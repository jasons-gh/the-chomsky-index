the first struggle today is going to be
the struggle against the heat of those
television lights in fact I'll start
believing in the miracles of Japanese
technology when they figure out a way to
televise without roasting the person
who's standing up in front the the
announce topic was the New World Order
Central America in the Middle East which
touches quite a few bases and the title
like that leaves essentially two options
one option is to speak in general terms
about the New World Order which as far
as I'm aware as the old world order
adapted to changing contingencies as
happens all the time the most important
of these changing contingencies have
having been about twenty years ago when
the post-war international economic
system essentially was torn apart and
has been reconstructed a second option
would be to pick some crucial issues
some particular topics and to use them
to illustrate the way the the general
contours of the New World Order and that
means the old world order and it
thinking about it seemed to me that the
second attack might be more informative
and in fact almost any current issue
could be used because they all
illustrate the same essential features
of policy and given us power US policy
has an overriding and often
determinative influence and furthermore
they all illustrate the same aspects of
the ideological cover within which
policy is presented to us examples of
which you just heard from our
illustrious leader the two examples that
are listed in the announcement the
Central America in the Middle East are
perfectly natural ones both regions
Latin America and the Middle East are
covered by what has been the
long-standing central doctrine of US
policy the
a doctrine which says in effect that
certain regions of the world are us turf
no one else raises their head
no foreign entries certainly but
crucially no indigenous groups and if
they do their heads are cut off if they
get out of control as the doves like to
put it the Monitor document is of course
devised for the Western Hemisphere
in a period of unless ambitious days its
meaning for the Western Hemisphere was
recently clarified in the gates hearings
one may be the only interesting thing
that happened in the gates hearings as
far as I noticed was a memorandum that
was released in from December 1984 in
which gates was dressed from gates to
William Casey the head of the CIA on US
policy toward Nicaragua and it opened by
saying that we have to start talking
tough about Nicaragua would stop the
pretenses about preventing arms to El
Salvador and all of this other nonsense
which is so easily exposed and although
I should say the media continued to trot
it out when it was useful and let's talk
we have to start talking tough and then
he said we have to rid the hemisphere of
this regime by any means necessary and
he means that we can use up to bombing
and that and he pointed out correctly
that if we don't accept this commitment
to rid the hemisphere of anybody we
don't like we will have abandoned the
Monroe Doctrine which confers upon us
that right well it was interesting
actually the the day that that appeared
I happen to be talking somewhere in
Detroit and I suggested to the audience
that they keep their eyes open to see
what the reaction will be to these two
this memorandum predicting that there
would be an OLE reaction and in fact
that's true it never came up in Congress
the media didn't mention it it wasn't
considered one of the big issues and
that's exactly correct because
essentially everyone agrees across the
spectrum it's agreed that we have a
right to rid the hemisphere or
matter the world of anybody we don't
like by any means that we that we find
feasible and possible and that he is
quite right and saying that is the
meaning of the menorah doctrine well the
Monroe Doctrine was extended to various
in this particular sense meaning we have
a right to ridden any area of anyone we
don't like if it was extended to large
parts of the world after the Second
World War that's just a reflection of
the extraordinary power of the US at the
time and in particular it was extended
to the Middle East which was described
by the State Department right after the
Second World War as the most important
area in the world in the field of
foreign investment and as General
Eisenhower described it the
strategically most important area in the
world because of its enormous energy
reserves which have two crucial features
first of all whoever has influence and
control over them has a considerable
amount of leverage in world affairs and
secondly there's a huge flow of capital
that comes from the profits from oil
production and the cheapest and most
abundant areas and that has to flow back
to prop up the both the corporations and
the general economy of the United States
and the country that in internal
discussion is called our lieutenant
namely written at addition to this is
our lieutenant the fashionable word is
partner as Mike Mansfield put it in the
Kennedy years so we have to prop up the
economy of our lieutenant and of course
ourselves more crucially and control
over the energy resources and the
profits that flow from them is a major
factor in that that's in fact discussed
and in turn ohms Declassified secret op
planning documents but it's also very
evident in policy and we saw examples of
that a few months ago so in other words
Latin America and the Middle East are
the these are the obvious areas to
discuss if you want to consider the the
core of American u.s. foreign policy
interests they both areas reveal to
quite a lot about ourselves the reason
is because of our overwhelming influence
in Latin America for over a century in
the Middle East for half a century and
what we find there can tell us a good
deal about who we in fact are a topic
which should be of interest to any
honest person
well discussion of Latin America could
open for example with a Latin American
strategy development workshop in
Washington Pentagon just a year ago
which involve noted academic specialists
and others they concluded we mostly
quotes they concluded that current
relations with Mexico the Mexican
dictatorship that means it's a rather
brutal dictatorship with a democratic
cover current relations with the Mexican
dictatorship they said are
extraordinarily positive that means that
they're untroubled by such trivialities
as stolen elections death squads and
then torture
scandalous treatment of workers and
peasants ecological destruction in the
interests of private power and so on but
they said that everything is not rosy
there's some problems on the horizon and
the main the only problem they note is
quote a democracy opening in Mexico
could test the special relationship by
bringing into office a government more
interested in challenging the United
States on economic and nationalist
grounds so right now everything's fine
because it's just a brutal and murderous
dictatorship but if there's a democracy
opening we may have some problems
because a democracy opening might mean
that sec various popular interests might
be reflected and that would be harmful
to the u.s. concern which is of course
investment opportunities and the local
wealthy classes and so on well that hits
the nail on the head the primary concern
of the United States in the third
as in fact always has been the problem
of meaningful democracy which is in fact
the threat to power and privilege and
that has to be crushed has to be crushed
abroad and it has to be crushed at home
and without understanding that you
understand very little about domestic or
foreign affairs and or about an American
society and culture now of course the
methods for crushing democratic forces
abroad and at home are different abroad
you can do it pretty much in a way it's
done by totalitarian states you can use
violence in fact unrestricted violence
at home over centuries of popular
struggle the capacity of the state to
coerce and control has been limited so a
whole variety of other devices have been
needed but it's been well understood and
it's a major theme of intellectual
discourse if you like for centuries that
methods have to be found to control and
divert what used to be called the rascal
multitude and to keep them from
interfering in what is none of their
business
namely the management of public affairs
as walter Lippmann put it the elements
that rule have to be protected from
meddling and ignorant Outsiders that is
the mass of the population and if you
can't do it by force you do it by other
means well a few weeks after this report
on our extraordinary on the
extraordinarily positive relations with
the Mexican tyranny a leading journal in
Mexico published an article by a
recording on a conference in Mexico
conference on International traffic of
children minors the report quotes a
leading researcher at the National
University the autonomous university in
Mexico from the Institute for law
research who writes that every year
20,000 Mexican children are sent
illegally to the United States for the
use of for organ transplants or sexual
exploitation
or various experimental tests the
conference report also quotes a report
of the United Nations saying that over a
million but over a million children a
year suffer from slavery forced
participation in criminal acts
prostitution organ transplant sale to
rich countries well is any of this true
the answer that is nobody really knows
and more importantly nobody cares at
least nobody important cares it's not
the kind of thing we discuss around here
but it is the most whether it's true or
not it may be it may not be the interest
and interesting fact about our domains
is that this is very widely believed
there's lots and lots of reports like
this one from all through Latin America
and other parts of the third-world
domains of the United States largely of
the United States that report such
things and you can get similar reports
from the London anti-slavery society and
others and whether they're true or not
the fact that they're widely believed
alone is a reflection of the reality of
life in the areas where our influence
has been overwhelming
this became much worse during the Reagan
Bush years which was a period of an
enormous catastrophe of capitalism
throughout the entire world in the aside
from the state capitalist industrial
countries themselves which in various
ways were able to protect themselves
from it Latin America is a striking
example we might proceed with Latin
America by quoting I'll just pick
something that happened to arrive in the
mail yesterday a Latin American church
journal which has an article from
Uruguay by Uruguayan journalists called
the war waged on Latin American Street
kids his translation of it and he
describes the war I'll give some quotes
the war being waged against millions of
abandoned children throughout Latin
America
we're death squads run by the police and
financed by the business sector target
and exterminate Street kids who are
trying to survive as beggars thieves
prostitutes drug runners or cheap
factory workers some of the victims are
gunned down while they're sleeping
beneath below bridges on vacant lots and
in doorways others are kidnapped
tortured and killed in remote areas in
Brazil where US influence has been
decisive the takeover the elimin
overthrow of brazilian democracy was
described as the greatest victory for
freedom in the mid 20th century by the
administration when it took place with
no little US support the in Brazil the
bodies of young death squad victims are
found in zones outside the metropolitan
areas with their hands tied showing
signs of torture riddled with bullet
holes street girls are frequently forced
to work as prostitutes in one plate town
in the first six months of 1991 a
thousand so-called disposable children
were assassinated in Guatemala City
another place where we have succeeded in
imposing the kind of values we like the
majority of the 5,000 Street kids work
as prostitutes they're found in with
their ears cut off and their eyes gouged
out and so on in rio de janeiro and san
paulo reports indicate an average of 3
children under the age of 18 killed
daily by these death squads financed by
the business business communities almost
all murders have been attributed to
those death squads going on the
journalist points out that this is a
region where 183 million people live in
abject poverty so that death by violence
is only one of the threats for street
children regional statistics show that
every minute 28 children die from hunger
according to UNICEF 69 million children
survive by doing menial labor
robbing running drugs and prostitution
in Ecuador about a hundred thousand
children from age 4 up
work ten to twelve hour shifts in one
region in western run mostly us run
corporations Panama had some a system
for protection of minors but the minors
protective tribunal buildings were
bombed during the 1989 US invasion
rendering work there nearly impossible
following the invasion the number of
criminal gangs robbing stores in search
of food increased in Peru 50,000 of the
600,000 children born this year will not
survive their first year in one
resilient state on the Bolivian border
approximately a thousand children work
as slaves extracting ten another two
thousand adolescents work as prostitutes
according to Union sources children work
18 hours a day in water up to their
knees and are paid a daily ration of
bananas and boiled yucca reported
according to labor union reports going
on I won't go on reading it and the
journalist ends up saying that until
recently the image of the image of the
abandoned Latin American child was the
was of a ragged child sleeping in a
doorway
today the images of a body lacerated and
dumped in a city slum well we may feel
proud of our contributions to this
picture of capitalist democracy
triumphant in the New World Order and
that's what the New World Order is all
about an intensification of the horrors
of the Old World Order well instead of
continuing through the Latin American
horror chamber which is what it is I'll
turn to the second area the Middle East
and let me just to talk about there to
talk about some of their exploits in the
Gulf for example but instead let me talk
about the topic that's on the front
pages right now and has been for the
several last several weeks the what's
called the Middle East peace process and
in particular the conference in Madrid
this is not now I'm not going to be
giving continuing with Latin American
atrocity stories but
about diplomacy nice clean topic so it
won't be so bloody the but let's have a
look and see what we can learn about
ourselves from that well I'm sure we all
read the newspapers and you've noticed
that there is universal acclaim for the
diplomatic triumph of George Bush and
James Baker in Madrid so let me just
remind you of some of the boilerplate
our hero is a quote now our heroes
exploited the historic window of
opportunity opened by their victory in
the Gulf to breathe light into on the
stalled Middle East peace process
showing remarkable courage and vision
that happens to come from Anthony Lewis
who is one of the most critical of US
government commentators on US government
policies anywhere in the mainstream and
it sort of goes from there over to the
real accolades the United States can at
last try to bring about its traditional
goals of land for peace and territorial
compromise and autonomy for the
Palestinians in the context of a general
peace now that the rejectionists are in
disarray and the Russians are no longer
causing mischief and the bad guys
everywhere know that what we say goes as
the president put it last February
that's also true in Latin America where
what we say goes has been true for a
long time with consequences of the kind
that I've already indicated the news
columns turning from they report with
considerable law that the president is
dreaming great dreams of peace and
justice and of course marching forward
to implement them that's diplomatic
correspondent RW Apple and the New York
Times James Baker is praised for his
diplomatic skills and his tenacity and
putting together what The Times calls
the remarkable tableau in Madrid I
should to be accurate point out that not
everyone agrees that the US has really
shown itself to be an
honest broker there are people who claim
that Bush and Baker have gone too far in
allowing their pro-arab sympathies to
influence what they do but it's agreed
that we're that they're both well on
their way to a well deserved Nobel Peace
Prize well that's sort of standard but
more interesting than this kind of
rather standard sort of Stalinist style
rhetoric it's very reminiscent of the
days of the genius Stalin and so on for
those of you who remember that kind of
stuff but that's kind of standard but
more interesting than that is the fact
that similar perceptions though without
the solenoids rhetoric are pretty
widespread in substantial parts of
Europe and that's that's more
interesting and even in fact Europe has
to a large extent come to accept the
extension of the Monroe Doctrine to the
Middle East which is new and has also
come to accept to a certain extent the
framework of US propaganda that's also a
interesting and a noticeable shift I
think it's one worth study in itself I
think it has to do with the end of the
Cold War maybe a comment on that later
but even more interesting than that is
that the euphoria is reaching much
further even to towns and villages in
the West Bank and Gaza where
expectations are apparently running
quite high the lead journal of the
current issue of the journal of
Palestine studies the lead article in it
is by an advisor to the Palestinian
Giardini and Palestinian delegation at
Madrid well it's holiday who lords the
personal commitment of the President of
the United States I'm quoting in front
of Congress in the whole world to adjust
and comprehensive settlement and he's
also much impressed by the invigoration
of international institutions and the
new recognition that we can't go too far
with double standards in my view so
that's a pretty broad speck
in my view this is all total illusion
like to give some indication of why
let's just start with a brief comment on
the matter of our abandoned bit of
double standards by chance that issue of
the journal of Palestine studies happen
to arrive in my home in the same day
that the lead front-page story in the
newspapers read us accuses Libya in Pan
Am bombing that's 270 people killed and
the subheading read retaliation waits as
White House and the editorials issued
stern calls for just punishment
overflowing with self-righteousness the
news reports told us that this fiendish
act of wickedness had become the
horrific symbol of terrorism quoting the
New York Times
again it was not entirely uniform so the
New York Times ran an op-ed pointing out
that the evidence about Libya was pretty
sin and suggesting some government
duplicity in identifying Libya m'as
accused the government of letting
letting the Palestinians off the hook at
a sensitive moment in the peace
conference and also they charged that
Syria and Iran had been led off the hook
for similar reasons that the authors of
this article representing the dissidents
are Robert and Tamara government Robert
Kupperman is a leading proponent of
what's called low intensity conflict
author of manuals on how to implement it
efficiently manuals in which he defines
low intensity conflict here's the
definition it's the threat or use of
force to achieve political objectives
without the full scale commitment of
resources that's to be distinguished
from international terrorism which is
defined in US Army manuals as the use
the threat or use of force to attain
goals that are political religious or
ideological in nature in short
low-intensity conflict is international
terrorism as the advocates and
practitioners of it are kind enough to
inform us and they're not only in their
definitions but also in the practice so
we have a spectrum then ranging from
those who assume that the government
case against Libya was proven on the
obvious grounds that had been proclaimed
and then on the other extreme we had
skeptics who are leading proponents of
international terrorism and think that
the case hasn't quite yet been proven
and we should go after other favourite
enemies like Palestinians so the issue
is should we meet out Stern justice to
Libya alone or also to other official
enemies and should we use bombing or
maybe some other technique well that's
what's known as an independent press in
a free society now there were some
things that were not discussed least I
don't see him discussed for example one
thing not discussed was the worst air
tragedy
of the decade that was an air bombing of
an Air India plane in 1985 which killed
329 people as a book by Lesley and
Andrew Coburn called out of control
which discusses some of the background
for this apparently the two people who
bombed that were trained in a
paramilitary training camp in Alabama
this was supposedly a sting operation
that went out of control the fact that
the US had been involved in training the
people who bombed it was acknowledged a
couple of months later by the Attorney
General Edwin Meese in India who sort of
promised the Indians we'd be careful to
see that that doesn't happen again
but that was not a horrific symbol of
international terrorism and you don't
have huge squads of thousands of people
you know scouring the region to see what
sensors you can discover and so on and
so forth now that one agency mentioned
though it's the worst air tragedy of the
decade there was some mention of another
air tragedy the downing of an Iranian
commercial
jet with 290 people killed that's also
more than the most horrific symbol of
terrorism of the decade that was
described for example by the the Middle
East correspondent of The Boston Globe
Mary courteous as she put it the
accidental bounding of the Iranian
passenger plane by the USS Vincennes
which is in which was part of the naval
Armada that had been sent by George Bush
to help out his pal Saddam Hussein in
the iran-iraq war and in fact the
shooting down of this plane was a rather
decisive event in ending the war on us
turn on Iraqi meaning US terms no
question one might ask is how the news
columns this news columns remember how
can they be so so sure that it was an
accidental downing well of course
there's an easy answer to that the US
did it and therefore it follows that it
was an accidental downing just as US
international terrorism is laudable it's
low intensity conflict good thing not
terrorism however not everyone agrees
again there's a spectrum of opinion in
this case for example one of the people
who does not agree is u.s. Navy
commander David Carlson who was the
commander of the vessel right near by
the Vincennes who wrote an article in
the US Naval Institute proceedings in
which he describes some quoting it now
how he wondered aloud in disbelief as
they watched the Vincennes shoot down
what was perfectly obviously a
commercial airliner passenger jet taking
off in a commercial corridor and his
assumption is this this was out of a
need to prove the viability of its
high-tech missile system
well the commander of the Vincennes
didn't go completely unpunished
the president reacted he gave him
granted him the Legion of Merit Award
along with the officer in charge of
shooting down the commercial airliner
for exceptional I'm quoting from the
citation exceptionally meritorious
conduct and outstanding service and for
the calm and profession
atmosphere under his command in the Gulf
the shooting down of the airliner was
not mentioned in the citation although
that's the only known action of the
vents in the media kept a dutiful
silence about this at least at home in
more civilized parts of the world like
for example Malaysia third world
journals were quite open about reporting
the facts including the Legion of Merit
Award in reviews of u.s. international
terrorism which they don't understand
there's only low intensity conflict an
accidental Libya's response to these
charges was a call for world a hearing
by the world court or some other
international inquiry call that was
regarded as reasonable by the Arab
League but of course dismissed here
without any discussion as utter nonsense
that's what's known as invigoration of
international institutions just as what
I've just described is what's known as
the abandonment of the double standard
well for those who are willing to
consider fact what I've just mentioned
is like a crumb from a mountain of
evidence that illustrates what a
Salvadoran Jesuit Journal recently
described as the ominous halo of
hypocrisy covering us statements and
actions an ominous hail of hip hello of
hypocrisy that seconds and disgusts any
honest person who suffers through the
daily output of the commissar culture
that's a major element of the new world
order just as it was a major element of
the old world order well let's put that
aside and turn to the third feature that
the lead article in the journal
Palestine studies finds so encouraging
along with most other opinion the
personal commitment of the President to
adjust and comprehensive settlement and
let me know review at least what I think
is happening it seems to me three major
questions arise about what's going on
right now
one is why is it happening now why this
big diplomatic flurry right now - is
there a break with traditional American
policy and three what about the apparent
conflict between the United States and
Israel well let me let's start with
first why right now and in fact we might
turn back to page one of the Boston
Globe in that which has that lead story
about the u.s. charges against Libya
that's the lead story and by accident or
you know because they got a subversive
in the editorial board or something
there's an adjacent story right next to
it which discusses White House concerns
over polls that show that George Bush is
falling rapidly because of the problems
with the domestic economy well could
there be a correlation between those
facts actually there could be the story
of the past 10 years the major story of
the past 10 years is a huge assault
against the general public which
familiar with huge transfer of resources
from large part of the public large
majority the public in fact to wealthy
privileged sectors investors and so on
now when a state is involved in policies
of that kind it's necessary to divert
the public the ignorant and meddling
Outsiders somehow so they don't pay
attention to what's going on around them
and that's true whether it's at a
latarian state or a democratic state and
there aren't a lot of ways to do this
two of the ways are to inspire fear of
terrible enemies who are about to
destroy us and that's got to be
accompanied with awe for our amazing
leaders who rise just in time and save
us from destruction so that we can once
again be standing tall as Ronald Reagan
put it when he succeeded in overcoming
the threat to our existence from Grenada
if you can remember event for our back
in fact this is pretty much the story of
the last ten years every year or two
there's some fantastic threat to our
existence but then
with incredible heroism or a leader
somehow beats it down and that's a
natural concomitant of the social
policies that are be carrying being
carried out domestically you'd find that
in any state just as another natural
concomitant as various devices to set
sectors of the targeted populations the
most of the population set them against
each other so they hate each other and
so on instead of paying attention to
what's going on this is all pretty
standard well it's all particularly
important right now
for several reasons for one thing the
the social and economic catastrophe that
resulted from reagan-bush programs is
getting harder and harder to you know
kind of put to the side and where and
where people see it and that means that
efforts at diversion are needed and
rapid and increasing ones secondly there
it's also necessary to divert attention
away from these foreign policy triumphs
that have supposedly he you know shown
what great people we are and led to the
bush rhetoric in fact every one of them
has been a complete catastrophe from the
point of view of any human value at
least that's true Grenada and Panama and
most strikingly recently the Gulf it's
not too pretty to look at the Gulf after
our great triumph there and notice
couple hundred thousand Corpses logical
disaster Saddam Hussein firmly in power
thanks to the support given to him by
George Bush and Norman Schwarzkopf who
backed his crushing of the popular
rebellions the shirt Kurdish and Shiite
rebellions the impact for once I should
say gotta give the press credit the the
diplomatic chief diplomatic
correspondent of the New York Times it's
a technical term which means State
Department spokesman in the New York
Times Thomas Friedman had an accurate
description of what happened he said
that right after the you know George
Bush was out fishing in Norman
Schwarzkopf was you know adding himself
on the back or something at the time
when the when Saddam Hussein was sort of
authorized to
here are the rascal multitude the
explanation that was given by Friedman
expressing the State Department position
is that the United States was seeking to
restore what he called the best of all
worlds that it the best of all worlds
would be a takeover by some Iraqi
generals who would wield the iron fist
much as Saddam Hussein did in the period
up until his one mistake in life namely
when he stepped on us toes in August 2nd
1990 as iron as wield the iron fist I
said I'm Hussein had done much to the
satisfaction of the US ally Saudi Arabia
and Turkey and of course the boss in
Washington well that's essentially
correct it'd be a little embarrassing to
just restore Saddam Hussein after the
fuss but we need a clone we got to find
somebody exactly like him and surely we
don't want to allow anything as
dangerous as a democracy opening in the
Middle East any more than we want a
democracy opening in Latin America or
for that matter in the United States and
if the way to block it is by supporting
Saddam Hussein's iron fist well you know
in the interests of what's called
pragmatism that's what we have to do
pragmatism is a nice technical term that
meanings doing anything you feel like
for your own interests and therefore we
pursue pragmatism and that overcomes
even our high moral commitments to human
rights and so on and so forth well so
there is a need to divert attention but
still it leaves a kind of a bad taste I
mean maybe the smart guys understand
that this is the right thing to do but
the population having been aroused the
considerable hysteria over the need to
destroy the beast of Baghdad has a kind
of a tough time figuring out these
subtle points about why we're supporting
and while he's massacring everybody in
sight the so you got to overcome that
somehow there are also our regional
problems the Arab tyrannies that lined
up in the Gulf Crusade these are what
the British imperialists in their they
called
the Arab facade that manages the local
oil system and the interests of the
imperial powers the British view was
that we should veil absorption of the
colonies behind constitutional fictions
such as buffer state or sphere of
influence and so on but of course as
Lord Boyd George put it when
complimenting the British on blocking a
disarmament an international disarmament
agreement he said we have to reserve the
right to bomb the niggers that's the
sort of bottom line so we reserve the
right to bomb niggers but you got to
have this Arab facade out there that you
know you sort of pretend our countries
but they're actually managing the local
wealth for you and those guys have a
problem too they though tyrannies or any
tyranny to has to preserve a certain
degree of credibility with population
and if they are exposed as just agents
of the United States and restoring the
traditional Anglo American condominium
over the wealth of the you know that
lies under the ground in the Arab world
that won't be so good for them so they
need something and thirdly speak
continuing with the urgency of the peace
process so-called there is in fact the
window of opportunity that's not a joke
it is in fact correct which is largely
correct and saying that what we say goes
and in fact that means that what you see
in the Gulf is what we say because
that's what we want we have held all the
cards and now that what we say goes we
can ram through traditional US policies
which takes us to the second point what
our traditional US policies and is there
a break with them well the simple answer
to the question what are us
of course the way in which we're going
to you know get credit for this and the
Arab facade is going to get some
credibility is by dealing with the
festering Palestinian problem the main
the simple answer to what US traditional
policy is is very simple forward it has
been adamant and inflexible opposition
to the peace
for us is now before I continue I have
to make a side comment on political
discourse every term of political
discourse has two meanings it has a
dictionary meaning and it has what we
might call the PC meaning the
politically correct meaning that is the
meaning that's used to event advance
power ends and they're always different
so for example terrorism in the
dictionary meaning it is what the army
manual says the threat the use of use or
threat of force to advance political
ends but in the PC meaning of the word
international terrorism is the threat or
use of force to implement political ends
when it's carried out by others
not when it's carried out by the United
States or client states then it has
another name it's called retaliation or
defense of freedom or something like
that the same is true of the term
democracy there's a dictionary meaning
in which a state is democratic societies
democratic to the extent that the
population has some meaningful way of
participating and managing their own
affairs but then there's the pc meaning
in which democracy means the rule by
elements that appreciate the
transcendent needs of those who own
american society and therefore must
govern it i borrow one of the favorite
Maxim's of the founding fathers that's
the principle on which the country was
founded and the only those who
understand that are capable of
participating in democracy and the pc
since well the same is true with the
term peace process there's a dictionary
meaning in which the peace process means
something like efforts to advance peace
and then there's the pc meaning in which
the peace process refers to whatever the
US happens to be doing at the moment if
what the US happens to be doing at the
moment is undermining the peace process
and barring the peace process at every
turn that's the peace process actually
it's all quite simple once you
understand the rules the reason for
institutions like universities is to
teach you the
so don't forget to do your homework but
once you figure all this stuff out you
can play the game rather well well
breaking the rules and keeping to
English instead of PC language the
traditional US policy has been - has
been as I said rigid opposition to the
peace process rigid inflexible invariant
opposition to the peace process which is
why it never gets anywhere you can see
this very clearly if you look at the
more or less irrelevant factual record
the record is irrelevant because it's
not politically correct it teaches the
wrong lessons but let's look at it
anyway if you look at the for example
you could start with the UN General
Assembly the UN General Assembly has a
vote every they meet every winter and
they have a vote every year on advancing
the peace process I won't run through
the whole record but the last one was
December 1990 when the vote was 144 to 2
United States and Israel and that's the
way it is all the way back it's always
something like that you know into -
we're in is everybody who wasn't asleep
that day or something like that and - is
the United States in Israel
sometimes with varies a little in 1989 I
was 150 one two three four completely
unexplained reasons Dominica joined with
the United States and Israel maybe
somebody has some insight into that but
in effect it's the US and Israel
blocking the peace process at the
General Assembly well what about the
Security Council notice incidentally the
United States a very powerful country
that means when the US vote if there's a
vote at the General Assembly which is
let's say hundred and sixty to one and
so on and things like that happen pretty
commonly if the one is the United States
its veto that's what it means to be in a
position to be able to assert what we
say goes the what about the Security
Council well of course that's out
because they're the United States can
just flat veto everything as in fact
it's been doing since 1976 in 1976 first
major u.s. veto the the there was a
resolution which called for quoted
a settlement a peace settlement on the
pre-1967 borders arab-israeli settlement
that means the internationally
recognized borders with guarantees for
the sovereignty territorial integrity
and political dependence of all states
in the area and their right to live in
peace within secure and recognized
boundaries including Israel and a new
Palestinian state in the West Bank and
Gaza that was introduced to the Security
Council by Jordan Syria and Egypt it was
openly but it was backed by virtually
the whole world it was publicly but
backed by the PLO according to Israel
the current President of Israel time
Hertzog who was then UN ambassador it
was not only backed by the PLO but
actually prepared by the PLO another
example of their terrorist past it was
vetoed by the United States it is
therefore out of history try to find it
in records of the peace process or
documentary collections and so on in
short it's just not politically correct
there have been the same thing happened
in 1980 but in effect the Security
Council was ruled out as an agency for
advancing the peace process the United
States there have been a series of other
proposals rejected by the United States
and Israel as opposed to the many others
I won't run through the record now the
US a very powerful country so we can
block a proposal by just saying no
period Israel is less powerful and
therefore they have to be a little more
vigorous in their opposition so in the
case of the 1976 Security Council
resolution while the u.s. just vetoed it
Israel reacted differently they reacted
by bombing Lebanon killing about 50
people in a raid that was described
quite openly and in fact even reported
as having no not a reaction to anything
which was not exactly correct it was
actually retaliation against the United
Nations for considering this resolution
and in 1980 when Saudi Arabia announced
the so-called THAAD plan which again
sort of along the same lines most of
those plans are along the same lines
Israel reacted according to the Israeli
press by sending
phantoms which probably means
nuclear-armed phantoms over the
oilfields and the Hebrew press pointed
out that foreign intelligence agencies
are digging into their files to look up
their records on the capacity of Israel
to destroy the oil fields
meaning push too far with things we can
do well that's the way a smaller and
weaker country has to respond the u.s.
it's just simpler we just say no and
that means it's off the agenda and it's
out of history if you have a
well-disciplined
commissar class at least well this
problem continued through the 1980s
Yasser Arafat for example kept annoying
everybody by calling for negotiations
with Israel leading to mutual
recognition this required considerable
acrobatics in the doctrinal institutions
so for example take a typical case the
chief current chief diplomatic
correspondent the New York Times again
Thomas Friedman who was Jerusalem
correspondent then he had to do things
like say when if headlines in the
Israeli press said Arafat offers
negotiations Paris supposed to be the
dog says no there had to be an article
by Thomas Friedman a couple of days
later saying the Israeli peace movement
has never been more distraught there are
no Palestinians to talk to interview
with Shimon Peres saying if only there
were some Palestinians as beautiful as
we are we could settle all of this but
unfortunately they're all terrorists who
won't talk to us and that routine went
on year after year of the New York Times
even refused to publish nah I refuse to
publish the facts but even refused to
publish letters referring to the facts
and occasionally even went as far as
writing to correspondence explaining
that they were not going to allow
letters on it actually some of those are
around it was all done quite brilliantly
the result was to craft a version of
history which has no relation whatsoever
to the facts or actually has a relation
to the facts for the logicians in the
audience the relation of contradiction
but apart from that has no relation to
the fact
but does have striking utility for a
power and that was achieved in a manner
which would have been be much admired by
any totalitarian state now there are
reasons for this there are reasons why
the United States has been constantly
opposed to the peace process it has two
features that the United States will not
accept one is it calls for an
international conference and remember
the Monroe Doctrine has been extended to
the Middle East long ago it's too
important to allow anybody to interfere
that's us turf nobody's allowed in so no
international conference to every call
for all international efforts to advance
the peace process have at least a
rhetorical commitment whether anybody
believes it or not but they have some
rhetoric about self-determination for
the Palestinians and that's unacceptable
to the United States not because the US
has anything particular against the
Palestinians they basically don't exist
but because that would entail Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories
and it's been US policy that they should
essentially maintain continued control
over those territories so therefore for
those two reasons the US has always
blocked the peace process
now turning to Madrid you'll notice that
it overcomes these two defects it's
completely unilateral nobody else was
allowed in actually to be more precise
Gorbachev was invited in but that's
because he is the completely powerless
leader of a non-existent state and
therefore he could provide a certain
kind of propaganda cover and people
could talk about international
conference but anyone who had even you
know met the minimal condition of
existence would not be allowed in
secondly you'll notice again that there
were nothing for the Palestinians in
fact that's built into the very
structure of the conference they are
part of a joint palestinian jordanian
delegation which is the traditional US
policy that there is no independent
Palestinian nationalism hence no no
issue for them to talk about and the
outcome of both that meeting and any
aftermath will be determined by US
policy so going
to that what is US policy well here you
can find out actually there's the US
government has been kind enough to
inform us there's a public record
can't find it in media as far as I'm
aware but that's there you can pull out
the documents some of it is even in the
media occasionally the US position was
made very clear in fall of 1989 by James
Baker with what was then called the
Baker plan the Baker plan then had to do
with negotiations between Jordan Israel
and Egypt with some Palestinians who we
like allowed in but the end Baker
presented five points and the five
points were that you read him in the
State Department bulletins that one
point was directed the Palestinians had
said that any Palestinians who are
permitted in by their overseers the
United States and Israel will be
permitted to discuss one topic namely
implementation of the so-called Shamir
plan and in part in public statements at
the same time Baker made it clear and
explicit that as he put it the only plan
under consideration is the Shamir plan
there is no other initiative on the
table so we want to find out what US
policy is we turn to the Shamir plan
which is in fact the Shamir Paris plan
the coalition plan of the labor Likud
government two major parties in Israel
which had been put forth in May and was
now endorsed and the Shamir Paris plan
has actually Amir Peretz Baker plan has
three basic principles principle one
says there can be I'm putting it there
can be no additional Palestinian state
meaning there already is a Palestinian
state named Jordan and if Palestinians
and Jordanians and the rest of the world
don't agree that just shows they're kind
of you know anti-semites or ignorant
Arabs or something like that so there's
no issue of Palestinian
self-determination there already is a
Palestinian state that's Jordan and
there can't be an additional one point
number two says there can be no change
in the status of the occupied territory
of the occupied territories
meaning Gaza Strip and West Bank except
in accordance with the basic guidelines
of the government government of Israel
which bar any form of Palestinian
self-determination point number three
says no PLO meaning Palestinians can't
pick their own negotiation
representatives even to sign the
capitulation at point four the fourth
point that says there will be what are
called free elections run under Israeli
military control and looked at a
television set you know what that means
with most of the Palestinian national
leadership rotting away in prison camps
without charges those are free elections
so that's it that's the Shamir Paris
Baker plan nothing much has changed
there since sometimes it's called
autonomy that's the current term for it
in the Israeli press more honest than
here one of the leading and most
respected Israeli journalists Annie
Rubenstein right in the mainstream and
though particularly though recently just
a couple of weeks ago described autonomy
as the kind of autonomy that exists in a
prisoner of war camp where the prisoners
are autonomous I'm quoting it where the
prisoners are autonomous to cook their
own meals and run cultural events
furthermore he went on to say the
autonomy is exactly what the
Palestinians have now namely the right
to run their own services and there's a
reason for that he explained he's
pointed out that even the most extreme
expansionists greater Israel enthusiasts
don't call for literal annexation of the
territories because that would have a
problem associated with it it would mean
you would have to extend to the
territories Israeli law including the
minimal services that are provided for
the second-class citizens of Israel
itself the Arab citizens and he said
that probably bankrupt the Treasury and
he estimates would probably double the
income in the territories so it's much
more efficient just to have heavy
taxation but to provide nothing in
return
under autonomy namely the autonomy of a
prison camp well that's what is being
offered now exactly as it was offered at
Camp David that's why it's so praised in
the United States well looking back
there's a
street of this somebody stopped me if I
go on too long but I'll give a little
bit of history it's worth looking at US
policy has undergone some changes from
1967 to 1971 US policy called for it was
right in the mainstream it called for
implementation of what was then the
international consensus which meant a
political settlement on the internet pre
June 67 borders with the wording that I
just read that was actually drawn from
the resolutions of the time reiterated
in 1976 territorial guarantee is
insecurity and right to live in peace
and so on and so forth at that time
there was nothing for the Palestinians
okay they weren't part of it it was just
the settlement on those borders official
US policy said that there might be minor
territorial adjustments which would
furthermore be mutual minor and mutual
territorial adjustments just that fix
things up but that was the position in
February 1971 a problem arose president
Sadat of Egypt offered a peace treaty in
those terms virtually identical with the
terms of official US policy Israel
rejected it calling for looking for
bigger that was under the Dougs
incidentally the Labour Party looking
for broader territorial gains and the
United States had to decide whether to
pursue its own policy or to change that
policy now it was a kind of an internal
you're a kradic conflict Henry Kissinger
won out he was the National Security
Advisor and pursued his policy which was
what he called stalemate keep things the
way they are no peace treaty
Israel responded the Sadat's offer by
recognizing it as a genuine peace treaty
the US backed the rejection that's a big
split in change and US policy actually
coincidentally that happens to be the
month in which George Bush appeared on
the national scene as UN Ambassador
although he had nothing to do with the
policy any property anymore she does now
but the ever since then the US policy
has been flatly rejectionist and
separated from the rest of the world in
the manner that I described now from 71
the 73 was that was a period of for
those of you know this history of great
ilysm both in the US and Israel the
assumption was that Israel had
overwhelming military power you could
disregard the Arabs altogether as the
former chief of military intelligence in
Israel you Josefa harka be not Dov
incidentally as he put it at the time
war is not the Arabs game they don't
know which end of the gun the whole so
we can just keep the stalemate Kissinger
accepted that so there was no need to
respond to Sadat's offers or anything
now in October 1973 those illusions were
shattered turns out they did know which
end of the guns behold there was a kind
of a near thing policy had to shift
Kissinger who was incidentally no great
genius does understand things like
violence pretty good understanding of
that and he could see that the eric
egypt had it you know they so therefore
you had to pay attention to them and
therefore at US policy shifted and it
shifted in the perfectly natural way
since egypt could not simply be
dismissed as a basket case the thing to
do was to incorporate it into the u.s.
system that is to accept so that's
actually long-standing offers to turn
egypt into a US client state and to
remove it from the conflict there that's
the major Arab military force and if you
remove it from the conflict you've
essentially eliminated the only Arab
deterrent which means that Israel is
then free to continue to pursue the
major policies which u.s. supports and
pays for namely integrating the occupied
territories and attacking its northern
neighbor Lebanon well that is the Camp
David agreement the Kissinger shuttle
diplomacy was culminated in the Camp
David agreement which had exactly these
properties and I was quite obvious at
the time to anyone who was willing to
look at the facts without ideological
blinkers and it's incidentally conceded
in retrospect it's called ironic ironic
is another one of those technical terms
which refers to the predictable
consequences of intended us actions
which happen to conflict erratically
with the professed values
so that's what's called ironic and the
political science literature and so on
but and that's a term that applies very
broadly to almost everything all right
but the so that was ironic but as I say
it was obvious to any ten-year-old at
the time it's now conceded well that's
exactly what Israel did of course with
huge USA the Carter Administration
raised aid to the stratosphere so that
Israel could in fact continue to do this
with the Arab deterrent removed
well then comes the invasion of Lebanon
actually it was one in 78 another in
1982 its purpose was to destroy the
moderates in the PLO that was again
conceded that's widely conceded and
pointed out at the time I'm conceded
proclaimed in the Israeli literature
general Harkavy he pointed out that this
was a war for the West Bank
the problem was PLO moderation they kept
making these annoying demands for
negotiations leading the mutual
recognition and so on and that's no good
we wanted to go back to terrorism like
shooting down planes and that kind of
stuff then they're easy to deal with the
point was actually put rather well by
the editor of the New Republic martin
peretz in a speech in in an interview in
israel right on the eve of the night
right before the 1982 invasion he
advised Israel in quoting to administer
to the PLO in Lebanon a lasting military
defeat that will clarify to the
Palestinians in the West Bank that their
struggle for an independent state has
suffered a setback of many years then
the Palestinians will return be turned
into just another crushed nation like
the Kurds and the Afghans and their
problems which are beginning to be
boring will be forgotten well you know
it's possible that with regard to the
Afghans that if you go to some of the
more extreme Stalinist elements in the
Communist Party bureaucracy you could
hear similar comments on the Afghans
back in those days and I should say that
appearances comments on his attitude
toward the Kurds do rather accurately
capture US policy toward them as we've
just seen again well that's us Paula
that stays like that until the day
now there's a spectrum as always there
the Hawks and the doves so let's look
according to the Hawks the Palestinians
deserve nothing like other crushed
Nations and then there's the doves and
here a good example is Thomas Friedman
again on the occasion of his receipt of
the Pulitzer Prize for his reporting in
Israel he had several interviews and
Israeli press where he advised Israel to
run the occupied territories in the
manner in which they run south Lebanon
now that means under the control of a
terrorist mercenary army which with big
prison camps where you hold hundreds of
torture chambers actually we hold
hundreds of hostages to ensure that the
villages submit to the rule of the
terrorist mercenary force and you know
you bomb beyond the borders when you
feel like it and so on that's a proper
way to run the occupied territories
however remember that this is a dove
speaking so his position is you should
give the Palestinians something right
and what he actually said is if they
said if you if you give quoting if you
give off net a seat in the bus he may
limit his demands so you ought to give
off meat a seat in the bus well you know
again you could imagine some but maybe
there's something you know Nazi
somewhere who's advising the Syrians
that they should run what is now Israel
the way they run the Bekaa Valley and
Lebanon but they should give Jaime a
seat in the bus because then maybe a
limit as demands that would be the doves
or maybe somebody's advising South
Africa that you should give Sambo a seat
at the bus and maybe it'll shut up or
something well that's the does so again
there is a spectrum and we learn a
little more about ourselves by looking
at it well the the doves view view is
that the Palestinians should be given a
seat in the bus namely autonomy the
autonomy of a prison camp basically what
they have now but nothing more no
citizenship no independence the great
achievement of the Madrid conference and
the one that's called forth such
raptures in the American
is that the Palestinian representatives
permitted in by the United States have
partially agreed to this so the news cut
actually the Israeli Lobby is naturally
quite enthusiastic the New York Times a
day hasn't op-ed by the deputy director
of something called the Washington
Institute for Near East policy which is
an organization that journalists go to
when they don't want to express their
own opinions but they want their support
for Israeli policies expressed for them
by an objective outsider that's a
standard journalistic trick the
Washington Institute for Near East
policy has no other function as far as
I'm aware than to provide such statement
and it it's deputy director notes I'm
quoting and that gains were made in
Madrid the Palestinians reversed the
thirteen their 13-year rejection of
autonomy which was called for in the
Camp David Accords the Accord is
welcomed by Menachem Bagan because they
removed the Arab deterrent from the
conflict and offered Palestinians the
autonomy of a prisoner of war camp as
the mainstream Israeli press points out
well the news columns in the US are much
impressed by what they call putting the
New York Times the Palestinians
self-adjustment to the real world that
is the acceptance of a period of
autonomy under Israeli domination during
which Israel can establish the facts of
permanent domination with enormous
subsidies from US taxpayers the idea is
that now that akhmad has limited his
demands he's praised for what is called
the new pragmatism this willingness to
accept half a loaf under Israeli
domination instead of the all-or-nothing
demands that's referring to the demands
for self-determination in a Palestinian
state alongside Israel a totally absurd
idea supported only by the entire world
outside the United States and it's
Israeli client and therefore by
definition extremists rejectionist and
not pragmatic pragmatic means
self-adjustment to the real world which
is what we say goes if you do that then
the news columns are willing to welcome
you as pragmatic that
Clyde Haberman and the same is true of a
host of others I won't bother referring
to it
the in fact so much of it that I won't
know too late to talk about but it's
standard open the press at random and
you'll find similar praise for the new
pragmatism in until 1988 continuing the
history a little bit the u.s. was quite
satisfied with the status quo as was
Israel in 1988 the Intifada was
beginning to raise some costs costs for
Israel to control it costs for the US
which in fact was becoming something of
a laughingstock internationally because
of the increasingly desperate insistence
that the Palestinians were not repeating
magic words produced by George Shultz
for them to say it became a joke in fact
so the u.s. made the obvious decision to
pretend that the Palestinians
capitulated and impose upon them the US
position say okay they accept that our
position there's actually a name for
that and the diplomatic literature it's
called the trollop ploy referring to
trollop now this was done by the Kennedy
administration who you remember we're
big intellectuals they referred things
like novels and the references to a
trollop novel where the heroine
interprets a meaningless gesture by you
know the hero or whatever as an offer of
marriage so the trick is if you're
really stuck in a diplomatic corner what
you should do if you have enormous power
and control over the world information
system is pretend that the other guys
accepted your demands and then stick
them with it and count on the media and
the academic scholarship and so on to
say yeah they capitulated your demand
and in mid-december 1988 George Bush
George Shultz that was at the time went
through this comic act claimed that
Yasser Arafat had said the magic words
in fact he has any literate person could
see he was saying exactly what he'd been
saying for years it was just as far from
the US demands as ever and though
Palestinian spokesmen could ever accept
the actual u.s. demands but now they
were stuck with it because George Shultz
had said so and everybody repeated it so
that
into that story the US then moved to
what we're caught what was called a
dialogue with the Palestinians they were
offered a chance to opportunity to have
P and the Masters and a chamber where
they were told in the first meeting
transcripts were leaked and published in
Israel in the night and and and Egypt
not here though they were in English in
the Jerusalem posts or if I could read
them the transcripts of the first
meeting the u.s. polled Palestinian
representatives that they should
understand two things one there would be
no international conference so forget
about that and two they should call off
the Intifada or what the US described as
the riots which we regard as terrorism
against the State of Israel so in other
words go back to the previous status quo
and forget about any political
settlement and then we'll agree to talk
to you
well this was understood very well
within Israel I should say the Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin of the dovish
Labor Party had a meeting with peace now
leaders shortly after the opening of the
dialogue and he told them don't worry
about it it's quite okay we're in favor
of it
he said the dialogue is a low-level
dialogue which is completely meaningless
and which will provide us he said with a
year or more to crush the Intifada by
force and he assured them they will be
crushed
well that's what happened they were
crushed there's a limit to what flesh
and blood can endure violence works the
dialogue diverting attention as needed
as intended then came along the
diplomatic initiative to divert the
daned the bush vision Baker Paris Shamir
plan purpose of which was to divert any
attempt to implement the real peace
process that brings us right up till
today that's as far as I can see that's
what's happening at Madrid well just
last comment there is a you know there's
some thinking behind this there is a
strategic conception behind it it's one
which is more or less permanent you know
it's part of the old world order the new
world order you know the next 10 years
in the world order and so on
the strategic conception about the
Middle East is pretty simple the major
issue there is the energy reserves the
US has to control them nobody else is
allowed interfere u.s. turf too
important there's a method for
controlling them
the method is first of all to construct
an Arab facade family dictatorships
which sort of manage it for us very weak
so we have to worry about them you know
having any funny ideas they the Arab
facade has to be protected from the
population of the region that requires
regional enforcers that's the second
part preferably non Arab they have an
easier time killing Arabs
so that's Turkey Iran Israel Pakistan
provides kind of praetorian guard for
the Saudi elite and so on it's what Ben
Gurion used to call a periphery pact so
there's this regional enforcer system
and then in the background that the guys
with the real muscle the US and Britain
in case things get out of control that's
the system and that doesn't change very
much now anyone who contributes to this
system has some rights the Arab facade
obviously contributes they manage the
oil wealth for us the regional enforcers
contribute they have right we obviously
had rights in fact ultimately the only
ones who do and so too are British
lieutenant as sort as long as they
remain a lieutenant the what about the
Palestinians well they don't contribute
to this system they don't have wealth
they're not power in fact there are damn
nuisance they stir up Arab nationalism
you know that is these pressures for
these Democratic openings that are
always a problem so they have a negative
value in fact and since they have no
that contribute nothing to our
domination of the region it follows by
quite simple logic you know that they
have no human rights whatsoever
that's elementary principles of
statecraft human rights depend on your
contribution to the needs of power and
profit other other than that you know
irrelevant well they don't have any
rights in fact they probably have
negative rights as I mentioned they're
even a nuisance
and from that you can pretty well
predict US policy and in fact it works
pretty well
remember this stuff is not quantum
physics you don't have to have you know
it'd be a big thinker to understand it
big efforts are made in the academic
disciplines and elsewhere to make it
look difficult but in fact it's all
pretty straightforward and I think we my
knowledge is almost nothing in
International Affairs or any of this
stuff that again a literate teenager
couldn't figure out in a few minutes and
that's pretty much the way it works and
if you understand it you can see what's
going on and you can usually predict
pretty well what's going to happen all
you have to remember to translate
politically correct discourse back into
English so you can get out of those
problems but that's not too hard either
well that the the thinking with regard
to the Palestinians the position really
has not changed as far as I'm aware
since about 1948 at that time back in
1948 the Joint Chiefs of Staff already
recognized Israel they were impressed by
Israel's military victories and they
recognized it as a as the second most
powerful regional military force and a
possible potential base for u.s. power
that relationship then got established
in later years that there's no time to
discuss there was also discussion of the
Palestinians the Israeli Foreign records
show it the u.s. didn't talk about it
much and didn't care about them but the
foreign ministry in Israel Moshe show
rates foreign ministry this is
incidentally that it does pointed out
that in their internal records that the
Palestinians they said will be they will
be crushed they will be dispersed like
human waste and join the most
impoverished masses in the Arab world so
there's nothing no worry about them as
martin peretz put it there just another
crushed nation like the kurds
and therefore there's nothing much to we
don't do pay much attention to them
that's been the policy ever since and as
i just mentioned that was its back
ravines statement to the peace now
leaders in february 1989 reassured them
that they will be broken well will they
be broken actually the answer doesn't
lie in the Middle East
that lies in the hands of those who are
funding the operation there is certainly
no hope in the president any faith and
the president's noble intentions or
other illusions rather it's necessary to
do some other things first one is to
clear away the mountains of rubble that
conceal the events of history not only
in this case but in almost every other
one to view what's happening without any
illusions and to create public pressures
that can put an end to the extreme
rejectionist policies that the United
States has been pursuing virtually alone
in the world
if we're honest we will also be able to
see that this is true in Central America
and indeed throughout the subject
domains generally what is
euphemistically called the South the
president is right to a degree when he
says what that what we say goes what
remains to be determined is what we
choose to be
[Applause]
surprise allegations and about the
articles that came out in Newsweek and
the New Republic yeah describe news do I
have any comments about the October
Surprise allegations not particularly
Ted the honest truth haven't really
followed it much and the reason I
haven't followed at much as I just don't
think it's all that important tell you
the truth I mean I wouldn't regard it as
particularly surprising if the Reagan
Bush administration had tried to figure
out a way to make a deal with the
ayatollah khomeini to hold off on the
hostages until they until after the
election however i think that how many
would have done it whether they made any
effort or not I think that Reagan and
Khomeini you know the Reagan I Reagan
didn't exist but the people around
Reagan and how meny probably recognized
each other as the kind of folk who can
do business with each other you know you
know they're that kind of guys we like
they didn't particularly like Carter who
wasn't all that different but had these
annoying characteristics of coming out
with sermons about human rights and so
on which didn't have a lot of effect in
policy but kind of we're irritating the
Reagan Bush people were just straight
you know - straight thugs they get along
with each other just fine and it would
have made a lot of sense for the earing
for Iran to deal with them rather than
Carter so whether the allegations are
true or not I don't think they would
have had a lot of effect on anything
that happened as to their possible
connection to the North nor do I find it
in the least surprising that people
should try to steal elections I mean
that's just standard everybody tries to
do that the so I don't understand what
maybe I'm missing something but I don't
understand what the importance of the
issue is if it's supposed to have
something to do with the Iran with the
sale of u.s. arms to Iran via Israel
that's almost certainly false because
there's a real logical problem there
that you have to deal with quite apart
from what the facts may be so suppose we
grant the whole story
suppose we grant that you know
William Casey or somebody made a deal
with the ayatollah to hold back on the
hostages and in return the US was going
to send arms to iran so let's say we
believe that for the sake of argument
okay
ayatollah khomeini holds up his end of
the bargain the hostages are held Reagan
comes in now then we ask the following
question why does the u.s. send arms to
Iran I mean that was what it was
supposed to explain but it doesn't
explain it we still have to ask why did
the US send arms to Iran was it because
they made a promise you know they're so
honorable that if they made a promise to
the ayatollah khomeini they got to live
up to it well we can put that one aside
is it they're afraid that the Ayatollah
Khomeini is going to go to the New York
Times and say hey these guys made a
promise and they didn't live up to it
well you know you can forget about that
one in fact there's no reason why they
should have lived up to it but it's true
that they did send arms to Iran via
Israel and this can't be the reason and
just to close the story off we know the
reason the reason was explained very
clearly ten years ago by in the public
record in fact I actually looked about
it it came out of it ten years ago that
quote you know a lot of stuff about it
from the public record there were no
hostages around that had nothing to do
with hostages and the story was
explained by the top Israeli officials
who were involved or Eva Braun II who
was the essential amount of the
ambassador to Iran David Kim key who was
the deputy director of Mossad in fact
all the guys who later surfaced in the
Iran and they were in the iran-contra
story which was mostly a cover-up and
they explained the reason straight out
and they were perfectly coherent and
standard and in fact normal they said
that where they're sending armed us is
sending arms to Iran via Israel in order
to try to overthrow the regime the US
didn't particularly like the regime it
wanted to restore it nor did Israel they
wanted to restore something like the
Shah we need an iron fist in the kind of
hands we can trust like generals and
there's a standard way to overthrow a
civilian regime that you don't like and
that is to send arms to the military I
mean after all who's going to overthrow
the regime you know I mean not civil
rights worker
you know the people who will overthrow
the regime or the military so you
establish contacts with them and one way
to establish contacts is sending arms
and another way is military training and
so on that's in fact the purpose of a
lot of the military missions throughout
the world to keep a grip on civilian
regime so if they get at it in trouble
you know they don't like think that
democracy openings or that sort of thing
we can control them and it's done
standardly almost reflexively and it
often works so for example when the u.s.
overthrew the democratic government in
Chile throughout that whole period where
they trying to overthrow the government
they were arming the military when the
US was trying to overthrow the
Indonesian government back in the early
60s it was sending arms to the military
and as McNamara later testified that to
Congress he said that paid dividends the
army actually overthrew the regime and
incidentally he slaughtered about half a
million people so ever I was happy about
it but that standard and it's appears
that that's exactly what was going on in
the early 80s it certainly didn't have
anything to do with hostages because
there weren't any so it doesn't seem to
me that the October Surprise would tell
you anything even if it were true this
is one of the reasons I honestly tell
you honest truth hadn't really pursued
it and have no opinion about whether the
facts are right or wrong this is a
two-part question really one part is
that ever since the Second World War
we've basically been told that the
reason for our large defense
expenditures were to counteract the
Soviet threat now that the Soviet Union
is completely pitch elated is going to
bankrupt our defense spending has gone
down by infant estimable amounts and
that seems to me to lead to the question
what was the real purpose of the
military buildup since it doesn't seem
to diminish when the threat goes away
and thereby what what are the current
reason is for our largest managers and
what can we expect in the future
tied to that is that now there's a
growing awareness on a lot of people's
part about
environment I mean the fact that going
off the end of the scale in terms of
influence into the atmosphere and into
neva aerated water and there's a lot of
concern on many people's part because of
that and yet the government resources
they're our focus in terms of taking
care of problems or tackle that requires
a radical response because we are in a
radically new situation in terms are we
going to the environment in the last ten
years for instance we bankrupted our own
government by having our large defense
expenditures - during the Reagan years
which was doubled or tripled the
national debt and ends up costing us
some interest payments 200 billion
dollars a year at this point what
happens with that with our military
spending is we're spending half our
government budget part of it for the
interest payments for the past military
buildup part and so the focus in the
world that was afterwards what about the
Pentagon budget and it's perfectly true
that people were told for years that it
was defend ourselves against the
Russians but that was about as plausible
as the fact that you know we have to
defend ourselves from you know Hispanic
narco terrorists or something else of
course that was never the reason then it
was always perfectly obvious that that
was never the reason and the internal
record makes it entirely clear that it
was the never the reason and that's
exactly why it continues now exactly
pretty much the way it did before the
reasons for the military budget were
real and they were significant and we
might as well understand them that's why
they're going to go on one reason for
the military budget is its domestic
every there isn't any such thing as a
capitalist society and in fact it
couldn't survive for a week every
society has a powerful state which
carries out programs typically for the
benefits of those who own the society
and we do - and our state has to funnel
resources to the advanced sectors of
Industry public resources so the public
people like you have to pay the costs of
research and development for high-tech
industry and you have to provide a
fate guaranteed market for excess
production so that advanced sectors of
industry can remain competitive this
means like computers and Blazers and
everything else and for all kinds of
reasons which we could go into the make
the main mechanism for that in the
United States has been the Pentagon
system so that you know you look at the
history of the development of computers
well its way it works and so that and
that remains constant you know it
doesn't change by now that's sort of
institutionally embedded secondly the
Pentagon system does have a role its
role is to do what it's always done
namely intervention in the third world
some somebody has to make sure that
those people don't raise their heads you
know that they fulfill their service
function the function of providing
resources and raw materials and cheap
labor and opportunities for investment
and export of pollution and so on and so
forth and if they have funny ideas about
democracy openings and that kind of
thing somebody has to make sure that you
knock those ideas out of their head and
that requires intervention forces and
international terrorism called
low-intensity conflict there's some
other things and economic warfare and
various other things well why do we need
things like nuclear weapons well the
fact is that you know Texas yeah the
u.s. is a global power that means we're
often carrying out intervention in areas
where we don't have a conventional force
advantage and you have to make sure you
intimidate everybody properly so nobody
gets in our way you know so you have to
a very intimidating military posture as
long as the Russians were there was the
Russians played a role in this the
Russians were a deterrent that's what is
a technical term for that too it's
called fighting with one hand behind
their backs like the Vietnam War was
supposed to be you know we made this
mistake of fighting it with one hand
behind our backs meaning there was
always a fear that if you went too far
you might run into the Russians and
they've got missiles and nuclear weapons
and all that kind of stuff
a mother principle of statecraft if any
of you are going into government is that
you never attack anybody who might be
able to shoot back
you only attack completely defenseless
people and you want to make sure that
you don't run into trouble so if there
is some powerful military force around
you have to fight with one hand behind
your back that's kind of bad and we
needed this and it is completely
explicit incidentally even in the open
like record they go back to nineteen
nineteen eighty and you look at Carter's
Secretary of Defense Harold Brown or
Eugene Rostow of the Reagan
administration the same time they both
pointed out that our strategic nuclear
forces provide an umbrella within which
under which our conventional forces can
be used as meaningful instruments of
political control you know translating a
simple English if we can intimidate
people with a big threatening military
posture we can use our conventional
forces to do the usual thing
intervention and subversion and so on
and that still remains in fact the
problem that you mentioned although that
the problem of the disappearance of the
Russians leads to rhetorical changes in
this and even some technical changes
like weapons systems change a bit but
the problem was in fact dealt with in
the public record again every year in a
spring the White House delivers the
Congress something called I think it's
called the National strategic survey or
some such thing in which the White House
presents to Congress in a glossy booklet
in simple language that they understand
that the reasons why we need a much but
you know a huge military force because
we're threatened by enemies even greater
than before so therefore we need x y&z
the bottom line is always the same and
for a long time the argument was more or
less the same you know the Russians etc
after the fall of the Berlin Wall in
November 1989 when you couldn't even
pretend anymore that the Russians are
around the first of these was produced
in March 1990 and it's public record you
can get it and you read it you notice
that the bottom line is the same you
know we need a huge military force and
we need to make sure that the industrial
base is for military expenditures is
still there so don't forget plenty of
money for the electronics industry and
so on and why do we need it well it's
not the Russians anymore you know you
can't conjure them up the reason was the
growing technological sophistication of
third world countries and in fact if
you'll notice we now need Star Wars for
that reason in fact we need Star Wars
because somebody's got to fund the
computer industry and produce lasers and
so on
but since the Russians aren't around we
now need Star Wars because of the
growing technological sophistication of
third world nations
and since the Russians aren't around
other rhetoric had the change and was
interesting to watch it the they said
they pointed out this is March 1990
you know while George Bush and Saddam
Hussein are still great buddies they
pointed out that the main problem is
going to be the Middle East where we
have to have extensive intervention
forces that will be able to move in
there in case you know anybody does
funny things let's monitor a doctor and
remember and they pointed out that main
target of intervention forces will be
the Middle East and then comes the
following phrase where the threats to US
interest could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door okay so now that the
Russians are gone you can concede what
was always obvious the Russians had
nothing to do with it it was always
indigenous threats just as it is
everywhere in the world people have
these nationalist tendencies or they try
for democratic openings or you know
priests organized Bible study groups
that begin to lead the peasant
associations all kind of rotten stuff
goes on and you need intervention forces
to stop that and now that we can we have
to you know the Russians aren't around
we can concede that the threats to our
interests were not at the Kremlin's door
but we still need exactly what we needed
before and in fact if you take a look
it's take a look at what's happened I
mean again like I said it's not very
deep it's pretty trivial the Berlin Wall
fell in 1982 sit November 1989 a months
later the United States invaded Panama
okay restored the 10% white minority you
know the money launderers the bankers
and those guys eliminated whatever
populist elements remained from the 3
host years took over control of the
military forces which were out of
control
eliminated any possible threat the u.s.
denomination of the canal killed a
couple hundred maybe a couple thousand
people you know nobody cares the it was
like a footnote to history you know it's
so in sand 'red that it doesn't even
barely deserves to be mentioned
in the historical record but there was
one innovation it was the first time in
70 years that you couldn't say you were
defending yourself against the Russians
because the Berlin Wall had just fallen
so if you remember we were defending
ourselves against the arch maniac
Noriega who was going to lead words of
Hispanic drug peddlers to destroy our
society and that game was played for a
couple of weeks until it was over and
then everybody forgot about it
in short it's interesting Bush is
constantly criticized by the media for
being kind of inarticulate you know he
can't formulate the reasons why we're
doing things as coherently as it was
done before and that's extremely unfair
way I could be fair to our leaders I
mean for 70 years there was a reflex
anytime you want to smash up somebody in
the third world he screamed Russians
okay so it was easy now you can't do
that anymore so we're back to the days
when Woodrow Wilson was sending the
Marines to Hispaniola into Mexico in
1916 and there weren't any Russians
around so we were defending ourselves
against the Huns or the British you know
all the way back to the merciless Indian
savages of the Declaration of
Independence
we're always defending ourselves from
somebody you know but the fact of the
matter is we're always just securing our
own interest you know extending and
that's what you need a Pentagon system
for as well as the domestic reasons try
to figure out some other way to keep my
institution functioning MIT or more
significantly IBM you know yeah two
quick questions one is you spoke of the
fact that this recent peace conference
or whatever foreign policy exploits that
the u.s. gets involved in is a diversion
or a smokescreen for the let's say
economic woes that are facing this
country in part but there also are real
reasons like ramming through the
traditional rejectionist program shown
insignificant but in light of that how
will the u.s. be able to justify the
continued aid to Israel and the fact
that the issue of ten billion dollar
loan guarantees are coming up for
discussion come January 1992 and second
of all irrespective of who is
responsible for the tragic downing of
the Pan Am 103 flight Libya was the
scapegoat for that
or is deemed as the perpetrator of that
act who is the scapegoat for the fact
that Israel most recently reaffirmed
economic social and scientific ties with
South Africa and was not reprimanded for
that you know it was glossed over by the
media and never to be heard again
there's not have to be a scapegoat for
that because the u.s. is in favor of it
and the meteor in favor of it so you
don't need a scapegoat as to the ten
billion dollar loan guarantee all right
I never really did yet to the third of
the three points I was going to talk
about that reminds me the third was the
conflict between the US and Israel which
is mostly about the modalities of
rejection ISM it's a trivial one on the
loan guarantee the the way in which
it'll be I mean you don't have to ask me
read the newspapers they're telling you
how it's going to be done the government
and the press are telling you the
justification for the 10 billion for the
10 million dollar loan guarantee what
you justification is humanitarian it's a
great humanitarian Enterprise and
obviously we're being humanitarians so
will therefore give Israel the loan
guarantees of course will condition it
on the that will require that they not
use it for settling Russian immigrants
in the West Bank which means we're
telling them use another dollar not the
one we're giving you for settling
Russian immigrants in the West Bank and
everybody will be happy with that
there's no debate in the United States
as to whether it is a humanitarian
effort again if you go to the Israeli
press they point out openly you know
there's nothing humanitarian about this
there what's what's in fact happening if
it is true that Soviet Jews face a
legitimate fear of persecution let's say
that's true then they qualify for entry
into the United States under US
immigration laws of course the u.s.
won't let them in because Israel doesn't
want us to and we don't want them to
either we want them to be forced to go
to Israel this is quite open inside
Israel so for example the Minister of
Immigration Michel kleiner has an
article in the just couple weeks ago and
these Hebrew press in Israel in which he
he says he's going to Germany because
they got a big problem in Germany now
the Germans are letting Russian Jews in
and he's got to go there and stop them
from this you know anti-semitic action
and he describes how he's going to do it
he's going to tell them here's roughly
almost literal translation he's going to
tell the Germans that they've already
fulfilled their quota with regard to
discrimination concerning Jews in this
century and they should start treating
Jews just like other people at last now
they don't let anybody else in so
therefore they shouldn't allow the
Russian Jews in so in short because of
the Holocaust you know the Germans
should stop discriminating with regard
to Jews and not let Soviet Jews in so
they'll be forced to go to Israel well
there's nothing humanitarian about that
I mean maybe you decide to do it or you
decide not to do it but it's a
humanitarian issue is zero there's no
humanitarian reason for forcing Russian
Jews to go to Israel and if you're
thinking about problems of refugees
there are plenty of them so for example
right across the river there's hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees who
are being driven out of quate with the
authorization of President Bush who
makes you know various apologetics for
it which are featured in the Kuwaiti
press therapy they're not leaving
because they're under fear of
persecution they're being tortured and
driven out and so on they're going into
a very impoverished country no not
getting any aid so you know right next
door there's a much bigger humanitarian
problem and one can think of a number of
others without too much imagination so
the the pretense the pretext that will
be used is humanitarian and there won't
be any debate about that because it
serves US interest it serves US
interests of trying to extend Israeli
control over the territories that's the
standard interest served by this so
therefore we force Russian Jews to
Israel and the American taxpayer pays
for that's the way that we present it
I'm sorry he presented that way but
that's what it amounts to
I'd like to come back to Latin America
and the US support of democracy down in
December of last year than much touted
democratic elections were held in Haiti
and the u.s. got a kick in the teeth a
few weeks before with our estates
appearance on the scene and also since
December 19 when he was elected there's
been a big change in the tone of the
reporting in the US press about our
Steve between then and the coup on 30th
of September what I'd like to ask is do
you have any comments on the events up
till now in Haiti and what you see in US
policy in the future there in the
immediate future and how important do
you consider the US public stance on
democracy that has been such a big deal
generally and specifically in Haiti
recently versus US interests down well
it's no there's no question that the US
was not happy with aresty and would have
much rather seen a standard
representative of business interest
however the u.s. accepted the rst
government and in fact was even you know
I'm more or less favorable to it now I
think the reasons are basically - first
of all Haiti is considered so hopeless
you know that it's assumed that you know
we can get some guy in there who has who
supports poor and as you know interested
in liberation he's not gonna be able to
do anything anyway the constraints are
so narrow you know the economic
situation is so horrifying that the
limits on any choices he can make
probably won't make any difference so
therefore we can tolerate him
furthermore the US has just made a big
rhetorical story about supporting
democracy in the New World Order and all
that kind of stuff and it's a little you
know it's a propaganda is it possible
there's a lot you can do but some things
are tough it would be tough to you know
to oppose what's obviously a popularly
elected government to blatantly now
after the coup the u.s. kind of was
standoffish about it you
remember right after the military coup
that throughout our estate there came a
lot of reporting and talk about his
terrible human rights record and he's
not a real Democrat and all that kind of
stuff actually his human rights record
is stellar as compared with anything
before after anything the US support but
and the u.s. kind of reluctantly went
along with the OAS boycott and I suppose
the reasons are pretty much the same
there's no real gain I mean I'm sure
that the US would much prefer to have a
standard representative of the you know
the industrialists and the the guys who
are getting the good press and the press
you know yeah the ones who are called
the Democrats meaning the industrialists
and so on but it's not so simple to see
how to do that
and since Haiti is not really considered
very important because the options there
are so restricted I suspect the US will
continue to sort of stand back try to
manipulate things so that the business
classes and maybe the military restore
control maybe with iris-t to some kind
of figurehead and then we have to will
law ourselves again on Eric great
contributions to democracy that's what I
suspect would probably come out frankly
I think for the u.s. it's kind of a
minor issue there's big humanitarian
issues for example these thousands of
people fleeing the both people a couple
hundred of them died the other day who
knows how many hundreds or thousands are
dying but remember there's been going on
for 20 years and I'm sure you know the
there have been people fleeing from
Haiti and the Dominican Republic for
decades and they drown at sea or you
know if the Coast Guard picks them up
they send them back and and that's a
really human rights horror which has
been going on for a long time it's
hitting the newspapers now but it's not
really new it's increased because of the
who but sure but it's been going on for
a long time so you know back in the late
1970s or was already quite substantial
thousands and thousands of people both
from Haiti and the Dominican Republic so
you think from the point of view of the
u.s. rhetoric and democracy that it will
just eventually sort of fade into the
background they'll try to make everybody
forget about it I mean
Haiti isn't that important but yeah I
mean you've got to maintain the
rhetorical stance you know we've got to
maintain the rhetorical stance of being
in favor of democracy we got a problem
remember there's a problem with the
rascal multitude in the United States -
they have to be subjected to illusions
about the US commitment to freedom and
human rights and democracy and so on the
commissar culture has its own tasks and
you don't want to make those tasks too
hard you know like latent support for a
brutal military dictatorship that's why
for example when the u.s. supported
Saddam Hussein and putting down the
Kurds and the Shiites there was a little
bit of a propaganda problem as you
remember we had to bring in all this
business about stability and so on and
then quickly turn to another diplomatic
triumph I mean these are constant
problems and controlling populations and
since Haiti is kind of marginal you know
they probably figure they can tolerate
the appearance of democracy there I was
wondering since you're talking you're
talking about the New World Order if you
can make some comments and about the
United States attempts to isolate and
demonize North Korea considering what's
going on now in the papers because aside
from the Middle East peace talks what
has been in the papers recently is the
whole new Korean nuclear campaign as
well as officials coming up with
statements saying that you know
aggressive force must be used to contain
North Korea also that if there's a
strong was any indication they've been
greater force using in Korea and so if
you can make some comment about that
situation taking into consideration of
us warming helps yeah you recall when
after the Gulf War Colin Powell made
some statement about saying there's
still a couple of things that haven't
been resolved like Cuba and North Korea
on Libya and a few others which have to
be integrated into the I mean the u.s.
system is supposed to be a world system
that's always been the position certain
pieces of it are still not integrated
into it North Korea is one of them kind
of interesting column the other day in
The Wall Street Journal which maybe
noticed from South Korea
reporting that the South Koreans want US
forces to remain even after possible
unification with North Korea because
they're afraid of Japan no interesting
sidelight on this they have some history
on that issue you know but yeah I don't
really expect the United States to do
anything serious to go after North Korea
it's too it's too dangerous too far away
you know it's not the kind of thing you
can do a more likely target of us attack
in fact the most likely one is Cuba
Libya you can always just bomb at will
you know that's not a big problem you
bomb and whenever you want a punching
bag around Cuba will take a little more
work and it's the next most likely
target and you know that you can see the
mechanisms Cuba was has been under us
terrorist attack for 30 years the
Kennedy administration launched the
world's by far the world's largest
terrorist operation international
terrorist operation against Cuba right
after the Bay of Pigs and I went on for
a long time may still be going on we
usually learn about these things couple
years later they're under illegal
embargo and economic strangulation the
United States has intimidated Latin
America enough so they're not going to
break the embargo and the European
countries in Japan don't care that much
and I'm gonna get in the way of the
United States
so these they were able to survive for a
while by assistance from the East Bloc
but now that we have Gorbachev new
thinking as it's called
meaning subordination the US power that
wonderful thing they've stopped
giving them substance sustenance so now
you can continue the economic
strangulation assumption being that
that'll worsen the internal situation
enough so that there will be you know
protests and dissidents and that will
intensify the repression which is our a
severe enough and that'll cause an
internal breakdown and sooner or later
it'll get to the point where things have
gotten so bad that you can send the
Marines in with being pretty security
that nobody's going to shoot back and
you can call them liberation that's
probably the scenario and if you know
the economy really is in trouble that
might be accelerated so as to happen
before the next election
it's not inconceivable but that's what
I'd yes the next likely one is North
Korea I think it's going to be just
something to talk about for a while so
you think it's just a media campaign I
mean they want to integrate North Korea
into the US dominated system but I don't
think it's a big init policy initiative
for the US for one thing if North Korea
did get absorbed into the Western
dominated economic system Japan would be
the main beneficiary not the United
States okay because that's in the Japan
sphere of influence and the US has no
particular interest in strengthening
Japan actually you can see this going on
in Eastern Europe right now throughout
the decade the United States has been
kind of trying to retard
the opening up of the Soviet Union in
fact right now that's continuing the
u.s. is still to this day you know it's
trying to strengthen the central forces
in the Soviet Union against the
separatist tendencies of the Republic's
I mean just last August Bush called for
called finally Ukrainians not to move
towards independence you know and in
fact throughout the decade the US has
been opposed to trade with the Soviet
Union which would have led to more rapid
liberalisation and opening up and so on
the US would prefer to see some kind of
Iron Fist over there rather than opening
the region up and turning it back into
conventional third world and I think
that's not hard to understand simply ask
yourself who's going to be the
beneficiary of returning Eastern Europe
to its traditional quasi colonial status
which is what's happening well the
minute beneficiaries will be mostly
Germany and its surroundings and Japan
if they decide to get in on the act
those are the cap first of all they're
nearby that's where the traditional
trade patterns are they have excess
capital to invest which the US doesn't
have so the u.s. is kind of likely to be
left out in the cold and that one as a
result there's no special interest in it
and I think probably the same is true
with regard to North Korea its might yes
many way we own time for five more
questions and please limit it to one
question each my question is about the
between government and the US government
my first question is there are a lot of
talks after the Gulf War about there are
a lot of talks in the Middle East
especially after the Gulf War especially
in Israel that Israel is no longer an
assets for US interests but another
liability and that's why they believe
that the so-called powerful iPAQ and
other Israeli interests in Washington
you see are no longer powerful Kremlin
door this is propaganda you know
academic and journalistic propaganda
you always have to present the the major
US interest has the me it's very clear
in the internal documentary record where
it makes it extremely explicit what
should be obvious even without a record
that the threat to US interests primary
threat is indigenous nationalism what's
called ultra nationalism and the
planning record things like democracy
openings nationalist regimes which are
responsive to pressures from the
population you know to take their own
resources or improvement of living
standards and so on that interferes with
the service role of the third world and
that's always been the fear with regard
to Israel I mentioned the not just 1948
start we go through the record it's
pretty clear 1948 the Joint Chiefs
already recognized Israel as part of the
regional control system didn't much do
with the Russians it had to do with
indigenous nationalism of course the
Russians you know they thought might
stir it up or support it and so on so
they play kind of an ancillary role but
if the Russians didn't exist it would be
the same by 1958 the National Security
Council already recognized that as they
put it a logical corollary to opposition
to Arab nationalism is support for
Israel as the most reliable pro-western
force in the region along with Turkey in
the 1960s Israel was regarded by US
intelligence as a barrier to NASA
right pressure Egyptian pressure against
Saudi Arabia now you know the Russians
could be on Mars for all this matter
there were there were nationalist
pressures in the Arab world they were
threatening the Arab facade which runs
the energy system for the benefits of
the United States and that out of he
stopped in Israel was a barrier to it
the in the 1970s was kind of open you
know like so the real the people who
really talk the truth you know weren't
just talking for propaganda purposes
like Senator Henry Jackson you know the
Senate's main expert on the Middle East
and oil he pointed out back in the early
70s that US policy toward the region was
based on a triangular relationship
between Israel Iran and then under the
Shah and Saudi Arabia there was all sort
of tacit alliances you know I didn't
have public alliances and the but the
idea was that Israel and Iran would as
he put it repress radical nationalist
forces in the Middle East that might
threaten the what I what the British
called the Arabs Assad you know the
tyrannies that run the oil States the
family dictatorships and that probably
remains the case I mean somebody
somebody's got to serve these interests
be a base for us power in the region
furthermore I might guess my strong
suspicion is that the Saudi Arabian
they'll eat and the Emirates like this
say I think they support Israel
I think they support Israeli power now
it's very hard to prove that because
these are real tyrannies you don't have
one piece of paper from them you know
that to find out what their policies are
like trying to find out what a
corporation is up to they're basically
like corporations completely fascist
they don't leave any paper trail they do
whatever they feel like internally and
so we don't have any documentary record
but from whatever secondary record there
is it looks to me as though there's
probably been a kind of an alliance
between say particularly the Saudi
Arabian elite the guys who run the thing
and Israel and they like Israeli power
as a barrier against nationalist
pressure just as it was a barrier
against Nasser right pressure so for
example personally I wasn't in the least
bit surprised
to notice that just to discover that
Saudi Arabia was funding his Israel's
operation of providing us arms to Iran
to restore the traditional you know that
part of the traditional alliance that
makes perfect sense
nor was it surprising to find Saudi
Arabia and Israel cooperating in the
us-run international terrorist network
directed against Central America and so
on in fact all of this is completely
natural the Arab facade is there
basically to serve US interests you know
I mean they got their own interests but
they got to do what the US tells them
they got to be protected they don't mind
Iran and Turkey and those guys as long
as they protect them there are
nationalist forces in the region it's
not a law of nature that says that the
wealth of the Arab world should be
funneled to the West particularly to the
United States in England in order to
enrich us and a couple of thousand rich
people there a lot of other people in
the Arab world are getting virtually
nothing from it that's not a law of
nature and therefore the local managers
have to be protected the Russians were a
problem insofar as they supported
nationalist group but these nationalists
are still around
Russians are not so I don't see any real
change showing up in the u.s. relation
to Israel other than propagandistic as
far as apex concerned it seems to me
there are powers what it always was
secondary you know I think it's a bad I
mean this is a impressionistic you know
if I give my impressions my impressions
are that it's a very serious
misunderstanding of American pluralism
to think that lobbies have very much
influence now as long as AIPAC is
lobbying for things that the executive
wants to do anyway
it'll be influential as long as it as
long as the lobby lines up with
significant power interests it can be
influential if it opposes those power
interests it'll go down at too quickly
now there's one exception to this and
that is business lobbies but remember
business lobbies are just reppin their
own representatives in the executive and
in Congress so that's a different issue
no I don't want to make this like you
know this is kind of broad brushstrokes
I mean it's not that the lobbies have no
influence the so-called Israeli Lobby
has a big influence
intimidating people I mean the main
thing they've achieved is not so much
lobbying the executive as intimidating
everybody else so people know that if
you open your mouth you're gonna get a
ton of mud thrown at you and this and
that and you know that makes people back
away particularly in public life and
that's had an effect it's doubtless had
an effect on portrayal of the whole
issue and suppressing and it you know
might have might that might be a
significant effect but if they were ever
to oppose a more or less unified US
policy they would disappear and I think
we just saw that so for example George
Bush there was a real US interest in
delaying that loan for a couple of
months there's no serious dispute over
you know they all basically agree but
the u.s. wanted that long
delayed and the current government of
Israel wanted it fast primarily to try
to block the Madrid conference they
don't like the Madrid conference and if
the US had given the loan guarantee and
September's probably would have blown
the Madrid conference out of the water
because you know the Arab states
couldn't I mean they would have just
have been happy to come but they
couldn't have done it because of
domestic problems and as a result the
u.s. won put that off for a couple of
months and then maybe everybody get
about it and then you go ahead with what
you're planning anyway but and it's
because that was a real interest yeah
small issue no this very small issue but
a real interest the Israeli Lobby simply
disappeared I mean one flick of George
Bush's eyebrow and they went home in
fact two flicks of his eyebrow could
have probably stirred up a wave of
anti-semitism throughout the country
which are really really frightened them
that's the I mean you know these
domestic lobbies I don't think one
should exaggerate their significance
that's not the way American democracy
works my opinion
okay could you comment on any perceived
connection between about a week and a
half ago when Libya was blamed for the
PanAm bombing all of a sudden shortly
thereafter the most of the Western
hostages in Lebanon who are supposedly
held by Iranian and Syrian controlled
people were mysteriously coincidentally
released and that is very interesting
yeah I would be I mean it might mean
something it might not I'd be cautious
about drawing conclusions from that I
suspect that these arrangements to
release the US hostages precede the
bombing of you know the thing I mean
look these these kind of you know this
sort of the cover men's and the ABE
Rosenthal's and so on could be correct
when they say that Iran and Syria are
being led off the hook because they have
some role to play in u.s. planning Libya
remember has been a punching bag for ten
years it's easy every time there's a
domestic problem you go bomb Libya
attack Libya or something like that and
that's easy they're completely
defenseless
you know Qaddafi nobody likes anyhow
nobody's going to defend them so they
want to bomb a bomb you know that's kind
of like automatic maybe Libya was
involved I mean maybe not nobody still
has any particular reason to believe
that they were involved in the disco
bombing in 1986 maybe they were but
there was certainly no evidence around
at the time that could convince a
rational person the German investigators
didn't believe it you know they thought
it was complete fraud and this was all
suppressed in the u.s. press but it was
published like I had article about it
right then based on an interview with
the top the head of the what amounts to
the German FBI who was actually
interview carried out biased US Stars
and Stripes reporter you know with the
head of this thing saying there's not a
particle of evidence that Libya had
anything to do with this there's a
couple of weeks after the bombing this
is mostly propaganda and noticed that
it's all you shouldn't be deluded by it
I mean there are if we were interested
in terrorism
we could do simple things like going
after say the people who who were
responsible for the worst air tragedy
the Air India flight or who were
responsible for the second worst one
namely the year an airliner that we
don't go very far to get those guys
we're not the extradite anyone right who
was walk over to the White House and so
if there was any concern with
international terrorism you had nowhere
to go but whether this has anything to
do with release of the hostages I we
don't know I mean like I don't know any
more than the White House is going to
have another war some sort of conflict
before the election because he needs
something but if the if they are facing
real domestic problems and you know the
meddling Outsiders are beginning to you
know make a fuss and people really start
paying attention deciding look we better
do something about this catastrophe
around us it'll be necessary to divert
them and there aren't many ways one way
is to set oppressed groups against one
another
actually they Thomas hearings were
perfect example of that
you take the two most oppressed groups
in the country and you set them at each
other's throats no perfect
you know the affirmative action thing is
exactly the same you don't have a
meaningful and unemployment program you
know a meaningful employment program
what you do is if you're clever what you
do is target particular sectors so that
other sectors equally deprived will hate
those guys you know instead of hitting
the guys who are picking up wall-e you
know we're making all the money and
establishing the policy so there's all
these techniques which is our standard
and will continue but the other major
ones are the ones I mentioned foreign
enemies who are going to overwhelm us or
at the magnificence of our leaders who
rise up at the last minute in the nick
of time to save us that standard and
they could resort to that my guess is it
would be Cuba though yeah I guess
some of us still need our fig leaves to
keep hope and in the Middle East and the
the Madrid talks the the fact that the
Palestinians went in it and agreed to it
some of us have been hoping that there
would be a momentum that would build up
so the
there would be some conclusion which be
other than what you've described what do
you think of it I think that's possible
only if there's enough internal pressure
in the United States to compel the state
to change its traditional policies
people who are going to have faith in
the in George Bush and James Baker are
simply contributing to oppression as
well as contributing to the destruction
of democracy here by fostering illusions
I mean like you I hope that something
decent will happen there but it's not
going to happen unless there's enough
domestic pressure so I mean any ruling
group has got to worry primarily about
its domestic enemy the main enemy of any
group that's in power anywhere is the
domestic population they got to be kept
under control if they become disruptive
or do things you got to react doesn't
matter who you are fascist state a
Democratic Society anything and if
there's that kind of pressure yeah US
policy could shift I mean it's not a
look it's not a crucial interest of the
United States that Palestinian rights be
denied it's a very marginal interest
kind of like Haitian democracy very
marginal interest as a result that could
shift but it will require pressures here
faith and you know the good will of our
leaders is just a way to make sure that
things continue the way they are Israeli
labor party there's no change I mean you
take a look at the report I mean the you
take a look at the New York Times report
and forget the headlines and read the
words and the Labour Party took its
traditional position traditional labor
party position has been complete
rejection ISM I mean I have time to run
through it but I was planning to in fact
have notes on it if you're interested
but the and there's a lot of
documentation on this in the Hebrew
literature a lot of interesting things
to say labour party position has always
been complete rejection ISM and remained
so the Labour Party and Likud differ on
the modalities so the Labour Party has
traditionally pursued what's been called
the alone plan the that's what's called
territorial compromise here territorial
compromises it farce everybody in Israel
knows that territorial compromises
the name for the plan which says Israel
takes what it wants in the occupied
territories but takes no responsibility
for the bulk of the population who were
administered by Jordan
now that's minimally different from the
Likud program which says we extend
sovereignty over the territories but we
grant the population autonomy which
means we don't take any responsibility
for them I mean the differences between
those plant those proposals are
minuscule and in fact many Israeli
doug's authentic dubs not in the waiver
party and Palestinian nationalists
actually regard the Likud programs as
more helpful to their interests and the
yeah but what does that mean they tell
you what that means
no no they tell you what it means sure
they can say anything they like as long
as they don't tell you what it means and
what it means is we'll take what we want
in the territories we will take the
water we will take the other resources
we'll take the nice suburbs around
Jerusalem which by now is a huge area
extending will into the West Bank and
remember is and we'll take the Jordan
Valley in fact we'll take everything
that we want but we won't take
responsibility for the population
because we don't want to pay for it we
don't want it we and that then comes
what's called the demographic problem
it's another term of art which means the
problem of too many non-jews and what is
by law not the state of its citizens but
the state of the Jews that's what it is
and you know the idea traditionally has
been if the second-class citizens by law
are sort of like 20% or less you can
kind of finesse it and the new york
times will still talk about the symbol
of human decency and all this kind of
stuff but if it gets to be 50% you know
it starts to look like a Rhodesia or
something then it gets to be a problem
so you have this demographic problem and
you also have the process play the
problem of providing you know extending
the normal services that any state any
state whatever it is provides to its own
citizens you got that problem which is
costly and then there are two ideas on
how not to do it one is the Likud idea
of autonomy and the other is the Labour
idea of territorial compromise they come
out about the same way they're not all
that different in certainly as far as
extending Giroux
slum men Israeli settlement in Jerusalem
including Russian Jews is concerned
remember there are two issues there one
problem is to keep a Jewish majority but
another non-trivial problem is to keep a
Zionist majority remember that a lot of
the Jews in Jerusalem are non Zionists
or anti-zionists the whole religious
group and that to go back to the Israeli
literature there's a phrase they breed
like rabbits which is used for two
groups Palestinians and Orthodox Jews
they all breed like rabbits and the big
problem is that the in effect a lot of
these or thought a lot of these Orthodox
Jews are not only non Zionists a lot of
them have called for Jordan to take
control so they can have religious
freedom again so you have to keep
expanding the population the Judah
Zionist Jewish population first to
overcome these two problems of those
guys who breed like rabbits and so
there's got a and this basically no
disagreement on this I mean you look
back at the settlement programs going
way back to you know 1967 September 1967
first Labour Party settlement program
was internally announced by Shimon Peres
incidentally internals since been
publicized and it called for expansion
around Jerusalem settlement around nob
Lewis settlement in the Jordan Valley
you know settlement and the Golan
Heights in fact pretty much what's
happened you know Likud does it a little
differently but there aren't major
differences and incidentally contrary to
a lot of the reporting here the Likud
policies in the territories have also
often been less harsh than the Labour
Party policies so when Menachem Bagan
came in in 1977 you know the hawk
torture stopped demolition of houses
stopped expulsion stuff got worse again
for a period when Ariel Sharon came in
but for the most but you know you and in
fact when Labour came back in in 1984 it
all started again I mean these are very
complicated things you know they're not
the way they're portrayed but the
fundamental point is there isn't much
difference no there is much difference
between the Labour form of rejection ISM
and the
we could inform the US has traditionally
favored the labor form to regard it as
kind of more rational so like also the
US doesn't see there's something about
the Likud policies that the US doesn't
like Likud labor tends to be much more
western-oriented that's why they have
people like Abba Eban
you know who talk with nice British
accents and that kind of thing they
could it's kind of like more Eastern
European or you know they're kind of
like evoke anti-semitic caricatures and
so on but and they could tends to do
things in a very brazen fashion and
defiant fashion so typically say when
James Baker shows up in Jerusalem
they'll pick that day you know to
defiantly establish a new settlement
somewhere to say you know thumb their
nose at them and the u.s. doesn't like
that it's kind of embarrassing what they
prefer is the Labour Party technique
which is not to do that but to wait till
the next day
and then not to establish a new
settlement but to do something called
thickening old settlements in exactly
the same place and then nobody notices
it but it sort of ends up the same way
the Labour Party as I say it's kind of
much more attuned to the norms of
Western hypocrisy then Likud is and for
that reason the United States always
tended to prefer labor yeah let's let's
go here yeah I almost lost track of all
the questions going to be I once had a
friend was just like yourself and
intellectually I do I once had a friend
was an intellectual he's a mentor of
mine but he's now dead his name is
Walter ogni and he would spend time like
yourself talking to people sorry I
didn't understand exactly could you say
again okay I'll go I'm not stretching
one side of friend time like you do
right now yeah talking to people like
myself and he was an intellectual like
you
his name is Walter Rodney he's a mentor
he's not a water run here and I
traveling the natural analysis but the
answer to the question the British
questioner because I feel for the people
are Haiti as I feel for the people of
man who became infamous after Jim Jones
and Johnston as you would understand
that's not the way you'd like your
country to be seen in the world so this
is my question what would you prescribe
and my new I'm not I'm like - I'd like
you to give answers and I'm willing to
listen what would you prescribe because
I'm sure that we have spoken today is
not just for intellectual consumption
but you've probably got something in
mind yeah yeah would you prescribe for
the domestic audience but myself was
living here at the moment
and what you call the the way the
Americans look at them the indigenous
nationalists who live in these poor
countries who suffer like the people in
Haiti yeah well what I I maybe I wasn't
clear but what I prescribe is extending
democracy in the United States that is
creating popular forces in the United
States which are able to become
significant enough to take control over
at least significantly influence policy
decisions well in a longer run to break
down the autocratic hierarchic
institutions which have controlled after
all at corporate run system and in that
way to allow the possibilities of you
know to allow people in the subject
domains a degree of openness and freedom
that they're not going to have as long
as the American population remains you
know spectators and Outsiders that's
what I recommend I mean not very
profound third world nation as far as
the third world is concerned well you
know the third world has extremely
narrow options open to it it's just very
oppressed and it's very hard and first
what's on life it's my place to
recommend things to them you know like
okay well look I'm I mean intellectual
doesn't mean anything you know I mean a
guy who drives a taxi cab is no less an
intellectual than a guy teachers in
university often more intellectual but
the point is we're talking about people
you know what should people do well you
know
somebody somebody in the who's sharing
ideas with us the moment right I meant
someone who's sharing find it I mean you
know at my advice I don't have much in
the way of advice to the third-world
countries for one thing they always the
depressed that I'm talking to the United
to people in the United States right I'm
talking to people in the United States
and what I think they ought to do if you
ask me what the Palestinians ought to do
or what the Haitians ought to do or what
the Nicaraguans ought to do frankly I
don't have a lot to suggest I think that
they have to decide what they're going
to do what I would like to do is to take
our boot off their neck okay then they
can decide what they want to do I mean
if somebody wants my advice you know
I'll like I'll tell them but I don't see
why they should pay any attention to it
and I think your opinions are worthwhile
okay you touch very briefly on the
propaganda side of all these events that
you were discussing today and I read
recently in the paper ABC is complaining
about losing a lot of money and they're
trying to force the FCC to do away with
regulations with the number of media
outlets that any corporation is able to
control presently it stays at 12 which
is up from three only a few years ago
and wondering what effect you think this
might have on the presentation of these
events in the media and the propaganda
assault on the people in this country
and I know that you contribute to Z
Magazine and they're trying to put
together the radio I'm wondering if you
think that can have any real effect and
you know if besides forums like this how
we can get the message out to more
people in this country to do just what
you said a moment ago is to make people
wake up and to remove the boot of
oppression of the United States
government on people around the world
well you know if there are any answers
to this question that aren't obvious
nobody's ever found them every social
time the only reason we're not living
under slavery or you know military
dictatorships or something is because
over the centuries there have been lots
of popular struggle which have extended
the domains of freedom and the only way
those things happen is by you know
education and organization and the
pamphlet literature and pressures and
hangover institutions and so on and so
forth and if there's any other way of
doing it nobody's ever found it so sure
I mean all of these ways are fine I
don't have anything to say I don't think
there is anything to say that isn't
obvious do you think that the increasing
concentration of corporate control of
media has you know how can we counter
that I mean I've written about it but
you want to know the truth they don't
really believe very much what I'm
writing I mean it's true that there is a
there is increased centralization of
like you know there's one newspaper in
town instead of two and there's three
channels instead of four and so on but I
don't think honestly speaking that
things would be very different if there
were 50 you know if there were 50
corporate controlled television channels
they would all do approximately the same
thing because they all respond to the
same interest I mean it might have a
marginal effect on opening up a few
things but not much in my view even
though as I say I've written about it
but but radio or things yeah I think you
radius is important but that's not a
corporate control channel say what I
mean is like instead of just GM and you
know you got also GE I don't think
that's gonna help a lot because they
basically have the same interests on the
other hand if you have say community
radio or you know independent what are
called alternative what do we call the
independent press especially if there's
organizational structure behind them you
know you got the Central American
Solidarity movement behind it or you
know you've got the feminist movement
behind it or something if there's some
popular force behind it then these
things mean something you know they help
people get together and think things out
and do things and so on and so forth
sure that's tremendously important in
fact that's one pressure against the
major ideological institutions is also
important I mean after all there are
people inside them who are trying to
press things to the limit and they can
do more if they have more outside
support I don't think it's a matter of
choice between one or another thing
they're all important
