well with regard to the media there's
essentially two topics one question is
institutional so what are they given
what they are once you have a look at
that you make some rather plausible love
draw some plausible conclusions about
when you'd expect a media product to be
like given their institutional nature
and then comes the real serious work
because the institutional nature is kind
of straightforward and obvious need
serious work is to try to see to what
extent the plausible conclusions from
the institutional nature are actually
verified or falsified in which case you
change your picture of what you think
their nature is and the on the media at
least anything I've been involved in
ninety-nine percent of the work is on
the second part and as far as my own
personal contribution to it is it's
about a hundred percent like in the book
that had Herman and I wrote
manufacturing consent there is a section
on the institutional structure but he
wrote that part I just sort of sign my
name to it the easy way to write a book
but so I'll say what and the reason is
not because I disagree or you know learn
anything special but because it seems me
kind of transparent so much so that it's
if we really had like some sort of free
country it's the kind of thing you learn
in elementary school you know not deep
no big problems of no conceptual
analysis or the kind that might keeps
telling us exists just straightforward
and asleep I hope straightforward common
sense awake I just wanted to see okay
every once in a while I'll sticking the
big
I'll hear about that by email later so
what are the media either they're the
major media I don't mean zeemagazine
they're either their state media which
in the United States is very marginal
other countries is more significant or
and that's an interesting story in
itself which perhaps you know or if you
don't you ought to know there was a big
battle back in the 1920s and 30s about
the public great about radio which way
it should go and the interesting story
there which Bob McChesney in particular
is written very well about so I go back
into that if you're interested anyhow
the United States is kind of off the
spectrum of the industrial countries
most of the world in fact and it's never
really had public media to the extent
that they've existed they've been
extremely marginal and that reflects
another fact about the United States
it's a by comparative standards a very
free and open society so you know more
about government activities in the
United States than any country I know of
too much easier to get archival
information and so on on the other hand
it's much more business run than any
other industrial society and that has
effects and that's always been true
going back to the revolution so it's
been a business run free society and
that has consequences for the media one
consequence is no public media except
really marginal another is that the
media are essentially big corporations
that's particularly true of the ones
that sort of set the framework within
which the others operate and there's
only a few of those there's only a few
media centers that provide the general
framework of things i learned how far
this goes some years back when some
friends at MIT was this is long before
internet access was working on a trying
to set up a company that would market
the AP reports Associated Press report
so he was running some experimental
program at MIT where he had the KPK pee
comes out on a ticker you know it's
pouring out all the time and he had a
way of feeding it into electronically
any time and he offered me a chance to
have it so for a couple of years I was
following the AP reports regularly was
quite interesting actually ap or the
other wire services are about as close
to raw news as you can get I'm the news
is coming from stringers all around the
world most of them non-professionals you
know hence a particular ax to grind I'm
just describing what's in front of their
eyes which plenty of reporters do very
well and you could see the filtering you
know as you go from the raw news to what
comes out on the front page and I used
to write about it I've stopped at a
North time but it's quite an interesting
transition if somebody wants to do a
research but now it's a lot easier to do
because it's all automated but if you
want to see the way it works it's quite
interesting anyhow the raw news comes
through it's picked up for the most part
by 3r just a small number of centers and
the others just do what they're told so
in fact it's so extreme that this is the
80s I probably still the same at around
four o'clock in the afternoon the this
flood of news would stop every day and
there would be a notice that said notice
to editors and it said the New York
Times tomorrow will have the following
stories on the front page lists the
stories x is going to have and what that
essentially tells an editor in no the
Midwest or someplace is that's
tomorrow's news so for the quarter of a
page that you devote to non local
affairs this is what your story is and
just take that and then they either get
it from the new york times news service
or the washington post a new service or
maybe a PE aur AAP has its own lead
story i'll see you pick up that one and
that's essentially what's done in most
of the country you're just occasionally
an editor will be more ambitious but
usually they'll just
pick up whatever passes through that
filter Sam's true of everything else Lex
a books a local library and say you know
Omaha or someplace the librarian doesn't
have the resources or or time or
anything to find out what books to buy
so what they do is read the New York
Times Book weekly book review and that
essentially tells the librarian here's
the books and again it's a filtering
service and they're very aware I'm sure
they're aware of it I mean they know
that they are deciding what happens all
over the country if they don't want a
book to be known then we'll review it if
or else if they want it if they know
it's going to be heard of and they want
to smash it smash it if they want to if
they want people to buy it and have it
around they'll assign it to a
sympathetic reviewer I mean that's the
way the thing works and the same is true
with news now sometimes you see kind of
striking consequences of this so for
under sometimes just amazing so it
almost makes you want to believe in that
conspiracy theories were always told we
shouldn't be believing in by me too so
for example during the Eid member back
around nineteen eighty-four I guess it
was the the there was a rebet kind of a
popular rebellion in the Philippines and
the Marcos regime was overthrown by
popular action and Cory Aquino got in it
was sort of a somewhat of a mild
democratic revolution the US was
supporting Marcos totally he was you
know the man George Bush had just gone
down there to tell him how much we love
Him and such a wonderful Democrat and so
on the US is giving full support to
Marcos who is a typical brutal murderous
gangster and robber and so on but there
came a point in the course of the the
demonstrations at which the army turned
against him and at that point it was
clear he couldn't hang on
and it was a particular day and was
every 20 seconds or whatever i was there
was kind of news coming through from the
philippines so i was watching it just to
see what would happen and right in the
middle of all of this you know you're
getting this constant flood of news
about what's happening on the streets a
notice came in again notice to editors
saying from this point on all Associated
Press stories will be about us support
for Aquino okay in other words the
government had switched sides it was now
against Marcos because he couldn't be
held on and the army had turned against
him so from there on all the stories
were about how the US is supporting
democratic revolution and any editor
understands that absolutely goes on
there sometimes and there are
interesting cases where it doesn't work
and those those are striking too so for
example take a more recent case and
should be september-october 1994 you
recall there had been this is about
Haiti there had been three years of
really brutal terror and Haiti I was
actually down there during the peak of
it and it was pretty bad which the US
was basically supporting I mean they
claimed they weren't but in fact the US
was supporting it and it came a point
when the US had decided to that it was
that it was enough you know people had
been smashed up enough and now they
could do what they called restoring
democracy so this big propaganda about
how u.s. is sending troops to restore
democracy and bring back the elected
leader and this enough to go through
that but what was in fact happening was
they had decided people had been smashed
up enough they could now bring back
President Irish deed but on the
condition that he follow the program of
the US candidate in the 1991 election
who had gotten fourteen percent of the
vote he had an ultra right-wing program
that the population had overwhelmingly
voted against and now they're going to
get it rammed down their throat
there are three years of terror with the
Marines coming in to restore democracy
that was the picture well again it was
clear that you knows like the day before
the troops were landing sighs again
watching the AP reports all day and they
kept pouring through restoring democracy
this is matt except for one thing there
was the lead story that day as i say
they commonly have a lead story which
they keep emphasizing so nobody misses a
story a shin pick up the lead story that
day was actually quite interesting the
lead story was a leaks from the Justice
Department which turned out to be
accurate were in fact conceded the lead
the leaks from the Justice Department
said that it had been discovered that
the Bush administration and the Clinton
administration had authorized illegal
shipments of oil from the Texaco
corporation to the military junta and
the wealthy leadership which means that
the embargo had been a total fraud I
mean it was sort of clear anyway but
here you had it direct information that
Clinton and Bush had simply authorized
the oil companies to keep sending oil
despite the presidential directive not
to Royals right the heart of any embargo
you don't stop oil and stuff anything
and you could see in Haiti that the rich
families were building royal farms so
oil was coming in you can just see it at
the same time the CIA was testifying
before Congress that all the oil had
been stopped and the embargo was really
working its own so here's a really
interesting story well the next day I
troops landed the whole thing happened
the mic we still awake was twisting my
arms for an article so I read an article
on Haiti and on the whole story and this
was the storm what I wrote would come
out in about six weeks so I kind of
wrote it in past tense and I no matter
how cynical you get you never are
cynical enough it turned out I assumed
that six weeks from now the story would
be known so I referred to it in past
tense no I'm described the rough details
without saying too much then what
happened was interesting the troops
landed on Monday
on tues there was nothing in the
newspapers the story was on Sunday so
every newspaper should had their
headline the next morning should be us
violates embargo whole story total fraud
you know restoring democracy no nothing
it was just supporting the military
junta and the terror and then moving in
when you figure they had enough in you
that's that's the AP story in effect
well not a word on Monday on Tuesday not
a word by then I had a friend who does
database searches mobilized for me dave
peterson my source for all of us
non-techies for getting database
searches done so he started checking the
media around the country on Tuesday
there was one report it was in a
petroleum professional petroleum
industry journal they reported on
Wednesday there was a small article in
The Wall Street Journal back pages which
had the story by then there were a
couple of stories appearing in places
like Akron Ohio or you know Las Vegas
just scattered around the country places
where editors were not sophisticated
enough to understand that although this
is the lead story from AP this is when
you suppress you know because it's too
inconsistent with the main story that
you're supposed to tell about
magnificent restoration of democracy you
know Clinton doctrine and action and so
on it never made it to the New York
Times of the Washington Post I mean I
stopped looking after a couple of months
but never made it a couple of weeks
later about six or seven weeks later the
Miami Herald which tends to cover
Caribbean and Latin American affairs
somewhat more heavily they had not a bad
story which included of their own which
doesn't really good Latin American
reporters there so they had a story
which included this buried in it
somewhere but it's out of history you
know like you know read it in history
books out of the reviews and so on and
that was the lead story on AP one you
can't miss you know like every news
station gets it right on top well you
know that's maybe unusual but this is
the kind of thing you see going on if
you actually monitor what
does if you just look at the output you
can reconstruct the same picture but
it's kind of more dramatic you see info
down it out good and they're kind of
aware of it so I remember once I was
I'll get back to the major media
remember you're supposed to be
interrupting me I can just ramble on
indefinitely the take a look at the
secondary media the non major media like
not the new york times in the Washington
Post and CBS News I was once invited
first than last time to give a talk at
the Midwest professional association of
journalists whatever they call
themselves there three or four around
the country and they want they were
having a panel on ethics and media so I
was asked by somebody to come talk and I
wrote back saying it I don't think you
want me to talk I don't think there any
ethical problems in the media except
telling the truth you know no other
effort but what they wanted me to talk
about is you know if you're a journalist
and you happen to be interviewing
someone and you notice a letter on the
desk and you read over the shoulder what
it is should you be able to report it
you know big things like that and and
they told me that in fact I said look I
have nothing to say about those topics
but I will I think I have a lot to say
about the question of how the media love
with me to tell the truth let me talk
about that i'll talk about it but it's
nothing else so they say oh sure we're
courageous journalists we want to hear
about all this stuff and they invited me
and i gave a talk which called most of
the people just you know this kind of
talk the the discussion afterwards is
kind of interesting i mean basically i
was saying look how come you guys don't
cover this that and the other thing
whatever the timing was picking the
issues of that time and a lot of margin
angry but some said were honest about it
they said look we're small-time people i
mean we can't do things that would
violate the principles that come from
outsiders who are really important like
if the New York Times and The Washington
Post aren't reporting this we just can't
do it I mean we may have the facts but
so we can't stand up against that kind
of authority it's just not done you know
I mean but they didn't say it but it's
kind of like the first grade kids saying
I can't fill the teacher you know what
she told me is a lot of nonsense you
can't do that so you just have to either
overlook it or something and just have
no choices they honestly and felt that
they weren't being dishonest or anything
they just there were those options
didn't exist and that kind of
disciplinary framework is a very
effectively that's as good as censorship
what happened was a Mercury News yeah
they stepped out of line and they got
smashed this is you're talking about the
dark very well Gary Webb story yeah well
Gary Webb did a piece of really good
investigative reporting on cocaine
Central American the relation between
the cocaine traffic from Central America
and the Contras and how its laid out in
Los Angeles I guess and he did need
dougie you know found local drug dealers
and tied him up with people involved
with the Contras until I mean you know
in a way it wasn't all that new you know
like the basic story was kind of known
to people who were following things but
he managed to put in fill in a lot of
details and tie it together in
interesting ways the San Jose Mercury
News which incidentally runs a lot of
stories that don't make it into the
mainstream they published a series on
this which was very well done and
nothing much happened for a couple of
days and then the big guys came in the
Washington Post and The Wall Street
Journal and everybody else and started
smashing the story and you know they
found the comma missing here and
somebody from the government denied
something else and the this is the way
it's done so and there was obvious about
plenty of internal of pressure on the
journal itself finally they pub the
journal the editors publicly withdrew
this kind of apologized for having
published the story he was sent off to
the Metro desk or some equivalent
punishment and the story was essentially
killed
and he finally he quit and finally
publishes a book i think it's called
dark victory was it called dark alliance
yeah dark alliance right which a good
book but i don't think that ever gotten
reviewed or discussed so that's kind of
buried and he's out of it this is the
kind of thing that does happen not you
know not a lot because things like his
story at home happen a lot but if
something does break out of line that's
what happens and i presume that without
even being aware of it most journalists
expect that you know it's a disciplinary
effect that most of us know from our own
experience is just going through school
I mean going through school is like that
you're trained for obedience all the way
through schooling an awful lot of it is
just training for obedience you're
trained to conform to repeat what you
know it's supposed to be said not to get
too far out of line in fact any of us
who got to a good college as most of us
I suppose did did it simply by being
dishonest I know if I look back at my
own personal life yes exactly what it
was if the teacher said something like
the history teacher and school said
something was obviously ridiculous you
didn't get up and say you know you're
absurd perfect anybody knows the other
way around and but you just SAT there
and you figured okay i'll give that
answer on the test and i'll do it
everyone and that's how you get through
people who don't accept the discipline
are usually weeded out somewhere along
the way there are behavior problems or
you know pick ritalin or something else
right but I've actually seen that happen
myself even with my own kids nothing
yeah move move over and ask a question
be like you should be like as far as
this league they always have three
people
yeah well that's the way the educational
system works I mean I've seen it plenty
of times well what's happening now with
education is in a way what's been going
on since the 60s the 60s really
revitalized the society I mean they
changed it a lot it had a big civilizing
effect it freed people up I mean all
kind of new thinking in all domains it
just had a tremendous effect and it's
just a completely different country in a
much better country for that reason is
detested you know immediately after the
60s right away there was there was a
major effort a lot of it pub quite
public to reverse to you know get rid of
this rot to undermine what happened and
a lot of it was discussed if you haven't
done so yet I would urge people to read
a very important book I'll get back to
education which comes up there called
the crisis of democracy it's a quite
important book it was not intended to be
read and that makes it useful to read it
was intended as a kind of an internal
document of the trilateral commission a
trilateral commission had just been
formed by David Rockefeller in 1973 or
so it's trilateral because it protected
because was Europe Japan in the United
States and it brought together sort of
liberal internationalists segments of
the ruling classes the kind of the more
and you get a picture of it by by the
fact that the Carter Administration was
totally drawn from its ranks including
Carter and all of his top advisers so
that was the general character of the
trilateral commission kind of on the
liberal side of the spectrum and
internationalist as David Rockefeller
himself is their first major publication
was called the crisis of democracy the
crisis of democracy was about the 60s
the 60s had brought about this at a
crisis of democracy in all of the
trilateral areas you're
and the United States the crisis was
that people were actually becoming
involved in the political arena people
who are supposed to be passive and
obedient and quiet nice people we're
organizing and pressing their own
interests and demands and this what they
said was happening all over I mean women
youth farmers you know all kind of
people are just supposed to shut up and
do what they're told we're trying to
become involved in things and that cause
what they called a crisis of
governability it was what they called
excessive democracy and they even said
what the right kind of democracy is as I
say they were talking to each other so
thing really expect anybody to read it
actually side comment as soon as I read
it I immediately brought up lots and
lots of comp copy started sending around
and put them on MIT reading lists and so
on and I noticed maybe it's no cause and
effect anyway went out of print very
quickly and it came back years later I
think he can now get it but it was
clearly wasn't intended to be read the
the u.s. spokesman the guy from the US
reporter the guy who gave the position
paper for the United States is a Harvard
professor of government guy named Samuel
Huntington this rather famous and he
described what he thought the right kind
of democracy was he said in the days
this is virtually a quote he said in the
days of Truman he said Truman had been
able to govern the country with the help
of a few Wall Street bankers and
financiers and that was the good old
days there was no crisis democracy then
but you were getting this crisis of
governability in the 60s with lots of
people trying to go where they don't
belong into the public arena and then
the question is what do we do about this
you know got to suppress it and one of a
part of it had to dedicate so they said
that the the educational institutions
what they call those are my words what
they called the institutions for the
indoctrination of the young like the
churches in the schools and the
universities just aren't doing their job
students are too rambunctious
thinking too much and children aren't
obeying orders and so on so we got to
make sure that the institutions for that
are responsible for the indoctrination
of the young really do indoctrinate the
young and from that point on you can see
I mean it's not that this started it off
this is one of a whole pile of things
like the establishment of these
right-wing think tanks all over the
place that have essentially taken
control of public debate and shifted it
way far to the right and lots of other
things actually financial liberalisation
as part of this that what we call
globalization which is mostly financial
liberalisation was understood which was
introduced meant has the effect of
eliminating the possibility of
decision-making on the part of national
governments so it undermines the crisis
of democracy this way from many points
of view the same thing we're happening
with part of it was in schools and in
the early 80s the Reagan administration
published a book with a lot of fanfare
called the what was it called remember
the title of that book the nation in
danger or some such name nation at risk
yea which was total fraud you know I
mean beginning to end and it was
completely discredited right away by
people in education as well as they were
wrong does that mean I think that didn't
matter it sort of it was saying what
people wanted the year so what a lates
wanted to hear so it became true and the
nation is at risk because people are
uneducated you know we're falling behind
the Japanese or whatever it may be and
we therefore have to go back to old
fashioned disciplinary training make
sure that people of the kids learn rote
learning you know memorize facts follow
orders don't think too much none of this
business and it's moving on right along
to the present we're in Massachusetts
and probably other states the
educational system the is now geared
around passing idiotic tests so forth I
have a kid and grandson grandchild and
fourth grade who's spent to spending all
their time it's like memorized studying
for sats you know you memorize the
answers to the question
that are going to be asked on the fourth
grade test and the teachers are
compelled to do that if they don't do it
they're going to lose their jobs because
they get monitored to see how well the
kids do on that fourth grade test if one
teacher the kids don't do that well
because maybe they're writing in you
know interesting papers on this on the
topic that they pursue instead of
memorizing meaningless names the teacher
will have a salary cut or desired you
know and that's starting to happen so
you're getting the natural effects
teachers cheating you know they're
figuring out ways of I'm their lives are
at stake they have to so you get the
usual test style effect you learn
pointless stupid things which you're
going to forget two minutes later and
but you but you learned the main thing
you learn is discipline you learn
discipline authority and not to think
for yourself and that's there's a fourth
grade one in eighth grade one and two
other kinds democracy to talk a bit
about how you can see I me I was this
because I'm well the interesting thing
about all of these efforts there's been
a huge effort over the past another one
sitting out of 30 years to try to roll
back the 60s and it hasn't happened I
mean it just keeps growing you know the
same the same whatever was going on in
the 60s which if you look back was
pretty small you know it was not that
widespread I'm there was there were a
lot of things going on in society you
know like all over the place but the
things the the visible activism the was
pretty narrowly focused it was first was
mostly young people and mostly students
not that things were going on in the
youth generally a lot of things are
going on but they were taking different
they were expressing themselves in
different ways but the direct political
activism was mostly students and not in
that many universities and it was mostly
the late 60s so 68 69 around then for a
couple of years and students are a
transitory group of people you know your
student for a couple years and then
you're out of it
so in a way it wasn't deeply rooted and
I think it was assumed that you could
sort of smash it you know I could roll
it back and get back to the good old
days when Truman good govern the country
etc etc but it didn't happen the major
movements that really had a large scale
effect are actually from the 70s not
from the 60s so it's in the 70s that you
get to say the feminist movement and the
environmental movement's and the human
rights movements the anti-nuclear
movement the Solidarity movements like
candy apartheid and all this stuff this
is not the 60s the this is posts I mean
it sort of had its roots there in some
way but it was growing up later and
became very extensive at it's bigger
than it ever was so when and it's now to
the point where they understand very
well that they have to keep things
secret because the ferment is so close
to the surface you know that if anything
comes out it will won't work and that's
what happened with EMA I the ma I was
you know what this is most letter
agreement on investments well it's one
of these is kind of like there's a
series of investor rights agreements
that are getting rammed through all over
the place some of them visibly some not
the ma I without going into details was
a massive investor rights treaty which
was going to allow investors to
basically go anything I wanted that sort
of eliminated all constraints and it
ever it was proposed that sort of became
formalized around 1996 the business
world knew about it at once so right
around that time the what they're called
but there's a kind of an International
Chamber of Commerce the business
organization that's oriented towards
international affairs whatever they're
called they published a big monograph
which was circulated to all corporations
the media certainly know about it
conceivable that they did it was known
to the corporate world it was known to
the media world they kept it secret
everywhere around the world it was kept
secret for
well this was 1995 I think it got
started it's stayed secret until
nineteen ninety-seven which is pretty
impressive discipline I finally in 1997
it started breaking through from
activists first in Canada there's a
couple of is good activists and some
pretty well known people like Maude
Barlow and others that they have good
group somehow they got a copy of of it
from somewhere I think was leaked to
them by somebody on the inside another
copy was leaked to lori wallach who
works with Public Citizen manator group
but starting in Canada they began to
begin some livia just to publicize it
there's publicize the information within
no time it had become a big issue in
Canada got to be big enough issue so it
was all over the major media so the
major press and Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation has stories about it
interestingly was kept out of the United
States even though it was still going it
was pretty open in Canada and III did an
article on this so I reviewed the way it
worked was kind of interesting the in
Australia it broke through in January
1998 and instantly became a huge issue
you know town meetings big things in
England about a month later like around
februari France about a month later by
then it was also beginning to break
through in the United States and more or
less the same story and most of the
industrial world anyway by awe at the
the OECD the 30 rich countries were
supposed to had a meeting scheduled for
April where they were going to ratify
this thing and it was just breaking
through by like februari by the time I
got to April they had taken ratified
they were being there was so much
pressure from grassroots organizations
that they simply couldn't cram it
through they delayed it for a later
meeting and there was even more pressure
and they finally publicly at least
abandoned but they're not trying to do
is sneak it through quietly other ways
well you know this is I and it was kind
of interesting to read the business
press after
is the having other clinical it's called
hordes of vigilantes it was in Z that
subversive journal and it's in a book
the that phrase hordes of vigilantes
came from the Financial Times that's the
premier international business journal
published in London Business Daily free
of journal so an article called hordes
of vigilantes and I was about how these
hordes of vigilantes you know people
like fog Barlow others descended on the
poor OECD and totally overwhelmed them
you know here's the greatest
concentration of power in world history
the richest countries in the world all
the corporation's you know the media and
Maude Barlow and her friends came around
and they they don't know how to resist
this pressure and I don't think the
article was written sarcastically I'm
not sure hard to tell something was
about how you know the business world is
going to have to learn how to deal with
these tremendous forces you know that
are beating it up and then the business
world doesn't have any organs to express
its own point of view you know these
guys run the whole international media
and everything else and they just didn't
know what to do they quote trade
representatives as saying this is a
total disaster and one of them said is
it may turn out that we won't be able to
sign trade deals behind closed doors and
have them rubber stamp by Parliament's
like in the good old days I mean his
immense disaster well that was the they
really took it seriously and we're very
upset by it kind of like the crisis of
democracy in the sixties and the fact
that constantly happens you know when
there's any when the population ever
breaks out from discipline and obedience
of people go berserk you know and think
the world's coming to an end I mean for
example I just take a local event at
Harvard and Mac in 69 I guess somebody
around can remind me if I got the date
room this Harvard was pretty quiet but
toward the end of the sort of 60s
activism students some students at
Harvard took over a building with the
president's building and
and what are you I mean basically
nothing you know they took over the
building and there were some protests
there is now a story that has been
concocted there's books about it you
know impassioned articles and so on
about how the courageous how most of the
faculty sold out but a few courageous
people enough you know Harvard
professors but if you can know you
surrounded the library to defend the
library against these fiends who are
going to come and burn down the library
you know like the Library of Alexandria
but some of them stood there bravely
confronting Mike Albert and a couple of
other isms prevented them from burning
down widener library is they were all
planning to do and this is told with
great passion and conviction you know as
if we were really fighting the good
fight and so I mean any point the point
of making any tiny break from obedience
is regarded as a complete disaster I
mean it's like an extremely
authoritarian parent you know who
expects the kids to simply do what
they're told every second and if a kid
makes a slight move out of it it's the
world's coming to an end because all
gonna collapse and in fact it's not a
totally unrealistic picture if there's
any breakthrough it might all collapse
and so I just West comment before the
same is true of foreign policy I mean if
you look over foreign policy you'll know
that the harshest reaction is against
the weakest most insignificant states so
like it takes a louse you know most
people ousted you know where they exist
they didn't though they're in the
country you know never there was such a
place but it was subjected to the most
intense bombing in history because there
was a month now it's claimed it had to
do with the Ho Chi Minh Trail which is
just not true it was because there was a
small very low-key peasant revolution
not even a revolution with land reforms
something's going on and they really got
terrified or take say the embargo
against Cuba you know Cuba's not going
to destroy the United States but it's a
it it's small and weak and therefore it
really has to be subjected to sit
stick pressures in fact is the most
extreme example I guess was grenade it
grenaded you know you barely exists a
hundred thousand people to the size of
Cambridge Mass had little influence over
the Nutmeg trade that was about its role
in international affairs when they had a
very authoritarian government us was
supporting when it was overthrown and
maurice bishop took over it's like 78
and he started like a fisherman's
cooperative for ten fishermen or
something like that other you at the
Carter Administration this is win % you
know they cut off aid they there was a
hurricane and there was supposed to be
aid for the Caribbean region they would
not give aid any other country in the
region unless they agreed to cut Grenada
out of it the country was disrupted it
was finally invaded invading Grenada in
fact the US Army after I guess Rangers
or Special Forces or whoever got
succeeded in getting eight thousand
medals of Valor for 6,000 soldiers who
exceeded in conquering 25 unarmed the
Cuban construction workers it isn't mota
there were casualties but that's because
the Rangers were killing each other like
they were shooting each other you know
but the point is it evokes history if
anything goes out alone and that's what
these things are like and probably for
good reasons I mean if people see that
you don't have to follow orders and
knows what will come next what has you
use many years more memorable statements
when you affect American academic seven
will survive intellectual class on the
planet and I'm thinking sponsors but
probably anything hi there probably
others who were both his bed yeah I
don't know I'm better you know about the
relationship between University
academics and legitimizing and creating
the ideas for the Vietnam War if you're
to do something like that now about the
University how would you work through
some of those relationship well you know
like everything else in the society the
university's got more open as a result
of the 60s for one thing a lot of people
who went through that experience
or in the university's you know they
just change but and also it just changed
things I'm going to change things down
to the styles of dress so like up till
the 60s I would go to class with a
jacket that time and the students would
be what's called properly dressed you
know you look like a gentleman you
didn't have to look like a lady because
there were no women or maybe three three
women in the Institute or something but
in the 60s that all changed it became
and those changes are not superficial
they reflect relationships among people
you know so as dress becomes more casual
it's not just post jeans are easy to
wear because you don't you know I
supposed to take yourself that seriously
and you're supposed to have a more easy
egalitarian relation with the other guy
wearing jeans and not sort of thing so
it's just everything changed from that
up till two attitudes and concerns and
so on and so forth in the university's
change so by now they are more open
there's a lot of stuff going on in the
university's we've been unthinkable in
the before the 60s and sometimes it's
really quite striking so in fact
affected since we're talking about the
media gets back to the media and
interesting ways so for example when
when the United States is carrying out
some atrocity somewhere in the world
whatever it may be the the media have a
thing called objectivity if you become a
journalist to go to journalism school
you're taught objectivity objectivity
it's not put this way but what it means
is you're not supposed to express your
own opinion you're kind of above that
what you do is go to somebody who has
your opinion who's an expert designators
an expert and get that person to say it
and then you write it down and now your
objective so there's a category of
experts who are called upon by the media
to express the party line whenever
anything goes on usually the way you can
do it to get somebody who's both expert
and party line is just go to local
university okay and go to the political
science department or you know
Southeast Asia the Asian department or
whatever it may be and find somebody who
will be a reputable expert because they
have the right PhD and stuff and they'll
tell you exactly what you want to hear
just sort of Han order and then you
write it on and subjective now in the
1980s of the big issue of Central
America now that was all over the place
of us were against Nicaragua El Salvador
and stuff and there is of course a Latin
American profession but they could not
do it the Latin American profession
would not repeat the party line they
described just accurately what was going
up so they were cut out of the media if
you look over the 1980s you will find
that they there's very rare access on
the part of Latin American profession
sometimes it's extreme so for example
there was an election in 1984 in
Nicaragua it was the first real free
election in the country's history and it
was very heavily monitored I was well
from all over the place I mean the
British parliamentary human rights group
Irish parliamentary delegation Dutch
very hostile Dutch delegation all over
among the monitors was the Latin
American Studies Association which is
the professional Society of Latin
American is the there was a group that
went down there spent a couple of weeks
there in the background of the election
these are people who are specialists on
Nicaragua most who had done field work
there in New the area quite well they
were led by the delegation was led by
pre conservative political scientists
Latin American 'used they wrote a very
detailed report on the election
concluding as everyone did that it even
the most hostile critics that it was a
pre fair election and by Latin American
standards unusually so well that wasn't
supposed to be happening because the
u.s. position was this is a totalitarian
communist dictatorship and I don't have
elections and therefore we have to
attack them well their report was never
none of this was ever for it this story
was there was no electric story remains
there was no election so the 1990
election which by that time the US
was in a position two men after smashing
up the country for ten years that was
the first election anything you reads
his first election on the Sandinistas
only agreed to it because of the
battering we gave them because their
communist totalitarians well everyone
including the Latin American
professional society was totally cut out
that may be the most in a way the most
interesting case was for those of you
know Central America they're the sort of
grand old man of Central American
democracies a guy named Jose figueres
who initiated the Democratic regime in
Costa Rica which is the one in country
that wasn't run by military hooligans he
was very Pro us in fact the United Fruit
Company considered him their best
delegates in Central America he was
close to the CIA supported the Bay of
Pigs and but he was a kind of a social
democrat and he hated the Sandinistas he
went to he was one of the monitors of
the election and he wrote afterwards he
said look I don't like these guys I
don't like what they're doing but it's
he said it's the first time in the
history of Nicaragua that there's ever
been a government that cared about the
people and they ought to be given a
chance leave you'll be let alone and
given a chance to make their own
mistakes and I don't like it but the
people are willing for it and it's an
honest election he wasn't reported you
know in fact when he died a couple years
later his obituary never mentioned it in
fact nothing he said about Central
American the 1980s was ever recorded and
this is the hero you know the Democratic
hero who is the US ally and still coming
back to the Latin American Studies
Association that that went right through
the whole period occasionally somebody
would get an op-ed here and there but
very rarely the leading historian who
writes about Nicaragua the Tom Walker
from Ohio University he is the major
historian you know he has written the
major books and so on and he's I'm 90
I'm and her friends but I don't even
know I wouldn't even know how to
identify and politically i'm not sure
what he is as far as it probably
mainstream liberal of some kind of I
suppose
certainly no identify no noticeable
politics he submitted an op-ed every
year to the New York Times never
regretted what they had what they did
was something interesting the media
invented their own experts they invented
a cadre of people they called experts
who since they couldn't find the usual
ones and those are the ones who wrote
the articles there were mainly to a guy
named Mark Falcao's and another one
laying Robert lakin mark neither had any
background in Latin America lake and I
happen to know personally he was at MIT
in the seventh in the 60s he has since
invented of false history for himself
but the fact is he was he was a kind of
an academic marxist who taught
literature and never had anything to do
with any of the activism I mean I marks
this is right where he's kind of
European Italy you know sorry European
or and intellectual who was completely
removed from any till the very end like
around 1970 and like a lot of people who
got involved at the very end he went
totally off the spectrum he became some
Maoist extremist you know and in that he
left MIT he went to Mexico he was
pretend he was writing back letters
about how he was living with the
guerrillas and is dead and the other
thing and not it was true was it you
know people like me and others would
send him some money to help him get out
of trouble and this went on he was
writing these crazy articles about to
not articles because nobody would
publish about how the guerrillas were
taking over Mexico and the Maoist this
that and the other business hey around
nineteen west and I son was in 1979 I
guess same line then he disappeared for
a couple of months he came back as a
senior fellow of the carnegie foundation
for Endowment for international peace
jacket and tie a new Spanish and smart
guy he then he realized that his Maoist
line was virtually the same as Reaganism
because the two basically different
terminology the two agreed so he would
write articles about how the sturdy
peasants
rising up against the feminists for any
of you who read malice cults that means
the peasants are rising up against the
Russians the Hegemony's means the
Russians and he wrote articles about the
DI his books like this it's all Maoist
rhetoric which is interpreted to mean
the sturdy peasants of the Contras and
they're rising up against the
Sandinistas were the Russians and
they're leading the Maoist revolution
you know this is the story and that fit
exactly with what was wanted he became
the writer for The New York Review of
Books is the guy who was quoted for the
Washington Post I mean after a couple of
years he learned to tone down the
obvious Maoist rhetoric which was not
like a joke if you know that literature
and then it just became straight
apologetics for the US war he's quoted
all over the place and so on he had
never written an article on Latin
America but he became the excitement
that's not a criticism you don't have to
have a degree in the subject to find out
what's going on anybody can find out but
the Latin American Studies Association
had to be cut off they couldn't write
the articles because they were just
saying the wrong thing well you know
that's a reflection of some of the
things that went on in the University I
don't say that that's typical it's in
fact extremely unusual I don't know why
Latin Americans Latin American study
stands out among the professions in this
respect I don't know why that's true but
there's something like that in many of
the professions so there's kind of a
tinge of it in many places which
certainly wasn't years ago and right at
the end of the 60s and early 70s most of
the professional societies has started
younger people in an occasional older
people per person but mostly younger
people started setting up the counter
organizations like the committee of
Concerned Asian scholars and others
because their own professional
organizations reserved reactionary and
to some extent that seeped its way into
the professions to a limited extent
there has as I said been a major effort
eliminated
but it has not succeeded it hasn't
succeeded among the public and it hasn't
succeeded at the University there's a
lot of resistance to it it's very
resilient what happened in the in the
second in the 60s and afterwards and
it's an issue of major concern so
there's still major and that's in fact
what these school programs are like now
none of these school programs about
trying to establish discipline are a
part of it in fact a bigger part of it
which is right in the background is a
fairly transparent effort to eliminate
the oil public school system to
eliminate it through privatization and
that's taking a lot of forms vouchers
charter schools defunding the system if
you want to privatize a system like when
Thatcher once to privatize the railroads
or whatever it may be this is a
particular technique for doing it you
make the system run so badly that people
get upset about it and then they don't
resist very much when it's handed over
as a gift is on private corporation
that's essentially the technique so if
you can make the schools function badly
enough partly by just defunding partly
by propaganda like your nation at risk
by propaganda so so parents really feel
and the community feels look these
things aren't functioning if you enough
combination that you cut back the
resistance to efforts to the slow
efforts to privatize and the it's only
the big investment firms are well aware
this a couple of years ago I got a Alain
Bernard who some of you know sent me a
copy of Lehman Brothers brochure that
they were sending out to you know there
are prime investors or something and the
content of it was well we've taken over
the health system you know we're taking
over the prison system we're taking this
that and the other thing we still
haven't got the school so the next big
target is get schools privatized name
and then first for lending when you
privatize them you can make them what's
called efficient and you can do it like
it
no manager but I know how to make the
school's official hire fire all the
union workers you know like the janitors
and the teachers and everybody else and
get low paid workers who have no
benefits because they have no union to
protect them that already makes it more
efficient cutback services like don't
offer any special education or you know
special things where kids that need this
and that gear the educational system to
the upper middle class kids who are
going to learn them are what you do
because their parents are going to make
them learn at home you know and forget
about the rest or send them off to what
amounts to if they're lucky you
vocational school they're not lucky the
streets or the prisons and the system
simply gets more efficient by the usual
measure so you can do that and meanwhile
you can pour a propaganda at them in
fact straight outright advertising like
now they've got advertising in first
grade and that turns them into the main
way to discipline people this has been
known like for centuries but it became
intensive and this sent last century the
main technique of disappointing people
the one that works best is to turn them
into psychotic consumers I mean if
people's complete conception of the
world of themselves is IMS goods for
myself period that's me nothing else
exists then they're trapped you know and
that that is very conscious i should say
you want to you read the advertising
industry pr industry's literature
they're very frank about it now you have
to turn you have to impose a philosophy
of utility and get people to focus on
the superficial things of life like
fashionable confessed consumption you
get that none they're trapped and that's
you know that's a dremel imitating the
public school system has many important
aspects the same as eliminating social
security and others I mean the public
school system is based on a principle
that is a strongly opposed by a leap
sectors in general and for good reasons
it's based on the principle of
solidarity
so the public school system is based on
the principle that you care whether some
other kids you don't know gets an
education and that's extremely bad idea
you want to knock that kind of idea out
of people's heads they're supposed to
consider only themselves and their own
and only insignificant things for
themselves like I read each shoes you
have or something like that and be
trapped into that and any concern for
other people any sympathy and solidarity
any feeling of working together that has
to be driven out of people's heads and
that means the public system cool school
system simply have to go I mean the main
thrust to the attack on Social Security
I think it's the same there's a lot of
fakery about it trust fund going broke
and assault fakery but what but there is
something that is not fake the Social
Security system really is based on
solidarity you know it's based on the
idea that every disabled person in every
Widow you know every everyone who
survives past working age should be
supported in some fashion everyone even
if you don't know and that it's just
their public responsibility to do them
and that conception is subversive and
therefore has to be eliminated in terms
of privatizing aspirations domesticating
aspirations so I think that's like
that's sort of the major part of the
attempt to restore just one to say
that's heroes some I saw a Pokemon my
grandchildren I was wondering if you
thought it was instructors particularly
for people on I guess you would consider
even or more like this in terms of the
media that it seems like you know sort
of the general public is much more
effective or receptive to more radical
or less this type of ideas about the
about reality I mean I'm picking up
phone what good will hunting or wag the
dog or even office space where you know
it's like people can see those movies
like okay that's active release as real
and everything but yet to say that and
so it seems like people are more
receptive if they're you know if it's in
a movie form or maybe even in a cartoon
or comedian says it but but yet somehow
unacceptable look at you know what you
say on the venue that's considered to be
serious ism yeah I don't know any I
don't know much about this culture so I
can't say much but it's but there's a
there's none well known fact about
totalitarian societies and that is they
have typically Tyler even some extent
tolerated the things like cartoons and
spoofs you know which make fun of the
leadership apparently some at that it
does people do react to it but
apparently it somehow considered safe
you see this in the Serbia right now so
a lot of which doesn't get attacked an
immediate he does get attacked in the
cabarets you know by and that's pretty
standard I don't know how people react
to these things I mean I rarely have
seen an I'll pee one case which may not
be typical I once if you know the film
missing about when my son was about
maybe 14 so my wife and I took him to
see it was playing a local theater and
this is playing in a theater in
Lexington Massachusetts which is a
professional you know educated town
and you liked it i mean as we were
walking out I asked him if he what he
understood you know we were talking
about it really it was good adventure
story I didn't understand what it was
about but I was listening to people as
we walked out and I don't think almost
nobody knows that joy I mean it was just
just you know this adventure story is
bad government and our government did
bad things you know even an American
citizen was harmed but it was kind of
unrelated it was not placed within any
context of understanding at least on the
part of the people i heard even for the
extent of knowing what country of us
which probably wasn't mentioned i don't
know what the reaction is to these other
things i'm sure you know a lot more than
i do is miss me actually i'm not sure
how much people object to what they see
on paper either remember a lot of the
reactions to what is seen on paper are
coming from educated intellectuals and
they certainly don't like it but that
for them that's kind of like a
professional obligation almost not to
like it how other people reacted like
you know i don't get a fair sample but i
get a huge number of letters most of
them from people with no special
educational status and interesting
raising questions i find the same again
not a fair sample with just public
audiences I'm if anything there's a the
willingness to think about it seriously
is negatively correlated with education
I think which is true and I suspect it
is true wouldn't be very surprising
because education really is
indoctrination I mean the people who are
most heavily indoctrinated are the ones
who are most educated meaning they've
been through the system of
indoctrination more intensively and
furthermore they've internalized it and
they have to internalize it because they
have to produce it
I mean if you have to produce something
you sort of have to believe it you come
to believe you know just by doing it I'm
getting a little oh sorry what you see
as far as America's involvement
Indonesian the next couple years Henry
Kissinger is kind of a flat for big
corporations now they use him as an
entree to leadership in various places I
think he's connected somehow with
Freeport if i'm not mistaken which is
investing which invests in the mines and
West Papua taken over by Indonesia the
whole future in Indonesia is extremely
uncertain it's a very rich area a lot of
resources and it's got tremendous
internal conflicts each team were had
nothing to do with Indonesia that was
just invaded so they're out of there
finally but the parts of work what is
called Indonesia they're very bitter
conflicts my mom in the Malacca there
there's a resistance movement in West
Papua what they call Irian Jaya that's
marginally Indonesia I mean it it is
ethnically distinct it was handed over
to indonesia by international agreement
around the late 60s so it's called
technically part of Indonesia unlike
East Timor which was just invaded on the
other hand the people there have never
regarded themselves as part of Indonesia
and there there is no there has been an
independence movement it's now picking
up steam there's a lot of mineral
resources there's a lot of interest in a
lot of the population essentially you
know indigenous the pre-modern for the
most part in other parts of Indonesia
there's been bitter battles going on for
years the other end of the archipelago
and nochi there's been a lot of there is
an independence movement there's been a
lot of violence putting it down i J as
well only work this way into what was in
the dutch dutch east indies pretty late
i think early in the 20th century
it was incorporated into the Dutch East
Indies and again they don't feel that
they're part of Indonesia and are
calling for a referendum and
independence right around the middle in
the Moluccas there's a bitter battle
going on a violent battle with plenty of
killing in the nation army sort of
involved apparently and it's there it's
a it's a Christian Muslim split Muslim
Indonesia has been a pretty tower at the
Muslim society for Muslims them for a
long time but there is a kind of jet you
know kind of jihad group some of them
apparently come from Afghanistan or had
an experience there and are now
apparently leading a rather violent
aunty Christian movement and there met
you know with comparable elements on the
other side and that that's breaking up
and the same in many places not very
clear what will happen there the u.s. is
now returning for a couple of months of
the u.s. we've held at least
theoretically I hope you will find out
ten years from that what actually
happened but in theory Lee the US did
withhold the direct arms shipments and
military training for several months the
last known military exercise jointly
with Indonesian forces was through
August 1999 ended on August 25th couple
days before the referendum and the huge
violence and since then as far as Amon
has been made public or haven't been any
more military exercises theoretically
again arms shipment stopped around that
time around mid-september but they're
now being renewed and the military
contacts are being rude and it's
whatever is happening in detail you can
be pretty sure that the US has not tried
very hard to maintain control over
whatever it is on there Indonesia's just
too important to well to go its own way
actually I know how much you know about
the history but this goes way back like
in 1958 the u.s. carried out the largest
clandestine
operation and post-war history up to the
Nicaragua war to try to split up
Indonesia this was kind of kept it's
just actually it isn't even released in
the official archives they have not
released speed the official archives
which usually release documents after 30
years or so 35 years they skipped over
this now they've gone past that period
but they concealed the documents which
were brought at most of it was brought
out by relating Indonesia's scholar in
the United States George can and Audrey
k and also it Indonesia scholar george
just died but he was the founder of
Southeast Asian Studies major historian
and he and Audrey is either his wife or
his daughter I'm not sure but something
with some relation they just wrote a
book to cut very interesting book a
couple years ago called subversion is
foreign policy which is largely about
the effort to break up Indonesia in 1958
which was taken extremely seriously they
were afraid that Indonesia was becoming
too independent and also to democratic
incidentally it was allowing a party of
the left to take part in elections
peasant faced party left and I was doing
pretty well and looked like it was not
do even better and I couldn't be
tolerated so there was an attempt to
break it up in that led ultimately to
the military coup that took place
collier's later I also was to teamwork
officers to be an awful lot somewhere is
between that two techniques in Phoenix
that was pointed out that was actually
pointed out explicitly by some of the
Australian specialists David Jenkins who
said i think the asia editor of one of
the major australian journals is an old
asia hand then pretty conservative
pointed out that the indonesian commando
forces that were going into east timor
in early nineteen ninety nine fresh from
us training incidentally which was
illegal that's why i think we have to be
cautious about what's been happening in
the last couple of months because there
was secret illegal training going on
right through 1999 including the capataz
commandos these special forces commandos
they he said that the what they were
taught essentially was Phoenix style
assassination techniques and he probably
knows he's Australian czar pretty close
to this and he's close to Australian
intelligence and so on so I think your
insight is correct I mean that yes
that's probably where it comes from in
fact this is true almost everywhere like
takes a Columbia the if you look at the
counter insurgents which is the next
major you know it's already a huge
atrocity that's going to get worse the
the history there is interesting I'm in
Columbia has a tremendous history of
violence which goes we meant us had
anything to do with drugs but the
history of violence goes way back has to
do with it totally hopelessly any gala
therrien socio-economic conditions of
real oppression but it got a lot worse
under the Kennedy administration Kennedy
sent down the kennett all of Latin
America was turned into a disaster area
by Kennedy's counterinsurgency programs
and then vicar in Colombia there was a
special forces mission sent out there in
1962 headed by a special forces general
general yarbrough and they advised the
Colombian military non-advised limbu
trained them and armed them but the
advice was to carry out what they called
paramilitary terror so to organize
paramilitaries and carry out terror
operations using primarily
paramilitaries against what we're called
known communist proponents and that's
just about anybody you know who doesn't
know doesn't say the right thing and
that's when it really got bad with my
advice but the training and so on that
went behind it by now the paramilitaries
are responsible for roughly eighty
percent of the atrocities which are
increasing and American Arms are
increasing which is typical as the
atrocities increase the US Armed slow
increases but it's mostly paramilitary
and that's and paramilitary terror of a
kind that the traces right back to the
Kennedy administration proposals for the
hemisphere and for Indonesia so yeah the
parallels are quite real when you're
developing the analysis of foreign
policy one of the things you look for
guys you understand I think the no
matter who you're looking at these you
want if you want to study the foreign
policy of any state the first thing to
look at is the distribution of power
internal to that state like who makes
decisions inside the society now who
decides what's produced what's
distributed you know what appears in
media you know who sets the parameters
within which the guidelines within which
the government functions and when you've
looked at them it should give you some
hints as to what the policies want to
look like it's going to protect their
interests you'd expect the state power
may have some degree of Independence but
it's going to reflect the internal
distribution of power well when you look
at the United States it's not a big
secret to you know there's a heavy
concentration of power and the private
industrial and financial sectors and
that includes the media's with your just
huge corporations so that network of
power has pretty obvious interests in
having a certain kind of world which
will be open to their exploitation and
nomination and you'd expect the state to
reflect those interests
you might be surprised so you always
keep an open mind of course but when you
look at the way policy works itself out
i think it's pretty much which fine then
it shouldn't surprise one at the same is
true the media I really said much about
them but if you ask yourself why is the
media product the way it is the place to
look at first is just what kind of
institutions are the media so what are
they they're the main ones the ones that
are setting the framework that the
others follow there are huge
corporations which sell a product namely
audiences and in the case of the big
ones privileged audiences to other
businesses tangley advertisers that's
the institutional structure of the media
major corporations selling privileged
readers to other businesses and you can
at least have some expectations from
that as to what picture of the world
they'll present namely one that reflects
the interests and concerns of the
sellers the buyers and the product and
when you look that's pretty much we find
and see any reason why I should be
surprised in it same with foreign policy
I mean there are there some other things
like occasionally domestic pressure
groups may have an influence maybe I
think it's exaggerated but you can find
cases but I think that's what you'd
expect whether you're looking at the
Soviet Union or turkey or the United
States or anywhere else hey aggravation
received decentralized nature cyberspace
the internet and push by high technology
companies to acquire media Columbus yeah
I think there's a there's a kind of
there's an interesting an important very
important struggle going on right now as
to who's want to control the cyberspace
I mean it is a public creation it's
created in the public sector in the
state sector only handed over to private
power about five years ago in a way
which nobody knows incidentally like the
decision is still secret but it was done
after the there was a shift then in the
way the thing was viewed Norman Solomon
is a meeting media critic rights
commentaries on Xena he pointed out he
didn't just a survey a while back and he
pointed out that prior to nineteen
ninety-five when the system was
commercialized the internet was
typically described as an information
superhighway and after 1995 it's
typically described as e-commerce okay
well that's quite of this shift
ecommerce is I think should be viewed as
part of the system of indoctrination
that is the part that's trying to get
people focused on individual consumption
for getting anything else as we're
making pouring it into them now the
question is what happens to this whole
system well in fury it's decentralized
but not entirely in practice like access
to the Internet is through a very few
places few portals and the mergers tend
to monopolize those and they can too
they can control they can't totally
control but they can at least heavily
influenced what happens to you when you
get through one of those portals like
what what's easy to do and what's hard
to do you know where are you drawn
automatically and where do you have to
work like I maniac to find out what you
want and there's just no doubt that
they're trying to design that in such a
way that it will take people where they
want to go they want them to go and that
means that people who want to find out
say about the ma I or whatever maybe are
going to find it harder to do unless
they resist you know unless this public
creation is in fact protected by the
public whose government gave it away so
it seems to me that's a terrain of
struggle really I'm in the corporate
power and the government surely do not
want people to use the internet to
undermine the ma I which is how the
organizing was done or to organize for
Seattle you know were to circulate the
subversive views / z net or whatever
they don't want that what they want is
for people to
a purchase no subordinate themselves to
private power that's what they want and
the question is can they succeed in
controlling the technologies is to get
them to do it in Peru and our MIT
student our political prisoners overseas
like Laurie Berenson and what we could
do to help her and how much involvement
with the rest government has with the
Peruvian government and really you know
why is it that we really can't get her
out well I don't think there's much
doubt that the US government could get
her out if they wanted to she's a
political prisoner having to be a
student at MIT who's been in a Peruvian
prison for quite a few years now she's
so very courageous woman she's been off
she's in a horrible prison somewhere up
and I'm now I'm mountain somewhere in
isolation and she has been offered to
better terms you know allowed if she'll
accommodation but she's refused she's
insists on suffering with the prisoners
who in the hardest circumstances and
it's pretty griddle from anything that's
dribbled through there has been there
have been efforts to put demonstrations
and protests and meetings and the usual
thing they have not reached enough of a
scale to get Washington dear bean but if
it wanted to it would get her out of an
American prisoners held somewhere they
get him out anywhere no after they can
send the Delta Force or something but
they don't have to you know they just
say they went around the end they
haven't done it why well you know right
now I think the washing has kind of an
ambivalent relationship to fujimori they
don't like the fact that he overturned
the trappings of democracy because it's
important to have countries look like
them up formal democracies that's part
of the legitimate legitimate of the
whole you know foreign policy enterprise
and the whole globalization enterprise
part of it is to make it happen what's
called globalization integration within
the corporate run system to make it look
as if it's happening through
democratically elected governments
that's much better than to make it look
as though it's happening through fascist
dictatorships because then it becomes
too transparent so they're much in favor
of having formal democracies which have
very little don't rock the boat and
Fujimori just upset that by essentially
stealing the election so I think the US
would be pretty happy if he agreed to
another election or you know what step
down or got assassinated or something
like that but they don't want the
government to change very much because
remember this is part of the whole
Andean region where the u.s. is planning
major probably planning major military
operations I'm the ending region is
important got plenty of resources it's
it's it's got a lot of confrontation and
their guerrilla activities which are
quite serious peasants are protesting
have been it they've had imposed on them
neoliberal programs which have been
extremely destructive right through the
edge Andean region that's one of the
things that's driven them to drug
production also the a lot of the drug
production is a consequence of the
economic programs and then forced on
them there are protests all over the
place the best ones that are most
prominent are the ones in Colombia where
a large part of the country has been
taken over by hasn't faced guerrillas
but they're happening everywhere I mean
Bolivia for example a couple of weeks
ago they had to impose martial law on
the whole country because of peasant
protests mostly in one city cochabamba
where the under IMF World Bank orders
the government had privatized the water
company which it at once raised rates
the World Bank
instructions are that you have to pay
user fees so everything has to be you
know public subsidies so like water
doesn't get provided before people or
must you have to pay for it at cost so
that meant raising the rates right away
and that led to several months of
peasant of protest getting reaching a
point where the government had to
declare martial law of the whole country
there were also protest elsewhere over
the destruction of coca plants which are
the only way for the peasant is to
survive after they have you know
subsidized US imports wiping out the
agricultural system and this is
happening all over the region and it's a
very important region there's a lot of
oil on other resources and the newest is
setting up air bases all over the place
I mean it could be an area of major
confrontation and proves writing we love
it so they're not going to you're not
gonna let to prove get out of control on
the other hand the relationship to this
current government is sort of ambivalent
because enough of them they're not
making it look good it was essentially a
so-called pay as they call itself coup
as for Laurie Berenson I think the only
way to proceed is just to try to
intensify the protest so it can't be
made to look invisible and you know this
is in a way a pretty easy issue I mean
here's an American woman who's being
held under miserable conditions and
solitary confinement in effect in a
horrible jail for years from munchies
studies where the violence is your
project can be nice right you ready
the static and reduction of thinking
emblematic of genetic explanations for
behavior leads out among other things
the way in which interactions between
things it's an artistically create
complex environment which feed back into
any shape the very items that have
caused them transforming entire
relationship and I was just going to
have how pervasive you think leaving out
the kind of thinking is depends where
you look so let's just take basic
biology forgetting society I mean any
serious biologist I'll tell you that d
if they ever get to figuring out what
the genome means which is a long way
away it's going to still tell you very
little about what an organism is I mean
even it's just over physical
characteristics because how you go from
jeans to an organism which is assumed
probably correctly this close to
deterministic I mean there may be some
non deterministic elements with mainly
deterministic this is done known I mean
you can some things are known about how
a chicken embryo gets to be a chicken
but it turns out to be extremely complex
the same gene is doing different things
at different times and jeans are
splitting up and parts of them are doing
114 another one another protein there's
maybe way few apparently way see
routines in the human organism there was
assumed maybe forty thousand or so but
somehow they're creating around the
median prey teams that's what teams
basically do is create four things at
this process called epigenesis how you
go from a genetic endowment to a
organism is essentially arguing you know
and that's now we're talking about
things like arms and the legs eyes and
stuff like this when you get the traits
I mean it's a have a site it's I mean on
doubt there's no doubt in my mind at
least that most of everything about us
including how it behaved and how we
interact with one another
is genetically is based in our genes now
it just has to be otherwise we'd be kind
of random acting randomly all the time
if we act systematically in any fashion
it's because it's coming out of their
innate inbound them but having said that
we're essentially at sea I mean just to
show you how just to illustrate how
little is known there one of the main
experimental organisms is a thing called
a nematode this is a tiny little worm
which has I think 800 cells and I think
three hundred neurons and the wiring
diagram for the neurons you know like
how they are interconnected maybe that's
completely known it's been known for
years the thing has a three-day
gestation period everything that happens
during that is known the genome has been
be coated a long time ago in fact you
know about everything you could know
about except why it does what it does so
like there's a big research project at
MIT that's been going interdisciplinary
research project involving the systems
engineering and biology department and
so on even working on this for years
trying to see if you can figure out from
the information about the genetic
structure than you know toad which is
all there you have to wait how you can
figure out why the organism on earth
kind of left or whatever a nematode does
and apparently that's an extremely hard
problem so hard that some people working
on it think that it may be unsolvable it
which has a technical meaning in
mathematics that there may be no sort of
algorithm that determines and we're
talking about a tiny organism when you
get to things as complicated as an
insect it's almost impossible I'm going
to get to humans are you just in outer
space so yeah there's even a i'm
just-just at the level of basic biology
these questions are mostly unstageable
almost when you think about
we have to deal with you know human
being we are human beings we care about
other human beings and how to behave and
understand other what they feel so on
and so forth and it's you got to make
huge leaps because you have to deal with
the situation can't base it on science
as a science didn't tell you know and as
soon as you do you have to think what
you've all synergistically you must it's
just too many complicated interactions
but to look for genetic elements makes a
good deal sense if you can find them
great anything to learn about people's
