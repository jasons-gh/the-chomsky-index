so it's the first question you know in
the mainstream media
Iran is described as the most dangerous
country in the world why now is it true
if we base our opinion on facts like how
many people got killed by an attacking
country after World War two which
countries are the most dangerous and
most likely to attack again
the recent close I mean there are plenty
of atrocities going on in the world so
in the Congo for example eastern Congo
maybe five million people have been
killed recently but there's no single
country that's doing that probably
Rwanda is the most guilty but didn't
kill five main people now the other hand
at the United States I mean in indochina
long the United States killed several
people and that's only the beginning
there are the countries that have killed
their own populations and that's not a
simple calculation so for example
China's well known to be a second world
world country other mouths where many
people were killed like in the Chinese
great Chinese famine in the late 1950s
maybe 25 30 million people were killed
which is quite a lot now nobody claims
that the mouth kill them purposely the
only serious claim is that it's
that's the one that I March SN for
economics of specializes on this what he
pointed out he argued this is a
political family because the
totalitarian system did not permit
information to flow so that by the time
the senator knew about what was
happening it was too late to do anything
about it then in the event as many as
people died but that's a big atrocity
undoubtedly in fact there's a famous
book the Liva Wow black book of
communism which claims that a hundred
million people were killed by communism
and this one this particular event the
Chinese families the biggest biggest
chunk of that so that's a lot of people
killed on the other hand if we look a
little farther but we find something
else I Marcus insane expert who's maybe
the leading specialist on the famines he
he compared he and a colleague on the
West compared a China and India from
liberation late forties up until 1979
year when China initiated the reforms so
the Maoist period and they discovered
that during this period democratic
capitalist India that killed 100 million
people that's compared with China the
reason and they say well this too was a
political killing that was just India
democratic capitalist system did not
Institute the kind of the Gulf reforms
doctors will clinically China and the
difference in mortality they estimated
about a hundred men mm-hmm the way they
put it is every eight years India put as
many skeletons in its closet as China
did during its years of shame here's the
of the Great Famine well you know if we
extended that calculation worldwide the
number of people killed by a capitalist
democracy would be possible
well it's talked about in the case of
China but in the West you wouldn't talk
about it the case of say India or other
capitalist democracies so in France
there's a best-selling book could you
know about the crisis of communism but
there's no comparable when the well for
the crimes of the West and it's the work
of people would be that house is pretty
statical Marxist or whatever the next
term uses so figuring out who killed
most people is not a simple matter
but income off of countries attacking
other countries so then it's the United
States right just there's no competition
no competition okay so so uh I'm not
sure that they say that this is
understood in much at all so for example
take the air of the world mmm an area
region sir there were there have been
polls of public opinion in the Arab
world Western
reliable the most recent was released a
few months ago by the Brookings
Institute very reputable Institute it
was the latest of the regular poll of
Eric opinion that one of the questions
that people were asked is what are the
greatest most dangerous countries they
mean to the region what are the most
dangerous countries to the region mm-hm
well according to Western propaganda the
most dangerous countries Iran mm-hmm
according to our public opinion only 10%
big do you Brennan
it was about 80% pick the United States
and 88% picked Israel that's the most
dangerous countries mm-hm
and in fact the opposition to fear of US
policy is so high that a majority 57
percent said the region would be better
off if you ever have had nuclear weapons
as a deterrent mm-hmm well that's not an
opinion gets expressed in the West in
fact in the United States where I
checked with in this study came out it
was reported no like one daily newspaper
The Washington Times which is a second
secondary industry nationally so the
president really reports not things like
that nothing like that so how do we fix
the press
I'll be the pressure on the press and it
makes a difference you can change the
general the intellectual culture makes a
difference so it was an effect of these
sixties activism which did civilize the
country in many respects it had an
effect on the press
any one thing reporters grew up in that
environment there changed their things
they would right now that they wouldn't
right before mm-hmm
the other thing is to set up alternative
media to not teach media like democracy
now for fun couple
okay I wouldn't be surprised if they
report yeah yeah yeah but I know that
some of the alternative journals did
they ever okay a little bit of Palestine
here since I'm young when I switch on TV
I hear you know the stories about Israel
and Palestine and the big mess that is
you know I'm doing why is that so
important why waste is conflict over
they are so important and so present in
the news because there are bigger
conflicts in the world you know where
more people are suffering but we don't
hear those with just or mainly here this
is the one of two cases the most
important
where as state as is illegally occupying
the territory territory of another
people this is one morocco in the
Western Sahara is the other other others
in the past right now these are the two
that makes ago Palestine is much more in
the center of ongoing events Western
Sahara is important but it doesn't
affect the global affairs the way Israel
Palestine mm-hmm a further reason is
that in the case of Israel Palestine
this is the longest occupation ever
probably the people of the nation is
basically being destroyed this is a rare
event in history mm-hmm the occupation
is totally illegal there's no question
about it case of Western Sahara maybe
you can argue but in this case but
Israel itself recognized that the that's
not this about anything done in the
occupied territories like building
houses angela is a crime they recognize
that back in 1967 and crucially this is
the u.s. from mmm-hmm that makes it very
important he was the most important
country in the world
whatever is real does is with the quite
decisive military economic diplomatic
and in fact ideological support of the
United States so it's a major event of
course it has plenty of repercussions in
the region and that's what you have the
transparent pinions that I described
mm-hmm and whatever opinion it is not
insignificant
maybe the Western press does more report
it but it's significant yeah so so I had
it in the news recently I think it was
with mr. Lieberman he was asked if the
settlements were illegal or not that is
a big dirty room yeah and I think he
said that was not really clear is each
one it was not really clear if it was
illegal or not clear
be an international law for one thing
Israel's own legal advisors including
its Attorney General recognized in 1967
explicitly an advisee Israeli government
that any transfer of populations to the
occupied territories would be in
violation of the Geneva Conventions core
international humanitarian law that have
been repeated Security Council
resolutions repeated that with regard to
Jerusalem it's doubly illegal for one
thing as expansion into the occupied
territories for another thing the
Security Council has had specific
Security Council resolutions on
annexation its quasi annexation of
Jerusalem affecting any modification of
the status of Jerusalem mm-hmm but that
was long enough ago so in the US on them
- that was a time when the US was part
of the world on this issue back in the
late 60s a World Court decision there is
a advisory opinion of the world for a
few years ago which concluded that any
settlement in the occupied territories
is in
the Geneva Convention that was
essentially an animus the US Justice had
a separate declaration but in his
separate declaration you agree that this
so I don't know how much more evidence
that could be that something to do with
evil that's everything okay so are you
seem to know all the facts about a lot
of different things you know it couldn't
be foreign policy do that how do you
keep it first of all you are you know
the latest facts and you know a lot of
them you know a lot of death as well are
you really
there's special tricks
