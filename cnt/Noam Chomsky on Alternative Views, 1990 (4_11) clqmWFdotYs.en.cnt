but before though I won't try to really
you know no no hope in a few minutes of
providing real evidence one way or
another let me just talk a little bit
about the the way you would deal with
this problem some methodological
questions first notice 3 comments 1 the
propaganda model has a certain prior
plausibility to it that is if you'd
simply accept uncontroversial free
market assumptions quite uncontroversial
assumptions about how society works
you're let almost automatically to the
propaganda model you can see that pretty
simply simply ask yourself what the
media are now notice here I'm talking
about what some might call the
agenda-setting media the media that set
the frame that others adapt to and
that's pretty narrow group it's
primarily the New York Times and The
Washington Post and the three television
channels and a couple of others it's not
much else those set the framework that
everyone else pretty well adapts to
within anything like the mainstream so
we're talking about the agenda-setting
media and ask yourself what they are
well what they are is very large
corporations in fact they're integrated
with often owned by even larger
conglomerates now like other businesses
they have a product that they sell to a
market the market is advertisers other
businesses and the product is audiences
the media don't finance themselves on
their audiences fact the audiences are
usually a loss more you subscribe the
more the newspaper loses money and of
course the television set you know they
might anything when you turn it on they
make their money from advertisers
advertising rates go up if you have a
the right kind of audience instantly a
relatively privileged audience raises
advertising rates so what the media are
just as an institution is major
corporations selling relatively
privileged audiences to other businesses
well what would you expect to come out
of such a system you expect to come out
something that reflects the interests of
the sellers the buyers and the product
wouldn't be very surprising in fact it
would be amazing if it were
true quite apart from that there are
many other things pressing in the same
direction there are after all centers of
power in society the state the corporate
sector others and they can impose
punishments for things go wrong and we
will offer rewards if things go right
you gain by adapting to them less costly
and so on furthermore the top managerial
positions in the media editors and
colonists and so on if you make it into
those positions you're part of the
privileged elite part of the very top in
fact though that's where your
associations are and your perceptions
and your friends and people you play
golf with and everything else and it
wouldn't be very surprising again if you
reflected the same interests and it goes
on if you think through we discuss this
in our book a lot but if you think
through it there are just many pressures
which lead immediately to the assumption
that the propaganda model is highly
plausible even without any evidence it's
at least it's got prior plausibility in
fact it would be rather surprising if it
weren't true on uncontroversial
assumptions that's point one point two
is it has a lot of elite advocacy that's
what I started with pointing out that it
represents a position that intellectual
elites have thought the media ought to
observe and the whole system of
education and so on ought to serve
that's the position since the 17th
century probably the dominant position
it's necessary to manufacture consent
for the general good because of the
stupidity the average man and so on we
have to put aside these Democratic
dogmatism so we have a position that has
prior plausibility and elite advocacy
and a third point is it's generally
accepted by the public there is very
striking that the debate over the media
is determined by the intellectuals and
they're the most indoctrinated sector of
the society and for them the only debate
is over whether the media are too
adversarial or not but there are polls
you ask the public what do you think
about the media and the public generally
thinks the media are too conformist and
to subordinate the power in other words
they automatically accept something like
the propaganda mom
so here we have three facts a position
that has prior plausibility a lead
advocacy and rather general public
support well that doesn't prove that
it's valid of course but it does suggest
that it ought to be part of the
discussion it's not part of the
discussion exactly as the model predicts
now by now turning to the factual matter
there are by now thousands of pages of
documentation detailed closed
documentation on the propaganda model
and it's been tested in just about every
conceivable way subjected to the
harshest tests we can think of I think
by now it's one of the best confirmed
theses of the social sciences if there's
any serious challenge to it I've never
seen it it's generally just ignore it or
else caricatured so what you have is
this very well confirmed thesis not
proven very well confirmed thesis no
serious challenge to it to my knowledge
it has prior plausibility the models
plausible and uncontroversial
assumptions advocated by elites
generally supported by the public but
it's not part of the discussion exactly
in accord with its predictions it's off
the agenda well the next task and the
interesting one would be to look at
actual details as I say there's plenty
of things you can look at in print
indeed thousands of pages and more
coming out and I'm not going to I almost
hesitate to give examples because
they're misleading any set of examples
will be misleading because I think its
predictions are essentially universally
confirmed with only statistical error so
giving examples this misleading because
you might argue plausibly that the
examples are not properly selected I'd
be a reasonable response and that's why
you have to look at a range of tests to
make sure they are properly selected
like let the people who think that the
media are adversarial pick their own
grounds that's the harshest test that
the model can face so let them pick the
grounds well they've picked their
grounds things like the coverage the Tet
Offensive and so on and it turns out
that everything you go to tet offensive
Watergate iran-contra hearings you take
a look at them they show precisely the
subservience of the press to establish
power
compare paired historical examples from
in history doesn't run controlled
experiments but it runs things that are
reasonably close for example you find
similar times and similar periods when
there you can find atrocities of roughly
the same scale carried out by official
enemies or by ourselves and our clients
and look at the comparative coverage or
good deeds like elections carried out by
our clients and our enemies and look at
the comparative coverage all of these
tests and in fact every other one I've
ever been able we've ever been able to
concoct leads to the same conclusion the
propaganda model is quite valid as a
very good first approximation to the way
the media function just to give a few
examples and I stress again they're
misleading because they're few takes a
the question of freedom of press that's
a picket because it's obviously a matter
that the press is naturally much
concerned about and in fact the press
has been very much concerned about
freedom of the press and the last deck
let's just keep to the last decade in
the last decade there's been plenty of
material in the press about freedom of
the press mainly in Latin America and
ask your friends to name one newspaper
in Latin America that has raised freedom
of press issues which newspaper in Latin
America has been suppressed unfairly by
a state and therefore we have to defend
it well you know 99 people out of 100
will name la prensa in Nicaragua and the
reason they will name it is because
there's been massive coverage of the
tribulations of La Prensa and Nicaragua
there was a study by in Harper's
Magazine by Francisco Goldman media
analyst who found that the New York
Times alone was giving something like
five references a month that's more than
one a week to the tribulations of La
Prensa and Nicaragua that's probably
more coverage than all freedom of the
press issues throughout the rest of the
world combined probably much more in
fact
well that's an interesting choice we can
take a look at it not not only coverage
but also enthusiastic support i mean the
for example in 1986 in june nineteen
eighty six there was a interesting
series of events the World Court
condemned the United States for its
unlawful use of force and violation of
treaties in its war against Nicaragua
and called upon the United States to
desist from these crimes Congress
responded to this by voting a hundred
million dollars in aid to increase to
accelerate the unlawful use of force the
Reagan administration announced that
this is for real this is a real war and
there was enthusiastic coverage that the
World Court decision was simply
dismissed as an annoying bit of nonsense
either ignore it or falsified but anyway
dismissed it's the court that was the
criminal not the United States the in
response to this virtual declaration of
war as the Reagan administration
described it the Nicaraguan government
suspended la prensa
