forty years ago you had the telly
televised debate on the Dutch TV with
Michel Foucault probably the most
influential contemporary French
intellectual you said that you had never
met anybody so amoral and indeed is
widely viewed as the main defender of
post-modernism and moral relativism but
what is wrong with that don't you see
that ethical norms vary widely across
space and time sleeping subjugation of
women repression of homosexuals have
been accepted in many cultures and still
are here it is a scandal to make
caricatures of the Holocaust but it is
considered admirable to make caricatures
of the Prophet in Han it's the other way
around
the terrorists of the Israelis are the
freedom fighters of the Palestinians
Muslims think that their halogen is
truly Universal and Christian things
likewise but for their religion while
secularists think secularism is the only
solution isn't truth itself including
scientific truth always the effect of
regimes of truth as Foucault call them
that are inextricably linked to power
isn't there something both parochial and
imperialist in asserting one's own value
system as being good to the universal
and good if there are truly objective
and universal moral norms how do you
discover and justify them moral
relativism it's a it's a little
difficult to discuss it's a little bit
like discussing skepticism there there
are no skeptics you can discuss it in a
philosophy seminar but no human being
can in fact be a skeptic they wouldn't
survive for two minutes if they were so
they're not and I think pretty much the
same is true of moral relativism there
are no moral relativists there are
people who profess it you can discuss it
abstractly but it it doesn't exist in
ordinary life and to sharpen the
discussion level you should recognize
that the concept moral
relativism ranges over quite a broad
spectrum so the form of moral relativism
which is totally uncontroversial of
course it's true
there are as quote this there are the
ethical norms that vary widely over
space and time and that's a stab
servation of fact nobody denies that
similarly every other aspect of humans
varies quite widely so for example human
visual systems that can vary quite
widely in the way they function
depending on early experience that it's
been shown by experiment enough with
humans but with other animals with
essentially the same visual system that
you can change you can change them
radically just by early experience every
biological system and I assume we're
biological organism so our moral values
and ethical systems are also biological
systems every one of them can vary quite
widely depending on experience that's
not controversial so for example the
human visual system can be varied
experimentally so that it will have
distant different distributions of
receptors that respond to horizontal and
vertical lines and that will give very
different perception you can show it
with cats and monkeys we have same
visual system on the other hand you
can't turn a human visual system into a
an insect visual system as you change
experience and this is quite general
across the biological domain including
moral systems there are there's a range
of options that's possible
this variation within that range but
there are also limits to the range and
in fact this takes us to the there's a
tendency to move from the
uncontroversial concept of moral
relativism to a concept that is in fact
incoherent and that's to say that moral
values can range
indefinitely that belief which is held
is literally incoherent it's based on
the assumption that moral values reflect
culture but then that raises the next
question how does a person acquire how
does a person acquire it's that his or
her culture you don't get it by taking a
pill you'd get your culture you acquire
your culture by observing a rather
limited number of behaviors and actions
and from those constructing somehow in
your mind the set of attitudes and
beliefs that constitute your culture but
that act is very much like learning a
language or like developing a visual
system or in fact like finding a
scientific theory it's a matter of
making a great leap from scattered data
to some outcome and that leap is made
essentially the same way by all
individuals a given relatively fixed
experience and it's only possible if you
have extensive built in innate structure
just as you can develop a human rather
than an insect visual system only if
it's guided by genetic instructions very
specific ones the same is true of
acquisition of language of acquisition
of arithmetic or capacity acquisition of
a culture hence acquisition of moral
values but that means that the most
extreme form of moral relativism is
actually committed to the belief in
universal values namely those that set
the frame in which this tremendous leap
from data scattered data to a complex
relatively fixed system can take place
that's why the extreme version of moral
relativism which is common and I think
Foucault professed it is simply
incoherent if you adopt that position
you are committed to
far-reaching universal values and their
existence those that just as if you are
studying the visual system and you
discover that it can vary over a wide
range you're nevertheless in fact by
that very fact that committed to the
belief that there are fixed innate
genetically determined constraints that
set the framework in which it can
develop and that sort of guide the
development of the structure even though
allowing a certain degree of variation
and in fact I think that the I won't
talk about post-modernism that's beyond
my capacity to discuss but just keep the
post-modernism which at least has the
merit of being incoherent I'm not sure
that post-modernism even reaches that
far but it reminds me of a famous
comment of a physicist Wolfgang Pauli
who apparently pretty acid person and
used to say sometimes when someone
proposed something that's not even false
you didn't get that far but the take
these examples a slavery subjugation of
women repression of homosexuals and
let's forget about a variety of cultures
just think about our own in our own
culture not that far back these were all
perfectly accepted dorms so it takes a
repression of homosexuals at one of the
greatest mathematicians of the 20th
century Alan Turing who also was a war
hero in Britain he's one of the people
who really saved Britain from the German
assault he was instrumental in
developing the techniques that did
decoded the German signal so the British
were able to determine where the Bombers
have gone ahead and so on and so forth
he was a killed by the British
government by a forced treatment to cure
his disease of homosexuality well it
wasn't that long ago I mean that wasn't
when I was a graduate
and you know doesn't seem very long ago
to me that's inconceivable now totally
inconceivable moral values have advanced
I would say that what it means is that
we have penetrated more deeply into our
own actual moral values and seen as the
moral sphere extends that some things
that were considered completely normal
and admirable are so atrocious you can't
even think about them and the same is
true of slavery subjugation of women has
very recently overcome one way to go yet
but changed dramatically in the last 30
40 years as I mentioned beginning just
with consciousness-raising groups that
brought women to recognize that what
they took to be normal and necessary and
even unacceptable is in fact completely
that should be totally rejected okay
that's same thing widening of the morals
here the same is true of slavery a
little bit earlier they're still our
slaves estimated thirty million or so in
the world but it's regarded as
reprehensible and totally unacceptable
and in fact if you look at the history
of overcoming of slavery in the West it
was substantially moral arguments
incidentally it's not that the slave
owners had no arguments they did and
it's worth attending to those arguments
in fact some of them really have never
been answered and the fact that they're
not answered gives us some insight it's
always in fact in general contrary to
the views of the extreme moral relevance
relativists moral disagreements can be
debated you don't just have to scream at
each other you can look at the arguments
try to find some common ground at work
from the common ground and try to reach
a conclusion that's immoral interchange
and it's often successful so it takes
slavery one of the arguments during the
american civil
or of the slave owners which is a
serious argument is that they argued
that they are more moral than northern
industrialists and for a very simple
reason they own their workers and
therefore they take care of them
that just as if you own a car you'll
take care of it
northern industrialists rent their
workers and they don't take care of them
they have no responsibility for them
just as if you rent a car you probably
won't take care of it so therefore
slavery is more moral than than a
capitalist industrial policy and
actually I think there's some merit to
that argument but instead of concluding
from it that save slavery is legitimate
that we should conclude what working
people in the north in the century and a
half ago we should draw their conclusion
was a very common belief among working
people in the United States that wage
labor is fundamentally no different from
slavery the only difference is its
temporary in fact that was such a
popular view that it was a slogan of the
Republican Party it was Abraham
Lincoln's view you could read it in the
New York Times it's taken a long time to
drive that understanding out of people's
heads and I don't think it's driven very
far
I think it's right below the surface and
it continually comes out it's like just
a comment on this idea about regimes of
truth I suspect we're going to agree
about this but I mean I think Fugo
Foucault wildly exaggerated again
there's a kind of a truism which is not
controversial that power systems have
some effect on the way the scientific
work proceeds and can be accepted and so
on sometimes it's at the extreme it's a
Stalinist biology okay that had an
effect
there's corporate influences on how drug
trials are conducted
that's true there are professional risk
constraints actually I've lived through
them in my entire life when I started my
own professional work I couldn't publish
because it was too inconsistent with
accept that ideas in fact the first book
I wrote in 1955 it didn't come out for
20 years and it came out then it was
submitted but rejected it came in out
later just as kind of like for
historical interest but then filled and
developed it grown so sure that happens
but it's marginal and there are
self-correcting procedures in the
sciences which worked pretty well not
perfectly but pretty well so there is an
element of you know power relations that
enter into say scientific work but to
talk about regimes of power it seems to
me radically overstating the case the
real question is whether you can regard
these differences within a framework of
progress in the sense that some cultures
are features of culture are better than
others I mean the real question of
cultural relativism is is one whether
you think progress implies as you said
an underline and an underlying innate
sense for instance a sense of justice or
whether these cultural choices are
wholly arbitrary with none being better
than it but I mean that's the real issue
it was cultural relativism but whatever
you believe about that there is a fixed
basis there must be a fixed basis
otherwise you can't acquire our culture
in the first place and that fixed basis
has to be determinative narrowly
determinative now that fixed basis gives
our actual human cult moral values now
if you take a look if you raise the
question about progress yeah I think
there is progress and I think it's
valuable to look at our own Street so
we're not talking about the imperialist
conquest our own history shows that
there is
moral progress and in fact the very
examples that were given strongly
Illustrated slavery subjugation of women
repression of homosexuals all of this
wasn't very common perfectly well
accepted in Western culture not very far
back in the case of say Tory it was 50
years ago it's now all regarded as
completely unacceptable
I think that's evidence you know it's
not in human discussing human affairs
you don't have proofs we don't
understand enough but I think this is
and there's much more like it is
evidence that somehow as our own history
culture develops we penetrate more
deeply into our actual real cultural and
normal normative values and we expand
the moral sphere to in fairly definite
ways these three examples are are good
illustrations of it they're plenty
language I would like to respond to that
because you see this is exactly what
you're expressing there is exactly the
point of view of the Enlightenment which
is so rejected nowadays in the name of
other cultures because if you speak of
polkas without a whole cultures and you
say this took a long time etcetera
etcetera and now we look at it as a
progress but when you encounter other
cultures that have not undergone these
so-called progress they will reply to
you that your progress is actually
regression let me give you an example
take almost sexuality suppose there is a
sacred book religious book that says
that this is a sin if you allow that sin
the community will be destroyed
partly because to allow that sin is to
allow for unholy Jews behavior and to
allow for skepticism and if skepticism
spreads than the religious culture is
going to be destroyed I have seen that
in my own country in my own life with
the Catholic culture now we are going to
yeah I know but suppose a Muslim doesn't
want to see their culture going the same
way the Catholic has in this country or
the Jews or some other sort of more
traditional community of the Catholics
whatever he remains of them I mean you
see what you say to them you say your
whole culture should go because I'm a
section should be free
in fact that I say the same thing in my
own culture it's it's a it's a sin in
Jewish culture yeah you know okay but
then thought it has been that it's sin
and Jewish culture I wouldn't have asked
some Nazi to come along and force force
it to be abandoned no but I think that
in the course of time in the course of
thinking through your own values these
things are overcome our own culture is a
good example homosexuality was
considered not a sin it was considered a
pathology a sickness okay and that's
recent we've come to understand it's not
a sickness and if I had the idea that it
was and that you should kill people as
you know these understandings universe
should be potentially universal just
like all cultures I think it even goes
potentially universal and I think the
good reason to believe it because even
if you're the most extreme moral
relativist you are presupposing
universal moral values and those can be
discovered in fact in recent years
there's even empirical work trying to
investigate them across culturally with
children and so on now it's basically a
scientific question and we know that
there's we have good reason to expect
that there's going to be an answer a
part of the reason is just almost logic
you can't acquire a culture without
having a rich in built-in array of
constraints that allow the leap from
scattered data to whatever it is that
you acquire and that's virtually logic
and I think a look at our own history
gives good illustrations for example
looking at just the very examples that
are given here it's been a long battle
but over time in fact last couple of
centuries there's been a very consistent
change and the change is not without
conflict but it's going in a particular
direction and I think you can even
understand the direction the direction
is towards that more tolerance of
variation and and more opposition
- coercion and control I think that's a
very definite tendency and I think it
suggests something pretty strong about
what our fundamental moral values are
