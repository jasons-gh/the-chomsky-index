all right so I'm going to change gears a
little bit again can you comment on the
contribution of research and statistical
neck natural language processing to
linguistics and that's it yes no
question I realized but okay one of the
early proponents of it may be the
earliest 1955 when I was working on
linguistic theory it seemed to me that
the only possible way in which a I say a
child could could identify words in
continuous text you know you're not
hearing single words when you live in
the world your earring continuous text
it seemed to me the only way that could
be done was by detecting transitional
probabilities of sounds or syllables if
you get to a word boundary the
predictability of the next sound is
lower than if you're inside a word right
for obvious reasons so if you check
these transitional probabilities it
looked as if you ought to be able to
detect words that's probably the first
proposal maybe the first proposed in the
literature it turns out not to be
accurate just in the last couple of
years there's been some careful really
careful work on statistical analysis of
texts Charles yang got his PhD at MIT
he's now a fan and computational
linguist cognitive scientist and he
showed that if you actually use this
technique on connected text that what
you get is syllables not words so that
doesn't work he also pointed out that if
you add the linguistic principle you do
get a better approximation to words the
linguistic principle is that a word of
well real words tend to have a stress
peak within them stress pitch peak
inside them so if you add that principle
and then you do the statistical analysis
you get a better approximation
there's subsequent work by number of
cognitive scientists which have shown
that if you add if you add what are
called the pros otic structure the whole
pitch stress structure of all sentence
you know what goes up and down really
reflecting phrases pretty much if you
look at the pitch structure if you add
all of that and then you do the
statistical analysis you get even better
approximation now this is one of the
very few cases where there's any results
from Cystic statistical analysis i'm
there there is there has been a there's
a kind of a industry and computational
cognitive science and computer science
trying to show that you can get
significant knowledge of a language by
statistical analysis of texts
antecedently that's extremely unlikely
to succeed you do not get discoveries in
the sciences by taking a huge amounts of
data throwing them into a computer and
doing statistical analysis of them I try
to think it through in history of the
sciences it just doesn't happen that's
not the way you understand things you
have to have theoretical insights you
have to know what kind of experiments to
carry out what kind of data are worth
looking at which kind you throw away and
so on that's the way the sciences have
always worked and if you want to say
study the laws of motion you could take
a huge number of videotapes of what's
happening outside the window and subject
them to statistical analysis and you
could get a pretty good prediction of
the next thing that's going to happen
outside the window actually a better
prediction or what the physics
department think is but it doesn't it's
not science it's a way of matching data
and maybe predicting some new data
but that's not what understanding it is
and it's very unlikely to work for
language either and I think the record
shows that it really fails totally I
could run through examples but every
example that's been carefully studied it
simply doesn't work for pretty much the
reasons that Charles yang and his
successors discovered you have to have
the you have to understand the
principles that determine what underlies
the system and then if you look around
the edges of those principles you can
find some sometimes useful just a little
data I think that's probably the way
it's going to continue but certainly is
the way it has so far
