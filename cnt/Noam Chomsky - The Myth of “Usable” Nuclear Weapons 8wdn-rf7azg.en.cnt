well it's it's really it's it's
particularly serious I think for
Americans who think that I mean who
become complacent about nuclear weapons
but think well probably the most
dangerous place where nuclear weapons my
abuses India Pakistan where there really
are two states that really are and war
that really hate each other that both
are nuclear States and what what is
important to point out is that is that
it's not isolated that a mere use of two
hundred nuclear weapons and in India and
Pakistan will produce a climate change
that will probably kill a billion people
in terms of the agriculture over the
course of a decade so there is no if
elope there's not even the local local
option you know you can't think about it
yeah and meanwhile the Trump
administration is escalating the threat
the so-called the low yield nuclear
weapons I mean you know people can think
about this you can't even imagine what's
in their minds I suppose you're the
opponent and somebody launches a missile
which you say has only low yield nuclear
weapons on it yeah how do they know no
they're gonna react with life but
massive violence are you've done the
idea of you of usable nuclear weapons is
a fallacy and it's unfortunately the
notion that if they're small enough
they're they're indistinguishable from
we have to overcome that but that's the
as far as I can see that's a myth that's
happening now and that's why the
Ellsberg book I think is important
because it points that people have
become complacent because we've had
seventy five years of not using them
against civilian populations but and it
took a look at the record yeah we've
come so close in control a wonderful
book about about how close we've come to
domestically and internationally to
animators it's nice is not going to last
forever I'm in their case if the case
we've come within a couple of minutes of
using them
