mr. Chomp see you began the briefing
mentioning your your opinion about the
administration's view of what's going on
in Iran what about your view of Iran's
aspirations the the government there the
regime if they end up with a nuclear
weapon how do you feel about that and
also if you could please comment on the
threats that Iran has made toward Israel
and and other boisterous remarks that
have come out of mr. hawk mamita Jones
well no sane person wants Iran to have
nuclear weapons and there are but just
quote one of Israel's leading military
historians Martin fun krefeld about a
year ago wrote that of course he doesn't
want Iran to get nuclear weapons but he
said after the invasion of Iraq if Iran
is not developing nuclear weapons they
are crazy the reason is because the
invasion of Iraq essentially was an
instruction to everyone any potential
target in the world that the US is going
to attack anyone it likes as long as
they're defenseless so it was an
instruction to develop a deterrent that
was pointed out by foreign policy
specialists by academic experts by
intelligence agencies and so on who
predicted that the invasion of Iraq
would lead to an escalation of the
threat of terror and proliferation for
obvious reasons which is exactly what
happened how to proceed well they're
good ways to proceed for example we
could take seriously a proposal of
Mohamed ElBaradei the head of the
International Atomic Energy Agency a
couple of years ago he made a very
sensible proposal which extends well
beyond the Iran case he proposed that
all production of weapons-grade material
enriched uranium that could be used for
weapons should be placed under
international supervision well you know
if something like that isn't done the
species is going to blow itself up free
production of
weapons-grade material is going to lead
to even accidental destruction so that's
a very sensible proposal well to my
knowledge tell me if you can think of
someone else there's only one country
that's accepted that proposal namely
Iran they said if such a proposal is
implemented fine they'll be willing to
get fissile materials from the
International Agency to use for nuclear
energy so that's one step that could be
taken a further step that could be taken
is to pursue the agreement that was made
between the European Union and Iran two
years ago there was an agreement reached
Iran agreed to temporarily suspend all
uranium enrichment while agreeing that
its legals their legal right everyone
agrees to that so they would said they
would suspend it if the European Union
would provide firm commitments on
security issues now security issues is a
term that everyone understands it means
the very credible us-israeli threats to
attack your n which incidentally are
gross violations of the UN Charter even
the threats so they said yeah they would
suspend if the European Union would
provide firm assurances on security
issues well they lived up to their part
of the bargain Iran but the European
Union didn't apparently under us
pressure they didn't take any steps
towards providing assurances well that
continued
no you well that's something else
actually those are mistranslated
statement on the terrible statements but
what you heard about you know Israel
must disappear from the world and so on
is it it's just a quotation from how
many years ago saying that in the course
of time Israel should be eliminated
actually we've heard at different
conferences in different moments in
which the NOC midi that job hasn't
indeed said these things so I'm a little
confused about that well you don't have
to be confused about you read them if
you really but doesn't ask you a couple
of questions which I still have not
responded to I have wondered so if the
Iranian regime ends up with a nuclear
weapon what does that mean in terms of
geopolitics and also what you sir think
about the threats that have been made to
another member state of the United
Nations will still have an answer that
question sir well I will and I'll
continue to answer it as I have been
doing there are if you don't want me to
go through it I won't go through it but
there are very sensible steps that can
be taken to prevent Iran from developing
a nuclear weapon if the US were
interested in that they know the steps
that can be taken they can follow the
proposal of Iran in may 2003 to discuss
all issues with the United States
including recognition of Israel
acceptance of the Arab League to state
proposal anything connected with nuclear
weapons security issues in the region
that's sensible step the u.s. refused
that was repeated again last january
thirtieth not the whole package but an
agreement proposal to suspend uranium
enrichment if the european union would
provide this assurances on security
issues now you're right that threats
against anyone including a member of the
united nations are serious but up by far
the most serious threats because they're
also credible are the threats by the
United States and Israel to attack Iran
those are extremely serious threats
they've been going on for years the US
continues to state condoleezza rice
only that there will be no security
assurances period that means the threat
of attack remains on the table that's
extremely serious much more serious than
quoting something that come any said
will happen in the future course of time
because it's a credible threat and in
fact the US is building up the threat
the US now has forces on all of Iran's
borders it's of course the by far the
overwhelming military power in the world
it's Israeli client has air and armored
forces that are larger and
technologically more advanced than any
NATO power outside the US and the last
year to the Bush administration has been
building up further by providing them
with a hundred roughly 100 advanced jet
bombers a very openly and publicly
advertised as capable of bombing Iran
and returning equipped with what are
called special weapons you can make your
own guess as to what that means they're
running into this for the years of
Iranian intelligence to make the worst
case so yes these are extremely credible
threats and they should be ended by
security assurances and by further steps
which I can outline if you like to
integrate I ran into the international
community and to put a cap on production
of fissile materials those are steps
towards ending the crisis suppose Iran
does get into clear weapon which the US
is driving them to do as fond krefeld
said they're virtually instructing them
to do it well you know that does is a
danger that means that Iran has a
deterrent to us attack and it's isn't
this note you know it's almost
inconceivable that your n would use a
nuclear weapon if they did they'd be
vaporized in thirty seconds if even
prepared to do it there is a remote
threat that they might leak nuclear
technology or weapons to others maybe
even at the scale of us ally Pakistan
though that
unlikely so yes it's nobody again nobody
wants Iran or anyone else to develop
nuclear weapons and sure nobody wants
threats against members of the United
Nations or anyone else particularly very
serious and very credible threats like
those of the US and Israel making
against Durant that's much more
significant than you know in the in the
end of days some country will disappear
