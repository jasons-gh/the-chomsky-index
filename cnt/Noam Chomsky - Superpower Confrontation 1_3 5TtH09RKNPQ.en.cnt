to be very great and it seems really to
to have deep roots in in the American
psyche what do you think the basis for
this is well from my perspective I think
it's in a kind of conditioned reflex
that's been building up in this country
ever since the Bolshevik Revolution in
Russia in 1917 1918 there may be some
legitimate reasons why people object to
communism but I think that the broad
kind of fear that we have in my view is
that is it as a conditioned reflex that
sort of covers up what our own country's
been up to during that period it seems
to me is pretty obvious that the
rationale of the American government for
pushing through more and more money to
buy weapons you know the influence on
Congress is that quote fear military
fear of the Soviet Union actually there
- as far as I can see there are two
forces in the world that are attempting
to carry out the in my view quite
ludicrous attempt to identify the Soviet
Union with communism one is the Soviet
leadership itself which is trying to
exploit the the positive image of the of
the egalitarian communist tradition for
their own benefit and the other is the
United States the American propaganda
system which is which also would like to
undermine that egalitarian vision by
associating it with Russian
totalitarianism but I don't think that
we should and you're right I mean this
leads to a situation in which the values
of the egalitarian socialist tradition
the libertarian egalitarian socialist
tradition are associated in the American
mind with the brutal and repressive
Soviet state which in my view has
nothing whatsoever to do with communism
or anything that no connection with it
and these things I think very much
should be dissociated so I wouldn't
think that I don't freaking Apple I
think the American people have very good
reason where everyone has good reason to
fear the Russian state which is a
violent and repressive and brutal
autocracy no I don't know that we should
spend our time trying to argue about the
definition I would agree
in a pure sense but I think in practical
political terms there still a seen as a
threat of Soviet Communism in terms of
American military informed yeah you're
right but I think we have to separate
out the various strands in that threat
it's perfectly true that the United
States or at least you know the American
leadership in the American ideological
system have been very strongly opposed
to what they call socialism but of
course they're opposed to many other
things too for example they're they've
often been opposed to fascism you know
we went to war with Thatcher States
there they were opposed to national
capitalism in Europe I mean they were
about there that the United States has
been opposed to democracy for example we
were opposed to democracy to a nudie
overt style regime in Guatemala and in
fact there's a general principle of
which the opposition to so-called
socialism is just one special case
namely the United States is opposed
naturally to any attempt on the part of
any society to use its resources for its
own purposes instead of to integrate
itself into what we call an open world
system which means a system that's open
to American economic penetration and
political control if any society
deviates from that whether it's
capitalist fascist communist you know
democratic or whatever the United States
will be opposed to it it's very handy to
use the quote Soviet threat or the
phrase communist threat to cover up the
efforts to protect American hegemony
everywhere in the world we got our we've
got some two thousand bases all around
the world the Russians have nothing like
that if you came down from Mars it would
be our country would be seen as the
expanding power but the American mindset
is just the opposite of that we see the
Soviet Union there the threat out there
and we're just minding our own business
we've brought up now a number of times
the question of life in the Soviet Union
repressive society various words have
been used to describe it is this a given
in other words are we all in agreement
that the Soviet Union is a very
repressive Society descent is totally
stifled its authoritarian totalitarian
absolutely no freedoms you know in that
society is that an accurate I don't
think it's it's
it's a very difficult kind of question
if you're an ordinary worker and you
know then then things may not be quite
so bad but if you try to go beyond that
and you run into a bureaucracy you'll
run into all kinds of constraints on
what you can do if you're prepared just
to be an ordinary John Doe or not cause
too many problems you may be alright
what because one of the things the
Russians do do which which is important
to them
is to say there are a different set of
rights in their country well it's
question of medical rights whether the
treatment is good or bad it has to be
judged differently but at least they
espouse that and they say full
employment now of course there are some
people who are unemployed if you're a
dissident you can be unemployed and then
there's no unemployment compensation
because by definition there's no
unemployment so what do you need
unemployment compensation for so for you
that can be bad so in those areas the
Russians indeed are kind of there's like
a social contract which says we'll take
care of your elemental economic needs
now we don't do that too well in this
country and and you know one of the
biggest strains that Russians keep
throwing up to me is how can such a rich
country like the United States tolerate
unemployment and that's a hard that's
not an easy question to answer if
there's an answer at all but when you go
beyond that I mean the Russian system is
a very strict one and you're not allowed
much deviation and if you if you want to
step out of line you're going to find
that it's you're subject to all kinds of
pressure possibly jailing it's not to
say that things are free in this country
but but in the Soviet Union there's much
much greater fear if you go to visit
somebody's home and they don't have
authorization before and you walk in you
don't talk because they're feared that
somebody will hear you speaking English
or Russian with an accent it's a very
frightening kind of thing so I mean that
that is a problem that exists and every
one of these criticisms have some
validity from my perspective the nuclear
arms race is just going to make matters
worse I mean I think there's there's
historical reason for the Soviet Union
to be fearful of the West there was as I
said earlier there was the
counter-revolution in the beginning
there was a whole period and we had the
atom bomb they didn't have it and they
felt they were being intimidated you
know a whole series of incidents where
there is this fear of the West and I
would say that there could perhaps be a
solidarity movement as in Poland in
Soviet Union in 15 years if we had
genuine coexistence in due time because
I imagine Soviet workers like polish
workers you know it sort of fed up with
the top-down stuff so I I don't know
that we need to argue in basically that
things are most Americans would not like
to live in the Soviet Union or maybe
you're a black teenager in Detroit out
of work you know it might look pretty
good to be in a place where there's no
unemployment then you can go to school
without joining the army and so forth
but be that as it may I would say that
that there what the problem we've run
into is the Soviet Union has been on the
defensive that the repression the
possibility of intervention along its
frontier all of that is aggravated by
the American initiatives inbuilt in
keeping the arms race going because it
seemed to me the initiative of the arms
race has come from the West from the
beginning and continues to come from the
West and mr. Reagan criticizes the
Soviet Union for all perhaps the good
reasons but his policies in my view are
almost calculated to reinforce and
aggravate and make the situation worse
well I think rust has made has
distinguished things properly that ought
to be distinguished on the one hand
there's the question of what kind of
society the Soviet Union is and I think
we would I doubt if either of us would
disagree in any serious way with what
Marshall just said you know it's a
highly repressive society which has a
kind of social contract that puts a
floor under certain kinds of suffering
okay that's the kind of society it is
separate question is what kind of a
threat it poses those are separate
tirely separate questions I mean you
could have the most brutal murderous
Society internally which just wouldn't
happen to be a threat out outside you
have the freest it's in fact it through
history there has been no correlation
between that I can detect between the
internal freedom of a society and its
violence and aggression abroad for
example England was the freest country
in the world in the 19th century and in
India it acted like the Nazis did you
know the United States is the in my view
the most open politically speaking for
getting social issues and so on it's the
most open and freest society in the
world and it also has the most brutal
record of violence and aggression in the
world now these things are just
uncorrelated now if you look at the
Soviet Union
it seems to me yes it is a repressive
and you know the scent is suppressed and
it's my view to dungeon
a dungeon with a certain degree of
social services now and it is also a
threat it's a threat to it to the
government it's a threat to its own
population it's a threat to in fact
anyone within its reach but its reach
doesn't happen to be very
