who killed at the old practice many many
sharp engineers expense yeah maybe I
didn't pick the best terms but what is
intended as a short sensation the social
factors have to do with the interaction
of people in communities okay
the real-world factors have to do with
the essence of things okay so what I
mean by real-world factors is what I
just mentioned in case of Putnam the
essence of things determines what the
word refers to so you take a word
Aristotle say what it really refers to
is the essential nature of the theme
Aristotle we may be wrong on all our
beliefs with room broom well that's the
problem
yeah that's the problem that arises with
artifact they in fact Kripke in his
discussion of his early discussion of
this and maintenance esse T he does
discuss artifacts and he discusses a
table I think and he says if this thing
is a table it is necessarily a table
that is it's the essence of this thing
to be a table an essential feature of it
that it is a table he does say that at
least collect ROM but it sort of comes
out of his way of looking at things
so artifacts also have an essence in my
opinion Aristotle had a better idea
there namely that you know that that
having a certain function is a factor
that enters into the meaning of things
or the nature of things as he put it
having a certain function enters into
the nature of thing like being a table
is one of the function
so that's thing and that enters into its
nature now if we take that view and we
divorce it from the metaphysics which
doesn't make any sense then we make it
epistemological we take the whole alien
view and transfer it up in the mind so
instead of you know the world being
divided into these various qualities and
so on we say well that's what our minds
are like and our minds impose that
structure in the world then it all
quickly makes sense it's perfectly true
I think that we characterize objects in
terms of their constitution their
function and so on and so forth
but that tells us nothing about the
essence of things I mean this thing is
what it is if we have to be using for a
table at the table somebody else uses a
bed it's a bit you know somebody else
uses a key it's a key there's an I mean
the effort if some Martian divides
things into the world on the basis of
whether they nailed to the floor or not
that's his categorization it's nailed to
the floor goes into one category it's
not no but before it goes to another
category then for the Martian this is
essentially something not nailed to the
floor and accidentally a table and if it
was nailed to the floor which shift
essences but of course you know what the
thing is doesn't depend on whether I'm
thinking about it or the Martians
thinking about it may change your go-to
fossil record well not the well you know
yeah they would so the externalist would
claim but I don't think so it seems
according that do you the essence would
change on the basis of social factors in
fact this has led to contemporary
contemporary philosophical essentialism
which is a big field that came out of
this is trying to find the essential
nature of things and in my opinion it's
constantly leading to paradox constantly
leading paradox like the idea that this
really is a table not a thing not nailed
to the floor because I'm looking at it
not a Martian how can that affect what
this is or take take a case from a
recent one of most recent articles I've
seen at least in the journal philosophy
by Joseph Pell mode
there's a very good young philosophy
that it's about a general philosophy
it's a couple of months ago
it's about essentialism you know it's a
big topic and he starts off by taking as
an example some mountain you know I
forget what it was
so whatever the mountain is he picked a
real one and he wants to sort of tease
out your intuitions about this and then
you know draw something big
philosophical conclusions uh and he he
argues of course that that mountain is
essentially a mountain it couldn't be
anything else and still be the same
thing they couldn't be anything other
than a mountain and still be the same
thing so I don't know about your
intuitions but mine are quite different
so here's this object you know on the
Earth's surface and he says that thing
that very thing must be amount because
it's a necessity it is a mountain sort
of follows from the general framework
please my intuition is that if you if
the water level rises up to this point
then this thing is an island not if it's
not a mountain and it's still the same
thing
now in fact islands are mountains it's
just that most of them is underwater or
if you if you dump earth around this
thing up to say you know a millimeter
away or something something less than is
perceptible but you leave little
miniscule space in there below the level
of perception then you haven't changed
the thing at least in my intuition it's
the same thing it was before but now
it's part of a plateau and so on for
many other things I mean I don't have
any of those information but my
intuitions are quite different so at
least if we're doing folk psychology
which is what we're supposed to be doing
it's essentially people are being
radically this way and there's nothing
here about the essence of thing I mean
it's what it is if I call it a mountain
it's because of its it's relationships
for me between you know its height and
other low thing but that doesn't make it
essentially a mountain that's a way of
viewing the world it's a way of viewing
the world which comes out of keep the
human mind which makes that thing now a
mountain but doesn't say anything about
its essence I don't think there are you
know there are no essence things are
just what they are I mean every property
is as essential as every other property
or as accidental as every other program
the the talk about essences I think is a
mistake that comes from taking our
mental categories and introducing them
into the world and they're not in the
world they're in our minds they're in
our ways of conceiving the world I think
in fact you know if you take Aristotle's
whole corpus and you rephrase it from
metaphysical to epistemological it makes
a lot of sense you know the levels of
reality and all this kind of stuff if
you forget the idea that those are the
constituents of nature and if you say
eliminate the idea that science proceeds
by moving up through the parts of nature
you know then you say well look that's
the way our minds work when we look at
things it makes a fair amount of sense
kind of it would sit well except the
victims stuff it's a little not quite I
think because victim Stein always says
he's stopping before explanation because
when I get an explanation of anything he
just wants to give enough of a
description and accurate enough
description so you don't enter into
error and this is going beyond into
explanation maybe you know right away
yeah I think it lies in fraud actually
you know yeah I think it's consistent
