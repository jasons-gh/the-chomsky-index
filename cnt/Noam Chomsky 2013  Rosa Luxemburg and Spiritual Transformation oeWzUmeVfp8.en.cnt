Oh
well I think her observation is
basically accurate I mean in a society
where people tend to be submissive and
subordinate don't question authority and
consider that it's their place in life
to follow orders they're if they carry
out something called a revolution it's
very likely to end up being another
version of the same society with
different leaders and so on maybe a you
know caudillo
dictator or whatever if there's going to
be a real revolution in social
institutions that has significance it's
going to have to be based on a different
conception of how people should relate
to one another or what it means to be
free and so on which you can call the
spiritual transformation I think often
happened in fact it's happened in our
lifetimes
not leading to revolutions but certainly
big changes and it takes a attitudes
towards women's rights it's not a
revolution but there's a very
significant difference from say 50 years
ago
animal rights same gay right environment
just it happens throughout human history
so sure I don't think there's any reason
to suppose we reach the limits or the
end
you
I took the slogan as you say from
Brazilian rural workers I used in a
slightly different sense than theirs but
not totally what they meant is look
we're living in a cage it's a very this
is during the dictatorship very harsh
circumstances the landowners and
military forces very violent either
extremely refreshed people so we're
living in a cage but there are things we
can do to explain expand the floor of
the cage that's what they were doing
when they were trying to form the rural
unions farmworkers unions and so on I
borrowed it in a slightly different
context it was in the context of
anarchist critiques of relying on state
power to improve pretend protect
circumstances of working people the poor
you know
vulnerable populations with children and
so on and my feeling is you should
support this and there are people who
think of themselves as principled
anarchists to say you shouldn't because
we're opposed to state power so the
analogy that I was trying to express was
that you know the cage is in kind of a
state the cage is the state and it is
repressive if I agree but outside that
cage there's a saber-toothed tiger
namely private capital which is wants to
get in there and tear you to shreds so
you need the cage and you can expand the
floor of it you can get more reforms and
this is quite concrete so things like
safety and health reforms or my
inspectors for mines we're horrible
accidents take place all the time or a
National Labor Relations Board
intervention to slightly improve the
conditions under which union elections
can take place or the social benefit
problem of pensions healthcare and so on
I think it's fair to regard that as kind
of expanding the were the floor of the
cage and I think it's the right thing to
do in fact if you look at the old
serious anarchist journals like say
freedom in London if a lot a large part
of each issue is devoted to expanding
the floor of the cage in this respect or
at least keeping it from contracting so
defending workers rights and so on and
as far as reform this is reformist but
as far as reform and revolution are
concerned I've never seen that as a
conflict in fact if it's going to be a
meaningful social revolution the one
that will have a positive outcome it's
pretty likely maybe almost certain that
it will be after the population has come
to understand a very large part of it
has come to recognize we've reached the
limits of reform there's no reason why
anybody should turn to revolution if
reform is still possible revolution is
the danger is ugly uncertain terrible
consequences possible if you can if the
mechanisms of the society still permit
expanding the floor of the cage then I
think you should do it and only when
resistance to reform is so strong that
you just can't go any further only then
and when that is recognized by people
will there be the basis for a revolution
that has some hope for the future so as
far as I can see the same state
different stages of the same process
