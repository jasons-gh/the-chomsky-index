all kind of authoritarian structures in
the world they all ought to be
challenged very few of them can resist
that challenge they survive mainly
because they not challenged they're not
really very strong they look strong but
there's a point that was made by David
Hume a couple hundred years ago with
it's worth bearing in mind he raised the
kind of paradox of power he said how
does power sustain itself he said if you
think about it power is always in the
hands of the people who are oppressed
it's in the hands of the governed
they really have power and it says it's
true of the most oppressive society what
we would call totalitarian society as of
the most free power is in the hands of
the governed
so how come they submit themselves to
the authority of others is it well
forces an element but he said the real
element opinion you have to control
their opinion of course he was in favor
of it you know he's a Tory so he says
well the what you have to do is make
sure you control the opinion of the
people meaning make them believe you
know make them saturate their minds with
ideology carry out where we call
propaganda didn't have the term in those
days and control their opinion and you
got them that means you you change their
aspirations you restrict their
aspirations to personal things to
commodities to break down the natural
bonds among people force them to forget
what they understand you know that they
basically want freedom and independence
and justice and so on everybody knows
every child understands that they have
to work really hard to drive it out of
their heads and if you can drive it out
of their heads and you control their
opinion then they'll submit you know and
they'll submit whether you're a brutal
state or more free society in fact it's
more important in the free societies in
the 20th century when it be you know in
Humes day there wasn't much difference
every society was absolute is but as the
societies differentiated over the years
with popular struggles and winning the
franchise and so on and so forth
the difference between the freer
societies and the
more you know totalitarian or command
societies became clearer and a point was
began to be understood that Hume didn't
talk about and that is that control of
opinion is much more important in the
free societies so like in say Soviet
Russia they really care much with people
thought a Franco Spain let's say fascist
state people read much more broadly and
widely than they do in the United States
I would like say that's true in fact you
know you could go to a Marxist bookstore
you know I mean if you got out of line
too much ok they send you to the torture
chamber in downtown Madrid but the since
there were techniques of control just by
force there was not much you know wasn't
much concern about what people thought
and sort of believe what you like will
beat you over the head with a bludgeon
you know when you get to the freer
societies there's a lot more concern
with what people think and that has been
understood that's part of the reason for
the rise of the public relations
industry in the United States public
relations industries propaganda agency
of business which was it's an American
creation you know it's created in the
early part of the century to try to as
they put it in to control people's minds
because that's you know I don't know if
they read human you know it's not a deep
point anybody can understand it without
reading you know they understood that
unless you control people's minds were
going to be in trouble
people's mind you know the what was
called in the business press the
greatest hazard facing industrialists is
the rising political power of the masses
I'm quoting I mean recognize that the
business press is very Marxist super
Marxist I mean all the values are
inverted you know but they believe in
class struggle they talk about the
masses you know and beating down the
masses and all that sort of thing in
fact business press reads kind of like
malice trapped little red books and
things just with all the values reversed
and they understood that you've got to
control people's opinion because as
human put it powers in the hands of the
governed if they ever realize it and if
they realize it and they try to
recognize what their own values are and
pursue them we're really going to be in
trouble because they're not going anyway
control people
