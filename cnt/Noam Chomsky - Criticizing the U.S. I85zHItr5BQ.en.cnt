I spoke to someone about you today and
he said the following to me someone who
many views you would recommend you would
what agree with some not he said me that
have to company in your mind the quality
of the mind and contributions you had
made he said that what you had done is
turned American exceptionalism on its
back and that your for all those who
believed in our conception you had
believed in exactly the opposite
whatever that is now let me stay with
this question well the other hand there
are people who have asked you look if
you have such strong feelings about how
wrongheaded American policy has been why
don't you leave the country of frequent
so the thing is thrown at people who
look critical frequently and you always
say I love this country
right I mean it's a very interesting
question let's let's try it in some
other country you know it's sometimes
easier to think about things clearly if
we let's go back to say our the big
enemy Soviet Union right I mean the
Russians would have been delighted to
have the dissidents leave the country if
soccer ever been Williams yes they would
have applauded it what does it make
sense to ask so why don't you leave it
the Soviet Union that question is
advancing that question the framing the
point that you've always said the
framework in which the country of any
question should be understood right it's
assuming that you can't have it then you
stay and fight for values because you
love the country and you think that the
country ought to live up to these values
now there are you don't you can't rank
country is a ABCD countries of all sorts
of properties there's a culture there's
a society there's modes of interaction
and so on a lot of the things that are
simply achievements now it takes a
protection of free speech it's unique in
the United States
there are a lot of great things that
have been achieved there are a lot of
rotten things that have been done if you
if you have any concern about the
country meaning its people its culture
and so on you want to save and extend
and amplify the achievements and modify
man you know free speech high up on that
list of area that's not the only one
okay but tell me more and then we'll
come to some of the criticisms because
that you have made about American
imperialism and the like see that's so
we have to make a distinction between
state power and a country the different
things I understand the different but
it's often not distinguished if you
criticize state policy
you're not criticizing it I understand
that too I mean we first unfrequently
when you're traveling around the world I
do you know people say I love you know
America I'm just happy with policy I
hate the policy and if and it's we're
responsible for the policy it's a free
country we can't say you know I don't
have any responsibility for the policy
because we do we may not know about it
but then we should find out about it and
if we decide we don't like it we should
change it in fact take a look at the
question we've just been discussing to
state settlement about two-thirds of the
American population supports the
international consensus on this and long
which has they ought to be a two-state
solution not roughly the ste 7 borders
and it's it's financially look the polls
I mean polls will you find roughly
two-thirds of the population saying yes
I support that and roughly the same
proportion says the US ought to become
more involved in the diplomacy people
don't know that that's contradiction the
reason that that policy has that program
has not been achieved is because of
consistent US intervention to prevent it
from being achieved and that continues
at this very moment in fact okay it is a
free country we've got a lot of freedom
that means we have people have the
opportunity to discover it's work you
know it's not going to come easily
that's where the internet is well they
have the opportunity to discover the
relevant facts and background which
should show them that their position is
contradictory they must come to
understand what the US government role
has been over the years in preventing
the outcome that they want
