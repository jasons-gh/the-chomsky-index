it's to try to block secular nationalism
and standard Imperial policy well you
know with that kind of a basis I don't
personally see a lot of reason to hope
but the more important point is it's not
our decision it's the decision of the
Afghans and the Pakistanis and there are
proposals from them as to what makes
sense like in Pakistan Pakistan has
pretty good constitution 1973
constitution which you know they could
implement it gives autonomy to Pakistan
it's kind of patched together from lots
of different groups the Balochistan that
they probably don't recognize Pakistan's
existence they Pro regarded as punjab or
something but the 1973 Constitution
gives reasonable degrees of autonomy to
the various groupings it could be a
basis for patching the country together
letting this very strong democratic
forces take over but not if we if we
keep supporting the military then you
know the ISI intelligence for civic
worse danger
as special envoy to Israel and that was
followed up by the Cairo speech I'm
wondering if you could comment it would
appear that the appointment of Mitchell
for many of us look like a hopeful thing
but it appears that it's all just become
rhetoric and that in fact things have
simply gone backwards and can you tie
that into the alliance that you saw that
developed in 1967 well actually the
appointment of Mitchell it was a very
good appointment Mitchell has a good
record he was George Bush's negotiator
that's not new and it's a good
appointment he has quite a good record
and a record of success in fact which
provides a model as to how to succeed he
was the negotiator who the main
negotiator who helped bring about the
fairly peaceful resolution of Northern
Ireland's kind of troubles and the what
happened was Britain had been responding
to Ira terror was pretty serious and
Britain responded to each act of terror
by extending its own violence which is a
gift of the IRA you know the extremists
in the IRA and it sort of cycled upwards
and finally in the late 90s the here
incidentally Clinton played a good role
to I to be honest I have to admit it and
Mitchell Mitchell was this or a point
man the British reversed policy they
started the pains to pay some attention
to the grievances that lay behind the
violence and that enabled the militant
elements in the IRA to mobilize support
and the grievances were a lot of more
legitimate they started paying attention
to them the violence declined I was in
Belfast a couple months ago in fact I
had been there for about 15 years it's
night and day you know it's not utopia
there's plenty of sectarian bitterness
and anger but it was a war zone the west
of I was there now you go anywhere so
peaceful okay that's the way you should
deal with the terror if you serious
about reducing it well okay Obama
appointed Mitchell this is a couple of
days after he took office late January
he gave a speech and it's worth reading
the speech worth reading it carefully
athletes Obama's only real speech on
Israel Palestine he appointed Mitchell's
at announced Mitchell's appointment he's
also always very forthcoming loves
everybody told the Arab states that
they're really doing a wonderful job he
said that there's a constructive
proposal on the table the peace proposal
of the Arab states and he said we ought
to build on that and in his amiable
fashion and then he gave his suggestions
he directed them to the Arab states he
said why you should live up to your
proposal and proceeded to normalize
relations with Israel well you know he's
an intelligent person he's literate I
presume he chooses his words carefully
it was perfectly well that that was not
the proposal of the Arab states the
proposal of the Arab states the primary
part of it was to reiterate and it goes
back to the mid 70s to reiterate their
support for the overwhelming
international consensus on a two-state
settlement only the u.s. blocks that
everyone supports Arab states Iran
europe for everybody mentioned so they
reiterated that and then they went on to
say well in the context of a two-state
settlement we should proceed to
normalize relations with Israel okay
Obama carefully cut out the heart of the
proposal and kept to the footnote
corollary I said yeah why don't you
normalize relations with Israel what
does that mean he was saying loud and
clear we're going to continue our
rejectionist stands okay right away a
couple days after the inauguration it
couldn't be clearer I mean everybody
wants to believe there's something
beautiful happening but I'm in the words
of the air and the action support the
words over the actions are what I
described briefly i mean he he
instructed israel that they should stop
settlement expansion it's not he knew
about that Bush said the same words you
know in fact it's in there he was just
quoting Obama was quoting from the
famous road map you know which is
supposed to lay out the path to peace
and it says in it 2003 Israel first step
should stop any expansion of settlements
including natural growth okay so Obama
repeated it very nice he didn't bother
saying and nobody accommodated bother
saying that Israel had reacted to the
roadmap instantly by formally accepting
it but adding 14 reservations which
completely eviscerated and the u.s.
supported that it's kind of interesting
that that reached the general public for
the first time in Jimmy Carter's book
peace not apartheid and that book you
know people went through it with a
fine-tooth comb to try to denounce
the Carter for this or that misplaced
comma or something I didn't see anybody
mentioned that the one new thing and
that he brought out in the book new for
the public was he included the 14
reservations which render the road map
inoperable nobody mentioned that so it's
another thing that was never mentioned
in all this look for errors in Carter's
book there's one glaring error which was
never mentioned and that had to do with
one of the the worst of the us-israeli
invasions 1982 in 1982 with complete us
backing Israel invaded Lebanon it killed
about 15 20 thousand people destroyed
much of southern Lebanon and Beirut and
so on all with us backing there was a
pretext the pretext was they had to
respond to the shelling of Galilee you
know PLO was shelling Galilee well it
was one problem with the pre Texas total
fabrication the border was totally quiet
north to south south to north Israel was
bombing Lebanon regularly killing plenty
of people in an effort to try to elicit
some kind of PLO response which would be
a pretext for the planned invasion the
most they could get was a couple of
symbolic yo nothing actually nothing
nobody even harm finally they didn't
have a pre Texas invaded outright but
that's the official line it's what you
get from Thomas Friedman you know
propaganda and so when a Carter repeated
it was an openly discussed in Israel at
the highest level that this is a war for
the West Bank the threat was PLO
negotiation offers which were
threatening to permit a diplomatic
settlement they want to end ads they
want to drive
the Aloha Lebanon I wasn't secret all
over the place you knew it right away
the Carter repeated it and nobody ever
thought that was an error well yeah
because that massive lie happens to be a
core part of our propaganda for
justifying our aggression and atrocities
well okay that's a that was obama speech
on Mitchell what about Cairo the Cairo
speech was you know polite I mean he
didn't insult the Arabs he said the
Muslims that we love you your friends we
can all be happy together it was there
any content there that look back and see
if he can find anything there other than
we love you and let's all do things
together actually on history there was
something that he did say on his trip to
Cairo there was a press conference and
he was asked what he are you going to
say anything about Mubarak's
authoritarian regime that's quite a
compliment incidentally he's one of
those brutal dictators in the Arab world
but they said he going to say anything
about his authoritarian regime and Obama
had an answer he said he said I don't
like to use labels for folks know when a
political figure uses the word folks get
ready the next thing that's they thought
about people okay but when they talk
about folks some huge monstrous at the Y
is going to come out so he says I don't
like to I don't like to use labels for
folks so I'm not going to call an
authoritarian in fact he's a force for
stability and for good now how can
anybody in the Muslim Arab world take
him seriously when he claims to be
concerned about human rights in Iran you
know right
this guy is one of the worst dictators
you know Iran is practically a paradise
and human rights terms as compared with
Saudi Arabia or main ally but somehow
people are supposed to believe that to
accept this and in the United States you
know they do but try to find something
else it's hard and if there's no reason
to expect anything different I mentioned
a little bit about Obama's record I mean
even before he came into office he was
lauding the fact that he had sponsored a
Senate resolution co-sponsored a Senate
resolution to ensure that Israel could
continue its attack on Lebanon and the
ceasefires would be rejected he's proud
of that what are you expecting to say
III don't see any woman yeah I I don't
think people of any right to be
disillusioned about Obama frankly there
was no basis for the illusions in the
first place
I promise noms assistant that I would
protect his voice I'm gonna strike force
prints but I want to thank all of you
for coming and please help me thank
you
