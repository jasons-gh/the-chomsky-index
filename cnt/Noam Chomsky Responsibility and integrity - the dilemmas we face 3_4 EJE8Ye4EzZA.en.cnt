her began with blundering efforts to do
good efforts to do good is tautological
the US government was carrying out it
out so his efforts to do good blundering
yeah it didn't work so it began with
blundering efforts to do good but by
1969 that's after the Tet Offensive it
had become clear that the war was a
mistake and that we could not achieve
our by definition noble objectives at a
cost acceptable to ourselves so it was
really a mistake that's the critical end
of a leap educated dissident opinion at
a time when seventy percent of the
population said no it's not a mistake
it's fundamentally wrong and immoral
those are phrases that don't appear in
educated discourse wrong in tomorrow may
be wrong because it didn't work but not
immoral and that's very typical take a
look at current debate about say Iraq
the outer limits of criticism within the
educated mainstream you have for example
Barack Obama who's very strongly praised
and honored for his principled
opposition to the war what was his
principled opposition he said it's a
strategic blunder we're not going to be
able to do it at a cost acceptable to
ourselves it's kind of like Nazi
generals after Stalingrad after
Stalingrad that I'm sure there was
criticism and the German General Staff
of Hitler's blunders that why fight a
two-front war when you should have
knocked out England first and then going
ahead so you have a strategic blunder
that we don't call that principle
criticism I don't have records from the
german general staff but we do have
records from the soviet union
if you read pravda in the mid-1980s
that's the way they describe the war in
Afghanistan it was a strategic blunder
should never have gotten into it again
we don't call that principle criticism
we don't honor and respect them for that
stand but when it's done on our side
that's exactly what we do well could go
on and on about this but this is this is
the task of the intellectuals
overwhelmingly and the task of they
fulfill focus on the crimes of enemies
the fate of the dissidents and Eastern
Europe suppress totally your own crimes
even if they're in comparably worse as
they were in at the same in the same
years in Latin America for example case
after cases like this and ensure that
uncomfortable information doesn't bother
the general public so takes a Holland
right now as you know I'm sure a couple
of days ago a trial ended in The Hague
the trial of Charles Taylor for terrible
crimes in Sierra Leone the case was
narrower than what the prosecutors
wanted the prosecutors who were one of
them's a distinguished law professor in
the United States the other well-known
barrister in London they wanted a much
broader case they had collected they
claimed massive evidence to implicate
Qaddafi in the crime he'd been massively
funding Taylor participating xand the
arms so they wanted to broaden the case
to include Qaddafi well the US and
Britain blocked it and the International
Criminal Court of course takes orders
from the Masters so they narrowed the
case and no mention of Gaddafi and
I don't read the Dutch press but you can
tell me how much reporting there was
about this I'll be willing to make a
wager that's happening right at this
minute and it's the normal pattern the
wrong kind of story must be marginalized
and kept from the eyes of the public and
meanwhile we focus on the terrible
crimes of others like Charles Taylor and
in Sierra Leone now it's pretty obvious
why they wanted to cut Qaddafi out he
was a foil friend and Ally so you don't
want to implicate him well now the story
has changed so you know we talked about
what we can do about this monster that's
again perfectly normal to take just one
last case in the 1970s Saddam Hussein
was an enemy that changed in the early
80s in fact in 1982 the Reagan
administration decided that they wanted
to provide arms to Iran to Iraq that to
assist in their invasion of Iran well as
a little impediment there's a an
institution called the terrorist list of
terror States and Iraq was on the list
of terrorist states so the government
had to remove Saddam from the list of
terror states and since there was a gap
that put somebody in so they would cubed
in honor of the fact that Cuba had been
the victim of really massive terrorism
and the preceding several years shooting
down an airliner killing 75 people
blowing up embassies all sorts of crimes
so they were put in on the terrorist
list to replace Saddam who came out the
next year in 1983 had Donald Rumsfeld
going to Baghdad shaking hands with his
friend Saddam etter into arms and other
deals this continued right through the
1980s us support for Iraq
so strong that Iraq was given a kind of
a gift that no other country has except
Israel they were permitted to attack a
u.s. ship and kill a couple of dozen
sailors and get away with it with it
nothing but a weak apology nobody can do
that except for Israel which did it in
1967 but that shows real love the u.s.
essentially entered the war the u.s.
also denied Saddam's atrocities that's
Halabja massacre the longfellow
massacres occurred everything denied in
fact the administration even intervened
in Congress to prevent them from issuing
a declaration of censure for these huge
atrocities the worst ones of Saddam's
rule and finally the u.s. entered the
war directly and central Iran
capitulated that couldn't face us
participation in the war love for Saddam
continued after the war in early in
1989's that's year after the war ended
the this the president was now President
Bush the first president Bush he invited
Iraqi nuclear engineers to the United
States for advanced weapons training in
nuclear weapons manufacturer that's 1989
a couple of months after that President
Bush sent a delegation to Iraq to convey
his greetings to his friend Saddam this
was april nineteen ninety the delegation
was led by Senator Robert dole with
Senate Majority Leader later Republican
presidential candidate other high-level
senators we have the transcript they
brought
Bush at present butchers greetings to
Saddam they assured Sonam that he could
ignore critical some critical comment he
was hearing in the American press that
we have this freedom of press business
so we can't figure out a way to shut him
up but you can ignore them and in fact
the the White House assured Saddam that
they would remove from The Voice of
America you know the official
international press service avoided
eliminate a reporter who was being too
critical of their friend this was april
nineteen ninety a couple of months later
Saddam committed a real crime he
disobeyed orders or maybe misunderstood
them it's not clear and he invaded quate
okay he suddenly became the
reincarnation of hitler said I'm
realized when he invaded Kuwait that
he'd made a mistake that he thought he
could it could be authorized he didn't
understand he saw right away is in
trouble and then the discourse in the
White House is interesting which would
also have in the White House they were
concerned Colin Powell head of the Joint
Chiefs said the problem is that Saddam
might withdraw and leave a puppet regime
behind and all the Arabs States would be
perfectly happy and we can't allow that
to happen so we have to go to war and
destroy Iraq well if Saddam had been
allowed to do that he would have
duplicated almost exactly what the US
had done a couple of months earlier
namely invaded Panama in order to kidnap
a thug who had also disobeyed orders
brought up the Florida where he was
tried for crimes that he committed while
he was on the CIA payroll installed a
puppet government about the only
difference is the Latin American States
weren't happy
they threw around panama out of the
collect the coalition of democratic
states and so on the deaths were also a
little different according Human Rights
Watch try the estimated when I said I'm
invaded quaid there were about 800
people killed according to Panamanian
human rights groups when the u.s.
invaded panama there about 3,000 killed
now we don't look at casualties that we
cause that's another thing that's off
the record so there's no Western
confirmation of these calculations but
they could very well be right the
American forces were bombing apartment
houses and poor neighborhoods and so on
well that's not exactly the story the
way it reaches us it's only the story
the way it happened all the way through
and that's again quite typical it's like
not mentioning the slightly embarrassed
in fact that the International Criminal
Court absolved the Qaddafi of the
atrocities for which they just condemned
a Taylor because he was a friend and an
ally like Saddam Hussein this story just
proliferate so far that it's almost
pointless to give examples it's hard to
think of an exception it's close to
uniform and that tells you something
very significant about the the role of
intellectuals and their responsibility
in the service of power both in
supporting atrocities and crimes and in
reshaping the current scene and
histories so that it looks good for us
you know for the powerful this may be
against the will of the public as in the
case of Vietnam but it ends up being the
picture that's transmitted to later
generations so that's what you read in
school and so on well
I said that the dreyfus Aras worthy
that's when the term intellectual became
into common use there were intellectuals
before the Dreyfus arch they weren't
called that called something else and it
goes back to the origins of recorded
history so you go back to say classical
Greece there was a man who was made to
drink the hemlock the death sentence
because it committed a crime he was
corrupting the youth of Athens by
challenging false gods and that's crime
so you riddim he was a dissident and
treated the way distance
