without further ado questions students
yes sir so I'm going to be traveling to
Lebanon hopefully this gen this January
to do some research but one of the
concerns I have is in the event of
foreign intervention in Syria do you
think that foreign intervention in Syria
is a serious risk and if so what would
be the fallout from that it's a serious
risk turkey one possibility is the
turkey may intervene just to carve out a
safe area in the North was feeling like
the idea of people fleeing into Turkey I
think Western intervention is the West
doesn't hear me in on the ground like
the u.s. just kills people from the air
they don't want to take a chance of
anybody cheating so if there's a Western
intervention would probably be bombing
drones things like that there could be a
substantial fallout it's a complex area
I mean this is the dominant political
force in Lebanon is Hezbollah which is
closely linked to serious serious the
source of your arms Duran they could
react to a
in many ways I think they did a lot of
things 11 and they could it could be an
effort to spread the the war across the
border you don't know how serious on the
back they would big army a military
intervention probably the worst thing
possible there's some of the people
really know Syria well and are very
critical of the Assad regime ever
written about this if you haven't read
it hit you might want to read Patrick
seal who's accompanying the story of
Syria has been around for a long time si
le and a very good British journalist
has worked a lot in the Middle East
Jonathan Steele ste LOL he has also been
writing about the dangers of the
military intervention and the need to
find some sort of a negotiated
settlement it's a very complex situation
the country split and military
intervention could lead to omit that
already is a civil war could exacerbate
and make it turn into something lucky
Iraq was like with you know Wow
sectarian warfare totally out of hand
you know where it's going to go and the
region is very inflammable all together
however I suspect that you'll be about a
safe in Beirut as you are in New York
about new policy you get erna pulled him
although I hear they're terrorists
evening at the equity
other questions yes in the back there
please speak up loudly you sir so he
couldn't hear ya I'll say he's asking
about the role music and literature and
effecting change global politics not
sure know how to do yeah that's always
the art forms of murals literature music
have always been parts of active social
movements certainly been through here
throughout my lifetime but way back
there's a slightly negative side to it
which was caught once in a you know time
there were seen a third generation was
great satirist named Tom Blair who he's
a songwriter he stopped right he was in
60s but you can pick up his records he
had once one song you made it remember
the work in which he said they win over
battles but we have all the best songs
yeah heart says there's that aspect but
it does it always invigorate social
movements it's a most i'll just say
something relevant the howard zinn you
know because of today's theme and the
reason for us being here being Howard
you know Howard was one had a real
appreciation for the role of the Arts in
social change he was very interested in
theater jakarta theater wrote plays if
you haven't got a chance to see any miss
play as the really terrific works but in
his own process of becoming conscious
and politicized and become
historian the people's history and he
became he really credits a kind of
decisive trying point being listening to
the music of Woody Guthrie and he heard
a song particular that Woody Guthrie
wrote about a massacre of striking coal
workers in Colorado in 1913 in Ludlow
and he had this moment of realizing that
he was learning about this labor
struggle to strike this repression
through a song why would he go through
but he had never heard about the
struggle in any of his courses in
history he had never read about in any
of the textbooks in the US history that
he was required to read and it was
really a moment when he began to
understand the difference between the
white history is taught in this country
and the actual histories that have been
excluded from the official history from
history from above and began in coming
interested in history as a profession
for himself and understanding that you
had to tell history a different way from
below and that an essential part of that
would be understanding cultural
expression song music theatre or the
arts and so I think that was one of the
remarkable things at Howard is he's
always weaving in throughout his work
references to novels to poetry to
saunter and it was certainly something
that sustained him throughout so much of
his own work in life seeing early plays
put on by the work Progress
Administration in New York at a time
when theater was actually accessible to
working-class people unlike today
although interestingly last weekend in
New York there was an occupy Broadway
action and people went to Broadway and
did public theater for free throughout
Saturday actually performances of of
great pieces of the theater and
monologues and other plays were
performed to try to reclaim that public
space which has become so commercialized
so private eyes or Broadway theater
tickets now or 150 200
tickets to the participation yeah so
yeah professional actors people like
Kathleen chalfont who was in the film
Howard's and I did the people speak was
part of that and that's another
interesting aspect of Occupy actually
the number of musicians who've gone down
and performed Tom Morello before me
Miley Cyrus remarkably releasing the
video in solidarity with occupy it so
it's when that dynamic starts happening
where the social movements are forming
popular music and popular music is
informing social movements it can be
very powerful all the way in the back
user
and that's why they ended up taking a
decision like that whether they had a
lot probably possibly guard against
making mistakes like this dear yeah I
heard of it first I don't know what
happened in that case but it could be a
perfectly honest decision I'm there have
been interconnections between toppers
square and the not only the Occupy
movements but also the Wisconsin
movement before it and trying to step
maybe that's not this isn't the best way
to establish the connection is probably
not given what the elections were but an
effort to try to make those
international connections to raise them
to the level of personal interchange
that's not a bad idea I think the way to
deal with decisions that you think are
faulty is through the General Assembly
discussions there's plenty of
opportunities for interaction is also a
you know that doesn't really have to be
consensus on these things different
groups can try different things of that
I agree that was not the wisest thing to
try because of the nature of the
elections but that may not have been
appreciated by the people who were
making a decision they may have I don't
know who they were
but they might have quite honestly felt
that this is a way to respond to the
gestures of solid Aryan sport that had
come from the Egyptian movie
um so bilingual education and foreign
language education is on a very steady
decline in our education system
especially in primary and secondary
schooling and I think a lot of that
comes from a lack of just knowledge of
what linguistics is so do you think it's
a good idea to introduce the study of
linguistics into maybe a secondary
education or even primary well I suspect
that the attack on bilingual education
is more part of the general
anti-immigrant hysteria and stop taking
our country away from us we don't want
to the nativist element that saying we
want to keep our old white culture don't
take it away as spreads out the things
like this you know whether it will want
to teach linguistics at the secondary
level is a separate question really I
don't think it will contribute in one
way or another to the issue of bilingual
education they're there things that can
be done that makes some sense in fact so
for example 11 teaching linguistics at
the school level can get students
interested in indigenous languages
indigenous cultures also the variety of
cultures that exist here which is
enormous New York City a very
multi-ethnic society and that's one way
to get into it another thing that could
be done jackie has been done with some
success is to use linguistics as a way
to introduce students to science like
when you went to eighth eighth grader
studies chemistry it's all kind of
arbitrary so you mix these two things
together and they turn
anything could have happened so this
happens and you memorize that on the
other hand you can use data that people
no children no namely their own language
there they have the data it's accessible
to them and a linguistics program that
introduces kids to scientific thinking
and rational argument and explanatory
theory making use of data that they
command where they can in fact invent
new cases you know they can invent their
own experiments because they have the
data that can be a very effective way to
introduce just crystal scientific
education but even just rational
thinking they're happening some programs
trying that that worked pretty well with
6 7th grade kids and I think that's
something that could be it's one of the
few ways in which you can introduce
basically scientific thinking or just
being reasonable about things figuring
out what an argument is what evidence is
how you test hypotheses and so on by
making use of data the turret eval it
doesn't have to look it up in a book you
know the guide on your head
un state had been dead and the u.s.
reaction to it well the you have to
recognize that they've been to the new
cook the way the negotiations are set up
the US and Europe unfortunately goes
along insists on a particular mode for
dealing with the problem the way this is
described here is that the Palestinians
insist on preconditions and Israel is
eager to proceed without preconditions
and the US wants them all to get around
the table and proceed without
preconditions like a lot of standard
doctrine them that's exactly the truth
is exactly the opposite of you if they
were honest negotiations going on
serious ones they would be run by some
neutral party some country that has some
respect in the world like maybe Brazil
or some country like that and there
would be two sides and negotiations on
the one side would be the United States
and Israel on the other side would be
the rest of the world because that's in
fact exactly what the conflict has been
for 35 years now the US and Israel
insist on strict preconditions one of
them is that the US must run the
negotiations well that's like saying
Israel must run the negotiations of
course that's not going to get anywhere
in fact the at the UN a couple of times
there have been efforts to try to have a
UN run negotiation process and that last
time that came up in the General
Assembly I think the boat was 144 to 244
in favor of it United States and Israel
against it so that's it the United
States is against something because
in fact it's out of history too you know
even learn about but the negotiation
that's what the negotiations would be
another precondition that the US and
Israel insist on is that settlements
must continue in the occupied
territories now there's a lot of talk
about expanding settlements but that's a
kind of a triviality the settlements
themselves are illegal there's no doubt
about that there's no debate about it
that every relevant international
Authority World Court the Security
Council anyone matters even the State of
Israel agrees that the settlements
themselves are illegal their violations
of the Geneva Conventions which is the
core of international humanitarian law
you can't transfer population into
occupied territory but if you insist
that the step settlements nah I stay but
continue to expand as a precondition
which is what the US and Israel do then
that again undermines further the
possibility of negotiations furthermore
Israel has already announced pretty
clearly that there are settled areas in
the occupied territories that they
intend to annex and the u.s. backs them
up on that so that's another
precondition and under those conditions
of course negotiations going to get and
over and the Palestinian Authority I
could ask whether the tactic was right
or not but they decided to see the good
break that log jam by going straight to
the United Nations well the u.s. made it
very clear the letter they'll never let
anything go on through the Security
Council there the US as oh he do and the
u.s. have been working overtime to
prevent it to prevent the issue from
coming up to the point where they'll
have to cast the veto because the veto
be very unpopular throughout most of the
world the u.s. standing in the world
already extremely low Obama himself is
by now practically a figure of ridicule
if in the Arab world I mean that he
succeeded he made a real achievement he
succeeded in a surpassing bush in
unpopularity that's quite a trick I
think Bush was eight percent he as you
get the five percent or something like
that so they don't want to cast the veto
so they're trying very hard to pressure
other countries and not to vote for it
in the Security Council I have to get
nine votes to go through and Wendy could
stop it and probably that will work but
if it goes to the General Assembly then
we'll be an overwhelming vote in favor
of it but at a general assembly vote has
no as in effect just like the book that
I mentioned 144 to has no effect you
already saw what happened when UNESCO
agreed to accept the Palestinians the us
immediately defunded UNESCO that's
twenty-five percent of their budget it's
not the first time incidentally dia 1984
of the u.s. pulled out of UNESCO
altogether because I had too much of a
third-world orientation and next year at
stop paying is UN dudes because what you
n wasn't enough under control but it's
ringing the
one thing that they're very worried
about both of them is that the
Palestinians might be accepted if the
Palestinian at General Assembly they can
there's no technical way in which a
general assembly vote could admit
Palestine as a state but they could give
them what's called enhanced observer
status sort of like the Vatican and that
would enable them to it would be an
opening at least to enter into other UN
organizations and one that is very
troublesome to the US and Israel II
talked about it publicly is they might
be admitted into the International
Criminal Court and if they are they can
bring charges against Israel for war
crimes the International Criminal Court
had the room in the statute on which
it's based does say that a violation of
the Geneva Conventions is a war crime
and there's no doubt in anyone's mind
that Israel's in gross violation of the
Geneva Conventions as it is reyel
doesn't accept ICC jurisdiction just
like the US doesn't but it would still
be a big propaganda step so that these
are the maneuverings claim kind of going
on in the background the u.s. is
determined to maintain control of the
diplomatic process which means to run
the negotiations which is a guarantee
that they will get in unless US policy
changes radically which would happen of
course
okay lots of hands way
could you tell us a little bit about the
day or even the moment when you really
solidify your theory on universal
grammar and how that felt it's still not
solidified you know this is science not
religion so every time a graduate
student work walks into your office you
may change your mind but the fact that's
what students are supposed to be for you
know they get new ideas so a lot is in
flux but there's some things that are
you know so obvious that it's it's kind
of embarrassing even to it's it's odd
that it's a debatable subject if you
think about it because there's something
that's obvious beyond discussion what's
obvious beyond discussion is that if say
my newborn infant si has a pet
chimpanzee or pet kitten or whatever you
like at songbirds and if they get
exactly the same experience from birth
the infant will instantly reflexively
carry out an operation which no one
understands it's sort of miraculous
somehow the infant selects out of the
environment the environment system ass
of noise but the infant selects out of
it information that's relevant to
language and no one knows that that's
done and none of the other pets can do
any of that like the chimpanzee has
essentially the same auditory system but
it can't do it and then the infant goes
on we're pretty much reflexively to it's
doing what you want
doing right now which is completely
impossible for any other organism well
you know either it's a miracle or
there's some genetic element that
determines this capacity well the name
for the genetic element is just
universal grammar so the existence of Z
of the genetic component shouldn't
really be debated it is debated but it's
just some confusion you know because
this nothing it's like questioning
whether we have a genetic element that
determines that we have a mammalian
visual system or an insect visual system
and it's not the nutrition and the coast
of the embryo that determines that at
something in the gene then the only the
question remains what what is it okay
that's a scientific question you can
have what kind of opinions about when
this became obvious I don't know
probably first time I started thinking
about language because it really is
obvious what's what's kind of
sociologically or maybe culturally
interesting is that it's considered
debatable it's considered the you know
kind of a strange hypothesis
yes you talk about your pregnancy occupy
poor people
well I think it's very exciting
development it's the first major popular
reaction in the United States there have
been some elsewhere to what has been a
global onslaught against the general
population for well over a generation
it's a lot of people are angry plenty
people are upset they don't like it in
the United States anger is an enormous a
hatred of institutions is enormous like
Congress support for Congress in single
digits the president not much higher
that people hate the banks they hate the
signs of state everything but this is
the first and they've been you know we
don't people here don't suffer the way
you do in a third world country but
you're suffering by the standards of
what ought to be true in the richest
most powerful country in history and
people feel that but that reacted okay
this is the first reaction it's for that
reason alone it significant and it's
been a very remarkably successful
reaction it's changed even if it were to
terminate tomorrow it's achieved
substantial successes so the things
being discussed now in the mainstream
which we're trying to suppress obvious
things like say the radical inequality
in the country the slogan 99 present one
percent is actually a little wrong it
should be more like ninety-nine point
nine percent
if you look at the radical inequality in
the country that's grown over the past
generation it's very heavily weighted by
the top one-tenth of 1% of the
population which has gotten just
spectacularly wealthy and with wealth
comes political power so that changes
legislation sets off a vicious cycle and
people are certainly suffering from that
and there's just an enormous chasm now
between what the public wants and what
policymakers pay do in Washington and
instead of the anger about that just
being unfocused let's ate everything
this is the first effort and
surprisingly successful when to try to
get people organized to do something
about it I think that's very exciting
and it's now spread to think about a
hundred countries and there are
independent developments in other
countries that have fed into it Spain
Greece Middle East so on so it's a
worldwide movement not for the gonna
totally from nothing of course but on a
different scale than anything that's
happened for generate for generations so
I think that's a really exciting
development is plenty of promise if
people can it's going to face real
difficulties serious difficulties
already kind and it's going to have to
change I mean it's been a brilliant and
successful tactic but you know tactics
have a kind of a half-life they start
having diminishing returns after a while
and you have to separate the tactic from
the principle and at some point if
turned other tactics and
I think that time is not far off the
other tactics are going to have to be
things like what Anthony was saying
bringing this to broader communities so
that the 99 percent can actually
participate and have their own inputs
into what ought to be done and those are
that means you know developing sustained
dedicated popular movements doesn't it
be a single when popular movements which
will be really be willing to devote
themselves to the long-term arduous
effort to reverse the processes that are
very harmful to the country in the world
and that just can't go on much longer
without real disaster
college
American solidarity minutes of the 1980s
which I know you participated in
original do you think they were
successful if you think there's like
lessons have been wrong that model of
what going to go on well for El Salvador
quotes the monkey was intervention their
lessons 80 there because the Central
America so there any movie yes well they
were pretty important they didn't
prevent what happened in Central
American 1980s was a complete disaster a
couple hundred thousand people were
murdered there's hundreds of thousands
of widows orphans the countries were
largely devastated to just begin in the
80s but really picked up them in fact a
lot of the immigration now illegal
immigration is still to this day
literally to this day is people fleeing
from the wreckage of the Reagan's
terrorist wars in El Salvador it's not
too well known but around eastern
Massachusetts for example there's a
pretty big Mayan community these are
people fleeing right to the present from
the Guatemalan Highlands with with its
virtual genocide in the 1980s against
the Mayan community and similar things
elsewhere Honduras is a special case
there that's the one country where the
United States did succeed in carrying
out a military coup military codes used
to be routine with the capacity to
implement them has reduced but in Obama
did manage a military coup in Honduras
didn't call it that but there was a
military coup over throughout the
elected president and Latin America and
even Europe
strongly opposed to it and the measures
against it Obama kind of and Clinton
kind of put out some nice rhetoric ended
up supporting and in fact the president
elected under the military regime was
just welcomed in Washington very
lavishly and so on Honduras is a
absolute wreck and as the worst homicide
rate and maybe in the world certainly in
Latin America there's tremendous
repression of activists is very violent
and repressive so some of the other
countries have changed somewhat
Guatemalan still a horror story but the
south despite all of this the Solidarity
movement did have effect could be a lot
worse I bad as it was putting a lot
worse I mean the forces that were
struggling against the dictatorships
mostly survived and some of them have
even gone forward in the political arena
so in El Salvador now the government is
based pretty much on a political group
that kind of grew out of the guerrillas
in Nicaragua still a something as the
president and not still open again to
break so there was some space for
survival and the Solidarity movements
shouldn't take credit with it they were
also very valuable here the act of these
solidarity movements have a kind of a
double function for one thing they do
help the victims
but they also helped civilized the
United States you'll learn about things
learn about the rest of the world you
learn about your own country so impetus
to change things in your country that
lead to actions like that and in many
ways that second ends up being the most
positive aspect of the Solidarity
movement it was a little bit like the
Peace Corps in that respect I don't know
how much the Peace Corps actually helps
people in the countries to which Peace
Corps volunteers go but it had a very
good effect on the United States now
this is a really insular country if
people don't know anything about the
outside world and you can see why I mean
it's you know you go from say Boston to
Los Angeles 3,000 miles and looks
exactly like where he came from same
mcdonalds same language saying music
whatever a little difference but not
much at most parts of the world say
Europe you go hundred miles or so you
different culture so it ends up being
very insolent also very rich you know
wins all its Wars and so on but getting
some understanding of what the rest of
the world is like and what we do to the
rest of the world that's very education
and people have worked in a village in
columbia or something they do get to see
part an aspect of the world that you
wouldn't know otherwise and they bring
it back and that's been helpful here and
I think that was true of the Solidarity
movements there one of the strains that
feeds into the Occupy movements that are
developing today they come from a lot of
sources but part of it is just the
International Solidarity we have time
for one more question and this one is
nice and mom please I was wondering what
your thoughts were on the build US
Senate recently passed which declares
the United States at battleground and
gives the military basically unchecked
power to do whatever they want to US
citizens so I was wondering what your
thoughts were and maybe how the citizens
mr. Magnus there's a lot of internet
chatter on that but I suggest some
caution I mean that the original bill
that was introduced was pretty bad but
there was a reaction to it even inside
Washington and it's been cut back the
final bill that was passed or that's
coming to vote pretty explicitly says
it's not going to change the law the law
is bad enough I'm the existing was
horrible and in fact it pretty much does
give the government authority to keep in
fact not pretty much it does give the
authority to the President to keep
people under preventive detention
indefinitely now it doesn't extend at
the moment to American citizens but
Obama's will already made it clear that
he has the right to murder American
citizens that was the killing of hola
key and
American citizen who happened to be
unfortunate up to the insane car with
that's murdering American citizens
because the president doesn't like it
that it was well beyond keeping them
under detention but it's true that up
until now the the logs doesn't
explicitly allow the President to keep
American citizens under preventive
detention preventive detention remember
is a very serious attack on the
fundamental conception of of modern law
I mean anglo-american law is based on a
principle of presumption of innocence
you're innocent until proven guilty in a
court of law well you know that's been
thrown to the wind for non-citizens for
people who are undocumented and it's now
spreading to citizen but this particular
bill I think doesn't deserve the
internet concern that was that it
elicited the concern should be real but
not on this bill rather on the whole
system of the violation of basic legal
principles moral and legal principles
that's just spreading before i right i
mean even the you know even the things
that don't arouse concern are shocking
elect for example of this suffer up in
one trial of the Guantanamo prison or
under under obama just take a look at
that one and tell you think what that
tells you about the country you can look
it up on
wikipedia it's a child named Omaha der
khadr it's the first case of a child
submitted to imprisonment law maybe in
American history but certainly for a
long time this is a fifteen-year-old kid
his crime was the accusation is that
when American soldiers invaded his
village in Afghanistan he picked up a
grenade to try to defend the village and
killed an American soldier that's the
crime okay that makes him a terrorist in
punishment for that crime he was sent to
first Bagram Air Base which is worse
than Guantanamo the end of Guantanamo he
spent eight years in you know what went
on was like I'll tell you he spent eight
years in these prisons you know no
lawyer nothing because as a 15 year old
child he tried to defend his village
from the attack by US soldiers after
eight years he was given a choice by the
Obama administration very benign the
choice was either plead guilty to the
charges or else get a what amounted to a
permanent life sentence in the torture
chamber so his lawyer convinced him to
plead guilty to these terrible charges
in return for that he got eight years
more in prison just take a look at the
reaction to that case and think what
that tells you was that tell you about
the country
to be able to even have a concept of
terrorists like this so if a child tries
to defend his village from an attack by
American soldiers is a terrorist and
therefore we can send him the torture
chamber for 8 for 16 years without a
whisper now he's not a citizen of course
but he's a human being and even in the
unlucky case they to the little extent
that first of all there wasn't much of a
fuss about it like if you look at the
new york times the next day it said
world celebrates death of muslim cleric
i wasn't death it was a murder and the
world certainly isn't celebrating it in
fact most of the world was horrified but
what they mean is privileged americans
in the new york times editorial board
they think it's great but and to the
extent that there was any criticism of
it there was some it was mostly because
it was an American citizen and maybe we
shouldn't hurt her American citizens
maybe we should just murder other people
but I think all of that is way more
important than the this particular bill
which was pared down so that it's worst
aspects don't seem to be in the final
bill there's a lot to be worried about
but not that one particularly I think
alright well those of you who have
questions that weren't addressed you'll
have a chance during the main event at
four o'clock in lecture center 100 be
sure to fill out one of the note cards
that will be passed around and join me
in thanking impressive top
