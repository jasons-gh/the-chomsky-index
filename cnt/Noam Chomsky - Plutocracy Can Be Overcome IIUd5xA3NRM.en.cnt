there's a major attack on democracy all
the way through but by now it's reached
the point which is pretty remarkable
when you take a look at me one of the
main topics in mainstream political
science you know not talking about
radicals mainstream political science is
comparing public attitudes with public
policy it's a fairly straightforward and
it's hard work but straightforward
effort we have the public policy so you
can see it there's extensive polling
quite reliable generally consistent its
results that gives you a good sense of
what public attitudes are the results of
this are published in the major books
and articles references if you like the
results are very straightforward about
70% of the population the lowest 70% on
the income scale are literally
disenfranchised their opinions have no
effect on policy their elected
representatives don't pay any attention
to it that's one of the reasons why many
of them don't bother voting they're not
going to pay attention to them anyway
may not read the technical literature
but you understand it in other ways as
you move up the income scale you again
they'll get a little more a little more
influence on policy when you get to the
top and the contrary to the Occupy
movement it's not 1% it's more like 1/10
of 1% when you get to the top where the
massive concentration of wealth is they
basically set policy thanks it's not
democracy that's plutocracy and that's
what we have accepted the good thing
about it is it's changeable it's not
controlled by force that we are very
free at night respect
thanks to victories over the century
it's not possible now for a corporation
to do what Andrew Carnegie the great
pacifist did in 1890 that gives a lot of
options and you have to make use
