hi I'm Parma and I has some questions
about democracy for the world's foremost
intellectual Noam Chomsky professor
Chomsky what do you think about the
circus element of today's politics if
you look at the sociological spectrum of
the people who don't vote in the United
States it's roughly the same as the
people in Europe who vote for one of the
social democratic or leg right policies
parties we don't have them you're the
only a business boys tom ferguson farm
political scientists just add analysis
in the 2014 election turns out to be
pretty much like about 1830 at a time
when voting was restricted to property
white males of the actual voting county
by can look so much like them so where's
the clownish miss come from the kind of
Trump phenomenon appeals to people like
this astral somebody's finally saying
something down with everyone we hate
everyone so this guy's going to get rid
of all okay and he does it look at fun
yeah Mike will win the election what do
you think that 2016 foretells for world
democracy 30 years of work whole
neoliberal policies basically assault on
populations of the world the impact is
pretty much the same everywhere
stagnation or decline for large part of
the population concentration of wealth
and very few hands undermining of
democratic participation a lack of
responsiveness of governments to
populations but there are two possible
reactions to this one would be to
organize and struggle and overcoming the
other is to feel is to be depressed and
angry and in fact I one of the striking
quite startling recent discoveries
probably saw was that in middle age
roughly 45 55 less educated white males
that sector the population mortality is
actually increasing that never happens
in the developed society who've always
wish them hmm but and it's a result
thing Alice a of depression drinking
from hopelessness and there's a huge
campaign to get people to blame this on
even more vulnerable people whom they
blame it on immigrants are on welfare
mother Kevin sheets and but not on the
people who were carrying it out it's
happening here tapping in England it's
happening in Europe and it's a part of
the reason for the lack of significant
responses that this period has been
correlated with a massive attack on the
kinds of organizations in which the
general the general population can get
together to form policies even to form
opinions you just don't do by yourself
when you're sitting alone watching
television so for example in Europe
group video with same phenomenon very
visible a lot of the problem traces back
to the undermining of popular democracy
by whom concentrating decisions and the
Brussels bureaucracy you they have the
northern banks that they move their
shoulders that's the main constituents
of you and it and you can see the its
led to the almost visceral fear of
democracy so example went in Greece
there was a suggestion that maybe that
people should be asked what they want
but their own choices about their faith
it led to it utterly savagery
promise the spectrum right here it takes
other forms of main form here is that
the population is just underrepresented
Lord majority of the population that
representatives don't pay attention that
have been kept their constituency is the
rich donors it shows up in abstention
which is very high and it's Carl its
class correlating it's roughly the parts
of the population that are in
represented anymore the commodity
culture is driving people to evaluate
their worth in their lives by the number
of commodities and of course this huge
amount of propaganda it's not just kind
of stuff we talked about manufacturing
content the main propaganda which we
didn't discuss much is the public
relations industry removing advertising
English absolutely hundreds of millions
of dollars just to try to turn people
into mindless confused irrational
consumers you have said that the
illusion of democracy has remained
profitable due to a propaganda machine
that manufactures consent with Bernie
Sanders Ron Paul and Elizabeth Warren or
other figures now sharing information on
network television that compromises the
propaganda machine do you think this
will render the illusion of freedom I'm
profitable so good yeah people can react
it as these circumstances in different
ways as I mentioned you go back to save
on more Germany what happened is the
center was collapsing the main political
establishment was collapsing it was
ferment on the moderate left labor
movement socialist communist parties
that was fair man on the right
could have gone the way in 1928 the
Nazis had about three percent of the
vote hmm 1932 about a third I'm lately
over the country we know what happened
so takes a builder rich country which is
no groaning under the threat of the
refugees the richest country in Africa
which could have led away the way to a
rich extensive development in Africa's
combo they had at the time of liberation
1960 they had a very effective young
leader the most promising young the
nationalist leader in Africa patrice
lumumba so what they do with the
Belgians murdered him they managed to
get to him before the CIA which was
under orders murder he was murdered his
body was cut to pieces and dissolved in
sulfuric acid oh we're not like Isis you
know me what happened then is the United
States and Belgium another supported
miserable brutal murder is cut the mania
completely destroyed the country now
it's the area where the most but the
worst atrocities in the world are going
on in eastern Congo partly so that you
can get minerals for your cell phone the
multinationals will so happens that such
people from that's all over the nitrogen
is people are fleeing what why they
think Europe one of the other direction
interest or take Central America right
where people fleeing from Central
America and they're fleeing from the
destruction caused by virtually genocide
will attacks in Guatemala destruction
and El Salvador what the main sources of
refugees nose on Duras which was always
very poor was turned into a real torture
chamber
military coup years ago which was
legitimized but nobody else so you have
people flames are we driving back and we
coerced Mexico into keeping them away
from our borders just as Europe was
trying to buy off turkey keep him away
from our learners so we generate the
refugees we wear one made a small number
of them come here and we asked the poor
countries to accept the results of air
barchi our trust me I'm in the bombing
of Libya alone Percival destroyed Libya
it undermined what could have been a
peaceful settlement the African Union
had pretty reasonable proposals for
settlement which Gaddafi agreed the
imperial powers US Britain or France is
regarded it decided the bomb ended up
destroying Libyans in the hands of
warring militias they're also setting
off a flood of weapons in June bodies
all over Africa well into the Middle
East the worst terrorist atrocities in
the world are in West Africa no arms and
the Japanese man you from Libya it's
also open a thumb for people to flow
into Europe from the countries that have
been devastated by European salts for
hundreds of years but that doesn't
matter to us all we want to do is keep
away from us because we want to be rich
right and then quiet liver happy lives
in peace
Wow thought-provoking if you enjoyed
this video check out my other videos
that Parma tricom go through so much
different fruits doing oh thank yous
gonna push the arc of history in the
right direction you so much per se after
this totally made me cry you said just
keep doing the radical work right crying
happens in the science
