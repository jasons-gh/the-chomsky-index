missing mass strikes in countries all
around the world in Europe places we
wouldn't expect it normally do you think
this is a revival with the left and the
west or if you think it's it's really
hard to tell i'm into certainly signs of
it and the United States to fact we had
a sit-down strike in the United States
not long ago which is a very militant
labor action sit-down strikes which were
again significant a significant level
and I think 30s were very threatening to
to management and ownership because of
sit-down strike is one step before
taking over the factory and having the
workers taken over the factory and
running it kicking out the managers and
probably doing a better job but that's
so that's a frightening idea and police
were called in and so on we've just had
one in the United States and the
Republic that it's hard to know don't
mean nope these things are just hard
over date they may take off they may
take on a broader scope or they may they
may be
a fizzle away or be diverted
