there's kind of a background to this if
you read the same authors than many
others they explained further that
there's good reason why we should be in
favor of American hegemony the reason is
that history has a natural course and
the United States represents the
realization of history's purpose so
they're quoting and therefore US
domination is kind of by logic
beneficial to the rest of the world if
you think is anything new about this you
haven't studied the right history
courses they're just repeating what was
said by leading British intellectuals
people like John Stuart Mill and others
at the peak when Britain enjoyed its day
and the Sun and the same is true if they
find the same among lesser aspirants for
the prize that standard whoever you are
the leading intellectuals explain that
you represent history's purpose and is
therefore beneficial if you rule the
world
