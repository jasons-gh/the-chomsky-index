I'm Lister Sinclaire on ideas
the 1988 CBC messy lectures about media
propaganda and democracy presented by
Noam Chomsky Institute professor in the
department's of linguistics and
philosophy at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology the messy
lectures with Noam Chomsky the issues
that I would like to discuss in these
lectures are rooted in the nature of
Western industrial societies in these
capitalist democracies there's a certain
tension perhaps even a contradiction
with regard to where power is located in
a democracy the people rule at least in
principle but decision-making power over
large areas of social life resides in
private hands and that has a major
spillover effect throughout the social
order one way to resolve the tension
would be to extend the democratic system
to investment organization of work and
so on that would be a major social
revolution which in my view at least
would realize some of the libertarian
principles on which the political
revolutions of the 18th century were
partially founded or the tension could
be resolved and sometimes is by
eliminating public interference with
state and private power in the advanced
industrial societies the problem is
typically approached by more moderate
means by measures to deprive democratic
political structures of substantive
content while leaving them formerly
intact a large part of this task is
assumed by ideological institutions they
have the job of channeling thought and
attitudes within acceptable bounds
deflecting any potential challenge to
establish privilege and authority before
it can take form and gather strength
this enterprise has many facets and
agents here I'm going to be primarily
concerned with one aspect thought
control as conducted through the agency
of the national media and related
elements of the elite intellectual
culture I'll be speaking primarily of
the United States which I know best but
I think that the comments generalize
reasonably well
to other industrial societies as well in
my opinion there's much too little
inquiry into these matters my feeling is
that citizens of the democratic
societies should undertake a course of
what we might call intellectual self
defense to protect themselves from
manipulation and control and to lay the
basis for more meaningful democracy it's
this concern that motivates my comments
here on ideas the 1988 Massey lectures
about media propaganda and democracy a
series of five talks one each night this
week
divided into 16 sections including
questions from a panel of distinguished
Canadian journalists the messy lectures
are an annual event on CBC radio they
began in 1961 and have featured leading
figures in literature and politics
religion and the arts including Northrop
Frye Jane Jacobs Carlos Fuentes Paul
Goodman Claude levi-strauss CB McPherson
Martin Luther King jr. and Doris Lessing
the 1988 Massey lectures are given by
Noam Chomsky Institute professor in the
department's of philosophy linguistics
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Boston professor Chomsky
is an internationally renowned scholar
the leading theorist in the field of
structural linguistics and the author of
some 30 books both technical books in
the field of linguistics and books
addressed to a general audience which
examined political issue is focusing
especially on the place of the United
States and international affairs he is
particularly concerned with what
Americans find out through their mass
media more properly called and professor
Chomsky is view the elite media his
approach to this question involves a
massive amount of research his books are
noted for the mountain of data they
contain and September 1988 his latest
book co-authored with Professor Edward
Herrmann was published by pantheon
it's called manufacturing consent some
of the raw material for the conclusions
he draws in these messy lectures can be
in that book which is in bookstores and
libraries now throughout his work
professor Chomsky has based his
conclusions on a closer analysis of
specific cases but his real interest is
in the larger issues that the specific
cases point to what are the enduring
institutional characteristics of our
media system the system we call the Free
Press and how do those characteristics
affect what we think we know a half
century ago John Dewey observed that
criticism of specific abuses has only
limited value the only really
fundamental approach to the problem
Dewey said is to inquire concerning the
necessary effect of the present economic
system upon the whole system of what he
called publicity upon the judgment of
what news is upon the selection and
elimination of matter that is published
upon the treatment of news in both news
and editorial columns the question under
this mode of approach is not how many
specific abuses there are and how they
may be remedied but how far genuine
intellectual freedom and social
responsibility are possible on any large
scale under the existing economic regime
the philosopher and theologian Reinhold
Niebuhr concluded that ordinary people
were hardly capable of understanding the
world or drawing reasonable conclusions
without being subjected to a set of what
he called necessary illusions what we'd
call propaganda constructed by the
intellectual elites the system for
managing this has turned out to be the
mass media the title of the 1988 messy
lectures is necessary illusions
Noam Chomsky let me begin with a report
in a church based latin american journal
date lined san paulo brazil the headline
reads brazilian bishops support plan to
democratize me
the report describes a proposal which is
now being debated in the Brazilian
Constituent Assembly that would open up
Brazil's powerful and highly
concentrated media to citizen
participation
Brazil's Catholic Bishops are among the
principal advocates of this legislative
proposal to democratize the country's
communications media the report points
out that Brazilian TV is in the hands of
five big networks while eight huge
multinational corporations and some
state enterprises account for most
communications advertising the current
proposal calls for a national
communications council that would be
made up of civilian and government
representatives and would develop a
Democratic communications policy the
questions raised by the Brazilian
Bishops are being seriously discussed in
many parts of the world there are
projects underway in several Latin
American countries and elsewhere as well
there has been discussion of what's been
called a new world information order the
idea is to diversify media access to
encourage alternatives to the global
media system which is under the
overwhelming dominance of the Western
industrial powers a an inquiry into such
possibilities by UNESCO elicited an
extremely hostile reaction in the United
States and contributed to the near
demise of the organization the alleged
concern was freedom of the press one
question I'd like to raise in these
lectures is just how serious this
concern is and what in fact it comes to
what's its substantive content further
questions that lie in the background
have to do with what a democratic
communications policy would be and
whether it's a good idea and if so
whether it's an attainable concept and
more generally just what kind of
democratic order is it to which we
aspire the concept of democratizing the
media has no real meaning within the
terms of political discourse in the
United States in fact the phrase has a
paradoxical or even vaguely subversive
ring to it citizen participation would
be considered an infringement on freedom
of the press it would be considered a
blow struck against the independence of
the media that would distort the mission
that they have undertaken to inform the
public without fear or favor and that
reaction merits and thought underlying
it our beliefs as to how the media do
function and also as to how they should
function within our democratic systems
there are also certain implicit
conceptions of the nature of democracy
let's have a look at these topics in
turn the standard image of media
performance was expressed by Judge
Gurfein in a decision in which he
rejected efforts by the US government to
borrow publication of the Pentagon
Papers in that decision he said that we
have a cantankerous press an obstinate
press a ubiquitous press and it must be
suffered by those in authority in order
to preserve the even greater values of
freedom of expression and the right of
the people to know columnist Anthony
Lewis of the New York Times commented on
this decision and pointed out that the
media were not always as independent
vigilant and defiant of authority as
they are today but he says in the
Vietnam and Watergate eras the media
learned to exercise the power to root
about in our national life exposing what
they deem right for exposure without
regard to external pressures that too is
a commonly held belief there has been
much debate about the media during this
period but it does not deal with the
problem of democratizing the media and
freeing them from the constraints of
state and private power rather the issue
that is debated is whether the media
have not exceeded proper bounds and
escaping such constraints the question
is whether they have perhaps even
threatened the existence of democratic
institutions in their contentious and
irresponsible defiance of Authority
there was an important study on these
topics by the Trilateral Commission in
1975
it was a study on what they call
governability of democracies and the
Commission which is made up of elite
elements from Japan the United States
and Europe the Commission concluded that
the media have become a notable new
source of national power this they said
is one aspect of an excess of democracy
that contributes to the reduction of
governmental authority at home and a
consequent decline in the influence of
democracy abroad this general crisis of
democracy the Commission held results
from the efforts of previously
marginalized sectors of the population
to organize and oppress their demands by
doing so they create an overload that
prevents the democratic process from
functioning properly the American
commentator Samuel Huntington a
professor at Harvard University pointed
out that in earlier times
President Truman had been able to govern
the country with the cooperation of a
relatively small number of Wall Street
lawyers and bankers in this period then
there was no crisis of democracy but in
the 1960s the crisis developed and
reached serious proportions the
Trilateral Commission study therefore
urges more moderation and democracy to
mitigate what they call the excess of
democracy and thus overcome the crisis
putting it in plain terms the general
public must be reduced to their
traditional apathy and obedience and
driven from the arena of political
debate and action if democracy is to
survive this study reflects the
perceptions and values of liberal elites
from the United States Europe and Japan
it includes the leading figures of the
Carter Administration President Carter
himself in fact on the right the
perception is that democracy is
threatened by the organizing efforts of
those groups that are called the special
interests that's an interesting concept
of contemporary political rhetoric it
refers to workers farmers women youth
the elderly the handicapped ethnic
minorities and
fact to the general population in the
u.s. presidential campaigns of the 1980s
the Democrats were accused of being the
instrument of these special interests
and therefore undermining the national
interest
what is the national interest well the
tacit assumption is that the national
interest is represented by the one
notable sector that was omitted from the
list of special interests corporations
financial institutions and other
business elites they represent the
national interest the charge that the
Democrats represent the special
interests has little merit rather they
represent other elements of the national
interest and they participated with few
qualms in the so-called right turn of
the post-vietnam era among elite groups
this right turn had a number of
different aspects it included the
dismantling of the limited state
programs that were designed to protect
the poor and deprived the transfer of
resources to the wealthy the conversion
of the state even more than before into
a welfare state for the privileged and
the expansion of state power and the
protected state sector of the economy
through the military system the military
system domestically in the United States
is in fact a device for compelling the
public to subsidize high technology
industry and to provide a state
guaranteed market for high-technology
waste production a related element of
the right-turn was a more activist
foreign policy the goal was to extend
u.s. power through subversion
international terrorism and aggression
what's called the Reagan doctrine which
the media characterized as the vigorous
defense of democracy worldwide in
general the Democratic opposition
offered qualified support to these
programs of the Reagan administration
and the fact of the matter is that they
were largely an extrapolation of
initiatives of the Carter years and with
very few exceptions were strongly
opposed by the general population and
that's a fact that very clearly shown by
polling results during this period one
should not be misled by
Regan's landslide electoral victories in
fact Reagan won the votes of under a
third of the electorate and of the
voters a clear majority hoped that his
legislative programs would not be
enacted meanwhile half the population
continued to hold that the government is
run by a few big interests looking out
for themselves as polls regularly show
the Reagan phenomenon in fact may offer
a kind of foretaste of where capitalist
democracies are moving in general with a
number of crucial features the
elimination of labor unions of
independent media of political
associations and more generally the
elimination of forms of popular
organization that interfere with
domination of the state by concentrated
private power
well let's return to the media which are
charged with having fan the ominous
flames of excess of democracy the
Trilateral Commission concludes I'm now
quoting them that broader interests of
society and government require that if
journalists do not impose standards of
professionalism upon themselves then the
alternative could well be regulation by
the government to the end of restoring a
balance between government and media
others have had similar concerns the
executive director of Freedom House
Leonard Sussman asks the question must
free institutions be overthrown because
of the very freedom they sustain he too
is referring to the allegedly
adversarial behavior of the media John
Roach who's the intellectual and
residence during the Johnson
administration he answers Sussman's
question by calling for congressional
investigation of the workings of these
private governments who he claims
distorted the record so grossly in their
anti Johnson mission however he fears
that Congress is too terrified of the
media to undertake this urgent tasks
both Sussman and Roach are commenting on
a two-volume study of media coverage of
the Tet Offensive of 1968 sponsored by
Freedom House
written by Peter Bray stroke journalist
this study has been widely hailed as a
landmark contribution John Roach
described it as one of the major pieces
of investigative reporting and
first-rate scholarship of the past
quarter century he calls it a meticulous
case study of media incompetence if not
malevolence this classic of modern
scholarship is alleged to have
demonstrated that in their incompetent
and biased coverage reflecting the
adversary culture of the 60s the media
lost the war in Vietnam they therefore
harmed the cause of democracy and
freedom for which the United States
fought in vain this freedom house study
concludes that these failures reflect
the more volatile journalistic style
that has become so popular since the
late 1960s and they go on to say that it
is accompanied with an often mindless
readiness to seek out conflict to
believe the worst of the government or
of authority in general and on that
basis to divide up the actors on any
issue into the good in the bed where the
bad actors include the US forces in
Vietnam the military-industrial complex
the CIA and the US government generally
and the good in the eyes of the media
are presumably the Communists who were
consistently over praised and protected
so the Freedom House study claims there
is in fact us striking an interesting
aspect of the reporting of the Tet
Offensive up until the Tet Offensive the
media had typically reported the war as
the American command wanted them to see
it
journalists were taken on guided tours
there were very few that did anything
different from that and they presented
the war as perceived under the control
of the American military but during the
Tet Offensive that didn't work the war
was all around them they could look out
the windows of their hotels and see
fighting and they saw that it was a very
different war than the one that they had
been programmed to present in that
respect coverage of the Tet Offensive
was different but only in that respect
it's by now an established truth that
it's almost inescapable that such broad
coverage will undermine
worked for the war effort particularly
the often glory pictorial reportage by
television I'm now quoting from Landrum
balling who's speaking in a conference
that he directed on the media the
conference was devoted to the question
of whether there is indeed no way to
affect some kind of balance between the
advantages a totalitarian government
enjoys because of its ability to control
or blackout unfavorable news in warfare
and the disadvantages for the free
society of allowing open coverage of all
the wartime events the Watergate affair
in which investigative reporting helped
force the president from office as
Anthony Lewis points out that reinforced
these dire images of impending
destruction of democracy by the
freewheeling independent and adversarial
media the iran-contra scandal
contributed to these images two kinds of
questions arise in connection with these
vigorous debates about the media and
democracy the first are questions of
fact the second are questions of value
the basic question of fact is whether
the media have indeed adopted an
adversarial stance perhaps with
excessive zeal whether in particular
they undermine the defense of freedom in
wartime and threaten free institutions
by flagellating ourselves and those in
power if that turns out to be true as a
matter of fact we may then ask a further
question would it be proper to impose
some external constraints to ensure that
the media keep to the bounds of
responsibility now the question of fact
which is of course fundamental is rarely
argued the case is assumed to have been
proven there are some however who have
argued that the factual premises are
simply false let's begin with the
broadest claims let's have a look at the
functioning of the so-called free market
of ideas there's an interesting study by
Benjamin Ginsberg of the mobilisation of
popular opinion to promote state power
and after reviewing many features of
this he concludes that now
quoting Ginsberg he concludes that the
marketplace of ideas built during the
19th and 20th centuries effectively
disseminates the beliefs and ideas of
the upper classes while subverting the
ideological and cultural independence of
the lower classes through the
construction of this marketplace Western
governments forged firm and enduring
links between socio-economic position
and ideological power they've therefore
permitted upper classes to use each to
buttress the other in the United States
in particular the ability of the upper
and middle classes to dominate the
marketplace of ideas has generally
allowed the strata to shape the entire
society's perception of political
reality and the range of realistic
political and social possibilities while
Westerners usually equate the
marketplace with freedom of opinion the
hidden hand of the market can be almost
as potent and instrument of control as
the iron fist of the state now these
conclusions have some initial
plausibility unguided free market
assumptions that are not particularly
controversial segments of the media that
can reach a substantial audience are
major corporations closely integrated
with even larger conglomerates like
other businesses they sell a product to
buyers the market to which they sell is
advertisers and the product is audiences
with a bias towards more wealthy
audiences which improve advertising
rates so in effect the media are major
corporations selling privileged
audiences to other businesses it would
hardly come as a surprise if the picture
of the world they present were to
reflect the perspectives and the
interests of the sellers the buyers and
the product furthermore those who occupy
managerial positions in the media or
gain status within them as commentators
belong to the same privileged elites and
it would be reasonable to expect that
they would share the perceptions
aspirations and attitudes of their
associates these reflect their own class
interests as well journalists entering
the system are unlikely to make their
way unless they conform to these
ideological pressure
generally they conform by internalizing
the values it's not easy to say one
thing and believe another and those who
fail to conform will tend to be weeded
out by familiar mechanisms there are
many other factors that induce the media
to conform to the requirements of the
state corporate Nexus to confront power
is costly and difficult high standards
of evidence and argument are imposed and
critical analysis will naturally not be
welcomed by those who are in a position
to react vigorously and to determine the
array of rewards and punishments
conformity to a patriotic agenda in
contrast imposes no such costs charges
against official enemies barely require
substantiation they're also protected
from correction a correction can always
be dismissed as apologetics for the
criminals
someone who attributes the best
intentions to the United States while
perhaps deploring failure and ineptitude
requires no evidence for this stance so
for example no evidence is required when
we asked why success has continued to
elude us in the third world
why cannot a nation of such vast wealth
power and good intentions accomplish its
purposes more promptly and more
effectively not again quoting Landrum
balling
