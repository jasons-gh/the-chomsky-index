is there any chance of humanitarian
intervention which doesn't have an
ulterior motive I think that's basically
the question is a major scholarly
history of humanitarian intervention
between the car Rihanna packed in 1928
which out world war and some recent
period period and the scholar serious
scholar found three examples of
humanitarian intervention Mussolini's
invasion of Ethiopia Japan's invasion of
manchuria and Hitler takeover of the
baton right he didn't mean that they
were real humanitarian intervention what
he meant is those are the three cases
where a strong case was made that it's
humanitarian that's pretty typical I
mean there are other studies that go way
back sometimes they find one example of
the French intervention in Syria 1860 or
something but then if you look at the
details it's just part of Francis trying
to establish it's about maybe the
British intervention in Sierra Leone
would pass the filters
careful the ads conceived but you know
it's a little bit like Gandhi's alleged
the answer to the question what do you
think about Western civilization and
he's supposed to have said well might be
a good idea met their inner bed got my
if I caught what you're saying you
mentioned the Congo yeah it's kind of
interesting case the Congo is absolutely
the worst catastrophe going on anywhere
and has been for years no talk of
intervention even any dark floor is a
huge issue in the United States is here
Save Darfur committees that's pretty
awful no doubt but isn't a fraction of
what's going on in the Congo so why of
course nobody talks about doing anything
just let's shrink away the so wyd Darfur
or not the Congo oh it's not hard to
figure it out in Darfur you can blame it
on enemies the errors the enemies so
they're doing so it's terrible if you
look at the condo it's a little harder
for one thing the worst atrocities are
carrying out by Rwanda which is
Washington's closest ally so that part's
up the other thing is that the
multinational corporations are all over
eastern Congo for the Fighting's going
on and they're using the militias who
are slaughtering everybody at the gain
control over the rich resource
the eastern Congo and you should all be
applauded at least all of you who have
cell phones Pacific old man room
and the same with much else so you know
talking making a big fuss about eastern
Congo is kind of difficult it's a little
bit like this January 2006 election in
the free election in Palestine it's the
only free election in the Arab world
it's not nice to talk about that while
we're creating about democracy promotion
since we us instantly moved in to punish
the population partially or voting the
wrong way and Europe as usual kind of
power long flight so we don't talk about
that and same with the Congress
