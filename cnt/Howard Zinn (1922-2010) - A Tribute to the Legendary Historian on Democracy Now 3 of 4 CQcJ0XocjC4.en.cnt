and we wanted fighting in the man and at
that point the times were raised and
they became clubbing us very heavy
Howard was pulled up as I say a shirt
was ripped to parties taken away I saw
blood coming down his chest is that was
an excerpt of the documentary can't be
neutral in a moving train was also the
title of howard sins autobiography known
we just have a minute left in this
segment but talk about that activism
well that case is very similar to what
Howard described about his a bombing
attack I mean the police were actually
sympathetic the individual policeman
they were coming over to demonstrators
you know speaking supportively and in
fact when they were given the order to
move forward they were actually telling
people Howard and others look please
move because we don't want to do this
but then when the order came they did it
I don't know who but it's much like he
said when you're in uniform under arms
an automaton following orders you do it
and I stand pointed out they went right
after Howard probably in reaction to his
comments the day before and he was
dragged away and beaten but he was
constantly involved in civil
disobedience I was many times with him
as Dan Ellsberg was and others and he
was just he was fearless he was simple
he was straightforward he said the right
things had been eloquently and inspired
others to move forward in ways they
wouldn't have done and changed their
minds they changed their minds by their
actions and by hearing him he was a
really both in his life and in his work
he was a remarkable person just
irreplaceable um you were personal
friends with Howard to you and Carol
Howard and Roz spent summers near each
other on the cake you know we were
some friends close personal friends for
many years over 40 years so its of
course personal loss but it's a beyond
even beyond disclosed friends and family
is just a tragic loss to the millions of
people that who knows how many endless
numbers whose lives he touched and
changed and help them become much better
people he one good thing is that he
understood and recognized I'm sure
especially and those last remarkable
vibrant years of his life how much his
incredible contributions were welcomed
admired how much he was loved and
admired and he could look back on a very
satisfying life of real unusual
achievement well known Chomsky I want to
thank you very much for being with us

talking to the mighty let to freedom
the snick freedom singers here on
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report I'm Amy Goodman will be
joined by Anthony arnova Naomi Klein but
on the sad day the day after the news of
howard zinn's death i want to turn to
one of the last interviews we did with
him it was may 2009 he came to New York
to promote his latest book you write in
the introduction to a young people's
history of the United States over the
years some people have asked me do you
think that your history which is
radically different than the usual
histories of the United States is
suitable for young people won't it
create disillusionment with our country
is it right to be so critical of the
government's policies is it right to
take down the traditional heroes of the
nation like Christopher Columbus Andrew
Jackson Theodore Roosevelt it's it's
true that people have asked that
question again and again no should we
tell kids that Columbus whom they've
been told was a great hero Columbus
mutilated Indians and kidnapped them and
kill them in pursuit of gold should we
tell people that of Theodore Roosevelt
who is held up as one of our great
presidents who was really a warmonger
who loved military exploits and who
congratulated an American general who
committed a massacre in the Philippines
should we tell young people that and I
think the answer is we should be honest
with young people we should not deceive
them we should be honest about the
history of our country and we should be
not only taking down the traditional
heroes like Andrew Jackson theodoros
hope but we should be giving young
people an alternate set of heroes
instead of Theodore Roosevelt tell them
about Mark Twain Mark Twain well
Mark Twain everybody learns about is the
author of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry
Finn but won't either school we don't
learn about Mark Twain as the vice
president of the anti-imperialist league
we aren't told at Mark Twain denounced
Theodore Roosevelt for approving this
Massacre the Philippines no we want to
give young people ideal figures like
Helen Keller and I remember learning
about Helen Keller everybody learns
about Helen Keller a disabled person who
overcame her handicaps and became famous
but people don't learn in school and
young people don't earn school what we
want them to learn when we do books like
The Young People's History then I'd say
that Helen Keller was a socialist she
was a labor organizer she refused to
cross a picket line that was picketing a
theater showing a play about her and so
there are these these alternate heroes
in American history there's Fannie Lou
Hamer and Bob Moses they're the heroes
of the civil rights movement there are a
lot of people who are obscure who are
not known we have in this young people's
a history we have a young hero who was
sitting on the bus and refute in
Montgomery Alabama refused to leave the
front of the bus and there was before
Rosa Parks and Rosa Parks is justifiably
famous for refusing to leave her seat
and she got arrested and that was the
beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott
and really the beginning of a great
movement in the south but we this
fifteen-year-old girl did it first and
so we have a lot of it we are trying to
bring a lot of these obscure people back
into the forefront of our attention and
and inspire young people to say this is
the way to live yes that was Howard ssin
we're joined now by Anthony r-nev in New
York by Naomi Klein here
at Sundance where Howard Zinn was last
year premiering the people speak he was
here with Anthony Aronov whose co-author
of voice of a people's history of the
united states with anthony anthony we
just have a few minutes but share your
reflections on the latest work of
howards end I know this is a tremendous
personal loss for you as well as for
everyone well you know Howard never
arrested he had such an energy and over
the last few years he continued to write
continue to speak and he brought to life
this history that he spoke about in that
segment that you just aired he wanted to
bring a new generation of people into
contact with the voices of dissent the
voices of protest that they don't get in
their school textbooks that we don't get
in our establishment media and to remind
them of the power of their own voice
remind them of the power of dissent the
power of protest and he wanted to leave
a legacy of crystallizing those voices
synthesizing those voices and he
actively worked to bring together this
