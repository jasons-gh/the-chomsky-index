what about the fact that you mentioned
India but countries that are developing
and lifting themselves out of poverty
like India and China as they go through
the process of development they tend to
pollute more and contribute more to
climate change you've spoken up how the
Republican Party's blocked action in the
US but do we in the West really have the
authority morally or politically to tell
developing countries not to use cheap
fossil fuels to improve their standard
of living we have the moral
responsibility and the capacity to
assist them in getting off fossil fuels
one of the elements is that the
negotiations since powers is to fund
developing countries to help them move
towards renewable energy that's what the
u.s. meaning the Republican Party
systematically blocks once again a
couple of weeks ago in Madrid oh so we
have there this can be done in large
scale and small scale so take India of
India is becoming so hot over the summer
that it's barely livable and people if
they can afford it are trying to get air
conditioners well it's a poor country so
that they're getting cheap air
conditioners which are highly polluting
that how much would it cost the West to
provide India with up-to-date non
polluting air conditioners I mean it
wouldn't even be statistical error in
the budget but we can't do it now the
fact of the matter is that these
countries are taking steps India is in
fact taking some steps different steps
to move towards renewable energy and
trying us doing more than anyone
they're still the largest polluter but
they're taking steps beyond any other
country to try to overcome this china's
produces more electric cars and i think
the rest of the world combined its way
in the lead in developing sophisticated
mass-produced solar energy and wind
turbines and interestingly the united
states which is the major danger after
the world is trying to impede chinese
development one of the charges against a
lot of charges against china but one of
them is that they have an industrial
policy which among other things is
moving very ambitious li but to deal
with the threat of climate change
we've got intervene to stop there
because that allegedly violates her
sacred free trade principles which of
course we violated all the time
the reason you in a higher able to do
what we're doing now is because of us
industrial policy than the fifties and
since which developed the technology for
the high-tech economy
the first statement massive state
intervention all the way through this
story goes way back in history but we
have to impede chinese industrial
development that's very important
including their leadership in renewable
energy and their efforts to try to
expand i mean somebody looking at this
from outer space who thinks this species
is just insane
