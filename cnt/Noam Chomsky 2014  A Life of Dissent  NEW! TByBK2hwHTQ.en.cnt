well noam chomsky there's a really a
great pleasure and honor to welcome you
to Darin castle to the University of
Durham on to the northeast of England
when I mentioned the people that you
were going to come here the excitement
was palpable the Twitter feeds which I
by the way I don't follow apparently
very excited and there's been a great
build up really to your visit but I
everyone knows in a sense noam chomsky
we know your formidable scholarly
achievements and your activism but I
thought it would be quite interesting to
spend 20 minutes half an hour with you
just talking about how you got to be a
political figure so I thought I might
start by asking you about where you came
from about your family how you grew up
and whether you were always a publicly
engaged recall we always political as a
young person my parents were immigrant
my father fled from right near kid from
the people who were now in power so in
1913 right before the First World War my
mother came as a baby collier's earlier
I grew up in there a Jewish family they
lived in a kind of Jewish cultural
ghetto not a physical ghetto but there
they were both Hebrew teachers my father
was worse cholera and the environment in
which they lived was a century Jewish
cultural ghetto I don't think they had
any non-jewish friends for example the
they didn't know it but we lived in a in
a community that was mostly german and
irish and very anti-semitic so i grew up
on the streets and sort of running away
from the tough Irish kids and I remember
a beer parties and
harrisville for example they were quite
for a Nazi and my parents were Livius do
this said no conception that anything
like this was happening those days
children parents didn't talk to each
other I grew up in the depression that
the family was mostly unemployed working
class and earliest memories are
childhood memories are people coming to
the door trying to sell rags riding on a
trolley with my mother and watching
passing a textile strike where the
police are reading people bloody talking
with my relatives about their lives of
my uncle one uncle was a had a newsstand
which he himself had never gone past
about fourth grade but very self
educated that itself educated and very
cultivated person his newsstand became a
kind of a center of discussion and
debate a lot of em agrees and sell
papers there and listened and so on and
by the time I was about 11 or 12 and my
parents would let we live in
Philadelphia but my parents would allow
me to go to New York by myself stay with
my relatives I spent a lot of time and
in well in those days Union Square in
New York used to be a center for radical
offices for our writers Tim and other
anarchist to be honest office others and
the street going down below it fourth
Avenue now all gentrified used to have a
lot of small bookstores many of them run
by recent dem agrees some of them the
ones i happen to be attracted to buy and
emigration Spain and I very quickly got
quite interested in the in Spanish Civil
and a particular in the anarchist
movement in Spain in fact the first
article I remember writing was which I
can date precisely was right after full
of Barcelona so it was a februari 1939
and it was kind of a lament about the
spread of fascism over Europe I'm sure
it was not very profound I hope it's
disappeared forever but that was the
topic at least but and from then on it
was more or less the same when the the
second world war broke out right after
that so that became a big issue I was
rather common variant anti-fascist the
critical of a lot of the way in which
the war was framed and fought as I'm
sure you know in the United States there
was a differentiated attitude towards
the Germans and the Japanese the Germans
were bad people you know that's what the
propaganda was but they were not unlike
us the Japanese were just Herman they
had to be destroyed and crushed and then
the racism was just incredible you know
it's a number of us were quite critical
to that in fact the high school where it
was happen to be right next to a
prisoner of war camp a barbed wire
separating them and there was the
students in school with during recess we
go out and sort of mock the prisoners
and you talk to them across and a number
of us tried to we're quite opposed to
that trying to stop it then look they're
human beings like us they were drafted
didn't have a choice and then went on
when the British took invaded Greece was
very violent Bruins
strongly opposed to that but I hate
group of students and it just went on
from there if I could just clarify a
little bit but it sounds like your
parents you make it very clear actually
your parents were not really we're not
political they were had little awareness
of what was going on around them so was
this something about the values of your
background but you know you you were an
immigrant who came from immigrant family
was something of an outside as they were
both of the US but outside the US the
same time do you think that tension in a
young person helped illuminate things
that you might not some others may not
have seen because it sounds like from
the beginning you had a critical edge
that is to say a critical awareness of
this circumstances of your life well my
parents were conventional Roosevelt
Democrat there were splits and the
Jewish community at the time there was a
Hebraic and it is just my parents for
both of them their native language was a
kiddush but I have a reward of you
wouldn't talk it because they were on
the Hebrew side of the Coulter account
and the revival of Hebrew my father was
a dedicated Zionist but in a sense
that's not considered giantism today he
was a follower of haddam who were wanted
to create a cultural center in Palestine
that would be the revive the aspirin
culture and so on and revival Hebrew was
a handful part of it his own he himself
was Hebrew scholar did a work them and
medieval even grammar and that Jay ah
they think she's a connection her when I
was kid I read his pnt thesis and but
and that was their world and I was part
of that of course in my father and from
childhood Friday night that we read he
were together Hebrew literature from the
half 19th century studied the Bible and
so forth but the other side of my life
was
the my own political interests which in
from elsewhere by the time you're a
young man it'd University how would you
characterize your your your kind of
little engagement I mean you obviously
were steeped in a diversity of radical
backgrounds you've already described
being drawn to Spanish anarchists but I
wonder as your political views develop
whether you whether you understood
yourself to be working within a
framework within a tradition or were you
carving something out that was
distinctive from them more or less from
the beginning well I was it was a very
lively period remember the late nineteen
thirties early forties but not not like
subsequent fury at all and there was
every I mean I i would spend Saturday
afternoons and the Philadelphia public
library which for some reason had every
imaginable radical publication and I
just be working through these every
conceivable cult yes that's enough by
the time I was say 12 or 13 I was an
addy Bolshevik leftist and he bought it
from the left and so it was that I was a
lot of my own personal commitments
actually were involved with what was
then called Zionism movement now be
called a designs and a commitment to
working for arab-jewish cooperation and
a bi-national Palestine based on
working-class institutions and
corporations of a kind of quasi and his
time which is not as exotic as it may
sound today than it was maybe not
realistic but not lost the planet and
but I could and there was a one of the
Zionist groups was pretty close to this
in some respect such a matter it's a
year but I could never join them because
they were split
twin Trotskyite and Stalinist and I was
supposed to both of them so it's kind of
awkward around the fringes but that it
was a there were I wasn't alone there
were people but they're not a lot look
looking back now from where you are
today and your extraordinary history
both as an academic but there's a public
intellectual and critic critic of
American engagements imperialism's the
war machines the American self-interest
our region's on how would you say your
views today are different from you know
they were when you were a young man I
mean what are the big changes that you
that you with would register as you know
formative of the chomsky today looking
back now oddly enough not not much in
principle of course I know a lot more
livable then yea i meant for example the
time second world war i was and i had a
kind of skeptical attitude through the
pacific war yeah but it was only later
that I learned about the intricacies of
the background and what drove Japan to
become a brutal violent imperialist
power Westhead 20 considerable role or
not the British and the Americans so
kind the same in other domains so but
kind of fundamental principles other
than kind of sharpening modifying some
extent evidence it said there weren't
any trigger points like the vietnam war
which was because i was in the US of
course during the last part of the
Vietnam War I remember in 1974 the sense
of celebrations when was seen that the
war was coming to an end you wouldn't
describe the Vietnam War or any
successive events as as critical in
changing your kinds of engagements in
the way you stood out a little changes
for example August six nineteen for
five it was a change I was a counselor
in the summer camp a hebrew-speaking
camp and the news one morning that was
announced that her she became bombed by
atom bomb and I was shocked and even
more shocked by the fact that nobody
cared people listened and went on to the
next activity and I think I was so
shocked I just took off by myself walked
off into the woods and SAT there for a
couple hours and disappeared and that
i'm going to realized at that time i
think nobody could fail to realize that
we're now facing the possibility and the
likelihood of destroying ourselves that
was a significant change the Vietnam War
I and I followed it in the late 40s and
early 50s which was the crucial fury
didn't really know then what we know now
about the internal deliberations they've
been revealed later of it in by about
nineteen sixty one or so when in 1961
Kennedy shortly escalated the war the
was barely reported but there was enough
there were enough kid bits coming
through so you could see what was
happening he sent the American Air Force
to carry out bombing in South Vietnam
under South Vietnamese coveri initiated
chemical warfare to destroy crops and
the ground cover began the program's of
rounding people up and into what amount
of the concentration camps you can let
was clear that a substantial escalation
was going on and I kind of debated with
myself as to how deeply to become
involved I had enough political
experience to know that I just can't put
one foot in if you start involvement
it's going to take over and I had a
pretty comfortable life I had
a young family I had it it was a
professor at MIT kind of job that I like
did the research I wanted then I knew
perfectly well if I get involved in this
this is going to change and I thought
about it for a while but I did become
involved at the time it was a very
lonely commitment if he wanted to give a
talk on the Vietnam War say in 1963 it
would be in somebody's living room or
the church with four people just to
illustrate you came later 74 if the
first there was an international day of
protest against the war in October 1965
and there we had an anti-war group at
the time we decided to have a
demonstration on the Boston Common you
know the tattered place for the
political action there was a
demonstration but it was completely
broken up by counter-demonstrators in
fact we were supposed to be one of the
speakers nobody could be heard that we
were rescued actually buy a big state
police contingent didn't like us but
anyone people to be killed on the Boston
Common take a look at the Boston Globe
the next day for liberal newspaper
bitterly pronouncing the demonstrators
dare you raise a question about the
bombing of North Vietnam the next
international day of protest was March
1966 and we realized and couldn't have a
public demonstration so we arranged it
in a church around 10 stream church
which is one of the centers of anti-war
activity church was attacked yeah that's
what the mood was like then by 1965 I
was organizing one of the people
organizing national tax resistance and
didn't
1966 we began to organize a group called
resist still exists which was involved
in a variety of forms of anti-war
resistance in fact what came up for
trial in 1968 I was probably going to
face a long jail sentence but the Tet
Offensive came along and the government
called off the trials but it was a
pretty serious involved for years I was
staking out a large part of my time and
effort after Jack rolls here yes studied
with was one of the people who support
of the resistance but quiet like it was
it wasn't a person was much engaged but
it did support it yeah I'm mindful that
we have limited time so I've got really
two questions I want to ask you but
really the first one is given that you
or very formed well-formed figuring it
wallace by the time we get to the late
60s what was your how did you appraise
the rise of the not just the civil
rights movement the 68 errs the
explosion of political engagement in the
US and Europe at that time and now
looking back at that you know was how
would you characterize the 68 period and
its impact in your political life well I
68 my feeling was was declining I was
not overwhelmed at all by the 68 events
I thought they were mostly negative a
civil rights movements are in different
case yeah it and its histories are
revealing that I went down to the South
for a demonstration and gentlemen but
when you learn say if you listen to the
orations on Martin Luther King Day if
you'll notice that they stopped with his
I have a dream speech in Washington
that's not where Martin Luther King stop
he then moved on to class issues and to
the north to racism in the north and to
develop he was when he was assassinated
he was
he was supporting a sanitation workers
strike and he was about to organize it
for people's movement not on the basis
of race just a poor people's movement
there was to be a march on Washington
that she took place after his
assassination they set up a tent city in
Washington tried to appeal for
legislation density was smashed up by
the police and they were driven out of
Washington Martin Luther King lost his
liberal support when he turned to class
issues and that part of his life has
kind of disappeared you know it's there
it's not what's recognized and that's a
quite a revealing fact that northern
liberals were perfectly happy to have
him condemned racist sheriffs and
Alabama but not to deal with issues of
class in the north and this isn't amid
this was shifting in the mid 60s the
anti-war movement had a different
trajectory it was building up and it did
peak in about 68 69 and became a quite a
significant movement yet surely affected
the course of the war but by the 68 was
being in split yeah and the move and the
anti-war movement itself the student
movement was breaking up into a Maoist
element PL in the progressive labor and
whether men which were kind of let's
overcome the state by breaking up my
night windows and so on and a lot of
sectarianism and it was a it was kind of
dissolved in it
way that I thought was dangerous
actually one of the main roommates they
developed and the one that had in the
long term the greatest impact on the
society was the women's movement which
was just barely beginning to take off in
the late 60s as an organized movement of
course origins the way back and then by
the seventies was a major force yeah I
make a distinction I'm in thinking about
the impact of social movements between
those social movements which are on the
one hand egalitarian but on the other
hand they are seeking in a sense equal
access into the system itself so you
could say the civil rights movement and
partly some wrong elements of the
women's movement were engaged in winning
equal rights and equal opportunities and
one reason we might say they were
successful and have been successful in
certain profound ways is that you can
appeal to the system to live up to its
principles to ensure as it were equal
opportunity to allow space for the civil
rights movement in the women's movement
to flourish in contrast with social
movements that come let's say later like
Occupy which seek to change the agenda
and the structure as it were of global
financial markets financial capitalism
American hegemony and so forth and there
the issue is not access on equal terms
as it were but the transformation of the
organizational principles of the system
and there it's much harder to have an
impact it's harder to change that agenda
and occupy today as is not the force it
will it was so I wanted to ask you now I
mean I mean looking back on your time in
public engagement as own would you say
that was a valid distinction or not and
would you say looking back that in a
sense um is it it's extrude you greedy
that the transformation of you know
Western capitalism as we know it and the
structure of financial capitalism is a
much tougher nut to crack
then is it were winning equal
opportunities however important that is
as it were within the structure I think
the the women's movement goes beyond
seeking equal opportunities it was also
breaking down attitudes deep-seated
attitudes that justified oppression and
domination yeah well have you
internalized by the victims in take a
large part of the women's movement was
overcoming the internalization of the
sense that you must be repressed and
dominated in d so if you ask my
grandmother say whether she was
repressed she would not have known what
we're talking about that's like asking
do it Rihanna maybe the rest my mother
she would know but didn't think there
was anything he could do about it if you
ask my daughter then three out of the
house that's a big that's a huge that's
a major change again women and also the
men's right I think it it's more than
just equal accident as far as the civil
rights movement is concerned it's a it's
a much more complex issue you take a
look at after african-american history
there were slaves in 1620 it's a long
period slavery formally ending with the
Civil War but about 10 years later it
was reconstituted in a different form it
was reconstituted by a the
post-reconstruction north-south compact
which essentially granted the southie
thority to do what they liked so what
they did was criminalized black life the
black man is standing on a corner he
could get a defined ten dollars for
vagrancy which he couldn't pay in prison
forever and so on it created under slave
labor force a large part of the American
industrial revolution was based on slave
labor coming out of the prison and that
lasted it was not a small
component it was you know we're familiar
with the chain gangs that's the
agricultural part but it was a mining
steel significant part of the Industrial
Revolution to the late 1930s entry it
changed at the time when the Second
World War came the the word there were
jobs there was an immigration of the
north it was plenty of labor you had
then about 20 or 30 years in which
blacks had relative freedom a black man
could get a job in the auto industry
year it was unionized then we had a
fairly decent job by home same just get
to college that's everything and the
civil rights movement encapsulated that
and formalized some of those rights and
expanded did give equal rights after
that it started the return again by now
take a look at the year by the method
that what actually happened since about
nineteen late seventies primarily since
reagan is recriminate take a look at the
incarceration system as shot until about
nineteen eighty the percentage of the
population that was in prison in the
United States is pretty much like the
Western world live on the high end after
that it just zooms up mostly black men
by now Hispanic men some women and it's
essentially recreating the system that
was constructed in the from the late
19th century so access to free accesses
it's true for a small sector yeah but
not for the masses of life toffee is I
mean these are very important points but
occupy yeah let's take I said I I think
occupy was a reformist movement right
they were not saying let's dissolve the
financial sector
they were saying things like let's
impose a financial transaction tax quite
that's easily accommodated is in the
existing institutions in fact it exists
in England but an occupied was really a
tactic not a movement yeah it was
important but we remember but it is
attacked and you can't carry out a
tactic beyond a certain point well let
me put the question differently to you
we've just you know lived through one of
the biggest financial calamities which
nearly pushed the system off the edge
certainly one of the biggest since the
Great Depression in many sense the
burdens of this crisis have been
absorbed take it off the private sex and
resorbed into the public sector and push
back onto the relatively immobile
population and higher taxes if you are
City traders today in London what's
changed they will say very little in
other words somewhat as Mark said the
state is a committee for managing the
affairs of the blue jersey and if
they're huge costs to bear they are
passed on to the the movements the
middle classes and working classes the
labor movement today is weaker than it's
been for some time the system of
industrial and financial capitalism is
global the rise of Asia is partly their
success in engaging with this economic
system China brings together the two the
greatest ideologies of 20th century
nationalists on capitalism into a
successful re-entry into the global
order where is the the spirit of what
carries the spirits the spirit of
criticism today what carries the spirit
of Christian today of that complex
system that now global system of
capitalism labor movements certainly in
relation to this seem weaker than and
what is organized a never before would
you agree with that or not the labor
movement is weaker that it has been but
you know this is a cyclic pattern I take
the United States again there was quite
a powerful labor movement in the late
19th century early very powerful taking
over was running cities in western
Pennsylvania
I saw very substantial it was pretty
much smashed by woodrow wilson and the
red squid scared and the first word post
for a war period 1920s labor was
essentially dead one of the great labor
historians David Montgomery has a book
called I think it's called the fall of
the house of labor he's talking about
the 1920s that was serious decline 1930s
it revived and it was the vital force
that basically spurred the deal
legislation CIO organizing sit-down
strike major very frightening to
management because they're just a step
before taking over the factory and that
did lead to welfare state legislation of
a significant kind immediately
afterwards there was a business reaction
by the late 1930s it began that's when
you had the movement for scientific
methods of strike breaking and so on it
was put on hold during the war after the
war had started in force strong
taft-hartley 1947 huge propaganda
efforts to which are quite astonishing
scale to try to turn the population
against labor labor made its own
mistakes of the American labor movement
tried to make a compact with capital
will work together you know that compact
will be called off by business as soon
as they want to and the labor room began
its decline at that point by now in the
United States it's maybe seven percent
less than seven percent of the private
of the private workforce public sector
unions are still more protected but
they're under attack but that's happened
before and it could revive again in fact
it is reviving again
interesting way so if you go to where
there's a in the old rust belt say
northern Ohio Indiana there's a revival
of something new there worker owned
enterprises so take a young step it take
Youngstown Ohio the major steel town in
1977 or so the US Steel decided to close
down the it's Youngstown enterprises as
a talent was built by the labor movement
all surrounding the steeple with audibly
everything proliferate sfrom it and so
on the Union wanted to buy the steel
company and take it over the steel
executives didn't want to do it went to
the courts get lost but they didn't give
up they move towards small scale worker
owned enterprises which are now
proliferating in northern Ohio that's a
possible germ of an alternative form of
organization and activism which actually
has a revolutionary potential it changes
the structure of the system if it can
succeed that's one kind of development
if you look around say the techs a
college students that sector of the
population they're much more politically
engaged now than they ever happened
except for there was a very brief period
late 1960s when there was a lot of
student activism of the mixed kind but
now that's much broader by our mental
issues women's issues or solidarity
movements they're not there's nothing
that kind of coordinated you know
there's no movement you can point
through but a lot of ferment a lot of
opposition to the corporatization of the
university's the many things happening
it could go the lesson isn't
let me finish by asking you this
question one way to put it would be what
keeps you awake at night yeah what keeps
you awake at night would be one way to
put the lot my last question to you but
another way to put it would be how would
you characterize today the dimensions of
your engagements in the public domain
what are your priorities and how would
you sketch that there are plenty of
problems but there are two that are
absolutely overwhelming one of them goes
back to August six nineteen forty-five
we're still living under the shadow of
potential self-destruction and if you
take a look at that record it is
horrendous it's a miracle that we
survived anyone who looks closely at the
record of near nuclear war very near
minutes is shocking that's still there
fact it's growing but the other which we
weren't really aware of until the 1970s
is the threat of environmental disaster
which is an overwhelming three ammu
really at a point in human history where
we have to decide are we going to
destroy the prospects or decent
existence that's never happened before
and it's very close everything else kind
of fades into the background in the face
of these two kind of overwhelming
dangers are the grounds for optimism
well right I'd like to think of my
favorite comment from the Analects
Confucius there's a definition there of
the exemplary person presumably the
master himself it's the person who keeps
on trying even though he knows there is
no hope I don't think it's quite that
bad there isn't much hope there's some
coupon for on them Chelsea thank you
very much
