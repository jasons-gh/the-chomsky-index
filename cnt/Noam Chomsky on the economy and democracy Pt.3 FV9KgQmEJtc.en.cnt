welcome back to the real news network
we're in Cambridge Massachusetts and at
MIT with Professor Noam Chomsky thanks
so let me paint a possible scenario
Puffs possible picture here the global
financial system is completely
collapsing outside of the United States
the Eastern Europe economy is in
shambles Ukraine is in shambles Pakistan
if you move into Asia the meltdown
globally is tremendous and and a lot of
the worst consequences of this crisis is
being shifted into various parts of the
world and capital drawn into the United
States as people by t-bills and such but
if this stimulus package doesn't work if
the banking reform doesn't work and
people start to lose confidence in the
American team bill and even if they
don't this unemployment spiral can turn
into a very severe crisis and many
people are suggesting it could be five
years could be ten years what's the
political fallout of that in the United
States and let's go back to a
conversation you and I had just before
the last election where you essentially
said vote vote for Obama but I don't
think you said hold your nose you said
do it without illusions if you're in if
you're in a swing state are people who
are disturbed by the current situation
both on the progressive side and also I
you find this a lot of concern also on
you know more traditional conservatives
and libertarians are kind of caught in
some ways the same way they were before
the election which is how vigorously do
critique the Obama administration at the
same time it's in this fight with the
Republicans trying to block any kind of
measures that are at all even have any
kind of progressive content to them and
then look ahead four years or eight
years if this whole Obama presidency is
not successful eight years from now you
could have mccain-palin times 10 and and
we we could be looking at a kind of
right-wing
administration that might make the
bush-cheney administration would be nine
so there are under currents in the
population where has a feel of late fire
germany sometimes massive people who are
suffering don't understand what's
happening to them we're hard-working we
listen to the talk shows we're white
god-fearing hardworking Americans
everything's collapsing in our lives
who's doing it we'll find somebody who's
doing that rather familiar it's worth
remembering that Germany went from being
the peak of Western civilization in the
arts and the sciences and democratic
practice in the 1920s to the depths of
human history within ten years and it
was identical but kind of similar
phenomena were involved in this
sometimes called the same to barbarism
it can happen
I think the only attitude you can take
is support the measures that critical
support of measures that seem necessary
to patch things up but at the same time
sustained critique you mentioned the
global impact it's already beginning
China for example has just proposed
quietly that there should be a shift
away from the dollar as a reserve
currency there should be an
international reserve currency actually
the kind that Keynes proposed 60 years
ago but was never implemented and they
have a big stake in this the huge amount
of capital tied up in the United States
if the dollar declines they're in
trouble and I can't withdraw it or they
lose their market so and those moves are
surely going to continue which may lead
to a shift in the international economic
structure it's worth stressing that the
United States is by no means suffering
the worst in fact Europe's in worse
shape than the you know it's
the US has natural advantages Europe for
example can't make unified plans there's
internal conflict national conflicts
that prevent you know large-scale
planning the United States solved that
problem during the Civil War but the so
it's likely that if these current
proposals more or less keep things
hanging together as they may maybe
within a year or two the United States
may well emerge in a position of
relative power that's not very much
unchanged except that there are now many
pressures China's most striking to
diversify the structure of the
International economy also Latin America
which was the traditional backyard of
the United States has been for the first
time in its modern history moving
towards independence and integration and
the south-south relations and so on
which does give a more diverse complex
economy but the main action I think will
remain here and you and you think it is
possible that this thing will patch
together in a couple of years I mean a
lot of the predictions are from many
economists on various ends of the
spectrum are predicting this thing to
unravel on the other hand the if you
look at the actual you know kind of
money manager community they don't like
what's happening but they are expecting
a revival within a year or two which
they didn't get it so right no they had
everything wrong that everything wrong
before it sort of almost everyone else
on the economics profession has made the
economics profession financial
journalists corporate managers and so on
made just colossal mistakes like for
example not seeing the housing bubble
you know four hundred years
housing prices have pretty much tracked
economic growth all of a sudden they
shut out of sight I mean how can people
not see that but overwhelmingly they
didn't there are she looks after a few
but not not a lot but and that's an
astonishing it's understandable that the
banks didn't see it they didn't care as
long as you can securitize mortgages you
can keep making money even if housing
prices go into the stratosphere my dad's
illusion and yeah and then you well then
you count on the public to bail you out
I'm gonna take that secrets perfect
example Robert Rubin who was the
Secretary of Treasury he kind of steered
through Congress the elimination of
glass-steagall Act which protected
commercial banks from risky investments
soon as went through he quit the
government became a director of
Citigroup they profited enormous Lee
from this nuke these new possibilities
and then when it crashed he's out with
his money and the public steps in to
bail them out but even if they passed
this together isn't it likely to be
quite temporary and the house of cards
continues to fall and given that given
that purchasing power has been so based
on death it has but look I mean if
there's a stimulus if the economy is
stimulated the debt can be overcome
i'ma take say the Second World War that
was the greatest growth period ever
during the Second World War there was a
semi command economy industrial
production almost quadrupled and totally
ended the depression there was an
enormous debt but the economy had grown
so and and then with the continued
reliance on the state sector for
dynamism to sustain the high tech
economy what's happened in the last 50
years that debt was paid off me the
biggest period of feast on growth
peacetime worth ever so it can be
overcome but there are you know there's
this big elephant in the closet and
that's the health care system if current
tendencies continue a health care is
going to overwhelm the federal budget
there's another big elephant than the
military budget that's just a huge
crushing
opponent of the of the economy now
here's a kind of case where you have to
both support current measures and
sharply critique them so Obama's health
reform proposals are being criticized
because they're going to add to the
deficit
but if they were done properly they
would reduce the deficit as long as this
good reason why the US healthcare system
is the most inefficient in the end
costly in the industrial world and it's
twice the per capita costs of other
countries as some of the worst outcomes
it's the only privatized system and
privatization introduces a massive a
huge amount of bureaucracy
administrative costs you know
surveillance and so on and so forth
which is very expensive probably
hundreds of Beings dollars a year for
decades the public has wanted a national
healthcare system or something like
what's now called Medicare plus here's a
case where democracy just doesn't
function the but the large majority
wants has been just off the agenda I
mean now you know it's beginning to sort
of appear around the fringes but if
there was a move towards what the public
wants that ought to reduce health care
costs substantially but it's it's
considered kind of politically
impossible you can't really tamper with
the privatized system or just take the
cost of drugs
I'm the cost of drugs is probably two or
three times as high here as in
comparable countries it's because of the
power of the pharmaceutical corporations
well in the next segment of your
interview which I know has to be the
last because I know you have to go let's
talk about what what's the shape of the
oppositional movement in the United
States and what do you think people
should do please join us the next
segment our interview with Professor
Noam Chomsky
there are times when reality just
asserts itself in spite of the haze
created by television news and
entertainment
sometimes crisis rips a tear in the
fabric of myth and propaganda now a
profound economic crisis has ripped
asunder the American Dream itself
millions of people losing jobs and homes
they lacked proper health care and any
real sense of security since 2001
workers wages have fallen or remained
stagnant
even though worker productivity has
risen almost 33% by 2006 the top 1% of
households were receiving 23% of all
pre-tax income more than double what it
was in the 1970s it's the greatest
concentration of income since 1928 as
unemployment rises we need to know why
this crisis is happening and what we can
do to defend ourselves why are wages so
low why is the society so laden with
debt is it in ordinary Americans
interest to have a trillion dollar
military budget to project power across
the globe corporate television news
won't ask these questions let alone try
to find answers only a truly independent
news network can tackle these questions
with courage and with ordinary people's
interests in mind
we need a news network that's
independent of corporations governments
and political parties we need the real
news but there won't be a real news
network unless we raise substantial
funds right away the current financial
crisis has hit our funding hard together
we do have the power to turn it around
there are already hundreds of thousands
of people watching the real news every
month if everyone pitches in we can
build an Internet and cable television
network that will change the face of
media forever you can organize house
parties talk to friends at school and at
work send email blasts and spread the
word distribute this video to everyone
you know pick up the phone and call a
few friends and suggest they visit the
real news calm
invest just 10 minutes a day to ask
friends and colleagues to join the
campaign to create a truly independent
source of internet and television news
together we can build this network just
50,000 people at $10 a month gets us to
our first level of sustainability you
can help us reach this goal and when we
do we'll move to television in millions
of homes across North America help us
