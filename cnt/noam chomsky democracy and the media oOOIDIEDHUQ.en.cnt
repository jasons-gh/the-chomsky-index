next a lecture by Noam Chomsky who was a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology mr. Chomsky is also the
author of books on linguistics politics
political philosophy and foreign policy
this semester Noam Chomsky is a visiting
scholar at the University of Maryland
Baltimore County where these remarks
took place his topic democracy and the
media okay I'd like to welcome you to
the fall 1994 University of Maryland
Honors College visiting scholar program
I'm pleased to recognize the
participation of the following
organizations with the Honors College in
the sponsorship of this evenings program
the humanities forum the offices of
summer and winter programs residential
life and Campus Activities and the
student socialist forum it is such
occasions as this which bring together
into a community of dialogue and
learning the diverse constituencies
which make UMBC a very stimulating and
exciting place to be and which
demonstrate to the community at large
the value of that dialogue and I'd also
like to take this opportunity to note
another such occasion which is coming up
on the evening of November 12th at 7:00
p.m. when initially in the ballroom here
we'll be showing a video of Anna deavere
Smith
fire in the mirror fires in the mirror
and then Anna deavere Smith will herself
be here to speak on that subject and we
cordially invite you to attend on
November 12th at 7 p.m.
we're privileged to have with us this
evening the world-renowned scholar of
linguistics and social critic and
analyst Noam Chomsky professor Chomsky
received his bachelor's master's and
doctoral degrees from the University of
Pennsylvania he currently holds the very
prestigious position
Institute professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he has
been a member of the faculty since 1955
a recipient of numerous awards professor
Chomsky has taught and lectured at
Columbia University Oxford Cambridge and
the University of Leiden among other
places and he has been a member of the
Institute for Advanced Study at
Princeton University the list of his
publications displays well over 50 books
which he has authored or co-authored
among them are syntactic structures
language in mind for reasons of state
the logical structure of linguistic
theory manufacturing consent the
political economy of the mass media and
necessary allusions thought-control in
democratic societies professors
Chomsky's fields of intellectual
endeavor might at first seem rather
disparate but a studied consideration of
both soon demonstrates that the one is a
logical and natural complement of the
other as a proponent of generative
grammar he is deeply concerned with how
we come to symbolize our thoughts for
their transmission from mind to mind as
a critic of the artificial media through
which those symbols are often
transmitted he is deeply concerned with
the responsibility of the powers which
operate those media the linguist deals
with the operation of this system and
the individual The Critic deals with a
version of this system as it is
magnified and operates in the body
politic some time ago we had a rather
rude awakening to discover that the
distinction between the message and the
medium through which it is transmitted
can become blurred in some cases quite
noxious Liso apropos of this professor
Chomsky opens his book manufacturing
consent as follows the mass media serve
as a system for communicating messages
and symbols to the general populace it
is their function to amuse entertain and
inform and to inculcate individuals with
the values beliefs and codes of behavior
that will integrate them into the
institutional structures of the larger
society whether it is the questionable
but unquestioned values and logic of a
fifth century BC Athenian rhetorician
the honeyed words of a first century BC
Roman poet smeared on the rim of a cup
of otherwise on power
doctrine or the irony of a carefully
designed media facade behind which lurk
the ulterior and perhaps also inferior
motives of the facade builders we are
ever in need of that gadfly spirit which
whether it gains our agreement or not
does does us the great service of making
us think about what is beneath the
surface
about how and why what is said you said
in the last analysis about appearance
and reality our honored guests this
evening is such a gadfly please join me
in welcoming professor Noam Chomsky who
will speak on democracy and media in the
New World Order
Thanks there's a conventional doctrine
about the new era that's opening up
before us and the promise that it holds
the official version of this was given
about a year ago by the National
Security Advisor Anthony Lake announcing
what some have called the Clinton
doctrine the doctrine is that we are now
able to move from containment so we did
in the old days to enlargement which is
what we're now going to do in his words
throughout the Cold War we contained the
global threat to market democracies now
we should seek to enlarge their reach
with the evil empire out of the way and
commentators were much impressed by this
enlightened vision the story is so
familiar that I'll spare you further
quote although when you move to the
higher levels of the intellectual
stratosphere they do have a certain
interest and may be worth a brief sample
so for example take say Henry Kissinger
in his recent book he repeats the
standard refrain that the world is lucky
indeed to have such a benevolent leader
but he warns that we may be a little too
angelic for our own good altruism is
okay up to a point but the altruism of
US policy is beginning to be somewhat
harmful or maybe always has been in
other words we should pay some attention
to our own needs instead of just
lavishing care and attention on everyone
else
sometimes this this point of this
conception of the tradition and the new
world order actually rises higher than
mere opinion or description of fact
sometimes it reaches the realms of pure
logic but here you really have to
to the higher level so for example
there's a position at Harvard called the
eaton professorship of the science of
government now held by Samuel Huntington
he writes in a prestigious journal
international security that the United
States must maintain its international
primacy for the benefit of the world
because alone among nations the national
identity of the United States is defined
by a set of universal political and
economic values liberty democracy
equality private property and markets
well since that's a matter of definition
so the science of government teaches us
evidences beside the point
so you don't waste time testing doing
experiments to find out if two and two
is really equal to four and that's a
kind of a useful conclusion because if
people don't understand it
they might be tempted to raise some
rather disquieting questions to pick
just say the period of the peak period
of American liberalism take say the
Kennedy administration and somebody
might want to know just how the kennedy
administration was containing the global
threat to market democracies when it
prepared the overthrow of the
parliamentary government of Brazil
installing a regime of killers and
tortures and setting off a plague of
neo-nazi national security states that
spread over the hemisphere always with
firm US support and in fact direct
participation and indeed the actions
were presented at the time as a great
victory for democracy Kennedy's
ambassador Lincoln Gordon who then
became Secretary of State for Asian
affairs he explained that the Brazilian
coup a military coup that overthrew the
parliamentary regime was a great victory
for the free world
which was undertaken to preserve and not
destroy Brazil's democracy it was called
at a democratic revolution which was the
single most decisive victory for freedom
in the mid 20th century and then he
added that also it should create a
greatly improved climate for private
investment so in that sense at least
that did contain a threat to market
democracy democracy you know rather
special sense he went on from there if
my memory is correct to become president
of a great university not very far from
here
well we also would not have to evaluate
other cases given that the u.s.
commitment to these splendid values as a
matter of definition in fact we can put
aside the whole historical record which
unfortunately reveals a rather systemic
relationship between US policy and
democracy and human rights and indeed
markets will come to that one example is
the close correlation that's been
demonstrated repeatedly between US aid
and torture
the more government tortures its
citizens the more likely it is to
receive US aid the correlation includes
military aid it's independent of need
it's not just that the torturing
countries or the need here and the
correlation remains alive right through
the period when human rights was the
sole of our foreign policy back in the
late 1970s and indeed the correlation
remains quite alive today notably in the
region that's most subject to u.s. power
and therefore most revealing about our
real values the leading human rights
violator in the hemisphere now first
place has been taken by Columbia where
the record is really horrendous and in
fact it is the recipient of more than
half of US military aid increasing under
Clinton now the pretext in Colombia is
not fighting communism that the
work anymore it's fighting narco
trafficking although nobody even at
least nobody even tries to conceal the
fact that the security course forces
that the United States is training and
arming and the government itself is
deeply involved with narco trafficking
which indeed has been abetted by US
policy in some quite remarkable ways if
there's time I'll give some examples but
the useful point is that any such
questions are irrelevant if indeed the
commitment to democracy and markets and
human rights and all good things is
simply a matter of definition well I
don't want to imply that everyone thinks
that facts are irrelevant that it's just
a matter of logic that's unfair so let's
say take democracy there is in fact
interesting work on democracy and human
and US policy with regard to democracy
particularly in the recent years some of
the most interesting work I know is
scholarly work is by a man named Thomas
Carruthers who's written a book and
several articles about it studies of US
relations to democracy in the nineteen
eighty and he has the advantage of
writing is a insider he was in the State
Department the Reagan State Department
working on the legal legal sub
department working in particular on the
what are called what they call the
democracy enhancement programs so he
writes both as an observer and as a
participant and that the study is
interesting he starts by pointing out
that he's convinced that the effort u.s.
effort to enhance democracy in Latin
America was sincere but unfortunately it
was a failure
and as he points out he doesn't point
this out but as the record shows and he
presents it quite honestly the failure
is rather systemic oddly systematic the
way it works is that where US influence
was least progress towards democracy was
greatest namely in the Southern Cone
where the you know down far south where
the US had least interest influence
there there was indeed progress toward
democracy the Reagan ID strenuously
opposed it as others accurately points
out and then
of course took credit for it once it
became irreversible well that's where US
interest was least influence was least
where US influence was greatest in
Central America progress was least here
as just quote you've Carruthers brothers
own conclusion is the program she was
involved in incidentally Washington
inevitably saw it only limited top-down
forms of Democratic Change that did not
risk upsetting the traditional
structures of power with which the
United States has long been ally the
United States he said sought to maintain
the basic order of quite undemocratic
societies and to avoid populist base
change that might upset established
economic and political orders and open a
leftist direction in other words we
sponsor democracy as long as it came out
the way we ordered it to come out with
the old non democratic structure
remaining and the anti-democratic elites
that were allied the us power in charge
otherwise we didn't sponsor it in fact
we're observing that again right now
before our eyes in many places Haiti's a
dramatic example if you look at what's
really happening when we turn to the
real world away from the world of
ideology I think we find that democracy
and markets and human rights are under
serious attack in much of the world more
so than for many years including the
leading industrial democracies the most
powerful of them the United States is in
fact leading the attack and in the real
world the United States has never
supported free markets from its earliest
history until the Reagan years which in
fact set new standards for protectionism
and state intervention in the economy
contrary to many illusions which in fact
are fostered by the ideological
institutions but are easily demonstrated
to be false if for an entry into the
real world I I would a good place to
start as
with noted diplomatic historian named
Gerald Haynes also the senior historian
of the CIA so again he writes both as a
scholar and then close to the inside he
recently published a highly praised book
on us control of Brazil for the last 50
years ever since the mid 40s when the
United States as he puts it took Brazil
over as a testing area for scientific
methods of development and we've been
essentially running it ever since
including the great victory for
democracy that took place when in during
the Kennedy Johnson period that I
already mentioned Haines writing in 1989
describes this result as a great success
story for American style capitalism
that's an interesting judgment if you
happen to know anything about Brazil
where a very potentially very rich
country ought to be one of the richest
in the world where for maybe 90% of the
population the conditions of Eastern
Europe under pre Gorbachev would look
like some kind of paradise that's
actually an interesting comparison if
you ask yourself how Brazil compared
with Russia seventy years ago actually
rather similar with similar prospect and
that you can draw some conclusions from
that but you can be safe and secure that
those conclusions won't be drawn in
mainstream discussion where the only
thing that's discussed is the comparison
of Eastern Europe and Western Europe
showing how great we are and how awful
they are which is about as rational as a
discussion of the nursery schools in
Cambridge Massachusetts showing that
there are a total failure as you can see
by comparing the amount of quantum
physics known by graduates of the
nursery schools with what's known by
graduates of MIT in fact if you want to
make even a rational compare minimally
rational comparison of these two models
of development the one we
buried out in the testing area for
scientific development and the
tyrannical command economy of Eastern
Europe the naturally the only way to do
it of course is to start with places
that more or less alike Eastern and
Western Europe the last time they were
alike was about the 15th century I guess
and Eastern Europe have been declining
relative to the West ever since on the
other hand say Brazil and Russia were
more or less alike although Brazil had
all sorts of advantages the Russian ever
had well I won't pursue that as I say
that's a rational course you can find
some material on that but not in the
mainstream anyhow Hannes he begins by
pointing out that I'm quoting following
World War two the United States assumed
out of self-interest responsibility for
the welfare of the world capitalist
system and as any CEO can explain to you
welfare for the leaders of the world
capitalist system requires a dual policy
with regard to markets free markets for
the poor and the oppressed but massive
state intervention to protect the
wealthy and the privileged from market
discipline to make sure that resources
are transferred to them by a huge public
subsidy and by regressive fiscal
measures and also to increase the power
of a requires increasing the power of
absolutist and unaccountable
institutions over the international
economy and society and indeed that's
exactly what policy has been as for
democracy it's a fine thing as long as
it satisfies the conditions that
Carruthers describes that is top-down
form of democracy in which the rule is
safely in the hands of elite groups
linked to the United States which are
indeed highly highly autocratic the
condition under which democracy is
acceptable was actually described rather
honestly by the London economist a
little while ago
they were writing this was right after
the Polish elections where the poles had
voted to against the policies that the
London economists and its readers favor
and they said that that's no problem
they assured their readers that that's
no problem the reason is is they put it
the policy is insulated from politics in
other words whatever games these people
play in the election booth and the
voting booth policy is going to go on
the same way so don't worry about and
the reason is that what's happening that
much more powerful forces are going to
determine policy anyway so they can have
democracy if they like because they're
going to do what we want anyway the to
borrow some world bank lingo policy can
be carried out in what they like to call
technocratic insulation that is with the
guys who really run the show of
following the orders of real power and
ignoring the noises that come from the
rabble in that case we can have
democracy well the current attack on
human rights and democracy in markets is
not something new but it is taking new
forms in fact qualitatively different
ones I think to show that convincingly
would be a you know way beyond anything
I can attempt here but what I'll try to
do is just to indicate why I think that
these conclusions are correct and then
maybe we can follow things up in
discussion let me begin with a lead
story in the New York Times that
appeared in July under the headline US
corporations expanding abroad at a
quicker pace and it starts off like this
it says American companies are once
again rapidly expanding their operations
abroad demonstrating that no matter what
the incentives for keeping business in
the United States the urge to spread
factories offices stores and jobs
overseas is irresistible despite a weak
dollar and falling labor costs here
which you would think would spur
investment here overseas investment is
rising at twice the rate of exports and
for each dollar earned from exports
American companies take in nearly $2
from the sale of what they produce
abroad well let's begin with the falling
labor costs which indeed are quite real
about ten years ago the United States
had the highest wages in the world which
is what you'd expect this is the richest
country in the world by far and it has
absolutely unparalleled advantages real
wages have in fact stagnated or even
declined for the majority of the
population since their peak around 25
years ago but in the mid 80s
the effects of the double edged
so-called conservatism of the Reaganites
namely markets for the poorer and state
protection for the rich that hadn't yet
had its full impact by 1993 the impact
was quite obvious the Wall Street
Journal was able to exalt over what it
called a welcome development of
transcendent importance namely US labor
costs had fallen below all other leading
industrial powers apart from England we
actually did fall below England for a
while but then Margaret Thatcher
succeeded in driving the working people
and the poor down even more efficiently
than us meanwhile profits were rising to
new heights
earlier this year every year Fortune
magazine has a know the big business
magazine has a review of the Fortune 500
you know the 500 top guys and this year
earlier this year they reported dazzling
profits that's their word for the 500
top corporations even though sales were
stagnating so wages are going down sales
are stagnating and profits are zooming
to dazzling Heights sometimes called a
paradox in fact if you look at social
policy it's not terribly paradoxical in
there are other things happening - along
with decline and wages for the majority
of the population and that continues
through the so-called recovery work
hours are increasing they're now at the
highest level since the Second World War
the 40-hour week has long been forgotten
and markets are becoming more flex
it's a technical term which means that
when you go to sleep at night you don't
know if you're going to have a job next
morning that's as any economist can
explain to you that's a contribution to
the health of the economy it's a
contribution of the health of the
economy when you eliminate what are
called market rigidity
like job security and contracts pensions
union laws governing health safety in
the workplace and so on those are all
market rigidities which we want to
eliminate in the interest of the health
of the economy health of the economy is
a carefully defined term designed so
that it refers to certain factor it
brings in certain factors and not others
including not the factors that even the
World Bank concedes are major factors
and economic growth like equality it's
an economy can be very healthy by this
measure while the population is in fact
suffering miserably in fact that happens
constantly and there's even another
technical term for that it's a call it's
called an an economic miracle means the
privileged few are doing beautifully the
numbers look fine foreign investors are
enriching themselves and the population
may be starving to death
well these developments are welcome to
other sectors of the world capitalist
system for whose welfare the United
States has provided as the senior
historian at CIA puts it one immediate
effect of the free trade agreement with
Canada was the flight of several hundred
thousand jobs to the Southeast United
States where labor markets are very
flexible there's no need for concern
about such archaic ideas as unions or
benefits or security or for that matter
for the rights that are guaranteed in
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights to which we make proper obeisance
when there's some political gains to be
made from that and other laws and
conventions on the news of course
reached Europe as well including Germany
where labor costs per unit output were
six
percent are 60% higher than the United
States according the Wall Street Journal
just at that time Germany's largest
conglomerate Thames lor bents
established a major Factory in Alabama
where it was offered the usual benefits
that are expected from third world
countries at a cost to the taxpayer that
was considered exorbitant even by The
Wall Street Journal which rarely has a
harsh word for foreign investment
overseas investment is motivated by more
than the availability of cheap labor
with few benefits and rights that is
flexible market labor markets and that's
explained in the same New York Times
article that I quoted from earlier in it
The Times interview is an executive of
the Gillette company you know the razor
company and he explained why his
corporation is shifting production to 28
countries including Germany despite its
very high labor costs here's the reason
we're concerned about having only one
place where a product is made because of
labor problems and gives an example
example is they have a factory in Boston
and if the Boston workers strike
Gillette could supply both the European
and the US markets from its plant in
Berlin and thereby break the strike so
it's quite reasonable that Gillette
should employ three times as many
workers in manufacture a broad as in the
United States quite irrespective of
course notice that this is not for
economic efficiency so they're going to
high-cost areas rather it's just part of
class war it's a way to maintain power
and to and to ensure that the highly
class conscious business sector in the
United States will be able to beat down
its enemy namely the domestic population
this is quite apart from questions of
economic efficiency notice except you
know much longer you know something in
some other sense of the term the this
these processes international
internationalization of productions
which is going on of which this is an
illustration
that puts quite a different cast on the
discussion that's underway these days
the debate about what's called American
decline it means that in order it
indicates as it was always true but now
it's much more true true that if you
want to evaluate the notion of American
decline you have to begin by saying what
you mean by the United States what is it
if you mean by the United States the
geographical entity and the people in it
then indeed the country is declining in
many respects but as Adam Smith observed
two centuries ago the principal
architects of state policy in his days
the merchants and manufacturers of
England have quite different interests
than those of their own of the
population of their country and they
make sure that their own interests are
in his words most peculiarly attended to
whatever the effect on their own
populations let alone others nothing has
changed in that regard including the
need to employ the class analysis the
Adam Smith took for granted in
understanding policy choices in Senate
Lee I'm talking about the real Adam
Smith not the one who is created by
ideologues
the real one is actually quite
interesting not the imbecile that sounds
like when you look at what's attributed
to him the so we have to at least begin
by recognizing what was a truism to Adam
Smith that when we talk about policy we
have to ask are we talking about the
principal architects no longer the
merchants and manufacturers but now
basically transnational corporations and
banks and so on or are we talking about
the population in the country and you
just get quite different answers so for
example if you use if you refer to the
principal architects of policy it's
quite natural to discover that the US
manufacturing production is indeed
declining namely when you consider the
geographical entity but it's holding its
own quite well if you consider the share
and global production of us-based
corporations just different concepts of
the United States so all is fine in
other words if you adopt the perspective
of the principal architects of
and the same conclusions hold with
regard to the famous trade deficit if
you consider international borders the
United States has a huge huge trade
deficit and it's expected to go up in
fact but recently the Commerce
Department recalculated the trade
deficit on a different way they counted
profits of US companies abroad as US
exports well when you did that the
deficit turned into a huge surplus and
that recalculation was quite reasonable
The Wall Street Journal explained and
reporting it because the profits gained
abroad benefit companies domestically so
therefore they should be regarded as
like in you know exports basically the
recalculation interprets the words
United States in the terms that matter
for the principal architects of policy
and Adam Smith since not the
geographical area or its people but
rather the people who count that is the
beneficiaries of the powerful welfare
state for the rich which indeed was
enhanced under the Reagan years the end
of the Cold War provides rich new
opportunities for for increasing the
privilege and power of Western investors
partly that simply because much of the
region is being returned to its
traditional third world service role in
my opinion that's what the Cold War was
basically about but that's another topic
put it aside in any event that's plainly
happening it's going back most of it to
where it was relative to the west about
70 years ago and for Eastern Europe
fifty years ago also these developments
offer the principal architects of policy
and the institution's they represent it
offers them new weapons against their
domestic enemy namely the population at
home and that's quite an important
matter workers in the East are skilled
and healthy and well-educated although
that in fact is changing because of the
precipitous and disastrous decline in
quality of life standards in most of
Eastern your
since 1989 as the capitalist reforms
were imposed and they in fact were
returned to the third world where
they're supposed to be UNESCO has a
recent report in which they try to give
some put some numbers on this and they
estimate for example about half a
million extra deaths a year in Russia
alone as a result of these measures
which incidentally they say they approve
of not the way they're carried out the
workers in the East nevertheless still
are they may not remain but they still
are skilled and well educated and of
course they're also blonde and blue-eyed
which overcomes another unspoken problem
about the third world they're willing to
work longer hours than what the business
press calls their pampered colleagues
and in the West
thanks to pauperization and massive
unemployment resulting from the free
market reforms I'm quoting London
Financial Times in a kind of an upbeat
column about the East headed green
shoots in communism ruins it's pretty
awful but there's some green shoots like
the pauperization and mass unemployment
which means that they'll work much
harder than they're pampered than
pampered Western workers they don't
receive many benefits nice flexible
labor market and wages are kept low by
harsh labor policies of the powerful
states doing their job meanwhile foreign
investors benefit additionally from
tariff protection subsidies tax holidays
and the other familiar concomitant of
really existing free-market policies so
when GM and VW and so on
moved Eastern Europe they expect and get
massive protection because that's their
sense of free markets well the business
press has been quite frank and warning
Western workers that they're going to
have to abandon what Businessweek calls
their luxurious lifestyle in the face of
international competition now including
the traditional third world in the east
returning to its service rule when
economists talk about this they usually
talk about job shift and then point out
rightly that we don't know a lot about
that but that's the least of it
the threat of jobs shift alone suffices
to make labor markets more flexible that
is to lower wages eliminate benefits and
so on in a more internationalized
economy for obvious reasons and all of
these devices provide new methods for
the powerful to enhance their wealth and
privilege which is after all what social
policy is about and their
decision-making power in all aspects of
life and indeed their control over the
general population and that's true
whether Democratic forums function or
not given that policy can increasingly
be insulated from politics well over the
last century and a half
workers have won many rights for
themselves and for the general
population in long and hard struggles in
the United States they faced levels of
state corporate violence that were
unique in the West but in the United
States these rights have been eroded and
by now have almost been completely
destroyed by a major state corporate
offensive starting right after World War
two
ever since the Reagan I'd take over the
offensive simply became open partnership
and crime employers simply violated the
law frankly and openly secure in the
knowledge that they'd be backed by a
criminal state all of this incidentally
is reviewed in some detail and quite
accurately in Businessweek in a cover
story last May which you might want to
have a look at the conclusion is that
crime does pay
particularly when state power is behind
it that's a principle that's understood
very well by our clients abroad as well
as for the global social and economic
crisis it's quite real
and we feel people feel it and they feel
it rightly often it's recognised in fact
and it's usually attributed to
inexorable market forces
forces which of the kind that written
David Ricardo called as immutable as the
principles of gravitation and an earlier
exercise of ideological warfare when
classical economics was sort of created
recognizing these inexorable forces you
then get division among analysts about
the contribution of various factors like
international trade and automation some
of the major ones well putting aside the
absurdity of comparing human
institutions with their specific values
and choices the laws of nature should be
recognized that there's a considerable
element of deception in all of this if
you look closely you find that the
alleged deficiencies of Trade and
automation for example are hardly
attributable to the market huge state
subsidies and state intervention have
always been required and still are to
make trade appear to be efficient not to
speak of costs such as for example
ecological costs that are imposed on
future generations who don't vote in the
market and other so-called externalities
which are put down in footnote somewhere
well to mention merely one slight market
distortion which doesn't get mentioned
discussed much and talk about the
efficiency of trade a substantial part
of the Pentagon budget has been devoted
to I'm quoting secure flow of oil at
reasonable prices from the Middle East
which is overwhelmingly the preserve of
the United States I'm quoting from
Phoebe more of the National Defense
University in a casual and quite great
comment in a scholarly journal if you
were watching television during the
latest Iraq escapade you'll recall that
she was one of the main specialists
called upon to give explanations of
what's happening
well the Pentagon budget which is not
slight is a contribution to the
efficiency of trade that doesn't receive
too much attention apart from other
contributions that it makes to what's
called the health of the economy and
there are plenty of other such factors
if you consider them you get quite a
different picture
let's take automation the second factor
there's no doubt that it is throwing
people out of work these days and it
does contribute to profit today however
automation was so inefficient that it
could not be developed through market
forces it had to be developed through
decades of protection in the state
sector that's what's called here the
defense system that's just the state
sector of the economy which the public
pays for until something profitable
comes out at which point it's handed
over to private power this has been
studied very extensively and very
revealingly by David Noble formerly of
my University now in Canada works very
much worth reading and furthermore as he
demonstrates the specific form of
automation that was selected was not
inherent in the technology it nor was it
picked for reasons of economic
efficiency often the choice was driven
by power rather than profit or
efficiency or anything that's in the
technology that is the form of
automation that was developed within the
state sector protected because of its
enormous inefficiency the form of
automation that was developed was
designed to descale workers and
subordinate them to management not the
contrary to give work to empower workers
and eliminate management the same
technology technology doesn't care which
way it's used couldn't used one way or
the other and questions of profit are
basically irrelevant to this question
what is relevant are questions of
domination and control like for example
Gillette's build-up of a labor force in
Berlin in case American workers get the
crazy idea of striking
what is in
fact happening in the world has less to
do with markets than it does with raw
concentrated power and class war of the
kind that was obvious to Adam Smith
increasingly this power is vested in
unaccountable institutions there are
changes in the international economy
that have offered real hopes for
reversing and unraveling the advances in
democracy and human rights that had been
achieved in more than a century of
bitter struggle one factor is just the
internationalization of the economy
which was which offers very effective
weapons against working people as I
mentioned this is obvious another factor
which goes along in parallel with that
is the huge explosion in unregulated
specula financial capital and also which
has just exploded since around 1970 when
the regulatory system was dismantled by
Richard Nixon the Bretton Woods system
and not only has the scale grown
enormously but so has the the
composition so current estimates are
that around 1970 about 90% of the
capital of involved in international
exchanges was for was trade related or
investment related that is related to
some sort of meaningful economic purpose
and about 10% was speculation like
speculation against currencies by 1990
those those numbers have literally
reversed 90% speculation not anything
productive and the latest report I saw
in a UN Development Programme report
just a few months ago is that that
figures now going up to 95 percent well
the difference between 10 percent
devoted to mere speculation and 95
percent devoted to it is great apart
from the fact that the scale is has
become completely astronomical alright
and that has its consequences
it creates massive pressures leading
towards low
low-wage dazzling profit economies and
it helps insulate policy from politics
and eliminate the threat of democracy
that's what's being referred to when
people talk about technocratic
insulation and the fact that democracy
isn't as much of a fear anymore because
there's nothing much people will do
about it anyway power lies in other
hands unaccountable essentially
totalitarian institutions have the kind
of power that was never dreamt of in the
past well I think that's what's really
happening a lot of work on this abstract
level let's go down to earth the real
meaning of what's called free-market
conservatism is illustrate illustrated
by a closer look at the most passionate
enthusiasts for what they call getting
the government off our back and letting
the market reign undisturbed those are
the mantras these days as you read every
day well New York Times had a front-page
story on this interesting phenomenon a
little while ago and they picked the
concrete example and indeed the most
striking example Cobb County Georgia the
article appears under the heading
conservatism flowering among the malls
that's what's happening in Cobb County
Georgia
it's a rich suburb of Atlanta
scrupulously
insulated from any urban infection so
that the inhabitants can enjoy the
fruits of what is described as their
entrepreneurial values and their market
enthusiasms their defendant which are
defended in Congress by their
representative leading conservative in
Congress Newt Gingrich next Speaker of
the House I presume who is proudly
proclaiming that the anti-government
sentiments of the American people are
finally beginning to prevail over the
socialistic welfare state well there is
a small footnote to this Cobb County
Georgia receives more federal subsidies
than any other county in the country
with two interesting exceptions one of
them is Arlington
is arlington virginia which is of course
just part of the federal system and the
other is the florida home of the kennedy
space center which is another central
component of the system of public
subsidy of private profit but if you
move out of the state system itself put
aside those two counties then cobb
county is the leading recipient of
federal subsidies public subsidies
funneled through the federal government
in the country the leading employer in
Cobb County is Lockheed Aircraft a
corporation which exists thanks to
massive public subsidy most other jobs
in Cobb County where people are pursuing
their entrepreneurial values also are
based on feeding at the public trough
meaning that taxpayers paying for
meanwhile praises to market miracles are
resounding to the heavens notably where
conservatism is flowering among the
malls along with calls to get the
government off our back as long as we're
sure that its hands are pouring public
funds into our pockets well I you if you
want a very graphic illustration of how
this works I really urge you to look at
Newt Gingrich's Contract with America
parts of which are published in New York
Times this morning I could read it on
the airplane coming down if you read it
you discover not just a little bit
closely doesn't take very closely you
discover the what he's calling for is a
greatly enhanced and much more powerful
welfare state for the rich but with
punishment of the poor and in fact it's
done in a pretty brazen fashion it's
worth reading carefully and in fact that
pattern is almost Exceptionalist so one
sort of minor part of the welfare state
for the rich is just straight flat
outright welfare whether it's men
sometimes masked and regressive fiscal
measures but what amounts to just
payments and what you find
just read a recent study but one
economist that if for a household with
incomes over a hundred thousand welfare
subsidies front four from the government
are about almost twice as high as for
households with income of under ten
thousand now these subsidies include
things like you know say tax reductions
for mortgage payments and so on which
are equivalent to subsidies might give
people of money it's just a way of
disguising it so others don't see it and
now that's the small part of it
but even there alone we find that the
welfare to the rich is well beyond
anything that goes to the poor so the
welfare system is in fact a
redistributed system upwards something
which wouldn't have surprised Adam Smith
who understood that that's what the
principal architects of policy are up to
however if you really want to see the
way the system works you have to move
from these sort of minor parts so places
like Cobb County Georgia or say Seattle
Washington where you could observe it
quite closely last year Bill Clinton is
off to Jakarta next week or week or two
for the next APEC conference beside
comment he made it clear that he's not
gonna bring up any human rights issues
Indonesia has a horrendous human rights
record if you wanna have a look at what
it's like take a look at the latest on
this the international report which is
unusual
I mean I've rarely seen such a harsh and
well justified report in fact in
addition to that it's carried out a near
genocide all attack on East Timor and is
still doing it I just picked up a flyer
coming in here saying that on Thursday
November 10th at five o'clock here I
guess alright the Indonesian embassy
there's to be a candlelight vigil it's
the anniversary of one of the big
massacres a couple of years ago the
dealy massacre 1991 Indonesia
error in case some of you are thinking
of a career in the Diplomatic Service I
give you some free advice you're not
supposed to carry out massacres in front
of television cameras and there happened
to be a hidden television camera there
there's a British journalist who's
hiding behind a gravestone in the
graveyard where the massacre took place
that's a bad mistake and second point
you're not supposed to practically
murder American journalists and the
Indonesian troops practically killed an
American journalist Allan Nairn while I
was he was trying to protect a friend
Amy Goodman another American journalist
that's a bad mistake that's considered
bad for him you're not supposed to do
that and when you do that there's a
routine that you go through cover-up
judicial cover-up punishment of the
victims free the people who are
responsible and then there's another job
this is advice for those who want to be
journalists or academics and so on
you're supposed to praise this
magnificent display that shows how you
know human rights are improving and it's
really a wonderful place and so on and
so forth I mean this is a record that
has replayed over and over it was done
on in that case if you don't happen to
like it you can for example join the
vigil well next week so two weeks I
guess Clinton's off to Jakarta where
he's promised not to say anything about
human rights
the last APEC conference asia-pacific
economic conference or whatever it's
called the last one a year ago is in
Seattle and there Clinton was the star
performer he offered what the press
described with great awe as his grand
vision of the free market future a lot
of admiration he gave the talk
announcing this grand vision and a
hangar of the Boeing Corporation in
Seattle and in fact he selected Boeing
as his model the model of the free
market future and it said make some
sense Boeing is the country's leading
expert exporter and in fact civilian air
aircraft leads the way in US
manufacturing exports the world's
biggest industry
tourism industry is of course aircraft
based and it accounts for about a third
of the US trade surplus and services so
it makes good sense to pick Boeing
Boeing also happens to be a perfect
example of state-supported industry
Boeing is a publicly subsidized Corp
like Lockheed publicly subsidized
Corporation which the taxpayer pays for
but the profits go to the investors
that's our system that's what we call
free enterprise and getting the
government off your backs
so Boeing was a great choice if this is
never nobody seemed to notice this when
they were talking about the grand grand
vision for the future but it's an
interesting story if you look at the
history Boeing the leading exporter pre
before World War two it couldn't could
barely survive during World War two
however its investment increased
fivefold over ninety percent of it
federal money this is while Boeing was
doing its patriotic duty during the
Second World War and wages were being
held down for others doing their
patriotic duty
so after World War two Boeing was in
business not through the forces of the
market well what happened after the war
Fortune magazine the leading business
magazine recognized write-off and
quoting it that the aircraft industry
cannot satisfactorily exist in a pure
uncompetitive unsubsidized free
enterprise economy and Businessweek
added that the government is their only
possible Savior and in fact the Pentagon
system was revitalized as the savior it
sustained and expanded the aircraft
industry the leading civilian exporter
along with a lot of others that went
along with it for example metals
generally electronics computers about 85
percent of electronics our research and
development during the 50s was paid for
by the taxpayer the profits later went
to private corporations that includes
chemicals machine tools automation as I
mentioned and in fact just about every
other central component
the industrial economy incidentally the
fact that the government had to be the
savior meaning the taxpayer had to pay
for it for the enrichment of the wealthy
and the maintenance of a private
enterprise economy that was completely
frank and open in the business press was
never concealed you don't have to go to
secret records to discover it all you
have to do is read the business press in
the late 40s very clear it's also
supported by released secret documents
but there's nothing much to reveal the
first secretary of except for the
general population it was not supposed
to hear any of this
the first secretary of the Air Force
Stuart Symington he put the matter quite
plainly in January 1948 he said the word
to talk is not subsidy the word to talk
is security listen to the word and
you'll learn a lot about recent history
including the Cold War Symington was
essentially aircraft industry
representative in Washington and he
regularly demanded enough procurement
funds from Congress to as he put it meet
the requirements of the aircraft
industry and in fact Boeing won the
major share and so the matter continues
until today I've written about it
elsewhere but and in fact it continues
in pretty much the same way and just
about every functioning sector of the
productive economy and somebody that's
one reason why the Pentagon budget
remains higher in real dollars today
than it was under Nixon while the
government is and the information system
is desperately looking for new pretexts
the old one having vanished for new
pretext to maintain this extraordinary
public's that technique for subsidizing
the wealthy and the privileged that's
what it means to get government off our
back you look at the contract with
america of Newt Gingrich you discover
that a major component is to increase to
restore our national security and our
national defense well that's an
interesting phrase you might ask who's
threatening us exactly as I read history
the last time the US was threatened was
in the
war of 1812 and it now produces US
military expenditures are now great or
already greater than the rest of the
world combined including government
subsidized military sales which maintain
the private economy but we have to
increase our security that is we have to
increase the welfare state for the rich
meanwhile cutting down welfare for the
poor this is then spelled out further
but that's the contract with America by
those who preach free-market
conservatives well needless to say
focusing on rich countries like ours is
very misleading this double-edged
advocacy of free markets has by far its
most lethal effects and the traditional
colonial domains third-world which with
the single exception of the Japan based
area which was never properly colonized
by the West apart from that it's an
utter disaster
apart from ideologically crafted
economic measures that put aside the
effects on people when they measure
economic health and with hopelessly
inadequate apologies to the victims I'm
going to put aside this terrible story
of major crimes against humanity for
which we bear major primary and
continuing responsibility
well the contemporary attack on
democracy focuses on its central point
namely accountability the huge
transnational corporations that
increasingly dominate the global economy
they operate of course in virtual
secrecy and the same is true of what the
London Financial Times calls the de
facto world government
that's taping taking shape around them
meaning referring to the World Bank in
the IMF and the New World Trade
Organization and the executive meetings
that were of the rich seven countries g7
and so on all of those can function in
technocratic isolation free from
interference by the declining
parliamentary institutions untroubled by
the general public who have only the
vaguest idea of what they're doing
their machination czar can be known only
to a few specialists and in fact they're
in principle secret well meanwhile
there's a growing sector kind of a
growing surplus population who don't
contribute much to profit if anything
and therefore don't have any human
rights under standard values the values
that we're trying to extend over the
world and that's that's problem they
naturally have to be kept in ignorance
like everyone else but in addition they
have to be controlled and the question
is how you do that
well that problems faced rather directly
in the third-world domains that have
long been subject the Western control
and therefore reveal most clearly the
actual guiding ideals of the leaders at
least if you apply rational standards
they're the favored devices include
large-scale terror death squads torture
and other similar methods of proven
effectiveness a dramatic example is the
terrorist war against Central America
during the 1980s against democracy and
independence largely against the church
in fact proceeding right now
incidentally Colombia is the leading
example within the United States however
the methods of choice are somewhat
different
the primary method of methods like we
don't send out death squads to kill the
superfluous people we do it in other
more indirect ways the primary way has
been just to keep the superfluous
population locked up in urban slums that
increasingly resemble concentration
camps or if that fails lock him up in
prisons those are the counterpart in a
richer society to the death squads that
we train and support in our domains in
June 1994 the Justice Department
reported that the number of state and
federal prison inmates in the United
States had almost tripled since 1980
reaching record heights under Reaganite
conservatism the u.s. left its main
competitors Russia and South Africa well
behind in locking up its population
although you'll be happy to learn
has just caught up thanks to the free
market reforms actually the highest rate
of imprisonment is under the leading US
client regime Human Rights Watch has
just pointed out in a study of torture
and the Israeli occupied territories the
largely fraudulent drug war has been
very effectively used and indeed is
crafted to imprison the unwanted
population in the United States and the
new bipartisan crime bill should
facilitate the process with its vast new
expenditures for prisons its sharp
increase in the death penalty and much
harsher sentencing procedures also it's
worth bearing in mind that the crime
bill gives a lift to the economy it's a
Keynesian technique of economic stimulus
a lot of big impulse to the construction
industry and so on and a lot of jobs for
just controlling people one of the
fastest growing white-collar professions
in the United States is security
personnel including prison guards the
great increase in prisons also creates a
very cheap in fact zero pay virtually
zero pay and highly disciplined labor
force for private corporations and the
state industry so it's pretty useful for
the economy and you can see then why
Newt Gingrich's Contract for America
calls for a very rapid expansion in this
highly efficient device of increasing
state power and ridding ourselves of
people who have no rights by the simple
standard that they don't contribute the
profit-making it's worth paying close
attention to this one of the leading
American criminologists William
Chambliss at George Washington
University he discusses what he calls
the politics of law and law enforcement
and the politics of it are very
interesting as he shows he points out as
have plenty of others that crime hasn't
really changed very much in the last 20
years in scale or even in character but
the perceptions have changed a lot and
furthermore the punishment is going up
very fast and in highly restricted and
specialized ways targeting the most
vulnerable sectors of the population
mainly
Black's over half the prisoners in
federal prisons about 30% in state
prisons are there for drug violations
two-thirds of the arrests in 1992 last
year for which they're good statistics
we're for possession not for sale and
manufacture so take a look at your
favorite federal lockup and you won't
find many executives of chemical
corporations that provide the materials
or banks that launder the money rather
for possession like kids on the street
Black's account for two-thirds of the
prisoners convicted for drug offenses
even though studies have shown that more
White's than blacks use illegal drugs
and of course that eighty percent of the
population is white and furthermore the
laws themselves are very carefully
crafted so it happens for various
reasons that in the in the urban ghettos
crack cocaine is the favored drug
whereas in the white suburbs its
powdered cocaine have a look at the laws
for those two and you'll find that the
punishments are radically different in
fact black males are considered a
criminal population by law enforcement
officials so Chambliss includes from
quite interesting studies there are
available now this includes direct
observation in a project with the
Washington police in which you know law
students and so on travel around with
the police and just take transcripts of
what's happening he says they're treated
as a criminal population I don't think
that's exactly correct
criminals are supposed to have
constitutional rights but as his and
other studies show that's not true for
the black population which is treated
more like a population under military
occupation it's not a not a criminal
population actually the drug war goes
down that fine detail when you look
closely there's this there in Columbia
this where the situation is monstrous
there nevertheless are human rights
groups functioning the most active is
Jesuit based a peace and justice group
they just came out with a report on
atrocities in the last year or in this
report but they also include an appendix
on the drug cartels which is kind of
intriguing Columbia's the main sore
you know illegal drugs here
high-technology illegal drugs and there
are two major cartels there's the
Medellin Cartel and the Cali cartel and
they've been treated quite differently
they point out the Medellin Cartel has
been destroyed
essentially the Cali cartel is
flourishing and the authors go into the
reasons the mid-eighteen cartel was
lower class in art lower class and
origins and it had something of the
character of mafia style populism that
is the guys who came up to the top Pablo
Escobar for example I mean undoubtedly
big gangsters but they also would like
build soccer fields and for the poor and
if your kid was starving you know dying
of a disease you could go and they give
you drugs and so on this is a familiar
sort of semi-feudal pattern that you
find the besides they were lower-class
in origin so they were wiped out the
Cali cartel they're just big bankers
industrialists so nobody's going to
touch them in fact they're flourishing
killing people as much as they like as I
say when you look closely at the drug
war you find that in the finest detail
it conforms to the worst predictions
that one might make by following Adam
Smith's advice and asking what the
principal architects of policy are
likely to design for their own interest
Chambliss also points out the perception
of crime as important did not proceed
and motivate government crime laws as
has been claimed by James Q Wilson and
other right-wing scholars rather as
polls show which he reviews the
perception of the issue became became an
issue after it was stimulated by Nixon
right-wing Democrats and others to share
their goals and perspectives the reasons
why blacks are targeted or obvious they
are they just don't have any clout and
they can't defend themselves or the
obvious target and furthermore
engendering fear is a standard method of
population control whether the
designated victims are black sword
or homosexuals or whatever and these it
seems are the primary reasons for the
growth of what Chambliss calls that
crime control industry it's not that
crime isn't a real threat to safety and
survival certainly is and has been for a
long time but the causes aren't being
addressed rather it's being used as a
method of population control in various
ways and those techniques will increase
under the contract with America well in
general it's more vulnerable sectors
that are under attack blacks are one
another's children general in general
there are very easy targets that matter
has in fact been addressed in several
recent important studies one of the best
is a UNICEF study carried out by
well-known US economist Sylvia and
Hewlett it's called child neglect in
rich societies UNICEF usually deals with
poor countries but this one deals with
rich countries and it makes quite
interesting reading Hewlett studies the
last 15 years and she finds a very sharp
split between two different approaches
to children she calls an anglo-american
model and a continental Europe Japan
model others have found the same split
the anglo-american model points out is
in her words a disaster for Children and
Families the European model in contrast
has improved their situation
considerably though the economic
problems faced or more or less the same
like other writers attributes the what
she calls a disaster for anglo-american
of the anglo-american model for children
she attributes that to the ideological
preference for free markets that's only
half true
as I've mentioned whatever one wants to
call the reigning ideology it's unfair
to tarnish the good name of conservatism
by applying it to this form of violent
lawless reactionary statism there's
nothing much to do with markets except
for the poor well causes aside there
isn't much doubt about the effects of
the free market for the more
honorable what culet calls the anti
child spirit that is loosened these
lands speaking primarily of the United
States and Britain this neglect filled
anglo-american model as she writes has
largely privatized child rearing while
making it effectively impossible for
most of the population and the result is
predictable a disaster for children and
families in contrast in the much more
supportive European model Social Policy
has strengthened support systems for
families and children and it shows as
she demonstrates and it's no secret
there's a Blue Ribbon Commission of the
State Boards of Education and the
American Medical Association which
pointed out recently that never before
has one generation of children been less
healthy less cared for or less prepared
for life than their parents were at the
same age though remember that's only
true in the neglect filled
anglo-american societies were an anti
child and a family spirit has reigned
for fifteen years under the guise of
conservatism and Family Values that's a
remarkable triumph of propaganda and a
real tribute to the Free Press and the
intellectual community a symbolic
expression of this disaster for children
and families is the fate of the there's
an International Convention on the
Rights of the Child when the UNICEF
study came out it had been ratified by a
hundred and forty-six countries but not
the only one that counts namely the
United States although for fairness we
should add that Reaganite conservatism
is quite Catholic in its anti child
spirit so the World Health Organization
voted to condemn the Nestle Corporation
for aggressive marketing of infant
formula which kills many children in the
third world
the vote was 118 to 1 well all that's
minor I should add as compared with what
the World Health Organization calls the
silent genocide they're referring to the
11 estimated 11 million children who die
every year as the result
the free-market policies for the poor
and the refusal of the rich to give what
amounts to pennies of Aid another
symbolic expression of the disaster is a
new line of greeting cards from the
Hallmark Corporation one of them says
have a super day at school and it's
supposed to be placed under the cereal
box in the morning the other says
another says I wish I were there to tuck
you in that's supposed to stick out
under the pillow at night the point is
that parents just aren't home
that's one effect of the anti child Andy
family spirit that's engendered by
conservatism with its respect for Family
Values in Park this disaster for
children and families is simply the
result of falling wages state corporate
policy has in fact been designed to
increase inequality radically and it
succeeded in that people have to work
much longer hours to survive for much of
the population as the UNICEF report
shows parents have to work 50 or 60 hour
work weeks to parents merely to provide
necessities and the elimination of such
market rigidities as contracts and job
security means that you work extra hours
at lower wages or else that's the
flexible labor market and under those
conditions it doesn't take a great
genius to predict the consequences and
the statistics show it still going
through the UNICEF study contact time
between parents and children has is down
about 40% and high-quality contact time
when they're really interacting has
virtually disappeared for many families
that leads to destruction of family
identity and values leads to sharply
increased reliance on television for
child supervision are called latchkey
children with rising child alcoholism
and drug use criminality violence by and
against children and other obvious
effects on health and education and
indeed ability to participate in a
democratic society for that matter even
survival I repeat these are not
of nature but they are consciously
designed social policies with a
particular goal which is being achieved
enrich the fortune 500 through powerful
welfare state for the rich while
conducting a what amounts to a war
against families and children and other
benefit electors actually some of the
consequences is this receive a huge
amount of attention and in a very
enlightening fashion in the last couple
of weeks as I'm sure you've read major
journals have had not been lavishing
attention on several new books that are
concerned with falling IQ and scholastic
achievement New York Times for example
devoted an unusually long lead article
in the book review to this topic by
Malcolm Brown he opens by warning that
governments and societies that ignore
the issues raised by the books he
reviews will do so at their peril well
there's no mention of the UNICEF study
or in fact any others I've never seen a
review elsewhere either and or any other
study that deals with the war against
children and families in the
anglo-american societies which could
maybe have something to do with falling
scholastic achievement and IQ but that's
we're not supposed to talk about so what
question is it that we ignore at our
peril
well it turns out to be quite narrow
none of these questions it turns out
that IQ may be partially inherited and
more ominously linked to race with
blacks breeding like rabbits and fouling
the gene pool now there's a real problem
one of the problems the one of the books
that Brown respectfully reviews suggests
that maybe black mothers don't nurture
their children because I'm quoting they
evolved in the warm but highly
unpredictable environment of Africa now
that's real hard science which we ignore
it our peril
on the other hand we may and we must
ignore the social policies based on free
markets for the poor and state
protection for the rich so we must and
Brown does as does everyone else ignore
the fact that in the city where
the articles appear richest city in the
world 40% of the children live below the
poverty line meaning deprived of any
hope of escape from misery and
destitution poverty level in the United
States is twice that of any other
industrial country next in the game is
Thatcher who hasn't quite saturating
'land which hasn't quite reached us and
then you get to the European Japanese
model well could that have something to
do with the following measures of IQ
achievement or the other consequences of
the war against children and families
that's discussed in the unmentionable
studies well such questions we don't the
answer we can readily ignore them and
that's a very natural decision by the
rich and the powerful addressing one
another and looking for justifications
for the class war that they're
conducting and it's horrifying human
effects well these are examples of some
of the uglier forms of population
control there are also more benign
variants which deserves some mention and
the benign variant the rabble are
supposed to be diverted into harmless
pursuits by the huge propaganda
institutions that are organized and run
by the business community they spend
hundreds of billions of dollars a year
incidentally half of it is in the United
States with the goal of converting
people into atoms of consumption and
obedient tools of production at least
when they're lucky enough to get work
crucially isolated from one another and
lacking even a conception of what a
decent human life might be and that's
important
normal human sentiments have to be
crushed they have to be beaten out of
people's heads they are inconsistent
with an ideology that's geared to the
needs of privilege and power an ideology
that celebrates private profit as the
supreme human value and denies people
rights beyond what they can salvage in
the labor market I should say that this
has been going on for a century 1/2 and
is an interesting story in itself and
again I stress not everybody is supposed
to live under market discipline only
poor people the rich are to be protected
by an
or more powerful state and by the global
oligopoly that ensures that policy will
be insulated from politics these
contemporary advertising onslaughts kill
more than the mind and the spirit they
also kill people and on a pretty
impressive scale one major exercise of
state power under Reagan Bush
conservatism was their updating of
Britain's opium wars of 150 years ago
when the British forced China to accept
Britain's exports of lethal narcotics
from its Indian colony and the current
revival relies on the threats of trade
sanctions against countries that are
unwilling to permit free import and free
advertising for today's leading lethal
narcotic leading killer namely tobacco
with just orders of magnitude beyond
illegal drugs and it's lethal effects
deaths from it and so on the advertising
of the US and British giants targets
primarily the most promising new markets
namely young people and women much of
East and Southeast Asia has already
succumbed the u.s. threats these are
backed by cat under the name of free
trade of the US Agriculture Department
also trumpeting free trade gives grants
to tobacco firms to promote smoking
overseas in an effort to stimulate the
profitable slaughter Asian countries
have attempted anti-smoking campaigns
but they're overwhelmed by the miracles
of the market reinforced by US state
power through the sanctions threat
there's a epidemiologist and Oxford
University whose really studied this and
he has too recently studied this he
estimates that among Chinese children
under 20 today 50 million will die of
cigarette related diseases it's an
achievement that ranks reasonably high
even by 20th century standards well
along with democracy and rights markets
are also under intensive attack even if
we put aside the massive state
intervention
at home and international economy
increasing under the Reaganites the
increasing economic concentration and
market control they alone offer endless
devices to evade and undermine market
discipline that's a long story that
there's no time to go into here but let
me just mention with one illustration
about 40% of what's called world trade
isn't really trade at all in any
meaningful sense
rather it's operations that are internal
to corporations which happened to cross
a border like the Ford Motor Company
sent something from one assembly plant
to another happens across a border in
the process that's called trade those
interactions are in fact centrally
managed by a very visible hand with all
sorts of mechanisms for undermining
markets and the interests of profit and
power in reality we have a kind of quasi
mercantilist system of transnational
corporate capitalism which is just rife
with the kinds of conspiracies of the
Masters against the public of which Adam
Smith warned not to speak of the
traditional reliance on state power and
public subsidy there's a 1992 study of
the OECD you know the rich countries
which concludes sorry for the jargon but
translated the English afterwards
oligopolistic competition and strategic
interaction among firms and governments
rather than the invisible hand of market
forces condition today's competitive
advantage and international division of
labor in high technology industries as
indeed and agriculture and
pharmaceuticals and services and major
areas of economic activity in general in
other words what really makes things
efficient is oligopoly you know big
corporations working together and quasi
conspiracies and interactions with the
state power that defends and protects
them that's what really works in today's
economy according to the organization of
the rich countries of the world well the
vast majority of the world's population
who are subjected to market discipline
and regaled
to its wonders are not supposed to hear
these words and in fact they rarely do
again some free advice to those of you
who want to make it in the ideological
institutions you're not supposed to hear
those words or to understand them or
certainly to transmit them to the
general population be a bad mistake
supposed to talk about the miracles of
the market these tendencies are enhanced
by the free trade agreements it's just
another Orwellian term in reality these
pacts are designed to enhance investor
rights not free trade you look at them
closely there's a combination of
liberalisation and protectionism which
is very carefully geared to the
interests of the transnational
corporations that are supposed to
monopolize the technology of the future
the knowledge the future through highly
protectionist devices and of course to
rule the world economy it's very clear
when you look at them closely these
agreements including NAFTA and GATT are
neither free nor are they specifically
about trade and they are certainly not
agreements if by that term we include
the general public which by and large
has opposed them in most of the
countries however politics is insulated
from policy so it doesn't policy is
insulated from politics so it doesn't
matter
these agreements these investor rights
agreements are likely to achieve the at
least enhance the basic goal namely to
accelerate the drift of global society
including the rich countries to a kind
of third-world model a model where you
have islands of enormous wealth and
privilege and a growing sea of misery
and despair well to reverse this course
or at least to stem it and to restore a
bit of respect for the values of
classical liberalism as it really was
and that is the Enlightenment that have
long been forgotten for respect for
freedom and human rights to do that it's
not necessary to repeal the principles
of gravitation it's only necessary to
penetrate the clouds of deceit and
distortion to learn the truth about the
world
and act to change it that's never been
impossible it's never been easy it's not
impossible today and it's not gonna be
easy today there's rarely if ever been a
time in human history when that choice
carried such enormous human consequences
there's a mic there if anybody wants to
put their two or five or 20 cents in
here can you hear yeah okay thanks for
mentioning that demonstration on
November 10th by the way um one thing
that's kind of interesting to people who
are paying attention to what's going on
in East Timor for me in particular as
someone who's involved in the East Timor
solidarity movement is how it's become
possible in the last four or five six
years to talk about what's going on in
Indonesia and even the Washington Post
and New York Times had an article on
Sunday talking about these two more
specifically demographic shifts in the
population and everything else
what's conspicuously absent is any sort
of relevant context that looks at the
u.s. role you know supporting this
genocide and everything else that
usually talked about in the context of
you know Indonesian annexation or
whatever ignoring both the roles in
media and the role the US but the
discussion exists which seems to be
something of an advancement but removed
from context seems to kind of defeat the
purpose of discussion at all I was
wondering if you might comment on the
significance that this discussion has
taken place for those who have tried to
open the discussion of these two Moors
responsibilities and what the
implications are that the discussion is
so removed from its proper context yeah
actually it's an extremely revealing
case you want to learn something about
our own society and culture and values
and so on this is a very interesting
case it's not a minor one it's probably
the biggest slaughter relative to the
population since the Holocaust which
makes it not small
it was mostly the worst part of it was
in the late 70s under the Carter
Administration it's still going on I
just gave the example of one big
massacre where maybe five or six hundred
people were killed which we happen to
know about for the act because the
accidents I mentioned but it's still
going on at the time in the late 70s it
was at about the scale of the Pol Pot
massacres and relative to the population
much larger furthermore it was radically
different from the Pol Pot massacres in
one critical respect though nobody had
any idea about how to stop the Pol Pot
massacres but it was trivial to stop
this one we could simply follow Stanford
one of the principles of the Hippocratic
oath which begins by saying first do no
harm then we'll talk about other things
in fact that massacre was going on
because the United States was crucially
supporting it the Carter the US was
providing it took the invasion took
place with the explicit authorization of
Henry Kissinger and Gerald Ford who meet
Kissinger at once secretly although it
leaked moved to increase the sales of US
arms including counterinsurgency
equipment to Indonesia which already was
90 percent armed with u.s. arms it's now
known from leaked documents that the
British and Americans and Australians
knew all about it in advance and
followed it it was continuing they
before the invasion coverage of East
Timor was in fact rather high
surprisingly high the reason was this
was part of the Portuguese Empire and
there was a lot of concern at the time
that with the Portuguese Empire
collapsing
you know countries might do what's
called moving towards communism meaning
moving toward independence which is not
allowed so there was in that context a
lot of coverage of East Timor as the
invasion took place the coverage started
decline and it declined very sharply by
1978 when the atrocities reached their
peak coverage reached zero literally
zero in the United States and Canada
another big supporter in 1978 the Carter
Administration in fact rushed new
supplies of arms to in
because they're actually running out of
arms and the slaughterer which may be
but then it killed a couple hundred
thousand people where there had been any
coverage of well at all
it was simply repetition of grotesque
lies by the State Department or
Indonesian generals presented as news
and the front page well around the early
80s the change began that you described
there began to be some coverage although
always excluding the American role which
was crucial for example not only in
providing arms and but even diplomatic
support and furthermore it's not a
secret like you read the memoirs of our
UN Ambassador Senator Daniel Moynihan
who's greatly praised for his defence of
international law he describes it in his
memoirs he was UN ambassador when the
Indonesian invasion took place and he
says something like this was close to
exact he says the State Department
wanted things to turn out as they did
and I was given the responsibility of
rendering the United Nations utterly
ineffective in any action it might take
I carried out this responsibility with
great success and then he goes on to
describe the effects which he was not
unaware of he says in the first couple
of months it seems about 60,000 people
were killed approximately the percentage
of the population that the Russians that
the German the Nazis killed in Eastern
Europe during World War two that's what
that's Moynahan the great advocate of
international law and he's right that's
what happened the State Department
wanted things to turn out as he did and
the u.s. ensured that it did the Carter
Administration then came along and
increased the flow of arms the press did
its job by shutting up down to zero at
the peak point well there were a small
there was a very small number of people
who were found who were working on this
literally you know there probably
weren't more than a dozen I mean it was
a tiny group of activists working on it
finally they succeeded in getting
somewhere they began to be some press
coverage some conserved some congressman
it's only mostly conservative
congressmen like Tony Hall got
interested pressure began to develop the
coverage was exactly
you say it completely wipes out the
record the most that the sharpest
criticism that you'll find is the United
States didn't try hard enough to get
Indonesia to stop its atrocities or we
didn't pay enough attention to it just
kind of like saying that you know the
Russians didn't try hard enough to bring
freedom to Eastern Europe you know
didn't pay enough attention to it that
was their problem that's not fair to the
Russians if you consider the comparison
of what happened the by the late 80s it
was becoming real in the United States
thanks to a small and indeed growing
number of activists about a year or two
ago it got to the point that Congress
actually passed legislation banning US
military training for Indonesian
officers because of these human rights
violations which that's putting it very
mildly that was kind of embarrassing for
the Clinton administration but they got
out of it or right they announced that
the law didn't mean what it said rather
what the law meant was that the United
States couldn't train Indonesian
military officers with money from the
United States itself but if the
Indonesian spade for it let's say with
money we gave him from some other pocket
then it was okay well Congress protested
but it went through the State Department
with rare delicacy picked the
anniversary of the invasion to announce
this but things are proceeding just to
give you an example in Boston on the
first anniversary that there's something
happened this week which is relevant and
shows you can really do things there was
a court case in Boston this week where
they where an Indonesian general was
brought under a civil suit by the mother
of one of the kids boys who was killed
in the dealy Massacre her name is Helen
Todd which explains why the civil suit
went through you can figure that part
out she
this suit what happened is that when
Indonesia was carrying out this cover-up
probably run by some big public
relations firm in the United States
after the dealy massacre one of the
things they did was get the generals out
of the way so nobody would see them and
one of them was sent off to Harvard to
study well some local people in Boston
found it out and went to Hartley checked
with Harvard Harvard claimed they'd
never heard of you know but he was there
he was studying and they started
protests began to build up and then came
my favorite Boston Globe headline in
history on the first anniversary of the
dealy massacre had said Indonesian
general facing suit flees Boston and
indeed that's what happened he fled
Boston and hasn't been seen since
meanwhat here the meanwhile the suit
went on there is a law which says that
you can bring civil suits against
tortures and murders and so on if they
happen to be on US soil and he didn't
show up so the the just this week the
judge heard the testimony of Helen Todd
and Ellen Erin and others and was
impressed and he now has a 14 million
dollar fine Inc it's a civil suit in
case he ever shows up it's only the same
thing happened a year before with one of
Guatemala's leading killers general
gramacho the State Department was
grooming to be the next president and he
was shipped off to Harvard also to
refine his skills and that was
discovered he was one of the big mass
murderers from the early 80s he Central
American press people approached Harvard
never heard of him you know but Ellen
Erin is very enterprising journalist and
imaginative he waited until the Harvard
graduation commencement ceremonies which
are televised and as general gramacho
was coming up to receive his degree he
raised up in front of the television
cameras and served him with a subpoena
on television and that one he fled
Boston to and that came to well you know
these things are just show you can do
things I mean there's enough change so
that in the Indonesian is very worried
about it very worried
they and things are getting the point
where they might actually allow a
referendum or something there's
possibility but it's going to take a lot
more pressure among the other things
that are not reported incidentally are
the fact that I have yet to see a word
about this in the United States one of
the main reasons for the invasion of
East Timor which was well known at the
time it's now completely public is that
there's a big oilfield of teamwork and
the Australians and the Western
companies had been trying to make a deal
with Portugal to exploit that oil and
they hadn't been doing too well and they
figured that an independent East Timor
would be really hard to deal with but
Indonesia would be easy because that's
one of their boys they've been running
it for ever since a big massacre that
the West applauded in 1965 so in fact
the Australian records leaked diplomatic
records show that they said before the
invasion we'll do better with an
Indonesian takeover
alright that's been proceeding there's a
treaty signed between Australia and
Indonesia to exploit teamrees oil right
after the dealy massacre the West
reacted by apart from sending additional
arms to Indonesia by 15 Western oil
companies starting exploration in the
Timor oil fields now there are
apparently some promising strikes and
were announced just a few weeks ago
there's also a World Court case
Portugal's challenging it in the world
Court if you've seen a word about this
you've read something I've read this is
the mate one of the major stories about
teamwork so that one's still under wraps
but the point is you know that things
can be done and this is a particularly
dramatic case because there were really
a handful of people doing and you know
they're getting somewhere maybe getting
far enough sort of policy could even
change particularly if there were
parallel efforts in other countries like
Britain is perfectly happy to take up
the slack and make as much money as they
can by selling arms to Indonesia if the
United States backs off so it's got to
be a coordinated effort I just wanted to
get you to make a few comments about two
things one
about how outside the framework of the
like industrial monopolies in the United
States how Cuba has been able to survive
this long and how that can be an example
for change and how people can live a
different way and also how we can help
Cuba and prevent the United States from
destroying what they've created the most
amazing accident I haven't have another
leaflet in front of me Washington on
Saturday November 12th which is called
by the end of the end the u.s. blockade
of Cuba coalition and it calls upon
Clinton to stop using hunger as a weapon
to threaten the Cuban people and to
start talks to normalize relations
incidentally those of you who choose to
go on that March and I hope plenty will
will be joining with the entire world
with the exception of two countries
namely the United States and Israel
which alone voted against the the
condemnation of this embargo at the
United Nations a few days ago New York
Times has yet to discover that fact
there was a vote the preceding year in
which the US was able to get three votes
Israel the United States Israel and
Romania but apparently Israel Uranus
year so you're not exactly in isolation
if you oppose it in fact what the
embargo and the effort to strangle the
decision the forum again
documents are available now the decision
to over the formal decision to overthrow
the government of Cuba was taken by the
Eisenhower administration in March 1960
that date is quite important had nothing
to do with the Cold War to Castro at
that time as any communist there were no
Russians around now the historians have
a different story like the court
historian of the Kennedy administration
Arthur Schlesinger had an article in The
Wall Street Journal recently in which he
opposed the embargo but he said well you
know two relic of the Cold War
the effort to overthrow the Castro
government became because it was
regarded as an outpost of Russian power
and it was fomenting revolution in Latin
America but now those days are over
well you know he knows that that's
complete fabrication the decision the
formal decision to overthrow the
government was long before with Russians
and there were no fomenting revolution
anywhere it was just going on an
independent path and remember this is a
country that the United States has
considered that it owns ever since the
1820s one of the earliest parts of
American history was you know Foreign
Relations was the decision by Jefferson
and John Quincy Adams and others that
this was the country that we had to take
Cuba the British Army Navy was in the
way at that time and they were at the
turrent so the decision in Adams words
was to wait until it falls into our
hands like a ripe fruit by the laws of
political gravitation it finally did and
the u.s. ran it with the usual effects
up until 1959 almost immediately a tax
on Cuba began bombing of Cuba from
Florida and so on
then came the decision to overthrow the
government then Kennedy who radically
escalated the terror against Cuba and in
fact you know two levels previously
unheard of there's nothing comparable in
the history of international terrorism
and in addition came along the embargo
which was you know this is a little
country in the US sphere of influence
I'm going to survive very long against a
monster it was able to survive that
support but barely although it did many
things were achieved it was also pretty
tyrannical up and down side but it was
it was succeeding in terms which were
meaningful to other people which is what
the United States was concerned about
the real crime of Cuba was not the
repression which whatever you think
about it doesn't come close to the kind
of repression we supported and in fact
implemented in nearby countries not even
close
the real crime was
was the successes and the threat of a
demonstration effect that as others
might try to do the same thing that's
what's known as rotten apple that might
in spoil the barrel or virus that might
infect the region or something well in
1991 I guess the next step came along
when when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989
the Russians were out of the game
we know that had an interesting event
take place nobody noticed I mean for 30
years the story had been we have to
defend ourselves against Cuba because
there's an outpost of the Russians okay
all of a sudden the Russians aren't
there so what happens well we have to
harshin we have to make the attack
against Cuba harsher and it's
interesting that the propaganda system
didn't skip a beat you know check back
and try to find that somebody noticed
this all of a sudden it turned out that
we were really we really had them under
an embargo because we're of our love for
democracy and human rights as is
illustrated for example by Colombia or
you know any other thousand other cases
so that's why we're trying to torture
them the Democrats got into the act at
that point a liberal Democrat Robert
Torricelli whose house Latin American
Affairs Committee and he pushed through
something called the democracy
enhancement a Cuban democracy act I
guess it's called which makes the
embargo tighter now this proposal was so
obviously in conflict with international
law that Bush actually vetoed it but
then he was outflanked from the right
during the 1992 campaign by the
Democrats and he then accepted it it was
immediately denounced by all you I think
every huge major US ally went through
the UN the way I described but you know
the u.s. makes its own laws we don't
care what happened the as the ambassador
to the UN said the other day in a debate
if possible we will act multilaterally
if necessary we will act unilaterally
violently she was referring to Madeleine
Albright that's the way it is when
you're the chief mafia dog if others so
if you can get support from others okay
otherwise
do yourself because you don't follow any
rules that's us in this case the the
enhanced embargo has been quite
effective about 90% of the aid and trade
that had cut off was food and medicine
and that's had its effects there are two
major articles and leading u.s. medical
journals last month October which
described the effects of a health system
which was extremely good is collapsing
there's a tremendous shortage of
medicines there's a shortage of
malnutrition is increasing rare diseases
that hadn't been seen since Japanese
prison camps in the Second World War are
reappearing infant mortality is going up
general health conditions are going down
in other words working pretty fine we're
enhancing democracy and maybe we can
ultimately make them as well office say
you know Honduras or one of the
countries that we've been taken care of
for all of these years well that's what
it's all about
meanwhile the commissar class has to
give their version of it you know we
were defending ourselves against the
Russians and then all of a sudden we
discovered we love democracy but anyway
we got to keep crushing it's right now
the United States it's so isolated in
the world that it may not be able to get
away with it no matter how powerful we
are in fact even the US business
community is beginning to have second
thoughts being concerned that they might
be cut out of potentially lucrative
business operations if others just stop
obeying the laws imposed by the enforcer
that's another one that can be pressed
should be pressed the blockade is this
blockade I mean sanctions in general are
free you know very questionable
operation but this one particularly when
they're not supported by the population
targeted this one is particularly brutal
and you know a real major crime in my
opinion anyway things can be done like
this march on Washington my name is
Robert Hastings and I'm live in Columbia
Maryland and I'd like to get your
comments and the irony of the fact that
this version of the talk you're giving
tonight is going to be broadcast on 100
stations coming
radio stations in the United States the
entire nation of Canada by the
organization that I represent and that
it's not gonna be heard here in
Baltimore that this stuff is not picked
up at all in Baltimore and there's no
community radio involvement in this town
somebody did tell me that c-span is
doing it true that's correct
and then of course there's Radio Free
Maine right there's no Radio Free
Baltimore to join me in forming
community radio station in Baltimore and
I'll be taking signups after this event
additionally I'd like any thoughts or
speculations that you have why that in
one of the richest areas in the United
States in terms of frequency in terms of
populace that there's no community radio
station where the East Timor issue is
discussed in earnest where people with
green hair might get some time on the
air and etc do you have any speculations
and why that might be true here yeah I
think so not hard
in fact just ask yourself if you were
one of the principal architects of the
policy and you had the levers of power
and wealth in your hands what would you
care more about a community radio
station say in Boston or a community
radio station in say Boulder Colorado
well there is one in Boulder Colorado
there isn't one in Boston in fact the
farther you get away from the centers of
power and doctrinal control the more you
find freedom and openness not surprising
like nobody cares all that much what
people think about and say you know
central Kentucky but they care a lot
what they think in places like
Washington and its environs in New York
in Boston and so on because they have
decision-making power and I think you
find that that's incidentally why it's
being you know you tell me I take their
word for it this being broadcast all
over Canada but only in very marginal
places here but that's again those are
things that can be overcome
you know these aren't laws of nature at
all in fact you might ask yourself how
come that we're talking about community
radio why not mainstream radio well you
know the United States diverged from the
rest of the world on this issue back
around the 9th late 1920s early 30s when
radio was coming into existence just
coming along radio isn't like shoes
there's a fixed band which is going to
be rationed necessarily and the question
is how is it going to be done well as
far as I know every country in the
certainly every major country maybe
every country in the world except the
United States turned turned radio into a
public a public forum meaning it's as
Democratic as the country is like in
Russia and not democratic and written as
Democratic as England is and so on but
somehow in the public domain the United
States went the other way
it was privatized it was put into
private hands and furthermore that was
called a victory for democracy and and
this is unique when television came
along the same thing happened so now if
you want radio say that's not under
corporate control you have to go to
community radio stations on the mark I'm
very important but of course limited
resources on the margins and so on and
they ought to be built up Thank You grey
with you on that I'm happy to see you in
person I heard you many times on
Pacifica Network quite a few times and
just want to ask maybe a couple quick
questions I mean it could be quick a few
people also are are waiting one
specifically it's like pertains to the
coming like midterm elections for
Congress and the positions on various
congressmen and all of you who bothered
to vote actually which I know is not
many of you better listen up because
this is probably a most pertinent point
regarding who is in Congress and who is
voting on this GATT treaty in December
and I was wondering what is your opinion
on a matter quite a few people nowadays
think that the World Trade Organization
is the de facto government of the New
World Order and the GATT treaty they're
voting on is officially the Constitution
of the New World Order of government
well what is your opinion on that matter
I'm wondering well I've actually written
it's a complicated issue I don't think
you can say anything simple the one
simple thing is I think there it should
at least be subjected to public
discussion I mean the idea this is
something of major significance you know
and the idea of allowing it to be rammed
through on a fast track without public
discussion is ridiculous and grotesque
in fact so whatever one thinks about it
at least it should become a topic for
the general public to become informed
about and to investigate and to look at
and to think about carefully that's
point one that's the easy part
what should happen in that public
discussion well you know if that public
discussion ever comes along I'll be glad
to say what I think what I think is in
fact mixed mixed I mean like NAFTA it's
a sort of a mixed story I don't know of
any major anyone in fact who was opposed
to a North American Free Trade Agreement
or 'the american trade agreement the
question is what kind yeah okay and in
fact like takes a NAFTA very mainstream
groups like for example the
Congressional office of Technology
Assessment can't get more centrist than
that that's Congress's research
organization they came out with a very
sharp and intelligent critique of the
executive version of NAFTA the one that
got passed pointing out that in fact it
was designed as an investor rights
agreement which was going to drive both
the United States well the United States
Canada and Mexico all three of them
towards a kind of a low wage low growth
equilibrium they didn't say high profit
but also high profit and they suggested
very constructive alternatives well that
never entered the discussion you know
that all you heard was oh you know crazy
jingoist
you know don't like mexican workers and
in fact the labor movement was its
proposals were nothing like what was
denounced in the press with virtually a
hundred percent uniformity the labor
Advisory Committee had very which is by
law required to give its opinion on
these things but was cut out of
discussion illegally I never reported
they did come out with a report which is
quite constructive it wasn't against an
agreement it was against that agreement
now when you turn to get it's the same
story you know you take a look at these
thousands of pay I think the thing runs
is huge document in fact if you look at
it it's a big it's a mixture of many
things let me just mention one there
first of all I should say that we're
very ignorant about this here but in the
third world they know a lot about it
like you go to India let's say and you
get hundreds of thousands of people
demonstrating in the streets about some
of the provisions of get which they know
about maybe we're dumb and stupid but
they're not you know like in the in
peasants and understand what's being
done to them which is why God has to be
passed virtually at gunpoint in
countries like India well were they
upset about here's one thing one of the
parts of GATT as NAFTA is what's called
intellectual property rights
intellectual property rights is a
protectionist measure has nothing to do
it is the opposite of free trade it
increases it does two things and a lot
of things but two crucial ones it
increases the duration of patents
meaning if say you know merck
pharmaceutical patent some drugs
thanks to publicly subsidized work in
the universities for example then they
the they get a lot much longer patent
instantly much longer patents than any
of the rich Western countries ever
accepted during the period when they
were developing it's only in the very
recent years they've him an honored
patent rights the United States never
did when it was a developing country so
point one patents are being much
extended secondly they're being shifted
in character
traditionally up till now patents have
been what are called process patents
like if Merck going back to that drug if
Merck figures out a way to create a drug
the process is patented but not not the
product the GATT treaty like NAFTA
shifts
it's not the product that's patent
meaning in the Indian pharmaceutical
industry or the Argentine pharmaceutical
industry can't figure out a smarter way
to produce the same drug at half the
cost and then get it to their own
population notice that this is not only
protectionist it's a blow against
economic efficiency and against
technological progress it shows you how
much a free trade is involved in this
actually there's historical precedents
on product patents I'm sure they're
known that the GATT designers France for
example about early in the century had a
chemical industry but it lost it
most of the chemists chemical industry
shifted the Switzerland which is why
Switzerland is big chemical industry the
reason was France having that product
patents which just you know we're such a
barrier to innovation and technical
progress that companies just went
elsewhere
all right GAD is trying to impose that
inefficiency and opposition to progress
and high cost incidentally on the whole
world know you know this means India has
already been forced to accept it the
couple of weeks ago they what they
called liberalize their pharmaceutical
industry meaning they open it up the
foreign penetration which means that
drug prices all shoot sky-high
more children will die so on and so
forth well you know this is one part of
get I'm in my opinion that's a part that
it's just observed I mean it's not
absurd it's grotesque it's part of the
technique to ensure that unaccountable
transnational corporations monopolize
the technology the future I don't see
any reason to push that through
certainly anyone who believes in free
trade would be opposed to that
so that's one part and you can talk at
other for about other parts you know but
I think you really have to think about
it you know like it's it can't you can't
just have a it's not you can't just have
slogans you know but one thing seems to
me clear we ought to be thinking about
it
meaning shouldn't be ran through the
there are important considerations there
are very important questions at stake
that is a telling point there's a very
debate on this Ghat question
what they're voting for you know who
knows what they're voting for yeah the
hatred of democracy
I mean after was supposed to go through
in a fast track to the only reason it
didn't is because there was unexpected
popular protest
which I just mentioned one thing there's
plenty more to I'm told we can take two
more questions and I the innuendo is I
should give short answers to flight to
say that good.you speech that
globalization of capital is basically an
attack on democracy and working people
give any ideas about how to organize
against the globalization of capital
yeah I mean it's different than if
there's one difference in scale which is
important in the past working people did
achieve many gains but that was within a
national framework and now the struggle
has got to be in an international
framework and that's a lot harder just
to give you an indication of how much
harder let me give an example you know
if the first truck one of the first
tries right after the NAFTA agreement
the Clinton administration was compelled
by public protests to add to the NAFTA
agreement some verbiage about labor
rights and tickets very seriously but
the wording is in there okay right after
NAFTA was passed two big US corporations
I think it was GE and Honeywell fired
labor organizers people are trying to
organize unions at plants in northern
Mexico
okay normally that just happens and the
end of her unions entered UE and another
Union I forget which entered and
protested with the Clinton
administration and they've got some
clout you know like they're not
corporations but they a lot more power
than Mexican either aren't Mexican Union
there's a government you
which is kind of like in Russia and
there's one independent labor union
which is of course opposed to NAFTA but
it's under terrific controls however the
American unions couldn't be completely
ignored so they called for you know the
thing to go to a panel to determine
which means the US Labor Department I
think to determine whether in fact there
had been an infringement on labor rights
when these organizers were fired and
just last week the Labor Department came
out with its decision which was that it
was quite okay because they had legal
recourse under Mexican law and therefore
there was no issue I don't know if any
of you are familiar with Mexican labor
law and the way it's implemented this
doesn't even rise to the level of
polarity you know but anyway that was
the decision so the firing goes through
they're allowed to apply for severance
pay and so on very happy
I'm sure GE is mourning the thing has to
be done it's hard you know it means
first of all transnational popular
organization and struggling against very
powerful enemies like the national
states including those who call
themselves liberal you know but are
really they have other masters so that's
by no means going to be anything easy
but it has to be done the NAFTA for
example even its advocates if if you
look closely even if it's advocates
conceded that it was probably going to
harm in absolute terms the majority of
the population in both Mexico and and
the United States for example its
advocates here said well it's really
good it'll only harm semi skilled
workers footnote seventy percent of the
workforce New York Times had a very
after NAFTA after NAFTA was safely
passed they did their first analysis of
its effect it's very upbeat article
talking about how great it was going to
be for corporate lawyers and you know PR
firms and so on and so forth gonna be
really terrific and there was a footnote
there to it said well you know everyone
can't gain and I said there'll be some
losers
women blacks Hispanics and semi-skilled
labor you know like most of the people
of New York but you can't have
everything and those are the advocates
so yeah it's this is so there certainly
are common interests across the borders
but they've got to be mobilized and it's
hard enough to do it even in one country
doing it across borders is gonna be
extremely hard but it just has to be
done or else you can just see where the
future is gonna go I'm there are very
powerful centralized forces which are
got their own agenda they're not making
much of a secret about it and you can
see where it's gonna lead you take a
look at any third-world country get a
picture of where it's gonna lead and the
question is that we want to live with it
you don't have to these aren't laws of
nature but they're not gonna be easy to
commit one short comment and then a
question first about Cuba I had the
pleasure of going to the Kennedy Museum
in Boston with some former Soviet Army
officers who were reduced to tears from
laughing at the film about the Cuban
Missile Crisis in which the country
Turkey is never even mentioned as a
pretext for Kennedy's for the missiles
Soviet placing of the missiles in Cuba I
just think that's an interesting part of
the ideological war against Cuba the
question I had to ask this whole I
wouldn't call it a debate but this whole
new effort in the media touting the
information superhighway is reminiscent
of the euphoria around television in the
mid-60s about the global village so on
and so forth and I tend to agree with
some of the critics of television that
who have argued that televisions main
effect has been as a medium of social
control dividing people some of the
themes you brought up in past talks as
well what are your views about the
information superhighway is that a force
for democracy is a force for more
atomization or what are its what are the
pros and cons well my feeling is that
it's pretty much like radio and
television
like automation you know the Technic I
mean most of the time you know you can't
you want to say hundred percent but most
of the time technology doesn't care
whether it's used to help people or harm
people it can be used to help people or
harm people but this very very rarely
anything inherent in the technology
which requires that one of those results
be the case and I think the information
Highway so-called is like that depends
who runs it as I mentioned back in the
nineteen twenties late 1920s there was a
battle about who was going to run radio
settle different ways in different
countries on the case of television
there wasn't even a battle just got
completely handed over a private power
here the on when this one we're now
facing another such conflict if it gets
into the hands of private power we know
exactly how it's gonna affect they've
been telling us I remember reading an
article somewhere forget where I think
you may be in The Wall Street Journal or
somewhere talking about the wonders of
the information Highway and this is from
memory so I may not have exactly right
but it was something like this they were
describing the great things that could
be done because it was interactive you
know it's not just passive anymore now
you can really do things when you're
sitting in front of the test so they
said well look but the - you know they
said look there's - you know and here's
the way it's going to work and then they
gave two examples one for women and
another for men for women it's gonna be
an incredible home-shopping thing like
you know you're sitting there watching
some model and she shows you some
ridiculous thing and you figure well I
better have that or my kid won't grow up
properly so now it's interactive so you
can just push a button and you know I
mean you know then they send it right
over or something like that so that's
the interactive stuff for women for men
the example that was given with
something like watching the Super Bowl
which every red-blooded male is supposed
to be doing and now it's just passive
you just watched the gladiators fighting
but you know the new stuff is going to
be interactive so what they're gonna
what they suggest is that before you
know like while they're in a huddle and
getting the instructions from the
about the next play they're going to ask
everyone in the audience you know have
all the male population to which is
alive you know open to to push to make
their own decision like should it be a
pass or a run or kick or something and
then after the play is run they'll flash
on the screen what people thought so
that's gonna be for men some story like
that yeah that's the way it's gonna go I
mean it'll be used as a technique for
control and manipulation and turning
into you know mindless consumers of
things you don't want them so on and so
forth yeah sure why should those who own
the place do anything different but it
doesn't have to be like that it depends
who controls it if it's controlled by
the public it can be something quite
different it could be a technique of you
know for example these these information
processing systems can be methods by
which working people can control their
own workplace without managers and
bosses it means that every person you
know in the workplace can have
information in real time you know like
when it counts to make decisions about
what ought to be done well that's a very
democratizing device it would wipe out
the you know the core of the whole
system of authority and domination but
it's not going to develop and let's you
know unless people fight for it in the
1920s before this whole media apparatus
got so centralized and so
capital-intensive there was a place
namely the partisan press where these
sorts of debates could go on where can
that debate go on and in the age of
television others that in small form
look I mean I'm right I mean through in
fact the late 30s there was still quite
a lively working-class and popular press
and you know in ethnic communities and
labor movement so on and so forth fun I
got wiped out by you know
resource concentration what's called
market forces so the thing is rebuilding
you know let me I think we're supposed
to end now so let me just end with by
quoting a genuine conservative not these
guys not the Newt Gingrich's who were
status you know statist extremists
genuine conservative who was so
conservative that Thomas Jefferson
wouldn't let his works be read at the
University of Virginia when he created
it namely David Hume eighteen a major
eighteenth-century figure who indeed was
a true conservative he has a book called
principles of government and or
something like that in which he
discusses he raises in it but but he cuz
it regards as describes that kind of a
paradox of government and it's very real
and very real today too he said how come
he said look if you look at any
government in the world whether it's the
most oppressive state or the most free
you always find one constant namely
force is in the hands of the government
the people who are being ruled they
basically have the force if they get
together in music so how come they
submit to Authority which almost
invariably is used to harm them that's
the paradox and then he says well of
course forces you know you can control
people by force B says that's not enough
is it ultimately its opinion it's
through opinion only that the governed
submit meaning flood control it control
people's minds you can control them even
though they have the power well you know
that's what the struggle for democracy
has been all about and sometimes it goes
forward sometimes it goes backwards
recent years has been going backwards
but it can go forwards again that means
you know people are certainly capable of
thinking they're capable of
understanding things they need
information they need opportunities they
need forums they need organizations but
those are things that are created by
human will and human activity they don't
grow out of you know they don't come
from molecules meeting or cosmological
forces so you know people want to create
them they create them and that can make
the difference
as human said and indeed feared because
he was a wanted the public to be
involved
okay we got a we got a little bit of
relief the people who are standing there
but nobody more I can't see how many
there are with the light one more four
more
okay you guys get your chance if I could
just before that make an announcement
there are some there are some response
sheets that we've passed out if before
you leave I just want to make sure we
get everybody before you leave if you
could pass them in toward the center
aisle because they're extremely
important to us for scheduling future
guests okay and okay go ahead hi my name
is Bruce crit I'm a student at the
University of Maryland Baltimore County
I never fail to vote but what from what
you're describing about both the
Republican administrations and the
Democratic administrations specifically
Clinton Carter and Kennedy as well as
the Nixon administration I wonder you
know maybe my voting power my ability to
change the system by voting seems a
little bit limited and also of course
the other the other possibility is just
getting in the information out which was
something else that you suggested I mean
even if everybody knew everything that
that you were saying that you're talking
about with regard to the collusion
between the capitalists and the the
government of the United States given
the separation between policy and
politics what can we do even after
everybody in the world knows about these
things even if we succeeded in telling
everybody about all of these things and
everybody knew what do they do what I
mean what specifically what direct
action can the population take what what
are the most important direct actions
that the population can take against
this collusion against this complex well
you know with regard to voting
principal I mean you just make your
decisions I don't think it's it's
usually not a major decision like it's
not going to be effect on things it may
have some effect on things so you just
decide like is it important enough to
have an effect in this in that case and
there's no general principle but on the
other question what can be done well you
know everything can be done everything
can be done up to the point of
eliminating all structures of authority
and repression they're all create their
human institutions they can be
dismantled if you ask yourself what's
the most important well you know then
you know we that's not the kind of thing
you decide in a meeting like this I mean
those are the kinds of decisions that
come by serious thought among people are
really trying to institute change now
you know typically the I mean given the
world the way it is you start with where
the world is okay like you don't start
by saying ok let's overthrow
transnational corporations ok I think
that's what because it's just not within
range so you start with saying look
here's where the world is what can we
begin to do well you can begin to do
things which will get people to
understand better what the source of
real power is and just how much they can
achieve like you can start by say first
we can start by getting us to stop
torturing people right like there's easy
things to do or getting you know stop
killing children and Cuba let's say stop
you know massacring in East Timor those
are easy things so let's do those first
do the easy things with regard to the
domestic scene takes a crime the crime
bills I mean they're just like I said
they're the domestic equivalent of death
squads the fact that they're targeting
vulnerable populations who are being
turned into people under military
occupation look that's not that's an
easy one to change I mean you really
just have to change opinion on that one
get you know that's it's it's the you
aren't striking at the core of private
power when you begin to have a civilized
criminal system instead of a brutal
barbaric one so that one I think is
changeable what about the war against
children and family
another case that I mentioned well
that's another easy one I'm in the Anglo
you know the European Japanese model and
suddenly it's not perfect I don't want
to suggest it so beautiful except in
comparison to errors but those are
countries very much like us you know
they have the same institutions the same
economy and so on and so forth they have
simply you know not been subjected to
the unilateral business power as much as
here for all kind of historical reasons
and we can certainly become like those
countries you know there's in fact a
model sitting or in frontier countries
very much like us takes a health care
well you know the u.s. is off the
spectrum on that one - again I think for
the same reasons I mean even if you just
look a couple of miles to the north
there's a country very much like us
which happens to have instituted a semi
civilized again plenty of things wrong
with it but a semi similar civilized
system of health care not that far back
back in the 1960s under conditions that
we can easily duplicate well those are
things that I don't want to say those
things will be easy but they're within
range on things like GATT are you
getting at the harder territory because
here crucial interests of authoritarian
institutions are at stake and then
you're going to begin to face the fact
which after all is a fact that sooner or
later you have to face that maybe the
most Italian institution in human
history are certainly close to it as a
corporation it's an institution which
with pat win which authority goes
strictly from top to bottom if you're in
ultimate lee it's in the hands of owners
investors if you're inside the system
you take orders from above and transmit
them down if you're outside the system
there are very weak popular controls
which indeed are eroding I should say
that this is not an inside of mine that
was pointed out but Thomas Jefferson in
his later years when he warned these
just the early days of corporations he
warned that if kryb if you if power was
going to shift into the hands of what he
called banking institutions and moneyed
in corporations
then we then the democratic experiment
would be over we'd be back to an
absolute reform of absolutism worse than
what they struggled against Thomas
Jefferson is not exactly a figure who's
off the spectrum an American you know
American history so you know this is not
a new insight it's as American as apple
pie we should recognize what Thomas
Jefferson could see in fact Adam Smith
but when you see that you realize that
it's a hard nut to crack because there
are enormous agglomerations of power
indeed concentrating and indeed
transnational which are protected from
scrutiny or from popular action and
that's got to change after all why do
corporations have the rights they do why
are they treated as immortal persons
contrary to the warnings of people like
Adam Smith and others it was not by law
you know this was by decisions made in
courts and by judges and by lawyers
which simply changed the climate totally
and that can be reversed to institutions
can be under popular control including
the economic institutions well you know
organizing to try to achieve that is a
much more long-term operation but it's
got to begin somewhere you know so if
yes what should be done well you know I
don't think any sane human being and
look around at the world around them and
not figure out things that have to be
done I'm gonna take a walk through
Baltimore you know you'll find plenty of
things that have to be done so you know
you get started doing some other broader
and scales so you know you think about
those but they're not going to people
you're not gonna do them alone like if
you take a walk down the streets of
Baltimore and you say oh yeah that ought
to be done nothing's going to happen on
the other hand if people are organized
enough to act about it yeah they can
achieve things and there's no particular
limit what they can achieve and that's
why we don't live under slavery or under
feudalism and so on mentioned specific
organizations that are involved that
they're involved in breaking apart this
collusion if you want I know you can't I
know you can't mention specific actions
but can you mention organizations that
are involved in working on this problem
specifically the problem of collusion
between corporations and government
are involved from different points of
view for example I mean like take say
that one level which is important though
of course official Nader's Public
Citizen is involved but that's important
as I say but kind of not really touching
the structure of power beyond that I
mean any you know if the American labor
movement ever recovers the insights that
ordinary working people and in fact the
labor movement had a hundred years ago
it'll be working against them you go
back a hundred years and in fact up
until much more recently than that and
the major you know the major thrust of
the labor movement was what was
sometimes you know industrial democracy
placing the workplace under Democratic
control I mean that wasn't you know you
didn't read that in Marx I mean
everybody figured it out after himselves
long before Marx and that's the he
didn't he in fact didn't say anything
much about it the this is you know and
in fact just about every you know any
there's tons of activism going on on
usually focused on pretty narrow issues
but they all ultimately they're all
talking about illegitimate authority of
one form or another and their interests
and are common and you know they just
they have to be built up and extended I
mean I you know I have my own views too
if you want some lists you know it's
easy to find there's easy to find lots
of lists so if you write to any of the
major funding organizations Lex they
resist in Boston they'll be delighted to
give you a list of a couple hundred
groups they funded in the last couple of
years and you will find among them
groups involved in anything you can
imagine or if you go to eat some I mean
I'm sure there's some church based group
and either Baltimore or Washington I
don't know they're seen well enough
which is a center for you know a
coordinating Center for all kinds of
peace and justice activities now you'll
find anything in the world they're just
about and
that happens everywhere thank you very
much I just have two questions that I'm
gonna sit down do you see the American
political system hidden for a civil war
and second of all do you see the bread
lines of the Great Depression rain is
here to get it in the contemporary stage
which we live in today speaking of the
industrial country right so of course in
the world it's all over yeah well with
regard to the bread line first of all
the US has I mean I thought the last I
saw there about 30 million people and
then according to the studies that have
been done about 30 million people are
suffering hunger in the United States
the takes a Boston where I live which is
a very rich City and in fact may be the
world's leading medical center there's
you know there are very fancy hospitals
but there's there's also a hospital that
works for you know that's the City
Hospital so like everybody goes to say
they a couple of years ago they
established a malnutrition clinic
because they were beginning and after
the impact of reaganism was felt they
were beginning to defined in Boston
third-world levels of malnutrition and
if that got worse over the winter
because families had to make a choice
you know do you let your kids starve or
you let them die the cold no okay that's
you know one of the richest cities in
the world major medical center I mean
bread lines are if we don't have bread
lines we have the equivalent over a 30
million people's a lot of people and
that's plenty of children and so on and
it's going to grow you know what about I
mean it's not starvation like say Haiti
you know a Nicaragua Cuba or something
but it's probably worse than Cuba in
many places but it's real and it has
long-term of things I mean when kids are
suffering malnutrition that has a
permanent effect has an effect on their
lives you know they'll never get over
the and that that's just criminal in a
country as rich as this or anywhere for
that man
as to the civil war you know I'm not I
think it's very much up in the air
what's gonna happen in the United States
there's an experiment going on the
experiment is can you marginalize a
large part of the population regard them
as superfluous because they're not
helping make those dazzling profits and
can you set up a world in which
production is carried out by the most
oppressed people with the fewest rights
in the most flexible labour market and
production is for the rich people of the
world so this can be done
internationally now it's not like the
old days when economies are more or less
national so can you get you know I say
can you get women in China to work in
factories where they're locked in and
they die in factory fires you know
because as this happening incidentally
can you get them to produce the toys
that are sold that are sold in stores in
New York and Baltimore where rich people
buy them to give them to their children
for Christmas and that's sort of to give
an example that's a real example
incidentally can you have an economy
where everything works like that so
production by the most impoverished and
exploited for the richest and most
privileged internationally and with
large parts of the general population
just marginalized because they don't
contribute to the system in say Columbia
murdered in the knee in New York locked
up in prison can you do that nobody
knows the answer to that question could
it lead to a civil war it definitely
could it could lead to uprisings you
know revolts there are other things to
worry about the United States happens to
be an extremely fundamentalist country
it's kind of like Iran sort of if you
look at it it's a deep it's a religious
fundamentalist country that's again off
the spectrum in this regard it's not
like other industrial countries none
come close and that's a very dangerous
phenomenon my opinion it means that
there's deep irrationality which can be
whipped up by demagogues you know the
Newt Gingrich
these guys can whip up hatred fear you
know they can appeal to religious
fundamentalist urges and so on and
that's scary scaring most of the world I
should say if you recall the last
Republican National Convention it opened
with God and country rally which was
televised and I was seen around the
world and in Europe particularly it
really sent chills up people's spines I
mean they remember the new Hitler's
Nuremberg rallies you know at least
older people do and it had something of
that tone and it's kind of striking you
know unnatural that the Republican I
don't mean say the two parties are all
that different I gave some examples to
illustrate the opposite but there's some
difference between the Republicans are
openly and outspokenly the party of
business they don't make much of a
pretense to be anything else and that
means that the only way they can rally
the public is behind jingoism fear
hatred slander you know other techniques
which have been used quite effectively
to can to organize great masses of
people in times of real distress we
don't have to go back very far in
history to find that Germany in the
1930s was maybe the most civilized an
advanced country in the world all right
it was possible but but plenty of
problems and it was possible to whip up
hatred fear and to mobilize people and
in fact to carry out certain you know
what from their point of view was social
development even and you know with
consequences that you're familiar with
yeah that could you know why are we
different we've got the same genes and
the conditions in the culture that might
be part of the background for that they
exist on the other hand there are other
things it this is you know that there's
a streak of Independence and opposition
to Authority in the United States which
is maybe also unique in the world that's
a very healthy thing can show up in
antisocial ways like running around with
assault rifles but it could also show up
in healthy ways and the trick is to make
it show up in healthy ways like
opposition to legitimate Authority which
it could do
this is maybe the country in the world
that most protects freedom of speech I
happen to think that's a very good thing
I know a lot of people don't agree but I
think it is and that was won by
centuries a struggle
I mean freedom of speech was achieved in
the United States really through the
civil rights movement which finally got
the Supreme Court to knock down the
centuries-old laws against the criticism
of state power that came right through
the civil rights movement well you know
those are gains that are real and that
offer a basis for doing things so you
know it's complicated the yeah could it
be a civil war could be very unpleasant
a lot of very very ugly things could
happen they're not inconceivable but
they're also not inevitable
how you don't my name is Albert wood my
question is a what question you all
studied linguistics so that means I
guess language as an extension
communication one of the biggest
problems or the biggest problem is
communication most people don't
understand each other don't hear each
other don't listen to each other more
important than anything else what do you
think are some ways of getting people to
like weird aquire how do we reach other
people because we have basically
understandings we all appreciate the
same idea use different words express
ourselves how do we reach the average
person out there when the mass media is
controlled so the TV and radio are out
sure you got the home computer and you
got more copy shops in a little bit and
Kinkos open 24 hours a day but most of
the people can't read the information
and even more of them don't understand
what they have read what are you some of
your ideas because I work with an
organization that is trying to reach
people better on it on a common level to
just to do just that thank you
well first of all let me just I think
one preliminary point I'll answer that
question as a human being and which I
have no more to say about it than you do
but I'm not going to answer it as a
linguist because linguistics tells me
it's zero about that topic and in fact
that point can generalize take any
question of human significance and the
fact of the matter is there's very
little understanding about it nothing
very little in the sciences or the you
know people pretend otherwise that's for
power reasons and career reasons and so
on but outside of a very small number of
areas like physics and mathematics and
actually linguistics is one of them
outside of extremely small number of
areas which usually which happen to deal
not with problems of immediate human
significance the level of understanding
is fairly shallow meaning it's as
accessible that it's accessible to
everybody you know like I learned a lot
of the stuff I know from people who
never went to school
no and that's standard because the level
of understanding is just not that
profound so you're not gonna go to the
sciences or you know to find answers to
these questions you can get pretences
from
you know the educated sectors about
answers but not the only pretenses you
know the answer your question as well as
I do so you know we you and I can talk
about what to do about it and I got no
more to say than you do and in fact I
don't think there are any tricks it
seems to me the tricks are the old ones
if there are any new ideas they've been
kept a deep dark secret
I mean organization is a hard job you
know it begins by getting people to be
willing to let's take sake places that
are much worse off than we are
like take say Latin America you know
where the suffering is much worse than
here well you know back in the nineteen
sixties and seventies elements of the
church the churches did begin to face
this problem and they began in a pretty
sensible way dealing with the culture as
it existed
so you most should know the story it's
an important one they began by setting
up communicate going in peasant society
in among peasants or you know workers or
whatever women any group they started by
setting up you know what came to be
called based communities where people
would do things like read the Gospels
and think talk to each other about what
it really meant you know and then work
on things no I mean I remember seeing
some of these base communities where
they were trying to get people to get to
geek peasant societies or often very
hostile you know and one that I went to
they there was actually a very
conservative order of nuns we're trying
to get local peasants to agree to work
together enough so that they could get a
common well okay you know instead of
each going out with a cup of water to
try to pick something up from the you
know stream well you know that's that
was hard and it it when it's done bigger
things I mean it got to a point in
Central America where you and I had
spend our tax money to have these people
murdered because that's what happened in
the eighties there was a big war fought
to destroy the people who were trying to
do that
you know it's symbolic that it but real
that the decade started with
assassination of an R
bishop and ended with the assassination
of jesuit intellectuals all by forces
armed trained and paid for by you and me
no and what happened in between was just
more slaughters in terror and massacre
because people were doing we're
answering the kind of question that
you're asking but under much harder
circumstances we don't face those
circumstances and what you know and
organizers including priests and nuns
and others did in Latin America we don't
face those problems it's a lot easier
for us and I don't know of any tricks
that they didn't figure out or that
haven't been figured out through history
it's just a matter of going out and
doing you want to organize people fine
you go organize people I mean I somebody
the first questioner raised the question
of East Timor boy if you can think of a
case that would be hard to get people
interested in that's one you know
Americans by and large don't even know
that Canada exists you know let alone
that the East Timor exists but so this
went on in secret you know nobody was
interested everybody
in power wanted it to go on but a half a
dozen or so people finally managed to
break through how by the ordinary
techniques that we all know that you
know lobbying organizing pressure groups
letter-writing you know everything
that's where you do it there are no
other ways
- quick question first what is the
political ramification of the crime bill
yes as it relates to the new world the
new crime right as we relate to the
world order and also what is the
relation of the world order to the
family value that is being charted
across America that is being crossed
America add to what I said before I mean
just to summarize the I mean the crime
bill I think is a natural reaction on
the part of the people who sort of own
the society to the problem of a lot of
superfluous people around who aren't
making profits for them well a natural
reaction if you if you're living in El
Salvador El Colombia or someplace like
that a natural reaction is actually what
they call down there social cleansing
you send out the security forces to just
murder people in the streets like the
Brazilian police you know where we had
this success story of american-style
capitalism one of the parts of success
stories and Brazilian police just go out
and murder street children you know they
murder them that's all okay that takes
care of that problem here the crime bill
I think fulfills a similar objective it
controls parts of the population that
are defenseless you don't have to worry
about them and that are superfluous in
the sense that they're not contributing
to profits oh that's a definite part of
the new world order because the new
world order is turning most of the world
into two-tiered societies you know with
little sectors of wealth and a large
mass of poverty and you got to control
them so that's the crime bill Family
Values yeah I think it's just what I say
it's just what the unit's not me though
what the UNICEF report described again
very mainstream report I was quoting
there has indeed been a war in the
United States and England and to some
extent the other anglo-american
societies like even as far as New
Zealand there's been a war against
families and against children because
human values are being as part of the
general attack on human sentiments and
human values which remember are
inconsistent with capitalism now you
know we don't have a capitalist society
as I said it's a very you know the
wealthy want a real powerful state to
defend them a capitalist society
wouldn't survive for five minutes but
we're sort of off toward the capitalist
end of the spectrum and in a capitalist
society if it was pure your rights would
be what you can earn in the market
period you know of any other rights and
since we're sort of off to that end of
the spectrum and we try to impose those
values on essentially defenseless and
vulnerable people okay
children don't have the right to be with
their parents parents don't have the
right to take care of their children
because you don't get there that's
that's a human right you don't win that
right isn't conferred by the labor
market therefore it doesn't exist
so therefore ippolit the design of
policies happens to be such as to
undermine those rights it's kind of
irrelevant if you don't have rights
other than those you've been on the
market so the fact that these societies
led the war against children and
families is understandable and not
pretty particularly when you think that
these are the most advantaged societies
in the world I mean we're the richest
country in the world just by a long shot
there's nobody who comes close you know
you took a look take a look the natural
advantages of the United States in terms
of resources and opportunities and so on
there's just no one close you know I
mean once the native population was
exterminated and eliminated you just had
this extraordinarily rich place you know
unparalleled wealth you know they had
slaves to build that to keep cotton
cheap for you you know so you could have
an industrial revolution everything you
know capital flowing in no enemies I
mean just happened to be you know kind
of an ideal place to become very rich
and powerful and wealthy and we're way
beyond anyone else so the fact that we
have these problems is it's bad enough
that anyone does but you know the fact
that we have them is an absolute
disgrace what it shows us that the
system is a social and economic system
is a catastrophic failure and it doesn't
have to be
you know we have the resources to make
it better but of course left alone it's
going to work towards undermining values
that don't express themselves as
commodities on the labor market on the
market and that includes like relations
between parents and children so the
usual questions that we decide to let it
happen
