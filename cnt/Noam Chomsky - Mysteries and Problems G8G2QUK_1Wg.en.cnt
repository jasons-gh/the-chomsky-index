there's a conceptual distinction between
mysteries and problems we don't know
where various aspects of the world fall
in those two categories that's an
empirical question but the conceptual
distinction nevertheless remains I mean
assuming that we're not angels let's
assume that we're organic creatures okay
if we're organic creatures we have a
fixed cognitive structure otherwise we'd
be angels okay so we have some fixed
cognitive structure like any other fixed
structure of the organism it has a scope
and it has limits we are genetically
programmed so that we can become humans
and not bees okay but we're not
genetically programmed so we can become
anything if we were if you could become
anything you'd never become any you'd
never becoming anything at all you know
just be some kind of a meat boy creature
so we have internal structure that
directs the process of growth in certain
ways allows some changes not others due
to the environment that new intrusion
and maybe some days people figure out a
way to turn on bat into a mouse or
something but there's a limit you know
and the same has got to be true of our
cognitive structures unless of course
we're angels
so if we're not angels then we have
cognitive structures which are going to
have scope and limits okay that yields
the distinction between problems and
mysteries mysteries will be what lies
beyond our cognitive limits which must
exist lesser angels our problems will be
things that are within our cognitive
limits now let's go to the question of
vitalism there's an open question
whether it's notice that the problem and
mystery is a biological concept it's
relative to the organism so what's a
problem a mystery for say a bee is not a
mystery for me necessarily I'm
transversely because we have different
cognitive structures so if the notion is
relative to humans it's a normal
biological
just like the visual system say for my
granddaughter can become mammalian but
not insect the same sort of the same
thing
but the question of what lies within the
two categories is an empirical question
to be discovered
so perhaps it was believed at one point
that life is beyond our cognitive reach
it's a mystery for humans okay it was
discovered that it's not beyond our
cognitive reach Hume and Locke argued
that the preference of motion are beyond
our cognitive reach and Hume said it was
greatest discovery was to have
demonstrated that as far as I understand
there as far as we know that are correct
but it's an empirical question maybe
someday we'll be able to comprehend not
just the theories of motion but the what
Locke and Hume and Galileo wanted
comprehend they really understand how
these mysterious properties work instead
of being mystified by the fact that you
know I can move the moon by moving my
hand as we are but they're just two
separate issues and Churchill is just
missing the point
there's a conceptual distinction then
there's an empirical question of what
lies within these domains so I take
particular cases like sea consciousness
we have no idea maybe it'll turn out to
be like like motion we'll be able to
develop a theory of it but it won't be
but the company but we won't be able to
conceive of how the theory works so it's
like the fact that I can't conceive of
the fact that when you take a drop of
water and you it's an electric current
through it it ends up with two passes I
mean I know it happens because I learned
it in a chemistry course but I don't
have the kind of conception of it that
Galileo and the founders of modern
science aimed for we've given up that
hope doesn't matter what we can conceive
of anymore we accept what the best
theoretical explanations give us and it
may turn out
we're likely will turn out that the that
the that Priestley's approach to
consciousness namely discover try to
discover the organic structures that
yield these phenomenon
maybe that will yield a result like
Newton's theory of motion X explanatory
theory but not we now consciousness is
called the hard problem in the 18th
century the 17th century motion was
called the hard problem in fact the same
terms were used it's the hard rock for
philosophy so we competitive
contemporary of Newton's and the reason
is that motion just what luck said
motion has properties that we cannot
conceive of which is corrected that so
we've given up the hope of conceiving of
them and just you know developing
theories of motion and it's not human
for example described Newton's greatest
contribution as demonstrating that there
are mysteries his term which the human
mind will never penetrate and he meant
the mysteries of motion those mysteries
were never solved they were abandoned
sinus just took them or a less ambitious
course aiming for intelligible theories
rather than comprehending mysteries
which by their very nature we can't
comprehend that's all that's Hume
already
