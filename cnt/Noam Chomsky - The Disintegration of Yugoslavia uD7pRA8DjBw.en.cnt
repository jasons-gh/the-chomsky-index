with regard that this integration of
Yugoslavia actually the u.s. role was
not honorable but it wasn't the worst as
the u.s. in fact was in favor of
maintaining the integrity of you former
Yugoslavia as incidentally where most
people in the country in polls at that
time but it started this split off the
first one this would off with Slovenia
okay that was not a big problem Slovenia
is pretty much part of the West anyway
so a small conflict but nothing much the
next one the split off was Croatia and
that was a big issue because I think
about a third of the population of
Croatia is Serbian and this was then
part of Yugoslavia
so when Croatia pulled out the
Yugoslavia army entered to try to
protect the integrity the country and
the Serbian minority well at that point
the main villain was Germany a Germans
initiative they Germany wanted to
restore a traditional relationship with
Croatia which is not very pretty if you
happen to remember the Second World War
but they wanted to restore that and you
know kind of reestablish their position
of influence and the Balkans
so they strongly supported Croatian
separation without any rights for the
Serbian minority nothing and they
brought the European Union along with
them and so it continued Clinton more or
less picked up the Muslim Bosniaks
so-called them was in a population of
Bosnia I suspect because they just
wanted have a horse in the race I mean
everybody had their friends we're going
to pick that one there was a chance for
a political settlement in 1992 the van
so and plan Clinton pressured is it
above it the head of the Muslim
community in Bosnia to rejected now that
was a guarantee of a major war just a
guarantee and after that came a major
war maybe a hundred thousand people
killed the
maybe seventy thousand of them Bosniaks
finally there was a settlement which is
not very different from the van so
implant but it was a settlement that was
carried out at us initiative the Dayton
plan and so the u.s. ends up with a
substantial degree of influence and
control there well that's 1995 Serbia
was still a problem and the reason why
Serbia was a problem is in fact
described in important documents that
are known but not discussed the there's
an important book by John Norris he's a
high official in the State Department
his his superior immediate superior with
stroke Talbot who was the Undersecretary
of State for East European affairs of
the top guy and the Clinton
administration dealing with this region
strobe Talbott in his introduction to
the book says John Martha's book is
based this is about Cosmo Kosovo he says
this book is based on Norris as complete
familiarity with all relevant documents
and if you want to understand the
thinking at the highest level of the
Clinton administration this is the book
you have to read oh is John Norris a
take a look
he says the bombing of Serbia was not
undertaken out of concern for the plight
of the Kosovar Albanians which
incidentally we know from masses of
documentation about what was going on he
said it was because Serbia was not
undertaking the required social and
economic reforms they're kind of a
euphemism to say for saying it's the
last holdout in Europe to our neoliberal
designs okay according strobe Talbott
that represents the highest level of
thinking in the Clinton administration
well I've quoted it a couple of times
and people have asked to tell button
Horace about it and they passionately
reject this description as oh no that's
not what we thought at all well you know
I don't read their minds that's what
they wrote okay so you can make your own
judgments
it's all on paper don't take my word for
it read it and I suspect that that's
pretty close to the reason for the
bombing of Serbian they're just not it's
like other is another reason for
believing is its characteristic of the
whole just about the whole of the modern
international relations and for with
other countries when they were Britain
when they were the dominant world power
you do not tolerate disobedience
disobedience is dangerous it firstly you
don't want it in the first place but
secondly if somebody's disobedient
somebody also get the idea and they'll
be disobedient - that's the virus
contagion theory and it just runs
through the whole of the great power
politics since the singer war that means
mostly the United States because the US
has been so dominant but the same with
other powers and in fact it is I think
it represents what I said before that
I'm kind of simple-minded and I think
with all the fancy talk in international
relations Theory there's only one
principle that I know of it seems to me
to have any merit and that's the Mafia
principle international relations is
very much like the Mafia
The Godfather does not accept
disobedience and for you know like if a
small store key then it doesn't matter
if it's an important country or not
so suppose some small storekeeper that
doesn't pay his protection money well
The Godfather doesn't just send out his
goons to pick up the money
sends out the Kuhns goons to beat him to
a pulp so that others will understand
the disobedience is not acceptable and
we have a rich documentary record I
mentioned a little of it but there's
plenty more to show that that's been a
guiding principle of great power
politics and anywhere you look and it's
an understandable principle of course
there's a task of intellectuals and
that's to write editorials like the one
I quoted in The Boston Globe which is
Universal I don't want to dump on them
our noble efforts aren't we
King so let's try something else but if
you look at the record
that's the Mafia principle successful
defiance the threat of a good example
you've got a smack you got to punish the
population and I think that's probably
what's involved in Serbia with regard to
Serbia and in fact as Serbia moves
towards accepting the correct social and
economic reforms as they're called
they'll be admitted into light society I
mean there's a residue of antagonism
because of the huge outburst of emotion
stirred up by the educated classes but I
suppose it'll go in that direction
