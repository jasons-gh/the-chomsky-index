I happened to have just returned from
greensboro north carolina small but
famous town in 1964 students from a
black college in Greensboro decided to
sit in at a restaurant in Woolworth
store they were arrested harshly there
others replaced them their courage lit a
spark unexpectedly and helped inspire a
mass popular movement that brought quite
significant changes to American society
now the store is one of the main civil
rights museums in the country it's not
the only case if the tinder is ready a
spark can set off a conflagration and
that's what happened with the Occupy
movement it burst forth last September
suddenly and unexpectedly and very
quickly spread to everyone's surprise
quickly to thousands of communities in
the United States many abroad all over
the world the tinder was certainly ready
after more than 30 years of neoliberal
assault against the populations of the
world with harmful and often devastating
impacts almost everywhere and there have
of course been reactions some of the
most important were in South America in
the past decade South America has
largely broken free
in the past decade that's after 500
years of subordination to foreign forces
in the last century or so mostly the
United States the Arab Spring which is
still a work in process is driven in
part by similar concerns there are
militant and dedicated student strikes
in many places in the Western Hemisphere
from Chile to Quebec in Europe the
resistance to the destructive austerity
programs of the past few years is
widespread and growing and there's a
great deal more regard the Occupy
movement in a few short months it has
really registered quite remarkable
achievements the movements have brought
fundamental issues to the forefront of
concern issues that had been festering
in the margins for a long time quite a
range of constructive programs have been
formulated and implemented to varying
degrees and beyond the policy domain
another major achievement of the
movements has been simply to create the
communities of mutual aid solidarity
cooperation with spaces for free and
open interchange and discussion that's
something highly significant and sorely
lacking in our increasingly atomized
societies of course achievements like
these quickly elicit repression power
does not simply disappear in the face of
challenges there are substantial
barriers to moving forward if these can
be overcome if the movements can deepen
their roots in the society
and draw in much larger sectors the
long-term impact could be of historic
significance it won't be any easy task
but nothing worth doing ever is
