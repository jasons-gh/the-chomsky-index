hello gnome it's really good to see you
it must be morning in Arizona it's
evening here in Islamabad
are you well okay excellent don't
there's a whole lot of things that I
want to talk to you about but let me
start with this it appears as if the
world is retry Bowl izing we're going
back to our primal tribal loyalties to
religion to nationalism and you see this
just about everywhere you see this with
brexit with the rise of the ultra-right
in Europe with Donald Trump in the
United States and here in Pakistan
you have just bloodletting with Sunnis
killing Shias and everybody after the
ahmadies and the christians and the
hindus and in india that seems to be a
country that's just gone mad with their
protection of the cow what's going on
there was a time of the European
enlightenment and I know that you admire
John Stuart Mill very much have we given
up on the advances that humans had made
in those times what's going on for one
thing remember my age I was a child in
the 1930s and I from a child's point of
view nevertheless could observe what's
happening this country was totally
collapsing a huge unemployment
starvation and nothing working in Europe
Germany Italy had fallen under fascist
rule years before I was born
the US was in fact supporting Mussolini
openly the Germany had fallen to Nazism
by the early 30s by 1938 Austria had
fallen
jalaja was taken
Spain was being conquered by fascist
government Franco as you may know the
first article I wrote was in that I can
remember was in February 1939 when
Barcelona fell and the article was about
the inexorable rise of fascism which
looks it's going to take over the world
with everything collapsing here without
going into detail that Japan was
carrying out horrendous atrocities in
East Asia it was just horrifying much
worse than though so it's not new we've
been through much worse periods much
worse in fact if the war had lasted
another year a Germany might have
actually won
it's no joke in the you take a look at
us now that we know about us planning in
the early years of the war thirty-nine
to about forty three all told Stalin
drug the after Stalin run a u.s.
planners were planning on a future world
which would be partly us dominated and
partly German dominated that is half
part large part of the world most of
Eurasia would be under Nazism are we
facing that I mean it's bad but it's not
that so to say that there couldn't have
been a harsher attack on the
Enlightenment than Nazism supported by
leading figure like Martin Heidegger
who was writing in 1935 that Germany
under the Nazis is the only hope of
saving the magnificence of Greeks of the
Greek heritage from the barbarians of
East and West I mean it's bad now
I agree but not that so first of all I
think we should keep the sense of before
him second and there are other cases
during the first world war was just
horrifying
right after the first world war in the
United States the Woodrow Wilson's
administration launched a repression
which is the worst repression in US
history
thousands of people were deported huge
numbers imprisoned the labor movement
destroyed independent thought was
destroyed was a deep harsh repression
we've never had anything like it since
so you look over history and look a
little back further in the 19th century
what was the United States doing it was
running the worst most hideous system of
slavery in human history
it was exterminating the indigenous
population step by step carrying out
well into the late 19th century attacks
that by now are understood even by
scholarship to be literally genocidal
not a pretty history and the British
were administering famines in India
which killed tens of millions of people
on while it was plenty of food around
but it was Imperial policy went on till
1943 when Churchill decided that people
in England needed white breads on so a
couple of million people in Bengal had
to die that was then it's bad now but
not what's happened before there's a lot
of inquiry and what's happening now so
let's take know several things are
happening in the Western world the
United States and Europe we've had he
took a look at the post-war period post
Second World War
it's basically two years now there was a
period in 50s in the 60s which had the
highest growth of American history no
financial collapses fairly Galit Aryan
first opportunities since reconstruction
for african-americans to somehow enter
into the system some progress and civil
rights a lot of things wrong with
substantial progress that lasted into
the 70s seventies he hit a switch
significant switch and social and
economic policy and the reasons for when
you look at
- one of the main ones is that the rate
of profit was declining as a result of
militancy of labor and other activism
and there were clear statements about it
Powell memorandum a lot of Commission
report others about the excess of
democracy and you have to return things
to obedience authority is all across the
spectrum could go into it and then come
the shift to the neoliberal policies
which have had the anticipated effect
they have restored the rate of crop
there has been there has been growth not
as in the past but substantial wages and
incomes for the majority have stagnated
or declined in 2007 at the period of
euphoria about the amazing new Great
Moderation the wonders of the
neoclassical economics that we problem
solve 2007 right before the crash the
real wages of American workers were
lower than they had been in 1979 when
the neoliberal experiment began the that
the stagnation or declines of the
population and the heart sharp
concentration of wealth is part of a
self-reinforcing cycle the policies
contribute to that the concentration
contributes to political power which
carries the policies further that's
there's been crash after crash with
deregulation we now have but the outside
of the Republican Party we have a
recognition at least there's a serious
problem with the climate given not
ignoring hearing that's been done about
it in Europe in many ways even in even
work the dirty programs in Europe and
run by the Brico have significant
interests of all the whole European
system the way it's designed is simply
undermining democracy
a democratic decision-making is being
moved from the hands of people through
their national state to an unelected
bureaucracy of the European Commission
unelected the IMF and the central bank
that's that's it it's troika the people
have almost no say and the policies of
their governments that are living with
unimportant issues and they know it
are you getting a sense of anger all
through Europe and the United States
about the centrist the centrist
institutions you know they're called
senator electrician or the right but the
main establishment institutions like the
political parties that have been running
the countries for contempt they're
solving the French elections they barely
participated the American elohim's the
striking fact about the American
election was the election of a kind of
an anti-establishment Republican that's
not so surprising but the enormous
successes the Sanders campaign which
broke with over a century of US
political history
no no contribution mostly bought
elections no contributions from any of
the major sources media disregard or
contempt the most popular politician in
the country of probably would've won the
Democratic Party nomination that binford
party managers as the center's
collapsing reason I think is traceable
back to social political developments
that are taking place there's more the
neoliberal form of globalization that
was instituted in the nineties and since
has magnified all these problems the
what's called free trade but it's not
free trade as little do with trade
altogether highly protectionist investor
rights systems which are
setting working people in competition
with one another all over the world well
thanks for putting things in perspective
and yes I'm happy that you see that
things are not as bleak as they are but
although what you say has a lot of
expletive our for what's happening in
the United States or brexit and so forth
but it doesn't tell me very much about
why the Islamic world has exploded in
this rage rage against the United States
rage against its own self why you have
these Gura chucks in India who are just
tearing apart Muslims and then such
peaceful people
as the Buddhists they've gone after the
Rohingyas I just don't understand what's
going on now let's take Burma it was a
fairly democratic system through the not
great some kind of parliamentary system
the United States at the time was bring
everything to it to attack China and one
of the things was setting up Chinese
nationalists and tribal forces in the
north of Burma to carry out attacks
against China the and that fed back of
course led to chaos and disruption
finally a military dictatorship took
over okay that was the end of Burmese
parliamentary democracy he was a
horrible military dictatorship finally
in the last couple of years it slightly
relaxed someone but not totally the but
the Muslim attacks on the disgraceful
monstrous atrocities the government and
including Shuki who oughta know better
are supporting it
India's complicated story there's not an
in the histories can be pretty ugly I
mean the caste system in India is just
ah it
disgrace last time I visited I visited
Indian I guess no and you remember and
going from Calcutta to Lahore the
difference was shocking I don't have to
go through it wasn't pretty
there's a lot of wealth and in the
tremendous wealth a lot of enlightenment
and a lot of awful things it's the
mixture of the most extreme mixture of
wealth high culture enlightenment
hideous poverty and disgraceful look
existent living standards that ever seen
maybe you see something like it in a
small circle Central Africa but this is
a huge country so it's a very mixed
story right now there's a regression in
the Islamic world it's been under attack
for hundreds of years
there's been the Syria right now is the
most awful place the take a look at
Syria hundred years ago the Ottomans
carried out a horrendous attack against
Syrians Syria probably lost more people
during the war fortunately than any
other country a hundred thousands people
are killed well no no that's Syria we
can go through the rest it hasn't been a
attractive picture there wasn't
parliamentary government in Iran what
happened to it well made the mistake of
trying to control take control of its
own resources so the u.s. carried out
and instigated a coup which instituted
the role of the Shah annually was
receiving the almost no bitter
condemnation tremendous the
international and others about his this
is a horrendous human rights record then
came the overthrow of the government
1979 what did the u.s. do immediately
supported an Iraqi attack
against iran david strong support even
to the extent of reagan denying Saddam's
responsibility for the awful atrocities
against courage tried to blame it on
Iran the US even permitted Saddam they
gave him a gift that's rarely allowed to
anyone and he was allowed to attack an
American ship the killing several
doesn't seamen and to get away with the
tap on the wrist real friend Israel and
the Liberty is the only analog I can
think of
finally the US pretty much won the war
for Iraq hundreds of thousands of
Iranians are killed the chemical weapons
used we can go on in country after
country that's been the Middle East the
that's not best the US the French the
British plenty of internal criminals you
know run through it so now right now
maybe the it's now the work for the last
couple of years the worst monstrosity
has been Isis where'd that come from
was there Isis before the United States
invaded Iraq I mean the invasion of Iraq
among other crimes incited sectarian
conflict that barely existed before it's
now tearing nominate that country but
the whole regional part of one of the
outbursts was Isis it's that these
things are not happening in a vacuum now
you take a look at them you can see a
sources for all of them
they Moulton this is anything like these
things has multiple causes but among the
causes and often quite significant among
the causes are the actions of the most
enlightened states well thanks for that
I pretty much agree with all that you
said but the United States is a
declining power it's no no no no longer
close to anything of what it was 50
years ago instead we are seeing the
China
is coming up and it's coming up very
rapidly you see its effects here in
Pakistan very visibly there's a Chinese
Pakistan economic corridor they're
beginning to dominate industry over here
the building roads and you see Chinese
people all over the place now so I want
to ask you know if we have a world
that's dominated by China than the
United States is this going to be a
better world a more humane world one
that runs according to rules one that
will be less imperialistic should we
expect a more humane outcome now that
the u.s. is in decline well I don't
think it's a remote possibility I mean
it's true that the United States is
declining power it's been a declining
power since 1949 the peak of u.s. power
was in 1945 at that point the US had
maybe almost half the world's wealth
incredible security controlled the
hemisphere both oceans sides of both
oceans
other industrial societies had been
either devastated or severely weakened
the US economy had boom during the
Second World War the engine depression
industrial production almost quadrupled
they're just sitting on top of the world
in fact planning to run the world well
something happened in 1949 the first
blow to this hegemony the event was
called in the United States the loss of
China took many years before people
started noticing some a little odd about
that truth and by now people will
qualify but for decades it was the loss
of China the under the presupposition
being wheel in the world and we lost
China so that's terrible thing was a
major fact in US domestic policy now the
basis for McCarthyism arch repression
when John F Kennedy
was wondering whether to escalate in
Vietnam afraid that he'd be accused the
loss of Indochina and this huge attack
on American power and from then on
declined by the early 70s the world was
economically pretty much tri-polar with
a North American us-based Center
European German based center and a North
East Asian at that point Japan the
center not comparable in power but
economically independent fairly
comparable actors in fact you may recall
in the 1980s
Japan is number one fears Japan's might
take over the world
well of the United States that has
somewhat declined since about that point
maybe u.s. share of worth world wealth
was maybe 25 percent lower than had been
after the Second World War
that's declined somewhat since up tilt
things are changing with Trump Trump may
in fact contribute to a rapid decline in
u.s. power that's a special phenomena
he's isolating the United States now
even from its close allies but putting
that aside the long-term tendency which
I suspect is not going to change much is
the US will continue to be militarily
just beyond any comparison Dhoni left to
talk about
economically a very powerful state that
that's is leading because in the
contemporary globalized system the
system that's developed pretty much
since the 90s with complicated value
chains a corporation of an Apple
Computer the profit is mostly in the
United States but it's put together
assembled in China under mostly under
control of the Taiwanese company the
parts and components come from South
Korea and
small enterprises all over the place of
making little pieces of it the offices
are in Ireland so don't pay taxes that's
the biggest company in the world you
take a look at the globalized economy
that's developed turns out the US
company US corporations own about half
the world economy that's probably even
more than us power in 1950 and that's
not a major that's usually used but it's
becoming a significant measure national
accounts still mean a lot but not what
they did 50 years ago now there and of
course these corporations are based in
the United States supported in the
United States both in subsidies and
militarily and diplomatically and so on
but I think we're much on the world
China's not anywhere near you take a
look at the sector after sector
manufacturing retail commerce wherever
you look at US corporations are one
occasionally to China's the word of its
name China is a growing developing power
it has it's a poor country take a look
at rankings and the UN you know
Development Index it I think it ranks
around 90 as if something has enormous
internal problems that the West doesn't
have enormous ecological problems of it
as demographic problems that there was a
bump of demographic bump for about 20
years of people of working age both
people work males most of the females to
have working ages it's declining it's
being that's it's it's moving
significantly in many directions but has
enormous problems what China is doing
and Pakistan is part of this is
expanding its system of social and
economic control to the West that's been
going on for some years with the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization and
all the New Silk Road projects
goes into Pakistan building a new port
got our pork try to avoid the the
stranglehold that the US and its allies
have on the lot of straits of oil into
the West and it's this is going to
expand
India's now part Pakistan Iran sooner or
later I'll be reading Turkey went into
Europe and eastern Russia's Iberia's
part of it and that's a building the
Asian Development Bank Shanghai this
gonna become more and more important or
every country outside the United States
including US allies dissipating the u.s.
withdraws from world affairs
very shortly under Trump but it's been
going slowly now the Chinese influence
will of course increase is it benign far
from it
Chinese developments in Africa or no
they do build things which the African
use with the British in India - the
overall effect is pretty ugly and you
can expect it to be this name but home
things anywhere near a power on anywhere
near the scale of the United States well
once upon a time the United States had
the power to make and break governments
here in Pakistan and the US was all over
the place they they gave arms to the gay
fighter jets destroyers whatever to the
Army Navy and so forth and they had
enormous power but that's no longer true
now it's a fading presence over here
instead you see that it's the Chinese
fighter jets which the Pakistan Air
Force has and China is everywhere
everywhere and it's a sweeter the our
friendship is sweeter than honey and
higher than the Himalayas and all that
sort of stuff should thinking Pakistanis
being worried
about what's going on in terms of our
relationship with China should be
worried about any great power
China's won and in Pakistan and what you
described is quite true but in the world
that's still a very partial and small
part
I mean China's in China's presence you
see everywhere they go to South America
say Brazil Chinese goods all over the
place of the trading relations and this
is part of the serious problem of South
American a Federative elip has been
reliance on their rich resources of
primary products in recent years being
sucked up by China in return China sends
cheap manufacturing goods which
undermine domestic manufacturing in
industry so yeah that's a real problem
but it's not on the order of
overthrowing governments instituting
military regimes invading economic
massive economic controls and so we're
near the power of the Western imperial
powers the u.s. obviously the Britain
and France as well know here in Pakistan
nobody seems to be worrying about
nuclear weapons very much but we've
entered an extraordinarily dangerous
phase where we have exchanges of
artillery fire across the line of
control practically every day and then
on the other hand Pakistan has gone in
for tactical nuclear weapons which are
relatively easy to use and very hard to
control
and similarly India's going in for
nuclear submarines and nuclear launched
ballistic missiles and so forth now
things seem to be getting very dangerous
here but it's even more dangerous in
North Korea where there's such a dense
nuclear standoff at the moment with the
North Korean regime developing missiles
and
even the hydrogen bomb how do you see
this panning out are things in our
control anymore well we have to take
each case on its own not take Indian
Pakistan as you say India development
Pakistan then responded um as long as
Pakistan tries to match India militarily
Pakistan they just can't compete with
India they can't match the clear weapons
program which is a devastating threat
not only the South Asia through the
world so how did package know that first
are you still hearing me because I says
your internet yeah well at first the
United States opposed Indian nuclear
weapons development and at least
formally it did show up until the George
Bush administration which decided to
support it varies trickery which we
wanted to go through but it in and ended
up effectively giving us support for
Indian nuclear weapons and in the
twisting the arms of the international
nuclear control group to get them to
kind of authorizes the what about
Pakistan in the 1980s under zero hook
Pakistan began to develop nuclear
weapons the Reagan administration
pretended that they didn't know it's
inconceivable that they didn't know with
all their intelligence assets in
Pakistan defies belief
but they pretended they didn't know if
they wanted to keep funding Pakistan to
carry out their policies in Afghanistan
nothing to do with helping the Afghans
the CIA chief in Islamabad is you may
recall them they that are very explicit
he said we're not there to help the
Afghans we want to harm the Russians I'm
gonna make the Russian lead so for that
this parade Afghanistan and watch
silently well ex-nun develop nuclear
weapons
now the basic conflict correct me if you
think this is wrong but it seems to me
the basic india-pakistan conflict is
probably over Kashmir and until that's
settled in some fashion or I think you
can imagine settlements a fiasco
ultimate sensible proposals for
settlement I think they could be pursued
if they could be pursued then maybe
Indian Pakistan could relax the military
confrontation and maybe move towards
what ought to happen all through the
world and as partially happened already
setting up of nuclear weapons free zones
could imagine moving to a South Asian
nuclear weapons-free zone as has
happened in the Western Hemisphere apart
from the US and Canada the Pacific in
Africa almost Africa has a nuclear
weapons free zone but it's never gone
into effect because of Diego Garcia the
u.s. insists on maintaining a huge
nuclear presence on the island versio
which the Africans regarded as part of
Africa now Pacific has a nuclear weapons
free zone almost the you could first
France blocked it because they wanted to
carry out the tests in their islands
there more recently the US has blocked
it because it wants to store nuclear
weapons and have nuclear weapons passage
through its possessions there but it
almost works the most interesting is the
Middle East now right now we're facing a
major comeback to North Korea we're
facing a major potential crisis in the
case of Iran the administration as you
know has announced they're going to
decertify
right then comes the question whether
Congress will impose sanctions if they
do that kills the US Iranian deal might
go on with Europe that the u.s. around
partl drop the ran may react
and if they do what happens next well
you can listen to the Republican
senators the leading ones on the right
Tom cotton says as soon as we find
they're doing anything will bomb
towards the other end the what's called
on are what you call it the adult end of
the Republican Party crazed
alright but the sort of sane end like
you have which is bob Corker just
retired because he can't handle the
craziness what he said is our strategy
is to try to derive drive we ran into
some kind of violation and if they carry
out a violation then BOOM
that's the same side that's what we're
facing in Iran now what's the problem
with Iranian weapons the US intelligence
has made it very explicitly say the
problem is it will be part of their
deterrent strategy and the rogue states
the United States and Israel can't
tolerate the deterrent he didn't say
that of course I'm adding it but that's
what it comes down to
so looking part of the nobody's saying
things that don't ever use the clear
weapons that could be a deterrent and
the states that like to rampage freely
in the region don't want out the turns
around so if in fact Iran acts in a way
which the administration and Congress
can claim as a violation maybe Israel
and the US will get in and bomb to then
what happens half the world was up Norma
Willa is there a settle is there a
possible answer straight for the
Europeans no the answer in fact
everybody in the world knows the answer
just continue with the agreement the
agreement my view was too harsh on Iran
it's another story but they've accepted
it they're living up to it so pursue it
is there a further possibility no
further possibility is too
he runs proposal to his advocacy of the
of establishing a nuclear weapons free
zone in the Middle East that would be
very important
Iran's in favor of it the non-aligned
countries have been pushing it for years
the United States and Britain are
committed to it committed to it I will
say it but when they decided the bomb to
attack Iran not in 2003 as a pretext
they invoked a treaty that an agreement
with Iran back after the Great War and
if you read that agreement take a look
at article 14 it says the US and Britain
will be committed to establishing a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East
nobody can refer to that for publishing
but can find it so everybody in the
world least in theory is in favor of it
it never happens because the u.s. blocks
it that every uh nuclear usage everyone
periodic nuclear review decisions last
one in 2015 but is that a possible and
of course everybody knows why exactly
why it would mean that Israel's nuclear
weapons would have to come in turn under
international inspection the u.s. monks
upman israel of course so that is there
a long-term solution there yeah possibly
we've covered most of the world except
for North Korea is there a possible
solution they're young and in fact
everybody knows what it is except the
Chinese proposal with Russian support
and North Korean acquiescence for a
double it's called the double freeze
North Korea freezes its nuclear weapons
programs the United States calls off
threatening military maneuvers on North
Korea's borders like know that nuclear
capable oh bombers flying right at the
border that sort of thing and the North
Koreans have some Emmer's going to go
into it but North Korea was absolutely
wiped out and a savage assault mostly
after the war had settled down at the 38
era
pure savagery talent real crimes and
remember like bombing dams and so on and
so forth so that's a first step in a
solution what comes next
negotiations diplomacy could they
succeed they could in fact if you look
at the record I've got to go through it
but every time when there have been
repeated times when an agreement was
reached in 2005 even an agreement in
which North Korea agreed to dismantle
its program in return for some
concessions by the West like the United
States that means like an ending of the
threat of aggression providing a Loeb
uranium enrichment plant for research
and medical purposes not interfering
with financial actions and so on
the Bush administration immediately
backed off so North Korea started
building weapons again and in fact
they're it's a horrible place no doubt
but it's been playing kind of
tit-for-tat diplomacy that could
continue so there are possible answers
there two of the sunshine policy of
South Korea for a time was a move
towards relaxing tensions commercial
cultural other interactions might break
into the North Korean system which is
hideous no down but it is the regime is
committed to survive its own survival
not surprisingly and there is also
committed economic development there has
been some economic development in the
past years that can be exploited as a
move towards more peaceful relations
maybe denuclearization of that region so
I think everywhere you look
in fact what about the major nuclear
powers well as I tell you they are
committed on the non-proliferation
treaty to good-faith efforts to
eliminate and there's enough pressure
maybe that could happen so I think there
is a
horrible threat and danger but it's not
out of human control
it's all under human control every point
it's quite incredible know that you
wrote your first article in 1939 you've
had a lifetime of activism you've been
fighting against all the wrong things
that the United States has done but do
you see the world as being better today
as compared to let's say the end of the
second world war which we can leave out
as a as a period of major atrocities but
subsequent to that do you see any kind
of hope or improvement as time has gone
on you know there's Steven Pinker's book
the better angels of our nature and of
course you must be familiar with it he
says that over the last 5000 years or so
or since recorded human history we've
been steadily improving is that the case
if we look around it doesn't seem to be
so good what do you say about that well
let's put that biggest book aside I
think it has many people um's
but now part of it is correct since one
major part is that since 1945 the
European countries have recognized that
they cannot play their favorite game
anymore for centuries
Europe was the most savage place in the
world
horrible Emily the 30 Years War in the
17th century had probably killed a third
of the population of German European
savagery then expanded over much of the
world with consequences on earth to
describe that that was recognized in and
the last paroxysm was of course the
second world war and it was recognized
by 1945 I can't play that game anymore
if there's a major war among the
European powers were all bit ok that's
finished so Europe has been at peace
which is not a small thing you look at
the past centuries that's a huge thing
another document that's true I don't
think it ain't do with the better angels
of our nature
I think it has to do with the worst
Devils our nature which created means of
destruction which will wipe us all out
and recognition of that is a major
factor and this is very significant
change I should say the scholarly
literature has a different explanation
is it's democracy you're skeptical about
that another trick thing is that since
the Enlightenment there has been among
the separate population a period of
advance of rationality moral commitment
recognition of human rights and so on
but we should remember that the period
of the Enlightenment and afterwards was
the worst period of Western imperialism
with horrible consequences all over the
world I mean the Western Hemisphere no
populations maybe 80 million people went
down hundreds of thousands and a bit in
the northern part maybe 18 million down
to maybe a million nursing a huge
slaughter for all kind of reason that
was the period of in life but for part
of the world it is quite true that there
was significant moral intellectual
progress and it's extended in in the
last I think take the United States
country I know best obviously that's a
much more civilized country than it was
50 years ago and many respect women's
rights for example norms change civil
rights are very awful that there's some
improved opposition to aggression has
increased substantially when the u.s.
invaded
those practiced who appears worst crimes
in the Second World War took years
before any purpose develop that's
changed there's also the beginnings much
too late at the beginnings of serious
concern about the environmental
catastrophe which is going to do us in
unless significant steps of taking and
finally there's growing recognition of
that don't means enough for some I mean
all of this is progress there's not
total progress
there's also regression things go in all
directions
but I think that general tendency in the
long run and stores somewhat more humane
and civilized societies well thanks for
that
it's been a long interview and I'm going
to let you go but there's a last
question you've had a very long life of
activism and academics and you've seen
things go downhill but you've never
given up what is it that keeps you going
what is it that keeps you giving hope
and keeps giving you that energy to just
go for it
lot of good things as a pension then
there are a lot of bad things
oh you're a terrific guy now it's it was
such a pleasure talking to you take care
bye good the top you
