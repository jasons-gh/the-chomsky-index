the real issue in early January was do
we pursue do we pursue the diplomatic
track and see if the options for
peaceful settlement are real that's one
option the other option is we go to war
and destroy two countries and create an
ecological catastrophe and lead to who
knows what monstrosity is that follow
those were the choices but those choices
were never presented because the
possibility that there might be a
political peaceful political settlement
that was not even an option
[Music]
what role did television news play
during the Gulf War
did it really investigate events
allowing the audience to scrutinize
government policy as the media is
supposed to order it serve to assist the
administration in gaining public consent
for the war although much has been made
of the censorship used to limit the
coverage of the war our position is that
television coverage is always already
influenced by economic and political
interests that is by corporate industry
and government although corporations and
government were not completely United in
their position on the Gulf War they
comprised the sector of society which
benefits most from controlling the oil
wealth of the region within this context
television itself must be seen as a
corporate industry dependent upon
advertisers corporate profit margins and
most importantly they need to sell
viewers back to sponsors in addition TV
news relies upon government for its
major news stories and is wary of
alienating its sources how do these
economic and political interests
influence coverage I view it as an honor
to be here to come to Raytheon the home
of the men and women who built the Scud
Busters the high-tech weapons have
become the stars of the war Tomahawk
cruise missiles there is a system of
domestic power that's not a great secret
that has an enormous influence on
everything that happens in the society
it it directly determines production
consumption patterns and so on and so
forth
it strongly influences in fact largely
controls the political system pretty
much limiting it to two factions of a
business-oriented party and as far as
the media are concerned they are simply
part of that system
it says an ABC News special report on
the Gulf War
we are a public corporation for people
who buy our stock asking us to deliver a
return to them I have always considered
myself a banker I am a banker I am an
officer of a company that uses other
people's money and invests and we try to
use it carefully so I I think it's
wonderful that our news department is
profitable and they are simply major
corporations parts of even larger
conglomerates like any other
corporations they sell a product to an
audience to a market the the market in
this case is advertisers other
businesses and for the agenda the major
media the product that they sell is
basically audiences and privileged
audiences
[Music]
you say okay you are selling widgets and
your widgets are for the 18 to 49
population we happen with this program
XYZ to deliver a hundred thousand
viewers in that age group so every
hundred thousand dollar for every
hundred thousand we're gonna charge you
all ten fifteen twenty thousand dollars
quite obviously it's the the news
product is going to reflect the
interests and the commitments of the
sellers the buyers and the product
unfortunately it is they present a
picture of reality that conforms to the
needs of power and power in our own
society happens to be largely vested in
a state corporate Nexus so that's the
way and as far as the Gulf War is
concerned it's just that's the way the
preliminaries to the war were presented
that's the way the war was presented and
that's the way the post-war periods for
in the relationship between television
on the one hand and government and
corporate interests on the other is not
simply one of direct control
in fact audiences accept television news
more easily if it appears to be
objective and neutral but these
professional codes that result in what
audiences perceive is objectivity
neutrality or what need examining as
they tend to present televisions
constructive view of reality as the
truth there's no such thing as pure
unmediated communication communication
is always structured by particular codes
and conventions or by specific
rhetorical and representational
strategies so that it's not so much what
people say as how they say it that
affects the meaning that we make what's
can be most ideological about television
news however is that it always works to
deny that there's any mediation that
it's involving any kind of structure or
conventions and one of the key ways that
that happens is by making it seem as if
the anchors talking right to you this
newscast is also employing many of the
same codes and convention
used in TV news for example our position
as anchors leads you the viewer through
the newscast and directs what you should
look at next in that way we seem in
control paradoxically even as we hide
our control and seem to be depicting
events as they are so the anchor does
things like looks right at the camera in
a direct address and uses personal
pronouns like I and you and we and all
of that makes it seem as if it's direct
kind of face-to-face communication and
as if we're all within the we that he's
talking about what that does is it
establishes the shared sense of
complicity with TV and it establishes
the sense of sincerity what the anchor
does is kind of directs our look kind of
tosses his look and directs what were
CIL's to look at so that he leads us
along a particular path without it ever
seeming as if we're being led as if
we're being directed and correspondent
David Barrington has this report on what
happened there we hope that through
acknowledging the use of these
conventions and revealing that we are
not necessarily speaking an
authoritative truth we will suggest that
this is always the case in other words
rather than offering us a clear window
on the world we would argue that all
television news offers a filtered view
of reality by offering this alternative
view we hope to encourage ways of
watching television more critically in
summary we'll examine how television
news covered the Gulf War our analysis
will be framed by two questions asking
first
how do corporations and government
influence coverage and second how does
TV work to gain public consent for
government action by shaping viewers
understanding of world events
[Music]
the world anxiously awaits as the threat
of war looms over the Persian Gulf why
the war peace prevails in the Persian
Gulf region the world will be watching
live special when the press goes to war
tonight 6:30 any significant political
decision deserves a thorough historical
analysis there was much the preceded
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on august 2nd
1990 and the subsequent massive
deployment of American troops however
televisions so-called histories told us
little about this context intended to be
either irrelevant or functioned as
elaborate justifications for military
action
[Music]
[Applause]
for centuries American and European
colonialists have walked all over the
Middle East a long history of colonial
presence in the Persian Gulf is obscured
by up-to-the-minute newscasts that
define our knowledge of the Middle East
by filling this time with slick
aesthetic views of war profit seeking
media corporations have silenced the
debate on u.s. foreign policy but you
really have to read the media just or
any other product of an ideological
system you have to read it defensively
most of the choices already are made
before the information or the picture of
the world is even presented the choice
is already made by the system of
assumptions and presuppositions in this
program we haven't set out to do an
in-depth historical analysis of the
reasons the United States went to war
instead in the next five and a half
minutes we'll begin to look at a few of
the assumptions we felt the US media
left largely unquestioned in its
coverage of the Gulf crisis the citizens
of the United States were very
uncomfortable with the idea that we
would somehow sacrifice both US lives
and the lives of Middle Eastern citizens
in merely for an economic benefit the
White House immediately shifted their
their stance and began to try to portray
Sodom Hussein as a Hitler and to try to
point out to the American people that we
were not in it for the money we were not
in it for the oil but we were interested
in trying to to stop aggression Saddam
Hussein in my judgment is a reflection
of our policy Saddam Hussein is not a
person Saddam Hussein is a phenomenon
which is reflecting us Saddam Hussein is
a mirror image of the u.s. policy we
could have known long before that the
Bush administration in the Reagan
administration we're doing everything
they could to protect Saddam Hussein
because he was just their kind of guy
and
they managed to switch him from a
Russian client in 1980 to a largely
Western client by 1987 because they
liked it the idea that somehow Iraq
would cut off oil supplies in order to
somehow deny the West a those supplies
for political reasons is really a
ludicrous proposition in a for single
product suppliers it's absolutely
important that they be dependent on
market forces so Saddam Hussein had he
even had he taken over all of the oil in
the Gulf region would still have to sell
it and would still have to sell it at
market prices ambassador Alma shot of
Iraqi ambassador to Washington several
months ago came to Harvard and he was
talking about the oil and he said that
if you are willing to sell oil based on
the $18 of the previous invasion of
Kuwait we are not gonna drink oil he
said it's not so much the access to the
oil you know if we were on a 100 percent
solar we'd follow the same policies but
control over but control over the oil
production pricing and levels and so on
that gives a certain leverage in world
affairs the United States did everything
within its power to frustrate and a
diplomatic solution to this problem
there were negotiations that were that
it started within hours after the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait nevertheless every
time one of these diplomatic processes
got started the United States
essentially threatened our partners in
the region threatened the Saudi Arabians
and the Kuwait ease with us withdrawal
if diplomatic solutions were we were to
be pursued there was a debate over
whether sanctions would work there was
no discussion over whether sanctions had
worked well the fact is is very good
evidence that they had worked at least
it's very hard on other
grounds to explain why Iraq produced a
series of withdrawal proposals from
mid-august right through early January
it seems very clear to me that once Iraq
had invaded Kuwait the United States had
already decided to go ahead with a
military solution to the the problem and
was not going to be deterred by any kind
of diplomatic moves
[Music]
why were these historical facts not
presented on television why in fact if
the coverage was to be balanced were
there so few anti-war voices heard when
protesters were given television
coverage they were represented as rabble
or ragtag crowds this undercut the
credibility of the anti-war position as
such footage contrasted sharply with the
images of military and pro war experts
from here to here is about 200 miles
it's important to think about the use of
experts on TV and the kinds of experts
that TV news shows to interview which
were largely military experts it's not
that they never showed anything from the
anti-war movement it's merely that the
way that they represented the anti-war
movement always worked to invalidate or
D legitimize that movement they were
always only shown as kind of crazed mob
or you know people holdovers from the
sixties anti-war movement who had
nothing new were interesting to say
about what was happening now as opposed
to people who were authorized to speak
to you the viewer in San Francisco the
anti-war cause has been hurt by violent
incidents a police car burned smashed
windows along the demonstration route we
will be right back after this important
announcement
number one have you driven a Ford lately
least in the early days the days leading
up to January the 15th before the
hostilities broke out the ads tended to
be fairly standard in their format when
I got the sense that the advertisers
hadn't rescreened the ads particularly
for the crisis this means that they
tended to focus during the news on the
regular items investment opportunities
and so on intended to focus on Don to
use slice-of-life scenarios to construct
them the pain weber add for instance
focuses on competition aggressive
professionalized expertise the Ford add
though is interesting in that it seems
to to begin to reflect the the changing
nature of the times the one doesn't know
whether the ad was in fact written for
The Times the words of the ad our call
it leadership call it winning call it
anything you want the simple fact is
Ford is number one and because this is
written before the hostilities what I
seem to remember was that at that time
there was a great deal of tension
anxiety among the American public no one
was quite sure how the events would turn
out so that when one finds an ad
speaking of way number one it has it has
a rather different ideological
significance than it would have after
the war in which America had so brutally
triumphed at this stage I think is a
great deal of anxiety about the ad it
was after the deployment of American
troops in Saudi Arabia and during the
lead-up to the bombing campaign the
debates around censorship began given
that television had failed both to cover
anti-war positions and to give an
adequate history of the region one could
argue that the fact of censorship had
already receded in importance television
censors itself in picking and choosing
certain pieces of information over
others while the same time covered this
process of selection and presented it as
truth at least since World War two a set
of grim at least since World War two a
set of ground rules emerged which the
press readily and voluntarily accepted
don't give away battle plan
a number of casualties while the battle
is raging etc the government broke with
his axis in 1983 in Grenada they imposed
a total ban on entry and access of
American correspondence to the
battlefield a great furor broke out and
the government promised not to do it
anymore they proposed instead a standing
pool system that would be given early
access during any u.s. invasions but in
Panama the next battle the government
failed to mobilize the press at all five
months after an investigation of what
went wrong in Panama the mobilization
took place in the Gulf
it seems clear that in this war as in
Grenada and Panama the government has
continued to exert more and more control
over the media it could be argued
however that the corporate interests
behind the media bring it in line with
government agendas in my view there's
very little censorship and if to the
extent there is any censorship the media
accept it only by their choice for
example during this war there were
journalists like Robert Fisk of the
London independent who just broke out of
the press pool and went his own way and
nobody's putting him in jail the press
the nobody told the press suppress the
Iraqi proposals for a diplomatic
settlement no one told the press when
George Bush says there will be no
negotiations you're supposed to write an
art an editorial lauding George Bush for
going the last mile for peace the
effects of self-censorship and corporate
economic pressure tend to be disguised
for TV viewers in fact the endless
debates over censorship and the media
reinforces the notion that the media is
usually free thus validating its role as
a crucial ingredient in american-style
democracy
welcome to the press goes to war I'm Bob
Beckel for CNN special when the press
goes to war it's a fair rule of thumb
that anything that's widely discussed is
probably unimportant and that what is
what you should look for
things that aren't being discussed if
you want people to believe what they're
presented with you don't mark it
authorized as truth by the state you
know that's not a way to convey belief
what you do is present it as if there's
a debate going on and in fact even with
a debate going on but ensuring that that
debate keeps two very rigid
presuppositions images of American
patriotism and nationalism were strong
themes on the evening news by
constructing the United States is
entirely benevolent and Iraq as evil
television supported the government's
policy for war in the Gulf but the
effects of American Pro military
sentiment were seldom connected to the
lives of civilians in Iraq and to Iraqi
Americans living in the United States
[Music]
one of the most striking features of the
war was that as it unfolded the public
sphere of American society was
increasingly taken over by the official
line what George Bush stood for in fact
increasingly came to be measured in
supermarkets in the in parking lots in
the public sphere generally on
television wherever one went one was
obviously accosted in by cars on the
streets by yellow ribbons and the
iconology of American official ideology
represented by flags and by the ribbons
in fact was something that the boretz
wavering march into everybody's
imagination
[Music]
[Music]
one of the consequences obviously of the
colonization was that it became very
difficult for people opposed to the war
of whom of course there were a lot as we
knew from the votes just before the war
became extremely difficult for them to
articulate their opposition to the war
without being branded as unpatriotic or
in fact opposed to the American forces
in fact to be seen as Pro Iraqi it
became very difficult for them to find
any ground at all from which they could
speak their opposition to the war there
are some people in the world you do not
want to depend on unfortunately we lean
on other countries for over 40% of the
oil that America consumes leaders have
been represented as not to be negotiated
with as mad a lot of times but as
powerful unstable sources
I do that that reflects reflects both
you know how we perceive Arabs is
powerful given that they have control
over some resources that you know are
important to the West oil but also it
reflects our misunderstanding and our
cultural ignorance about the Arab world
well Peter said I'm saying now is
prepared for war but it is part of the
Saddam Hussein mentality and the Iraqi
mentality his friends say this Adam was
saying is not afraid to die because if
he dies he will become a martyr hero in
the Arab world invoking the martyrdom
theme actually I think tends to tend to
mask the power relations that are really
involved here and I think when a third
world country faces what is basically
World War three the people of that
country are going to feel an allegiance
to their to their leader and are going
to feel a loss if you know he dies and
are going to you know no matter what
feel that he's won in some sense in this
first program of our two-part series
critiquing televisions coverage of the
Gulf War we've concentrated on the
period leading up to the bombing of Iraq
next program we'll analyze how TV news
covered the extended bombing campaign
the brief ground war and the aftermath
of the conflict
[Music]
Schwarzkopf typifies as a new kind of
general he has a sort of dramatic
persona of a Douglas MacArthur the
organizational skills of a Dwight
Eisenhower and that bonding with the
troops of a norma our bradley those kind
of combinations are rare to combine I
think in a way Schwarzkopf typifies both
an older tradition of American hero hero
like qualities and at the same time
presents a new image as well I know that
one thing that has been talked about is
how Schwarzkopf sort of like I mean in a
way he's almost like a mythological
figure the Schwarzkopf phenomenon is
being analyzed with a more critical eye
at Brown University in a modern culture
and media class students are concerned
that the generals charisma and charm
might be desensitizing people to the
horrors of war to those of us who were
watching it on TV he presents it in such
a way that we don't see the bulldozers
you know bearing that the trench loads
of Iraqi soldiers and yet when he talks
about about the Iraqis he talks about
them as sort of collateral damage he's
having compassion for the US but not the
Boone he does placate critical awareness
so I think that we have to be able to
say okay he makes me feel good but why
does he make me feel good and what is
being hidden behind that sense of
feeling good you know what is the
reality of war but the vast majority of
America
