break into the Chinese market the
Chinese didn't want British goods
because they felt their own were
superior and the British Asians were
complaining about that so they hit on a
brilliant way to do it they developed it
was by far the most huge narco
trafficking industry in history I mean
Columbia doesn't even come close
huge narco trafficking industry in which
they tried to monopolize opium
production and force it on China with
gunboats that way you can break into the
Chinese market
and the enterprise succeeded brilliantly
the China market was open by what were
called was called in those days the
poison trade and the pig trade the
poison trade meant opium brought in by
gunpoint and turning the country into a
nation of opium addicts creating a
market for British exports joined by
others and the pig trade brought
kidnapped Chinese workers to the United
States to build a railroads for example
that enriched the English language with
the word Shanghai meaning to kidnap and
made a big contribution to US economic
development in the 19th century the
profits from the huge British
narco-trafficking racket were enormous
they paid the costs of the Royal Navy
which is the mainstay of imperialism
they paid for the administration of
India the biggest colony they paid for
the purchase of US cotton cotton is what
fueled the Industrial Revolution like
oil today and that also was not exactly
a free market miracle it was created by
extermination of the indigenous
population and slavery rather rather
radical forms of market interference
that don't enter into economic history
well England was willing to toy with
free trade as long as it was going to
win but
after a while was clear it wasn't gonna
win so by the 1920s England was facing a
situation like the United States fifty
years later superior Japanese products
were driving British products out of the
market so British Britain handled it
kind of the way Reagan did they closed
the empire to Japanese imports and that
was a big piece of the world then u.s.
did the same with its smaller empire so
did the Dutch that's part of the
background for World War two another
story
and then notice it's similar to the
Reaganite intervention to
reindustrialize America in the face of
Japanese competition in the 70s the
general can point is that free trade and
democracy are just fine when you can
make sure that the results come out the
right way not otherwise you're really
history's full of that well so much for
the foundations of reaganism before the
European conquests in the 18th century
the Industrial and commercial centers of
the world were in Asia over China and
India the biggest market systems centres
of production most advanced production
the far ahead of Europe and public
health life expectancy in Japan was
probably higher in England but that
changed through violence Europe did have
big advantage and violence the England
was able to catch up in textiles than
other manufacturers after destroying
superior Irish later Indian competitors
by force also borrowing their superior
technology by means that are now called
piracy and abandon the international
trade agreement
or kicking away the ladder other states
that have developed have relied on the
same mechanisms there's one country
outside of Europe and its offshoots that
succeeded in developing namely Japan
which is also not by accident the one
country that was able to resist
colonization and liberalisation and
retained its sovereignty so it was able
to pursue the methods that were pursued
by Europe and its offshoots along with
its colonies Britain Japan was a brutal
colonial power but it was different from
the European powers and that it didn't
destroy its colonies it developed them
that's we're now called Taiwan and Korea
developed under brutal Japanese rule and
are now picking up resuming the
development after the break of the
Second World War and aftermath well
after World War two
the picture pretty much conforms to the
historical pattern there have been two
phases roughly 1950 to 1975 1975 to the
present not exactly but approximately
the first phase designs of Bretton Woods
but under it was designed that are great
popular pressure for social democracy in
fact for much more radical measures of
democracy and social welfare and the
system was designed to leave these
options open so the system was designed
with capital controls the regulated
currencies the government programs in
the third world to stimulate production
it's called import substitution and that
continued roughly into the mid 70s and
that's a period that economists often
call the Golden Age of capitalism we
should say state capitalism that our
economic results than ever before in
history or ever since the
so take the United States from roughly
1950 to 1975 it was the highest growth
period ever in US history and
furthermore it was egalitarian growth
the lowest sector did not as well as the
highest second the an interesting
important fact is the social indicators
the measure of the social health of the
society
infant mortality you know child abuse a
whole collection of measures social
indicators rose along with growth they
tracked growth that continued until 1975
since then social indicators have
declined growth that's going on not as
fast but it's going up social indicators
have declined by year 2000 when the last
statistic SAR available
they had declined to the level of 1960
that's after the very brief and shallow
Clinton who since then the records
become much worse in all respects
actually one startling fact that was
just revealed in the business press is
that during the Bush years current Bush
years the private sector has added no
jobs outside of the health sector and
the reason you have jobs there is a
total catastrophe it's the worst most
inefficient health sector in the
industrial world but outside of that no
jobs all in the state sector to the
extent that there is job growth and it's
the same in much of the world the
mid-70s the switch to the neoliberal
period Washington Consensus has there
has been a sharp decline in almost every
economic dimension the growth of the
economy growth of productivity and
others and the decline is correlated
very closely with following the rules
following the neoliberal programs other
countries that follow the rules most
rigorously had the worst records like
Latin America the worst period in its
history much worse than the preceding 25
years and they
the rules there were countries that
didn't follow the rules and they had
fast growth the Asian Tigers so-called
and Korea Taiwan ignored the rules were
very fast
China and India are the current poster
children which are supposed to
illustrate the marvels of neoliberalism
there has in fact been substantial
economic growth by ignoring the rules
consistent with historical record and to
the extent that the rules were followed
the results are pretty much the same as
elsewhere so let's take India which is
quite striking India's is a poster child
you know you read Thomas Friedman
greatest place in the world and it did
since 1990 it has partially followed the
rules and there has been improvement so
India has risen in the number of
billionaires it's now 8th in the world
it's quite arised there's also something
called the UN ranking for human
development prior to the neoliberal to
the this period of 1990 India was one
hundred and twenty fourth now it has
sunk two hundred and twenty seventh
that's after the miracle
