our guests this evening really is an
intellectual Rockstar and many of you
are here because you know that according
to Paul Robinson writing in the New York
Review of Books and I quote judged in
terms of the power range novelty and
influence of his thought know'm Shaam
ski is arguably the most important
intellectual alive today the London
Times named him one of the thousand
makers of the 20th century professor
Chomsky has written prolifically taught
courses and lectured widely throughout
the world his groundbreaking research
into the nature of human language and
communication has had an impact on
everything from the way children are
taught foreign languages to what it
means when we say we are human dr.
Chomsky has also earned a place in
history as an activist social critic
unrelenting and compelling voice in the
debate over American and global politics
among his recent books are new horizons
in the study of language and mind on
nature and language hopes and prospects
and Gazza in crisis he is a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences and the National Academy of
Science and a recipient of the Kyoto
Prize in basic sciences the Helmholtz
medal the Dorothy Eldridge peacemaker
award the Ben Franklin medal in computer
and cognitive science and countless
other prestigious awards so before I
bring him to the podium let me just
review the format for this evening dr.
Chomsky will give his talk and
immediately following his talk we will
take a minute pause stretch and reflect
while University of Maryland professor
of history dr. David Cecelia joins dr.
Chomsky on stage to help moderate the
question and answer portion of the
evening there will be microphones in the
aisles down here in the orchestra
section and I believe there will be some
my
upstairs if you have a question please
calmly form a line behind the microphone
closest to you and professor Cecilia
will call on you for your question
please do not ask a question without a
microphone and please be considerate of
the people behind you in the line and
make your question succinctly can get as
many questions as possible before the
event ends so now I just want to say
that Professor Chomsky has said we
shouldn't be looking for heroes we
should be looking for good ideas and
it's really my distinct pleasure to
welcome to our campus community one of
the preeminent makers of ideas of our
time dr. Noah Chomsky
to clarify the title a little while
adopting imagery of the Occupy movements
the imagery that's become familiar
current in the last few months them is
the one percent and us is the 99 percent
of course this is only imagery it's not
to be taken literally the leading factor
in the astonishing inequality to which
the Occupy movement has finally drawn
attention actually lies in a fraction of
one percent of the population maybe a
tenth of one percent it's mostly hedge
fund managers CEOs of financial
corporations and the light now this is a
product of radical changes in the
economy since the 1970s it initiated a
process in which an out-of-control
financial sector is eating out the
modern market economy from the inside
just as the larvae of the spider wasp
eats out the host and which it has been
laid actually those words are not mine I
couldn't get away with it I'm quoting
Martin wolf of the Financial Times
probably the most respected economic
correspondent in the world suitably
conservative a related and parallel
process has been the deindustrialization
of America that's a sharp reversal of
centuries of history it's been a bonanza
for the 1% and pretty much of a disaster
for the rest the process is called
failure by design in a by the Economic
Policy Institute
they're the major monitors of the state
of working America and not of course a
failure for the designers as they make
clear the designers have been making out
like bandits rather a failure for the
rest including future generations on
whom huge burden is being imposed that
one that may be impossible to meet and
again by design it's not a law of nature
law of economics anything else planned
process the Occupy imagery it refers to
aspirations and commitments so take for
example Martin Luther King his
anniversary was commemorate celebrated a
couple of weeks ago a king was a leading
figure of the 1% that's independent of
whatever his personal assets might have
been when he was assassinated and we
should recall that he was assassinated
while he was supporting a strike of
public sector workers a group that's now
targeted for destruction in the current
phase of the class war the vicious class
war that's intensified in the last 30
years or so he was hoping at the time to
carry his dream forward by leading a
march of the poor to Washington the
March actually took place starting from
the motel where he was assassinated in
Memphis passing through regions where
the civil rights struggle had been waged
and finally reaching Washington where
the marchers were dismissed with scorn
by Congress and driven out of the city
and by the police who for good measure
were ordered to destroy their encampment
and resurrection city in the middle of
the night revealing the
attempt of northern liberalism for king
when once he went beyond condemning
racist Alabama sheriff's to confronting
the more fundamental problems of
American society in the north as well
the terrible plight of the poor and
aggression abroad at the time that was
the atrocious u.s. war in Indochina
Martin Luther King's actual dream and
not the one we hear orations about on
Martin Luther King Day the actual one
was left in tatters and unfulfilled
legacy matters worth contemplating as
king is solemnly commemorated one vivid
illustration of the difference between
the crises of the 1% and the 99% is the
fate of the Congressional legislation
that was passed to deal with the
catastrophic financial crisis that was
created by the 1% and their associates
in the political and professional worlds
the government reaction was reviewed by
the Special Inspector General of the
bush-obama bailout programs at Neil
Barofsky he pointed out that the
legislation that authorized the bail a
bailout was two-sided it was the
financial institutions that were
responsible for the collapse they were
to be saved by the taxpayer and the
victims of their misdeeds were to be
very partially compensated by measures
to give some protection to home values
and to secure owner home ownership well
only one part of the bargain
was kept
it didn't take a genius to predict which
part the financial institutions were
rewarded lavishly for causing the crisis
the tarp bailouts were the least of it
meanwhile the rest of the program
flounder quote offski foreclosures
continued to mount with 8 million to 13
million filings forecast over the
program's lifetime while the biggest
banks are 20% larger than they were
before the crisis and control the larger
part of the our economy than ever
furthermore he went on they reasonably
assumed that the government will rescue
them again if necessary
indeed the credit rating agencies
incorporate future government bailouts
into their assessments of the largest
banks exaggerating market distortions
that provide them with an unfair
advantage over smaller institutions
which continue to struggle and of course
over the 99% in short he concludes
Obama's programs were a giveaway to Wall
Street executives and a blow in the
solar plexus to their defenseless
victims and very likely a stepping stone
towards the next and probably worse
financial crisis as business lobbying
chips away systematically at the
dodd-frank regulation bill
well these crises have been a regular
occurrence since the Reagan years though
there weren't any before before that the
New Deal regulatory apparatus remained
in place now that was also the greatest
growth period in American economic
history often called Golden Age by
economists it was also a period of
egalitarian growth the lowest fifth of
the population
that as well as the top fifth it was
also the period in which the modern high
tech economy was founded very largely in
the dynamic state sector of the economy
and not something you read about when
you see the encomiums to Steve Jobs and
Bill Gates and the others who made use
of the contribution of the public to
commercialize the work that had been
done well at that time the banks were
were banks they were they did pretty
much what a bank is supposed to do in a
state capitalist society no they took
unused top capital like say your bank
accounts and they transferred them to
what was supposed to be some
constructive use like somebody wants to
buy a home or send their kids to college
or start a business or whatever it may
be now that was the golden age when
deregulation began and the post-war
system so-called Britain would system
was dismantled that was a system of
regulated capital and regulated
currencies when that was dismantled in
the 1970s it led to an extraordinary
increase in global capital flow a banks
weren't banks anymore though they became
financial casinos increasingly opaque
instruments all kinds of incentives to
underestimate risk because as profs me
pointed out the nanny state is counted
on to step in when things go sour credit
bridge rating agencies as he wrote
already take that for granted well it
wasn't very hard to predict what was
going to happen there are a few Internet
economists who actually did very few one
of them was David Felix he repeatedly
warned quoting him that the increasing
frequency of financial crises during the
period of financial liberalisation could
terminate in an uncontrollable one
return to the Great Depression quite
close to that now he was joined by a few
others among them Johnny well and last
teller well-known British and American
economist they published in the 90s an
important book that called global
finance at risk they discussed the
institutional roots of the
underestimation of risk and they
proposed means to deal with it at root
the problems result from very well-known
in efficiencies of of markets inherent
inefficiencies of markets which you
learn about it for a semester of
economics one of these is that
transactions in a market system don't
take into account the effects of on
others who are not parties to the
transaction so for example if you sell
me a car and we're paying attention
we'll work it out so that we both make
out pretty well all right but we simply
don't take into account the effect of
that purchase on somebody else that guy
over there and the effects can be the
effects are real there's more pollution
there's more congest traffic congestion
there are more accidents and when you
multiply these over the population they
they become substantial in fact these
externalities as they're called under
you don't pay attention to them they're
footnote now they can be huge that's
particularly true in the case of
financial institutions so their vocation
is to take risks and if they're well
managed they are supposed to ensure that
the potential losses to themselves that
will be covered
for themselves under capitalist rules
market rules it's not there it's not
their business to consider the risk to
others that's even apart from the nanny
state rushing in when things get in
trouble which of course expands the
underestimation of risks but even apart
from that just inherent in a market
system is that risk is underpriced
because what's called systemic risk that
is the risk to the system at large is
not priced into decisions so if Goldman
Sachs makes a risky transaction
investment of some kind or loan or
whatever it presumably if we'll manage
covers the risk to itself even putting
aside the fact that the nanny state is
there to help it out if when things go
wrong but it doesn't take into account
the risk that if it's say loan goes bad
the whole system will collapse which is
pretty close to what happened it insured
itself with AIG AIG tanked if the
government hadn't bailed out AIG the
biggest insurance company that Goldman
Sachs would have he would be bankrupt
and other consequences like it would
have happened as would happen in a
capitalist society without in any state
but the risk is always there an
exaggerated and underestimated just by
virtue of the nature of markets well
that naturally leads to repeated crises
but all such annoying thoughts were put
to the side during the period of what's
called neoliberal globalization that
kind of settled into dogma from the
Reagan Sacher years also dismissed were
occasional warnings to beware of what
Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz fifteen
years ago called the religion that
markets know best
they don't there are inherent assistance
risks that are just part of them can be
very severe and often are that's the
least of it but too devout believers who
came to dominate the profession and such
heresies is regulating financial markets
must be dismissed
in fact dismissed with ridicule and in
fact they consistently were the
extremism of the religion was revealed
quite graphically just a couple of days
ago the Fed Federal Reserve regularly
releases transcripts after five years
and it released transcripts of internal
discussions in 2006 those are very
interesting reading that was just when
the housing bubble was reaching its
incredible peak unnoticed because
markets know best so the fact that well
in the last few years
housing prices have been shooting way
out of sight a breaking a trend line of
a century without any basis in any
economic fundamentals that had to be
right
because markets know best that's what
the religion dictates economist Dean
Baker who's one of the very few who
foresaw the catastrophe he could do the
arithmetic is apparently a rare talent
he comments that there is no one in the
eighth Fed meetings reported who
suggests that the economy faces any
serious turbulence ahead there is not
even discussion that a mild recession
could be in sight there was a concern in
the meetings the concern was inflation
of which there wasn't even a remote sign
but that's what worries financial
institutions shortly after the Fed
meetings the huge bubble burst destroyed
trillions of dollars of paper wealth on
which much of the public relied
having been deluded into believing that
it was safe for the more deprived parts
of the population like african-americans
it virtually eliminated net worth that's
astonishing when you look at the figures
well during these if you read the
transcript see the president of the New
York Fed the one who's primarily in
charge of monitoring Wall Street he
captured the general mood among the
elite of the profession economics
profession when he hailed Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan who at the time was
revered as a saint Alan on the eve of
the worst crash since the Great
Depression that Timothy Geithner so it
is who went on to become was appointed
Obama's chief economic manager he told
Greenspan I'd like the record to show
that I think you're pretty terrific and
thinking in terms of probabilities I
think the risk that we decide in the
future that you're even better than we
think
is higher than the alternative so you're
up in the pantheon Greenspan himself had
not only boasted over the achievements
of what economists called the Great
Moderation over which he was presiding
but he even explained how the magical
tricks were performed was quite frank
about it
during the Clinton years he informed
Congress that one of the ways in which
he was achieving these fabulous results
was to instill growing worker insecurity
and that's a good thing he says because
it reduces efforts by working people to
try to gain compensation and benefits to
mitigate the harsh effects of the Great
Moderation and that's obviously healthy
for the economy
now the religion decrees that those
gains should go to the
1% of course for the benefit of all by
some kind of miracle that never takes
place after the great crash 2007 such
fundamental market efficiencies which as
I say your thought about in the first
term of economics they finally did reach
the attention of leading economists some
of the leading financial economists
wrote that there is growing recognition
that our financial system is running a
doomsday cycle whenever it fails we rely
on lacks money and fiscal policies to
bail it out the response teaches the
financial sector Laura to take large
Gamble's to to get paid handsomely and
don't worry about the costs they will be
paid by taxpayers through bailouts and
lost jobs and the financial system is
resurrected to gamble again notice that
that's recognizing a kind of a
superficial cause of the problem now the
deeper cause inherent and market
inefficiencies in this case at least
Winston went on mentioned though others
mentioned it so the system is a Doom
loop those are the words of the official
of the Bank of England who's responsible
for financial stability and in fact so
it remains getting worse well as I
mentioned the failure by design traces
back to the 1970s when there was a
substantial redirection of the US
economy towards financialization and
offshoring of production the
industrialization both of these were
impelled in part by the falling rate of
profit in domestic manufacturing but
also by diversification of the
global economy that by 1970 the global
economy was becoming what's called
tri-polar they have to recall that after
the Second World War the peak of us
power the US was the one economic center
had half the world's wealth other
industrial countries had been severely
harmed or devastated by the war u.s.
gained enormous Lee from the war
industrial production correctly
quadrupled and that was the peak of
power of the famous American decline
that's talked about these days actually
started right away declined very quickly
decline is kind of interesting if you
think about it the first step in
American decline that has a name it's
called the loss of China
it happened in 1949 and then there's
huge debate uh who's responsible for the
loss of China a major issue in American
domestic policy since that time it's
interesting that the phrase itself is
never questioned you can only lose
something that you own and it's just
taken for granted of course we own the
world
how can anyone question that so if some
part of the world moves towards
independence we've lost it and then the
problem is you know who's responsible
for the laws so in fact part of the
post-war planning very explicit wasn't
the US should control the entire Far
East as well as most of the rest so
that's the beginning of American decline
keeps going I won't run through it but
by nineteen seventy five seventy it had
reached the point that instead of having
a controlling said half the world's will
it had declined to 25% which is still
colossal but not 50% and the United
States by then was it's about what it is
now incidentally the United States was
one of three major economic centres
there was a major center and
North America us-based North America in
another one in German based Europe
roughly comparable and a third in East
Asia which was already becoming the most
dynamic industrial system in the world
then it was Japan based as soon as was
that was to be joined by the industrial
powerhouses and Japan's former colonies
Taiwan and South Korea soon later joined
by China which is becoming its assembly
plant now that's actually an important
fact to bear in mind when you hear about
China's rapid growth which is indeed
spectacular but it's the growth is
largely as an assembly plant for the
industrial countries on its periphery
and for multinational corporations say
like Apple where they make your iPods
and Foxconn that's where the high
technology comes from the parts and
components the fancy software and so on
China itself mostly assembles them
that means incidentally that the trade
deficit with China that you hear about
all the time is severely miscalculated
which has been pointed out in fact if
you calculate the trade deficit by
what's called value-added how much value
is actually added in each step of the
manufacturing process then the trade
deficit with China it reduces by about
25 percent and it goes up by same figure
approximately with the peripheral
industrial countries and of course US
manufacturers make a gain from it as
well not the population now there's a
recent study by the sloan foundation
that goes into this and gives some
illustrations one illustration is an
iPod they say if you have if there's an
iPod assembled and exported from China
it costs they estimated a hundred and
fifty dollars to produce
and China adds $4 to that the rest is
coming from the outside well under these
conditions namely in a decline in the
rate of profit Manufacturing
diversification of the economy
opportunities for production abroad and
so on under those conditions of
financial manipulations and overseas
operations became much more profitable
for the designers of the economy who
designed a failure as the EPI points out
now what that did is it set off a
vicious cycle of greater concentration
of wealth increasingly in the financial
sector which just exploded
that led concentration of wealth leads
almost automatically the concentration
of political power that in turn leads to
legislation which carries the cycle
forward most of things like fiscal
measures you know changing tax burdens
and so on deregulation the rules of
corporate governance that give more
power to the chief executive and a lot
more meanwhile what remained of
functioning democracy rapidly declining
was shredded further as the cost of
Elections skyrocketed that drives the
political parties deeper even deeper
than before they're always there but
even deeper than before into corporate
pockets where the money is the
Republicans did it so enthusiastically
that they scarcely even resemble a
traditional political party anymore
the which is part of the reason for the
year of lunacy of the Republican debates
and talk about that
if you abandon any pretense of being a
political party you have to mobilize
voters somehow and you can't do it on
the base of your policies now you can't
go to the voting public and say hey our
only policy is to enrich the super-rich
and impoverish you so you have to
organize other constituencies the groups
they're always there you know but they
had never they weren't really mobilized
as a political force in earlier years
that includes religious I would use the
word extremist meaning by comparative by
world standards but they're not
extremists by US standards that
country's kind of off the spectrum and
religious extremism and has been for a
long time in fact since the colonists
but they weren't organized as a
political force very much and now they
are that's a big voting constituency
nativists who are consumed with hate and
fear they're always there but now
they're organized a small businessmen
who feel that the world's turning
against them they don't like the big
corporations not like the government
they're like anybody they can be
organized and other sectors like that I
kind of hate to say it but those of you
who know something about modern history
will recognize that this is somewhat
similar to the constituencies that big
industrialists mobilized in Germany in
the late
bime our republic which became the
Knutson which was the Nazi Party and
they thought they could control them
what turned out they couldn't it's a lot
of dissimilarities but some unpleasant
similarities to anyhow when you mobilize
those constituencies and that's who you
have to talk to then the debates and the
so-called debates
you know the Catechism so on it's gonna
be like what you see on television it's
kind of amazing the world there's
nothing like it and
any parliamentary system but it's almost
inevitable the once a political party
abandons any pretence of being a
political party and just as completely
in service to a tiny sector a fraction
of the 1% well that's the vicious cycle
the Democrats who actually the Democrats
today are what used to be called
moderate Republicans moderate
Republicans it's sometimes said that
they're gone they're not gone they're
centrist Democrats or even center-left
Democrats now they're not far behind
although that's part of the vicious
cycle well actually a lot of what's
going on is in accord with a maxim of
Adam Smith's
that should actually be known better
back in wealth of nations 1776 he wrote
that of course he's interested in
England he wrote that in England the
principal architects of government
policy are the people who own the
economy in his day the merchants and
manufacturers of England they set policy
and they design it so as to ensure that
their own interests are very well
attended to however Grievous the effect
on others including the people of
England but in particular that those
overseas like those in India who were
suffering what he called the savage
injustice of the Europeans and British
in that cases you know well that's
that's a pretty good principle of
politics it held well and 1770s it
slightly different today it's not
merchants and manufacturers its
financial institutions and multinational
corporations but the general maxim holds
pretty well you can make it more complex
and sophisticated but as a kind of a
simple first approximation it's not bad
and very dramatic today well it's also
worth remembering that the founders of
classical economics
Smith and David Ricardo they were they
couldn't predict what's what's been
happening today and in fact they did
they warned about what would be
recognized would be a nightmare of
what's now called neoliberal
globalization what the 99% have been
enduring here and much harsher and long
familiar in the poorer countries so for
example Adam Smith discussed what would
happen if in England the merchants and
manufacturers decided to basically
abandon England to invest abroad and
import from abroad he pointed out that
they may might do very well and under
those circumstances but it would be very
harsh for England however he argued that
this is not going to happen because of a
phenomenon that's sometimes called home
bias that the merchants and
manufacturers would prefer to do
business at home to invest at home and
to get their commodity for products from
home and then he said because of this as
if by an invisible hand England will be
saved from the ravages of what we called
neoliberal globalization that phrase
invisible hand is a pretty hard one to
miss it's the only occurrence the one
occurrence of the phrase in his classic
wealth of nations so if you look it up
the index that's the passage it'll take
to you two it's basically a critique of
neoliberal globalization and a
description of what's happening now he
was not alone his was the next great
political economist David Ricardo
classic Kazakh economist he recognized
the same thing any point Hibbs he
recognized that his famous law of
comparative advantage that would
collapse if
his England Portugal model of the
British investors and merchants did
everything in Portugal they do fine but
England would collapse and he said it
wouldn't happen he hoped it wouldn't
happen he was a little more sentimental
about it than Adam Smith Athene hoped it
wouldn't happen he hoped that because of
home bias I'll quote him most men of
property would be satisfied with a low
rate of profits in their own country
rather than seek a more advantageous
employment for their wealth in foreign
nations the feelings that I hope I wish
should be sorry to see weakened he said
well that's what happened dramatically
in the best generation that leads to the
process of eating out the market of
economy like the larvae of a wasp quote
Martin wolf again and destruction of the
manufacturing base of the economy at
home with all that that entails and it's
quite serious
well the 1% can survive on Finance and
profits from production I survive very
well at least temporarily production
under absolutely hideous conditions at
monstrosity is like Foxconn Taiwanese
owned corporation where they produce
your iPods and other Apple products and
others but the 99% that can't survive on
this and there are other effects
longer-term effects that one of them is
loss of the technological edge that's
another debt we're imposing on future
generations there's a take one rather
striking illustration there is a rapidly
growing market for solar panels growing
very fast it's now been largely taken
over by China the US Secretary of Energy
physicists even true
he warned recently to Congress that the
United States is falling behind an
advanced manufacturing and he took as
exhibit a solar panel manufacturing he
toured one of the main Chinese factories
and he reported it's a high-tech
automated Factory
it's not succeeding because of cheap
labor rather because of sensible
planning the government making creating
opportunities for the infrastructure for
suppliers and so on the kind of
synergies developed also for Apple the
products as was discussed recently in
the New York Times so he said it started
the factory started with very low tech
manufacturing but there's a general
phenomenon which is well known to
industrial engineers manufacturing
capacity provides the basis and the
stimulus for a design innovation and
rising to higher levels of
sophistication and in production and
design and invention a lot of it comes
from the factory floor just trying
things out seeing what's works getting
new ideas and so on and in fact it's
gotten to the point two points out where
the Chinese have now developed a type of
solar cell with world record
efficiencies so China's forging ahead in
this essential market and it might in
others too as the 99% here languish
again by design now I mentioned that
China to this day is still primarily an
assembly plant but it's going to move up
the technology ladder in ways like this
and we're helping it out and helping
others out to gain a technological edge
which will
lose that industrial countries to
Germany's doing quite well for example
well a good illustration of the design
is President Obama's economic team when
he came into office it was in the midst
of this terrible collapse so he had the
first thing I do is appoint an economic
team that was very interesting to see
how he appointed he avoided everyone who
had criticized the the decisions and the
procedures that were leading to the
crisis included Nobel laureates they
were out period the ones who came in
were the ones who designed the crisis
Robert Rubens boys basically and that
was noticed the business press noticed
so Bloomberg News one of the main
business journals they actually did a
review of
akadama x' economic team one by one
talked about their records and their
conclusion was that most of these guys
shouldn't be on an economic team they
should be getting subpoenas well that's
correct there was in fact one exception
that representing the liberal left
called for some kind of regulation that
was Paul Volcker just to place him in
the spectrum he was reagan's treasury
secretary but by the last couple of
years that puts him somewhere on the
left yeah anyway he didn't last very
long he was thrown out he was replaced
Obama replaced him by Jeffrey Immelt
he is the CEO of General Electric that's
the nation's largest corporation and the
business world was quite pleased they
were glad to get rid of Volcker radical
leftist and they trusted ml
so London Financial Times pointed out
that mr. Immelt support meant was
applauded by the US Chamber of Commerce
made big business lobby which has been
among the president's harsher critics
and funded notice funded many
Republicans who ran against Democrats in
November's elections this is right after
the 210th election so the last barrier
to unimpeded business rule is out of the
way we can all be happy in the 1% well
you take a look at GE the this
appointment incidentally was heralded as
to create jobs
okaythat's jeffrey melts mission more
than half of GES workforce is abroad
more than half of its revenues come from
overseas operations also vary
substantially from not from production
but from the financial manipulations it
is now doing some hiring but at much
lower salaries the workforce has been so
beaten down by class war by unemployment
designed unemployment that they don't
object they're glad to have any work at
all this practice the genie is now
illustrating of two-tier contracts you
know old contracts for the unionized
workforce that you can't get rid of yet
trying to get rid of them but much lower
pay and much worse benefits for all new
workers that two-tiered contract system
it goes back to the Reagan years it's a
core part of the bitter and a very
self-conscious class war of the past
generation well the amount appointment
that I said was proclaimed by the White
House to be for job growth but it had
very little to do with that more
accurately it's what's called follow the
money more than a century ago
the great political financier Mark Hanna
I said that three things are important
in politics and money and money and I
forgotten the third one that's far more
true today than it was a century ago
especially after the changes of radical
changes of the past 30 years
well the consequent and perfectly
predictable decline of and in fact
intended a decline of democracy is
evident every day on the front pages so
right now for example in Washington the
great issue of the day is the deficit
for the general public of the great
issue of the day's jobs and on strictly
economic grounds the public is right
there very few serious economists have
questioned this so in fact the reasons
are explained in the most prestigious
places including the business press I'll
quote again Martin wolf Lee London
Financial Times correspondent was maybe
the most respected economic course not
in the world he writes that the US
fiscal position is not an urgent issue
the u.s. is now able to borrow on easy
terms the astonishing feature of the
federal fiscal position is that revenues
are forecast to be a mere fourteen point
four percent of gross domestic product
in 2011 far below their post-war average
of close to eight percent individual
income tax is forecast to be barely six
percent of GDP in 2011 this non American
cannot understand what the fuss is about
in 1988 at the end of Ronald Reagan's
term receipts were three times that high
over 18 percent of GDP a tax revenue has
to rise substan
actually if the deficit is too close and
of course that means rise substantially
on the sectors of the population where
it's been sharply reduced the rich
especially the super-rich and the
corporate sector well it is astonishing
but it's not hard to understand it's the
demand of the financial institutions and
the super-rich and in a rapidly
declining democracy that's what counts
those are the voices that are heard and
as an instrument of class war the
policies that the public strongly
opposes that make perfectly good sense
actually much the same is true these
days in continental Europe there are two
leading economists a financial press
even the International Monetary Fund
that point out that the policies of the
European Central Bank which are much
more reactionary than the Fed their
policies imposing austerity during
recession are almost certain to
undermine growth and even to undermine
debt repayment which is exactly what's
been happening now the IMF International
Monetary Fund recently did a survey of
several hundred cases of applying
austerity during recession and they
showed that in the uniformly it
undermines growth and even undermines
debt repayment which is not too
surprising
what's needed is economic stimulus and
Europe has plenty of resources for that
so on economic grounds doesn't make any
sense but on grounds of class warfare
it's kind of sensible it's a way to
undermine hated social programs to
weaken labor and to entrench corporate
control even more than before so the
programs that the public strenuously
opposes are quite rational it's more
failure by design well even if you keep
to the secondary issue of the death
the radical decline of democracy I'm
speaking of here stares us in the face
so the public hasn't used on how to deal
with the deficit large majorities raise
taxes on the rich even if not anywhere
near the level of a great growth period
but raising them and safeguard the
benefit systems of Medicare Social
Security not even Tea Party adherents
insist on that the financial
institutions demand the opposite so
therefore it's the opposite that's on
the agenda for Republicans it's part of
the catechism that you have to solemnly
in tone lockstep rather in the style of
the old communist party just got a
repeat and the Democrats again are not
all that far behind a couple of steps
behind well there is something that's
undiscussables
now that is a very obvious well known
way to eliminate the deficit totally and
in fact to create a surplus and that is
to reform the scandalous health care
system and not by some utopian means and
just to make it like other industrial
countries you know that's kind of not
outer space so the u.s. health system
which is unique in a number of ways one
is that it's privatized and unregulated
that's extremely inefficient layer after
layer of bureaucracy tons of
administrative costs profit-making
advertising all sorts of things which
take funds away from the treatment of
people and of course all kind of
measures and after all these are
profit-making institutions they're there
to make profit not to cure people so
they try to do it and they try to do it
by all sorts of ways to defer
the treatment if they can get away with
it that's kind of what I'm adding and
it's about twice the per capita costs
even more of comparable countries that
does not translate into health benefits
in fact the u.s. comes out sort of at
the low end of industrial societies and
health outcomes but that's a huge cost
and in fact if it if we did Institute a
health care system like other countries
the deficit would be wiped out and in
fact there'd be a surplus but that's not
part of the debate over the deficit it's
not discussed in the media the financial
institutions don't want it and the story
there actually is a far more ominous
component of the failure by design now
that's not just for the 99% but for the
but for their children and the
grandchildren and those are the 1% - and
that's environmental catastrophe there
have been a number of major emissions
reports in the last couple of weeks one
from the International Energy
Association which is a pretty
conservative body it was founded by
Henry Kissinger now they came out with
their regular report indicating that
emissions you know greenhouse emissions
were far beyond what had been
anticipated and their chief economist
warned that we may have about five years
before the window closes as you put it
will reach the point in global warming
which is irreversible assumed to be
irreversible from then on it just
explodes and these are we're called
nonlinear processes you know I can
exclude three fast
so we got five years other emissions are
getting worse than ever right before
that a couple of weeks before that the
US Energy monitors Department produced
its estimates which similar said its 419
it's for 2010 the last figures
said it was the greatest rise ever and
it was worse than the worst-case
scenario of the IPCC you know the
International monitors the scientists
group that monitors emissions they have
a spectrum of the more optimistic less
more pessimistic estimates and this was
worse than the worst of them I should
say that where I am at MIT that didn't
come as any surprise there is a climate
change study group at MIT and they've
been saying for years that they weren't
unpublishing the fact that their own
models suggest that the IPCC consensus
is in an even its worst case is far too
optimistic well that's what the latest
emissions report shows that Congress
reacted to this they reacted by enacting
legislation to ensure that there can be
no inquiry into whether the crazy
weather of the past year which is very
unusual it might have something to do
with global warming and they explained
you can't inquire into that because you
inquire into it you might open the door
to conceding that the global warming is
taking place or that it could be a
problem and can't do that so therefore
we can't inquire into it that it's kind
of similar to the National Rifle
Association which for decades has
prevented any legislation would which
would lead to an inquiry and no action
just an inquiry into that whether
there's a relation between guns and
homicides it's clear what they're gonna
find out but you can't inquire into it
it's too dangerous
well meanwhile Congress Republican
Congress is is busy its dismantling
environmental measures that are on the
books the ones introduced by Richard
Nixon it was in many ways the last
liberal President Eisenhower would look
like some kind of flaming radical today
so all the more evidence about how they
both the doctrinal and policy spectrum
has shifted to the right but on climate
there are international polls taken by
the Pew foundation and turns out that
across the world a large majority of the
population is very much concerned about
the environmental catastrophe even in
the United States there's considerable
concern all of the United States is much
lower than other countries
they're much less concerned less the
belief that it's real which is why every
Republican candidate can say and Ian
must say it's not doesn't exist or it's
not a problem and get away with it in
the United States this figure has been
going down for the last couple of years
concerned for climate you know the
problems of climate that's certainly
correlated with a massive corporate
propaganda campaign which was openly
announced and nothing secret about it
you can read in the New York Times that
after the success of the insurance
companies in meaning back health reform
and turning the Obama program into a
kind of a gift to them what you need it
was after their success the Chamber of
Commerce of our control ium Institute
and others announced that they're going
to use the same methods to try to
undermine the concern over global
warming and it's big a in a big campaign
it's apparently had a substantial effect
and that's all a direct consequence of
the shift of power towards unaccountable
private tyrannies and the religion and
it is a religion that there must be no
public interference in their pursuit of
short-term profit and power well it's
easy and convenient to make fun of the
Republican congressman who explained
that there can't be any environmental
problems because God promised Noah that
would never be another flood that's easy
we can laugh about it it's less easy
less convenient and far more significant
to pay attention to the secular
religious extremism that's all around us
right in our circles our own and
lightning circles kind that I mentioned
and this indeed goes well beyond what
I've already mentioned at an encrypting
involves crises that are far graver than
the failure by design in the rich
countries from which the 99% are
suffering among these many crises and
there are plenty of there's one that
ought to be of prime concern for us and
that is just on moral ground the ones
the crises affecting the victims of our
crimes well these are ranged and widely
to talk about but I'll just end by
bringing up one quite striking case
which happens to teach us a good deal
about ourselves if we choose to learn
from it
as you know anniversaries of important
events are often commemorated sometimes
quite solemnly like Pearl Harbor day but
there are some that are forgotten and
they have lessons too so I'll mention
one we are now reaching the fiftieth
anniversary of the date when President
John F Kennedy launched a direct US
invasion of South Vietnam just 50 years
ago he shifted u.s. policy from support
of a brutal client regime that had
killed tens of thousands of people and
he listed in resistance that couldn't
subdue he's shifted policy from support
for them to a direct us attack that
included bombing by US aircraft the use
of napalm a program of chemical warfare
programs that ultimately drove millions
of people villagers into urban slums or
what amounted to concentration camps in
which this story was they would be
protected from the indigenous guerillas
who in fact the administration knew they
were willingly supporting well quote
official sources from fifty years ago
President Kennedy authorized use of US
forces in a sharply increased effort to
avoid a further deterioration of the
situation in South Vietnam
including increased airlift to the
government of Vietnam
that's the u.s. client regime which
until virtually the end declared itself
to be the government of all Vietnam the
this increased airlift included
helicopters light aviation transport air
aircraft equipment and US personnel for
aerial reconnaissance instruction in an
execution of air ground support special
intelligence aircraft personnel and
chemical defoliants to kill Vietcong
food crops and to foliate selected
border and jungle areas spraying
equipment was installed on the 834
helicopters and is ready to be used
against food crops the this is 1961 1966
T to the defoliants included Agent
Orange
that's laden with dioxin which was known
to be but that manufacturers at least
was known to be one of the most lethal
carcinogens
that's anyone knows about and it exact
'add pretty terrifying toll on the
invading armies and of course far worse
horrors for the civilian population
still does find aborted hideously
malformed fetuses and Saigon hospitals
several generations down the line but
notice that all of this is attack on
South Vietnam the short term effects
were reported by the most highly
respected Indochina specialists military
historian Bernard fall there was no dove
incidentally but he was one of the few
who cared about the people of the
tormented countries so in early 1965 he
estimated that about 66,000 had been
killed between 1957 and 1961 under the
u.s. imposed terror state and another
90,000 between 1961 when policy was
shifted in April 1965 during the early
stages of the kennedy johnson aggression
virtually all of them South Vietnamese
and mostly victims of the u.s. client
regime or as he put it the crushing
weight of American Armour napalm jet
bombers and finally vomiting gases well
the decisions of 50 years ago were
largely kept from the American people
the pieces dribbled out and so are the
shocking consequences that persist the
first study of the continuing impact of
chemical warfare on South Vietnamese
construction of food crops and so on
first study of that just appeared by
Fred Wilcox a couple of months ago I
doubt very much that'll even be reviewed
well despite the silence information did
trickle through the give idli some sense
of what was happening but efforts at
justification were pretty slim because
nobody really cared hardly more than
President Kennedy's impassioned address
to the General Assembly UN General
Assembly where he warned that we are
opposed around the world by a monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy that relies
primary
uncovered means for extending its sphere
of influence and if the conspiracy
achieves its ends in Laos and Vietnam
the gates will be opened wide
conspiracies in the Kremlin
there weren't any Russians anywhere near
sight
but they were the sort of the monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy that was doing
all these things about the same time he
warned that as he put it the complacent
the self-indulgent the soft societies
are about to be swept away with the
debris of history and only the strong
can possibly survive now that was his
lament after the failure of the invasion
of Cuba Bay of Pigs invasion a warning
that got to do something about it
oh well hardly necessary to spell out
the actual basis for these grim
pronouncements since so few people were
even paying attention to what was
actually being done and the invasion
itself passed with hardly more than a
yawn
well that was 1961 years later by 1967
opposition of the crimes did reach a
substantial scale but by that time
hundreds of thousands of US troops and
tens of thousands of virtual mercenaries
were rampaging through the country the
heavily populated areas were subjected
to saturation bombing and by then the
invasion had spread to the rest of
Indochina and the consequences had
become so horrendous that Burnette fall
again forecast that Vietnam as a
cultural and historic entity is
threatened with extinction as the
countryside literally dies under the
blows of the largest military machine
ever unleashed on an area of this size
and he was again referring to South
Vietnam which was always the main target
up to that point the war went on for
another eight horrendous years and
mainstream was
opinion was divided between those who
described the war as a noble cause that
could have been one with more dedication
and at the opposite extreme the critics
the to whom it was a mistake that proved
too costly kind of like the German
General Staff after Stalingrad
that's the Liberals by 1977 the
President Carter aroused almost no
notice when he explained that weaove it
Nam no debt and because the destruction
was mutual
practically no comment well still to
come after Falls burnt Falls grim
warning was the bombing of the remote
peasant society of northern Laos bombing
with such intensity that the victims
lived in caves for years to try to
survive the bombing that almost nothing
to do with the Vietnam War had mostly to
do with the fact there were a lot of
bombers around them nothing much to do
shortly after that came the bombing of
rural Cambodia at the incredible level
of all allied air operations in the
entire Pacific Theater during World War
two including two atom bombs
that's rural Cambodia all of this was
under Henry Kissinger's orders anything
that flies on anything that moves now
that's a call for genocide of a kind
that's very hard to find in New York
I've already known disregarded these
were what are called secret Wars in the
meaning reporting of what was available
even what was available was very scanty
and the facts are still barely known to
the general public or even educated
elites people can recite by heart
every real or alleged crime of official
enemies these are all matters that
reflect that merit reflection not about
you know the Republican base but about
ourselves and our communities and those
we live in and they also married action
and there is finally some action the
Occupy movements are first large-scale
popular response to the growing crisis
of the past generation maybe they can go
beyond what they've done I hope so they
have achieved a great deal and if they
can overcome the inevitable repression
already underway and if they can find
ways to expand into the general
community and to deepen the insight that
they're trying to provide that could
prove to be a development of historical
significance and whether that will
happen is essentially up to us to
determine just as it's up to us to
determine whether say Martin Luther
King's a dream is to remain as in
tattered ruins or can in fact be
realized
so we got started a little late so that
many of you could join us and we're
delighted to have you
we'll set up here I believe we already
have a couple of microphones set up so
we have some time for some dialogue with
Professor Chomsky and we also have some
handheld microphones up in the balcony
so if you could please line up here and
I hope we can get some questions from
some undergraduates as well tonight that
would be terrific okay so the gentlemen
over on this side dr. dr. Chomsky
absolutely love your work I just wanted
you to comment and give some of your
criticisms over the State of the Union
speech the other night if you had any
criticisms I never listen to stay too
they're kind of predictable which means
they carrying essentially no information
even in the technical sense of
information you can predict what they're
going to say yes it's mostly boilerplate
that's in this case it's a bill it's a
campaign speech for the next election
now there were a couple of things in it
which were I've read read read about
them later they there are a couple of
things which are reasonable if they're
carried through there are some things
mature they're quite threatening oh just
to pick one of those Obama made it clear
that they're gonna go ahead with the XL
pipeline that's delayed and go through
and the fracking operations and these
are kind of like a death sentence for
the species I mean you can argue about
the other things but these are pretty
very serious the you know the advanced
technology and it's been developed for
getting a gas from natural gas other
hydrocarbons products from the shale tar
sand the Derrick's the predictions are
nobody knows the predictions are right
but the predictions are that they will
lead to of their it's kind of hell
they'll lead to energy independence for
the United States and maybe first
century so the United States will be
kind of the Saudi Arabia of the world
of course at the end of that century
there won't be any world to care about
but that's not not part of the
calculation I think it's kind of amazing
to see these discussions I mean what the
facts are you can debate but take again
the Financial Times it's probably the
most responsible and serious journal in
the world
very good Journal now they had a full
page devoted to a euphoric account of
how fracking techniques and the pipeline
could
lead to a century of energy independence
and global hegemony for the United
States because of the vast resources
that would be opened up and not some
comment a couple of sentences on the
local environmental effects which are
very severe that destroys Water
Resources and all sorts of things so a
couple of words about that but literally
not one word relating it to the
emissions reports that had just appeared
at that time the ones I mentioned and
you just put these things together and
you can see that the species is kind of
like lemmings happily walking over the
cliff you know it's pretty much what he
said it's gonna lead to living other
proposals you know if it kind of varies
some of them make some sense some don't
there's not much details you know really
of what they mean and it you don't know
whether he's gonna really pursue them so
for example takes a health care reform
when Obama came into office with a
mandate a very strong mandate also
controlling a both congressional body
and part of the mandate was for serious
health reform a majority of the
population was in favor of some kind of
national health care you know extending
maybe extending Medicare to the whole
population or what's called single-payer
Canadian style and not because Canada
has the best health system in the world
but because this is a very insular
country and people have know that
Canada's there somewhere and they don't
know that Australia say has it much
better health system but so people want
a Canadian style health system which
would in fact sharply cut the deficit
and so on that was a mandate they gave
it away without a struggle
he it was reduced to a public option at
least an option for this Obama gave that
away without trying even though he was
supported by maybe close to two-thirds
of the population he quickly made a deal
with the big pharmaceutical companies to
continue a legislation that I think is
unique to the United States well in the
United States Congress is perfect the
government is prevented by law the
executive is prevented by law from
negotiating drug prices
so of course drug prices are you know
two or three times as high as anywhere
else after this one part of the medical
system which is treated is handled like
every other industrial country that's
the Veterans Affairs program there
the governor's allowed to negotiate drug
prices
there's guaranteed health care there's
preventive care and the the costs are a
fraction of the general system of public
system and the outcomes are quite good
and this remembers a vulnerable part of
the population these are people who are
not kind of like a random section of the
population a lot of them had war
injuries and traumas and so on and so
forth well they're they're allowed to do
it but for the rest of the population
not allowed to at that time there was
about eighty-five percent of the public
was in favor of getting rid of that
provision and it saw it went step by
step it actually ended up with by about
August this must been August 2010 the
insurance industry industry were
euphoric about their victory that's
great we got a huge victory the Obama
system is going to give us a huge number
of
new people signing up and will make a
ton of money on it
of course they turned against it because
nothing is ever good enough
damn I'd like to get everything you
don't have anything so after having
celebrated the victory they finally
turned against it and said no we want
even more no of course but that was an
example of how he handled the mandate
the same with other things like take the
of the bailout legislation that I
mentioned there were two parts to it
in the legislation save the banks who
were responsible
pam-pam offered their crimes and do
something for the victims only half was
done it wasn't because of lack of public
support so we don't know even the kind
of positive parts of it that may not
mean anything in fact whether they will
mean anything it depends on whether
there's massive public pressure to force
them to mean something there's always
pressure coming from concentrated
capital the business classes are always
fighting a very self-conscious class war
highly class conscious business
community and if it's a one-sided class
where will they win and so it depends
whether there's another side and the
class work but I think that's the fate
of whatever's decent in the State of the
Union speech
oh good evening my name is David de
Xiang I'm a former Marine veteran who
survived the hideous war of atrocity
against the Vietnamese people's after my
return I was trained as a community
organizer by Saul Alinsky as was very
active in Veterans Affairs including
being a core member of the group of
volunteers that built the Vietnam
Memorial in Washington also known as the
wall I invite everyone here to go there
and as you reflect during the spirit of
Tet healing and reconciliation to try
and imagine how vast a symbol Memorial
would be in Vietnam and how much we owe
the Vietnamese and the indo-chinese my
question I couldn't here in the
afterword of fields failed States you
note the opportunities for education
organizing abound and warned that failed
to grasp them as like a nominee will
have ominous repercussions for our
country our world and future generations
I strongly believe that the media is
mightier than war and then I ask how do
we the people defend our Constitution
occupy the foreign policy establishment
the national media to ensure sustained
Democratic empowerment and access to
unimpeachably ground intelligence to
redress these foreign policy grievances
suffer Fidelis how do we how do we
Occupy Wall Street but the foreign
policy establishment it's very free
country by comparative standards that
is a very free country but you got a lot
of opportunity they range from
demonstrations to electoral politics to
resistance to organizing organizing
public pressure you know it's way to do
it in fact you don't to go berry for the
educational establishment the
intellectual establishment is up to
their neck in this and we live right in
the middle of it of course that can be
influenced you know in classrooms
writing and organization and all sorts
of things I don't I mean I hear the
question often and I don't really
understand it we can do almost anything
we want
it's you know it's not like say Egypt
where you're going to get murdered by
the security forces it's a hearing
there's some regression sometimes but by
international standards by comparative
standards so slight that it hardly
counts certainly for privileged people
not for say Martin Luther King not for
people with our own color or you know
poor people and so on yeah they could
get it in the neck but for people like
us see the the opportunities are just
overwhelming there's nothing to stop all
kinds of action from education and
organizing to the political action to
demonstrations do all kinds of
resistance are possible with whole range
of things one of the kind of things that
have succeeded in the past after all we
have a history of success in getting
policy changes the New Deal legislation
for example they didn't come out of
nowhere but that came out of very
large-scale popular activism which
reached the point where the business
world and the government agreed to allow
progressive legislation to pass the
business world quickly tried to
undermine it but they had to accept it
because the next thing it takes a
sit-down strikes at by the time sit-down
strikes were taking place the business
world could easily see that the next
step is just taking over the factory
running it and kicking them out
well you don't allow that so some
legislation patent portent legislation
passed and under other massive popular
organization of pressure the other
things happened and it's happened again
I mean in the 1960s for example of the
anymore movement which I mentioned it
got from essentially nowhere to a mass
popular movement so strong that by 1968
if he read the Pentagon Papers and one
of the most interesting sections is the
final section that ends in mid-1968 and
the last the first few months of 1968
you take a look at that section there
the president wanted to send a couple
hundred thousand more troops to South
Vietnam and the military and Joint
Chiefs were opposed because they said
that they would need the troops for
civil disorder controlled
the United States the population was
just going to get out of control the
young people women minorities others and
just gonna need the troops to control
the population here they didn't send the
troops well you know when the government
gets that worried you've had in fact but
they did other horrible things could
have been worse but it was bad enough
like I mentioned but it had to be kind
of clandestine actually the same thing
happened in the Iraq war on a current of
you is that the protests the protest
against the Iraq war were historically
totally unique but I think it's a first
war in history where there was massive
protest before the war was officially
launched I can't think of a case where
that ever happen and it's claimed that
there wasn't any effect but I don't
think that's true
it should have gone on unfortunately it
reduced and that allowed more leeway for
aggression but the Iraq war King was
nothing like the war against South
Vietnam and the policies that Kennedy
and Johnson routinely carried out that
without even thinking about it we're
never tried to erect
there was no chemical warfare there was
no saturation bombing by b-52s there was
no what are called the population
control measures we drive the population
of the concentration camps that none of
these measures were even tried and I
think the reason they weren't tried is
part of a lot of reasons but one of them
was just the public it was understood
that the public was not going to re from
this time
so--okay had a kind of a retarding
effect there are other kinds of popular
organization that have had major effect
I've looked at countries a much more
civilized place now than it
in the 1960s in many respects it takes a
woman's rights I'm in 1960s women
literally still were not allowed to
serve on juries they hadn't gotten to
vote long before but in the 60s they
still women could not there were some
states where they could but in many
states they couldn't serve on jury and
they take a place same way on university
1960 almost a hundred percent white male
no now it's kind of like this that's
changed all over the country well that's
a big change in the nature of the
society and the culture it didn't happen
by magic it wasn't a gift from above it
came from extensive organizing
activities and corresponding actions
which finally broke down a lot of
barriers and freed things up that's the
way changes take place it's not a big
secret there's no magic and all those
methods are still available thank you so
let's see if we can go up to the balcony
do we have a
microphone with a questioner up there
yeah I was wondering if you'd read gar
alperovitz book America beyond
capitalism and if if you have what you
thought of his ideas in the book could
you repeat the title and author of the
book please I'm Hamid either I was
wondering if he had read gar alperovitz
America beyond capitalism okay and what
he thought of our that's very important
book and the work that he's doing that's
described there is extremely important
that's one of the things that can be
done it's very feasible the book reviews
work that alperovitz mainly has been
involved in for some years in trying to
develop worker owned enterprises mostly
in Ohio it took off in Ohio for very
interesting reasons and because it was
1977 the as part of this change in the
socio-economic policy that I was
discussing Oh the US Steel Corporation
decided to close down its operations in
Youngstown Ohio the Youngstown is a
steel town it was built by and around
thee you know the steel industry the
working people the community were
extensively involved in steel production
and all that everything that flows off
of it manufacturing plant spawns all
sorts of other things so it was a steel
town
US Steel decided to sell it off kill the
town instead of just giving up the
workers in the community would have
called the stakeholders offered to buy
the plant and run it themselves that
could have been done with enough public
support it could have happened these
were not public issues at the time that
way it didn't go to court the court
think the Union took the case to court
to try to get the right to do it they
lost in the court no but they could have
won
and it could have been carried forward
well so it was a kind of a defeat but
like a lot of defeats it wasn't the end
of the story it was the basis for moving
on to something else and what it spawned
was a lot of much smaller scale efforts
to establish worker owned enterprises a
lot of it's called the Cleveland mob
well a lot of them around Cleveland and
other parts of Ohio which are not huge
enterprises but there's a lot of them
how parrots miss book reviews all of
this you can look at it for details and
these are notice worker-owned that's
short of worker managed that would be
another step towards liberation but it's
real and it's a way of reacting to the
kind of collapse of the productive
system for the 99% we're just taking it
over actually if you take a look at
standard texts and business economics
you know nothing radical standard texts
and business economics now point out
that there's a no economic principle or
any other principle that says that
corporations should be controlled by
shareholders the shareholders
incidentally it doesn't mean somebody
who you know this pension fund has $2 of
theirs in the as a share that
shareholders are very narrowly
concentrated shareholdings like top 1%
of the population
most of it and that means big banks
interlocking directorates and so on
there's no economic principle that says
they're the ones who should determine
investment policy like just shipping
production to Foxconn there's no law of
economics incident that should happen it
could just as well be done by
stakeholders by the workforce of the
community perfectly consistent with
anything that anyone claims about
economic theory well you know there's no
reason for say the Occupy movement to be
less imaginative and ambitious than
standard business texts so yes
stakeholders could take over parts of
the economy that are being dismantled
that run them effectively and direct
them to different purposes these are
very feasible tasks so for example one
of the things that Obama's praised for
by the kind of less liberal economists
Paul Krugman and others is for having
essentially nationalized the auto
industry and reconstructed it that's
pretty much what happened well what's
the auto industry was nationalized he
just said what would happen there were
alternatives one alternative was to
reconstruct it and hand it back to the
essentially the original owners not the
same names but same class same banks and
so on
but that's what was done another
possibility would have been
and the auto industry over to the
workforce and the communities the
stakeholders and redirected towards
things that the country really needs not
only badly need high-speed rail for
example it's a you know it's a kind of a
shameful situation when you compare it
with other countries in much poorer
looking and it would be a tremendous
economic benefit to the it's the human
benefit in all kinds of respect means I
could have got here in two hours instead
of wasting time at the airport for
example literally two hours I happen to
be in France a couple of months ago
giving talks the last one I gave was all
southern France I had to get from having
you on southern friends to the airport
to go Airport and of course is praying
that goes directly to the airport it
took two hours it's the same distance as
Washington the boss makes better what
eight hours or something but oh this is
these are human costs their economic
cost the things the country badly needs
the skilled workforce at the in the auto
industry could easily be it could be
reconverted to producing things like
this and other things and people need
that could be done under the ownership
and management of the workforce and the
communities well that was an alternative
that getting back to air of it this is
the kind of thing
we talked about that particular case but
it's the kind of case that's coming up
all the time and these are very feasible
things they're not far out in Utopia now
they could have a big effect on the
society and how Perewitz is one of the
very few people is really doing very
good work on this book it's certainly
worth reading thinking about what it
describes whether Rob what options it
suggests but this comes up all the time
I should say like in Boston I didn't
warn others that a year ago those in a
suburb across important manufacturing
town there was a there was a reasonably
successful high-technology small
manufacturing plant that was producing
equipment high-tech equipment for
aircraft and they apparently were doing
ok but they weren't making up profit for
the managers in the multinational
corporation who owned them so the
corporation wanted to just dismantle it
out of the union you know I didn't like
oval workers wanted to buy the operation
and just run it themselves
well they the corporation wouldn't agree
I suspect that they wouldn't agree
mostly on the class grounds it's kind of
not a good idea to let people own and
manage their own workplaces and get the
wrong idea anyhow whatever the reason it
didn't work but if say the Occupy
movement had been around and if it had
been active and energetic enough that I
had reached out sufficiently that's the
kind of thing it could have participated
in and supported then maybe gotten it
over the edge well that'd be important
in maintaining say manufacturing in
Massachusetts and that kind of thing
goes on all the time these are options
that are all over the place
so and garbetts by the way he's also had
a long distinguished career starting
with his book atomic diplomacy about
fifty years ago as here at the
university so our dilemma is that we
could go on all night with professor
Chomsky but we need to get back home
safely so let me take one more question
and we'll wrap it up from this this side
thank you
fair enough kind of thank you for your
so if we can do both and get a question
from the other side upstairs from a
woman do we have anyone to fit the bill
yes we do so hi I'm Lindsey and I am an
adjunct professor what's known as a
Beltway adjunct I teach eight classes a
semester and I have no health insurance
and no retirement benefits
I'm communication scholar and I've
studied your work for the last 15 years
and I want to know beyond the critique
which was a marvelous critique by the
way thank you what are the discursive
strategies that we can use to combat
this kind of ideologically driven
discourse that dominates the politics
that we deal with in the classroom and
beyond every day I mean I know I have
friends colleagues and family members
who are staunchly you know staunch
supporters of Republican worldview and
it's hard to have dialogues meaningful
dialogues with them because in late
modernity facts no longer matter which
is hard because there's some legitimacy
in late modernity for challenging the
notions of truth that historically
grounded us in the Enlightenment but
what I'm wondering is with that being
the case how do we begin to talk about
truth in a meaningful way what kind of
linguistic strategies do we use to drive
change that's what I'm wondering I only
heard about half of it okay so
I'm sorry I destroyed version what
discursive strategies can we use at a
time when facts seem to this anger
little foundation yeah well before
answering let me just make a comment
expanding on the statement I made before
about one of the great victories of the
past generation namely establishing a
much higher level of women's rights it's
a huge progress but notice how far we've
we are from having reached any proper
point just but every talk I give the
same question comes up how about
allowing a question from a woman why
does that question even arise you know
like you know we don't ask the question
how about allowing the question from
somebody with blonde hair let's say why
is the discrimination so deeply embedded
and in fact internalized that you still
have to raise the question know that and
it's it's a uniform I can't remember to
talk what this didn't come up so that's
something to think about that's still a
battle to be won internally and in the
society as far as the discursive
strategies are concerned I don't think
there are any answers other than other
ones we all know but the ones that have
succeeded not 100% of course every
successes
there are some sensors oh sorry one
discursive strategies keep your hand
away there are things we can all do I
mean we're all practically everybody
here I'm sure it's for a pretty
privileged sector of the population you
have lots of opportunities you can you
can speak you can write you can organize
you can you can reach out to other
people if you keep doing it it can have
an impact
it takes a something like the women's
movement I mean a lot of you're old
enough to remember how that happened I
mean it habit began with very small
consciousness-raising groups the groups
of women getting together and talking to
each other and coming to comprehend that
a lot of its internal to comprehend that
you don't have to accept oppression that
there is oppression first of all like if
you asked my grandmother is she
oppressed she wouldn't know what you
were talking about of course she was
hopelessly oppressed but just wasn't
that's life you know it's like asking do
you breathe so just getting to
understand that you don't have to accept
the oppression you can be a free
independent person and then came efforts
to expand and there was bitter
resistance you know it wasn't easy by
any means that in fact there still is
there's a backlash and so on and so
forth but you just keep struggling for
it now the civil rights movement it
didn't get anywhere near Martin Luther
King's dream but it did have effects big
change from saying Alabama in 1960 know
things that are bad but not like that
and it's a head the same way it started
with you know goes back decades of
course but it really took off
when a couple of young black students
sat in at a lunch in outer 60 or 51
years ago they were arrested and beaten
and so on pretty soon snick form Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee the
students got some support in a Spelman
College in Atlanta where a lot of the
the snick activists came from there were
two faculty members who supported them a
Howard gen and starting Lind both
expelled but they did get some support
and they Freedom Riders Freedom buses
started there was a little participation
from the north it was very brutal that
people were killed beaten you know not
fun I mean I remember demonstrations as
late as 1965 in the South where there's
just brutal police violence and
repression the federal marshals there
kind of watching him not doing anything
but but they did it did get some games
it hit a limit it hit a limit as soon as
it reached the North it's kind of
striking Martin Luther King in 1966
expanded the movement to Chicago then
they were just dumped thought miserably
it was a mark losing effort to mobilize
the poor mobilize people around slums
moved on to the war in Vietnam huge
antagonism he ended up the way I
described just kind of written out of
history by northern liberals but it did
have success and the successes are real
and we know how they were won same with
thee with everything else on the Vietnam
War protests didn't reach a substantial
level but remember what it was like four
years I mean I when I started giving
talks about the Vietnam War in the early
sixties it was in somebody's living room
or in a church with four people no
and in fact if we tried to do it to
college say you they might thing you'd
have to bring together half a dozen
topics main men of them Vietnam and I
hope that somebody would show up as late
as October 65 that's after what Burnett
fall was describing what I quoted in
Boston which is a liberal City you could
not have a public demonstration against
the war literally would be violently
broken up often by students that's a
fact in March 1966 yeah this time the
hundreds of thousands of troops were
rampaging in South Vietnam a huge
destruction country virtually destroyed
in Boston again a liberal city since we
couldn't have public demonstrations
because they'd be broken up we tried to
have one in a church downtown church or
aankhen Street Church now the church was
attacked
you know Tomatoes cans the face actually
there was a police contingent I walked
outside that stood next to the police
captain I asked him you know can't you
do something to stop the defacing of the
church and said I can't do anything
about a minute later a tomato hit him in
the face and about thirty seconds the
place was but that was going on in March
1966 a year later there were big
demonstration and it's there were no
special kind of tricky strategies just
what we all know how to do if people
don't want to think about facts that try
to bring out the importance of
understanding facts which after all
everyone knows in fact if you look at
public attitudes that even tea party
attitudes they're kind of
social-democratic literally so for
example among Tea Party advocates and of
course the rest of the population a
considerable journey are in favor of
more spending for health and more
spending for education
they're against welfare but more
spending to help save women with
dependent children that's the result of
very effective propaganda Ronald Reagan
one of his great successes was to
demonize the concept of welfare so
welfare means for Reagan you know
Reaganite rhetoric a rich black woman
and driving to a welfare office in a
chauffeured Cadillac to take your
hard-earned money and spend it on the
drugs there's nothing well nobody's in
favor of that but are you in favor of
what welfare actually does yeah that
ought to be supported and I just don't
think it's true that people don't want
to hear about facts and the sames true
health the deficit the things I
mentioned you know not 100% but there's
a fairly simple about I think it's 2/3
of the population thinks that
corporations should be deprived of
personal rights that's a pretty
significant move now that would undo a
century of court decisions not just
citizens united goes back a century and
that's against the will of about
two-thirds of the population well all
these things offer plenty of
opportunities for discussion interchange
of Education organizing activism the
opportunities are all there it's mostly
the will to undertake them that's
lacking and it's not easy I mean that
there's costs associated with it so you
know undoubtedly even for privileged
people but you know not the costs that
people like us can't bear not that kind
of cost
so professor Chomsky has given us a lot
to think about across a really
astonishing range of topics in the best
tradition of intellectual exchange and
and of the deans lecture series before
we thank him I want to thank the
organizers of this event I want to thank
all of you for coming out tonight coming
out this evening I'm sorry we couldn't
get two more questions so please join me
in thanking professor Laura
you
