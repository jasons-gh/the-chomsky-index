it is needless to say an honor and a
privilege to be invited to speak in the
Pauling lecture series and a particular
privilege to be able to do so today on
the 50th anniversary of the founding of
the United Nations as the contours of a
New World Order were being constructed
from the ashes of the most terrible
single catastrophe of human history
there were conflicting visions at the
time of what the new world order of the
day should be defined they're still
highly relevant one view was that of the
United Nations which is now possibly
facing its demise
the second was a view that is sometimes
called realism in international
relations theory which was critical of
the utopianism that accompanied the
founding of the United Nations the
realist vision was articulated with
great clarity 50 years ago by one of the
most respected an important statesmen of
the 20th century Winston Churchill who
was speaking for the victors one of the
big three
he explained that according him now the
government of the world must be
entrusted to the satisfied nations who
wish nothing more for themselves than
what they had our power placed us above
the rest we are like rich men dwelling
in peace within their habitations and we
must keep the hungry nations from under
control for us there will be danger
earlier in century the peak of British
power before World War one Churchill had
outline the this realistic vision more
fully this time in secret in the British
cabinet meetings records of which have
recently been released after quite a few
years apparently considered rather
sensitive he said we are not young
people with an innocent record and a
scanty inheritance we have inverse to
ourselves and altogether
disproportionate share of the wealth and
traffic of the world we have got all we
want in territory but our claim to be
left in the unmolested enjoyment of that
splendid possessions mainly acquired by
violence largely maintained by force
often seems less reasonable to others
than to us so we have to teach them
lessons in reasonableness this was part
of a call for expanding the military
budget I should say a sanitized version
of that did appear in his writings but
with a very different tone well that the
more humane among the conquerors didn't
find those measures so reasonable not
for example Adam Smith who bear
condemned what he called the savage
injustice of the Europeans who he saw
very clearly two hundred years ago were
brutally creating the first world
third-world divide that is now so
dramatic and was far less so at the time
well Adam Smith was a figure of the
Enlightenment pre-capitalist
anti-capitalist in fundamental ways and
he was also smart enough to detect the
fundamental illusions of the realist
picture that Churchill
eloquently articulated the first is that
contrary to the Churchillian
version the rich men enjoying their
ample hesitate habitations are never
satisfied rather they will follow what
Adam Smith called the vile maximum of
the Masters of mankind all for ourselves
and nothing for anyone else the second
and more crucial point is that the we
who are enjoying their vast and splendid
possessions were not the people of
England nor France nor the United States
nor other imperial powers except
occasionally by accident rather
continuing in his words the principal
architects of state policy designed to
ensure that their own interests are most
peculiarly attended to however Grievous
the impact on others including the
people of their own country that's a
very valid comment in his day the
principal architects were the merchants
and manufacturers of England as he
explained today it's the huge
transnational corporations and financial
institutions that dominate the domestic
economy and in fact the International
economy and hence its politics as well
well to correct the realist vision with
Adam Smith's insights it comes out like
this
the rich man of the rich societies will
pursue their vile Maxim seeking to
expand their vast and splendid
possessions that they have gained by
violence and hold by force resorting to
savage injustice when necessary so that
those who do not will simply fall by the
wayside the lot of the vast majority of
people including those of their own
countries is simply to serve and so no
that's the realist division
the other vision of world order the
competing 150 years ago
was the vision of the United Nations or
at least the rhetoric that accompanied
its founding which I won't review
because you're engulfed in a flood of
such pronouncements and it's unnecessary
to repeat them as to which of the
conflicting visions prevailed history
has provided a rather clear and
unflattering answer now there were and
are of course plenty of people deeply
committed to the vision of the rhetoric
the term that accompanied the United
Nations then a noun and who sought to
make it more than mere rhetoric that
includes I suppose the vast majority of
the population of the world which is why
reality has to be masked in so much
secrecy and deceit it's why the
occasional honest comment such as
Churchill's
before the First World War has to be
concealed from the population for almost
a century in this case and I think it'll
be a long time before they study it in
British schools the to make the rhetoric
included also prominent individuals -
and Helen Pauling ranking high among
them but real power has always resided
elsewhere well in the United Stated over
the years from great praise to letter
contempt I'll return to that at the end
suggesting a rather simple realist
principle that I think it counts for the
variations but first let's look at the
the failures and flaws of the United
Nations that have
cause this needs changes in attitudes
towards it
there is a standard version of this it
runs sort of like this at the beginning
there were great hopes they were dashed
by the Cold War the when the Cold War
ended around 1989 1990 it there was a
period of hopefulness and then hopes
were dashed again by the ethnic
conflicts that swept the world since
well there's some representative quotes
from the most interesting period 1990
right after the end of the Cold War and
before the new catastrophes began these
are from the Washington Post in the New
York Times and leading columnist sand
editorialists but they're perfectly
standard I've actually reviewed a lot of
them in print and this is a completely
exception with pattern so here's a few
during the long cold war years the
Soviet veto and the hostility of many
third world nations made the United
Nations an object of scorn to many
Americans who were rightly at fault by
the sight of breehn face Soviet
ambassadors casting vetoes and shrill
anti-western rhetoric from third world
nations although with the end of the
Cold War 1988-89 Soviet policy changed
bringing about a wondrous sea change in
the United Nations which can finally
work the way it was designed to well
that's the picture as of 1990 and then
comes the delusion that disillusionment
the year of ethnic conflict replaced the
Cold War and the UN again failed to deal
with them so maybe the time has come to
bid it farewell that's in capsule form
the story I'd like what I'd like to do
now is to look at these two ears the
Cold War and
ethnic conflict and compare the vision
with the reality and also ask just what
role the UN played in this so let's take
the Cold War well again there's a
standard version I don't know there
waste much time on it that's you've
heard it over and over it was for
example articulated by President Kennedy
who proclaimed that the communist world
from Havana to Moscow to pay paying as
it was in those days to Saigon and so on
is a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
planning to take over everything else
his right-hand man Robert McNamara
announced in his confirmation hearings
its goal is total obliteration without
any hint of moral restraint anywhere to
be found in the entire literature of
Marxism and so on there's that's the
standard version now there is a more
sober version of that for example it's
given in scholarship so take take say
the leading the most respected American
diplomatic historian is also a major
historian the Cold War John Lewis Gaddis
he pretty much accepts what's called the
Orthodox position post revisionist
position that's often called and
realistically he traces the Cold War to
1917 agreeing with George Kennan and
others as you know right after the
Bolshevik takeover in 1917 there was a
Western invasion and gas explains the
immediate Western invasion
as defensive on sighs should say that
this invasion was taken rather seriously
for example Britain used poison gas
which is the ultimate atrocity in those
days like nuclear weapons after World
War two usually poison gas in those days
was reserved to those who were called
recalcitrant Arabs or uncivilized
tribesmen among whom it would spread a
lively terror again quoting Winston
Churchill and documents released about
15 years ago and yet to enter popular
consciousness also worth reading
well why defensive
according to Geddes because it was a
preemptive strike he explains it was
taken to ward off a potential Soviet
actions in his words it was a response
to a potentially far-reaching
intervention by the new Soviet
government in the internal affairs not
just of the West but of virtually every
country in the world namely the
revolutions challenged to the very
survival of the capitalist system so as
a preemptive strike and therefore
justified what was the challenge well
the challenge was obviously not military
conquest certainly not at that time and
in fact not at any time he argues
agreeing with most serious scholarship
and in fact with the internal documents
rather the challenge the potential
challenge that was going to come that
justified the defensive invasion was the
demonstration effect of an alternative
social models development model that
might have appeal in the traditional
service areas of the south but even
among working people and the poor in the
industrial
himself that was a prospect that varied
greatly concerned Lloyd George Woodrow
Wilson is Secretary of State Robert
Lansing and many others and indeed that
remains the primary concern as far as
record reaches which right now is into
the 1960s right through that's the
primary concern the over the Soviet
challenge for example when John F
Kennedy and Prime Minister Macmillan of
England were discussing the Soviet
challenge in the early sixties that was
precisely their concern and this wasn't
just the Soviet Union the same concerns
were voiced with regard to China and
Vietnam and many others ensure it was
the perceived success of the so-called
communist model there's nothing to do
with communism but that's what it's
called
it's the procedure except the communist
model that was considered a threat and
that's pretty understandable when you
look at the comparable situation and the
comparable Western domains I should add
that
Stalin's awesome crimes were of course
well known but almost totally irrelevant
to these calculations Truman for example
liked and admired Stalin thought he was
honest I said what happened inside the
Soviet Union he didn't care about he
thought it would be a disaster if
anything happened to the great man and
his great friend and said you could get
along fine with Stalin as long as the
United States got its way 85% of the
time shirk the same view in internal
records of course
early 1945 after that is Churchill and
internal cabinet records was defending
Stalin as honest and trustworthy and
we've got to deal with him he admired
and he spoke in fact very glowingly of
him in private meetings
mass-murderer was not known but not
relevant in this respect Stalin
falls into a sort of a pretty
traditional pattern he falls into a long
line of monsters and gangsters including
su carto will be visiting in a week or
so trujillo sane and a host of other
killers and torturers including the man
who president roosevelt called that
admirable italian gentleman who had
brought fascism to italy and even
including hitler well into the late
1930s the crime what's is not following
orders but we don't get our way
eighty-five percent of the time or more
history is very clear on that a few
years before the Kennedy McMillan
exchanges that I just mentioned
President Eisenhower and John Foster
Dulles the Secretary of State had
highlighted the central issue in private
internal discussions recent recently
Declassified they were lamenting the
ability of the communist so-called to
appeal directly to the masses and gain
control of mass movements something we
have no capacity to duplicate because
the poor people are the ones they appeal
to and they have always wanted to
plunder the rich the big problem of
world history
and how many others recognize their on
position on who should plunder whom was
a pretty hard sell so the opposition had
a kind of unfair advantage and they were
trying to figure out how to deal with
this well rich record which suggests a
different perspective on the Cold War
that perspective happens to be
reinforced quite powerfully I think when
you look further for example at the
quite rich and interesting record of
declining documents which stress
forcefully and consistently that the
major threaten US interests and quoting
is radical nationalism that calls for
improvement in the lower living
standards of the masses and development
for domestic needs based on the
principle that the first beneficiaries
of a country's resources should be the
people of that country not foreign
investors conception that must be
destroyed in all its forms as the State
Department insisted in the Charter for
the Americas that it imposed on the
Western Hemisphere right in 1945 as the
new world order was being established
consistent themes that run through the
whole record as they do for Britain
before us and though I haven't looked I
imagine France and Belgium and anybody
else you look at which is consistent
with this for some pretty dramatic
examples of it so take one example from
just a few years ago you recall that
about ten years ago the United States
was engaged in what the World Court
condemned as the unlawful use of force
against Nicaragua and when the World
Court condemned the United States for
its aggression against Nicaragua
were to desist from the crimes as well
as the unlawful economic work there and
of course the u.s. dismissed the
judgment without concern and in fact
Congress voted right after another
hundred million dollars to increase the
unlawful use of force against Nicaragua
well at that time the selling point what
the Reagan administration used to sell
Congress on the need to do this was the
the what they could be something is done
and the announcement by the government
of Nicaragua that they were conducting a
revolution Without Borders and that
became the centerpiece of the US
propaganda campaign it was all over the
media the journals as I say it induced
Congress to step up the war the sound
earnestness had actually announced that
they were going to conquer the world
case you didn't know it they were going
to carry out a revolution with that word
well that's an interesting case that's
because the in fact was based on some
reality as propaganda usually is it was
based on speech by a Sundance the leader
Thomas bore faith and in which he said
every country has to carry out its own
revolution we can interfere with anyone
else but we would like to construct the
model that will work so well that others
will want to follow so that in that
sense he said our revolution transcends
words so in a certain sense the the US
propaganda was correct he again was
issuing a challenge the
others might want a development model
that others might want to follow and
that requires a defensive response
namely international terrorism and
aggression and terror and torture and so
on because after all we have to defend
ourselves from that challenge so there's
nothing true about the fabrication
incidentally the fabrication was
perfectly well known it was exposed
instantly right in the mainstream in the
Washington Post in fact within days but
nobody cared it was just too useful so
therefore it continued to be reiterated
as something is to revolution Without
Borders it's kind of an interesting fact
about our own culture that this kind of
thing can happen so easily and so off
another point of view from which you can
gain some perspective on the reality of
the Cold War I think is tip is to carry
out the following test which is indeed
rather useful after any war it's very
interesting after any war is over to ask
whose rejoicing and who's unhappy when
you carry out it often makes the war
look rather different than the way it
was interpreted about what it was really
about so let's look at the Cold War
whose rejoicing and who's unhappy well
honey in the east the people who rejoice
are easy to find that's the old
Communist Party leadership they are rich
beyond their wildest dreams just
delighted with everything that's
happened obviously they're the victors
in the Cold War they are now the
managers of the u.s. Center prizes that
are being set up they're sort of taking
on the role of the typical third world
elite very rich very powerful working
for the bosses somewhere else and very
well-off so their delight
they're called in fact the capitalist
nomenclature very often that's the old
communist party hacks who are now very
powerful very rich very much beloved by
the West so they're the victors they won
in the cold who's unhappy about the end
of the Cold War in the east well they're
poles now taken by the West about
attitudes in Russia and so on Western
run polls so pretty accurate and one of
the questions they asked regularly is
what do you think is the best period of
Russian history well the latest one that
was taken two thirds said the pre
perestroika period you know before the
before Gorbachev that was the best
period two thirds that's up from fifty
percent about in 1992 the future has
declined that's it's rather general
through the region people are delighted
that the tyrannies collapsed but they're
less than happy about returning to the
third world status that they had before
so they're less than happy about the
fact that since 1989 in Russia there has
been have been about a half a million
excess deaths resulting from the reforms
according to a recent UNESCO study which
indeed approves of the reforms but gives
the figures so there's people who one
were in the east and there's people who
lost the war in the East what about in
the West well among the people who were
rejoicing about the end of the Cold War
our Western business leaders for example
the directors of General Motors
and dave repents and Volkswagen and so
on and their reasons that are explained
with great clarity in the International
Business press for example the British
Financial Times which has been pointing
out that the big games from the end of
the Cold War typical example is an
article called green chutes and
communism ruins and it's horrible over
there but something good some green
chutes the green chutes are that the
effect of the capitalist reforms has
been to cause tremendous impoverishment
and unemployment so it is now possible
for Western investors to get highly
trained skilled educated workers for a
fraction of the cost of the pampered
Western workers I'm quoting who will
have to abandon their luxurious
lifestyles as Businessweek added so
they're on the other hand who's unhappy
in the West well among the people who
are unhappy are the pampered Western
workers who are less than overjoyed
having to give up their luxurious
lifestyles now that say General Motors
ordained lament that cannot only
threaten and in fact bring down their
wages and benefits and increase their
working hours and so on by either moving
or threatening to move to Mexico but now
also to Poland and Slovakia and so on so
they are less than delighted they lost
the Cold War well if you look at this
way there are winners and there are
losers the winners are the Communist
Party leadership and Western business
leaders the losers are the people in
Eastern Europe and the people in the
West actually that's not uncommon after
worse and it relates to Adam Smith's
point about who the we are and when you
talk about we the Cold War makes even
more sense when you look at it in a
broader historical perspective so east
and west Europe did not be the
differentiation between Eastern and
Western Europe that goes back to the
15th century the last time they look
alike was about the 15th century that
point Western Europe was beginning to
develop and Eastern Europe was beginning
to turn into its service area its third
world as we would call it now providing
resources and raw materials and cheap
labor and investment opportunities and
markets and so on that was beginning on
the 15th century actually pre Columbus a
fault line incidentally that runs kind
of through Germany and it continued that
difference continued to deepen right
after this century
so I say Russia was becoming relatively
impoverished relative to the West more
and more
up until the first world war and for
large parts of Eastern Europe had
continued up to the Second World War the
so the east-west
relationship was a first world third
world relationship what's called a
north-south relationship these days one
of the few foam is emits used for the
European conquest of the world
the lie is that the South surface areas
on the third world there pursue only
what's called complementary development
complementary to the interests of
Western power they're not supposed to
follow these bad ideas about development
on the basis of the principle that the
beneficiaries of the people's resources
should be the people of that own of that
country
which supports the interests of the rich
men in the rich societies and
Churchillian realistic rhetoric and if
they try development that's got to be
stopped and it's sometimes in other ways
but it's got to be stopped
that's the north-south conflict goes on
and it begins successful that is if
there is a demonstration effect then
they become what is called in the
planning documents a rotten apple that
might spoil the barrel or a virus that
might infect others and obviously you
can't allow a virus to spread so they've
got to be eliminated for example my n
days joy was described by Henry
Kissinger as a virus
that might infect people all the way to
Italy not because Chile was gonna
conquer Rome but because it might be it
might send the wrong message to Italian
voters namely that social democratic
parliamentary procedures can succeed and
that's got it stopped so the government
was overthrown and the effect neo Nazi
regime regime was instituted and
supported think about the east-west
conflict a good part of it fits into
that framework there was a big East of
the third world was following a path of
Independence and furthermore it was
becoming a virus it was imposing that
challenge that was so threatening from
1917 at least into the 1960s for the
reasons I mentioned well typical piece
of the third world it's not like grenade
it's a six of the world even when it was
a deeply impoverished third-world
country under the Tsar it's still a big
military force which frightened people
and that was even more so in the 20th
century took on a life of its own and
that's called the Cold War but basically
a lot of it falls right into the
traditional north-south framework I
think when you think it through from
this point of view which i think is the
accurate one well I should also add that
the aftermath of the Cold War is
completely understand intelligible and
indeed predictable in these terms
most of the region is going back where
it was so the parts that were part of
the industrial West like the Czech
Republic in western Poland are again
becoming like the industrial West and
the parts that were deeply impoverished
world countries are going back pretty
much to that status they look more and
more like the third world with the small
wealthy elites the old Communist Party
to a large extent and the suffering and
impoverished mass of the population
typical view wherever you go Mexico
South Egypt anywhere
well this position is reinforced I think
when you look at the continuity of
policy right through the whole period so
let's just take the period when the Cold
War ended 1989 certainly ended by the
fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989
we have a huge Pentagon system so what
has happened to the Pentagon budget
since the end of the Cold War we needed
this huge military system because we had
to defend ourselves from the monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy ok the
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy isn't
there so what happened to the Pentagon
system answer it's the same it's
actually higher in real terms than under
Nixon right now about 85% of the Cold
War average and we're not the current
Congress is driving it up so I've been
the reason the reason we were told for
50 years can't be the reason in fact
there is a new official reason the
reason is now defend ourselves from the
technological sophistication of third
world powers it's literally the case
not from the monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy anymore
and that about as much plausibility is
the other one so obviously it's a
different reason and it's not very hard
to figure out the well pics a Cuban you
know on the front pages right now for
thirty years from Cuba we had to carry
out the world's biggest international
terrorist campaign and economic warfare
and so on and so forth because we're
defending ourselves from the monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy okay then walls
no monolithic and ruthless conspiracy so
what do we do we intensify the pressure
against humans we met embargo type and
now even more so so something's got to
be wrong with that story
1989
well the first event that took place
after the fall of the Berlin Wall was
the u.s. invasion of Panama few weeks
later event that it barely merits a
footnote in history I mean it's kind of
thing that happens over and over but
there was a difference this time but for
since about for a long every such action
was justified by defense against the
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy we
had to defend ourselves from the
Communists and there were revolutions
without borders and so on they were gone
so this time we were defending ourselves
from Hispanic narco traffickers led by
the Archdemon Noriega who was in fact
kidnapped and brought here and tried for
crimes that he committed while he was on
the CIA payroll kind of small
the United Nations let's turn out of the
United Nations they were in session that
was their winter session and there were
indeed some Security Council vetoes 3-1
Security Council veto was on Israel's
actions in the occupied territories
voted 14 to 1 the United States and he
towed it the other two were
condemnations of the u.s. attack on
Panama the both vetoed by the United
States the General Assembly also had
some very lopsided votes you know it's
kind of similar to eat those know
technical veto there in fact one was a
resolution condemning the continuation
of the unlawful use of force against
Nicaragua voted unanimously US and
Israel alone against resolution
condemning Washington's the illegal
economic warfare against Nicaragua again
two votes against United States and
Israel that's actually one vote when you
think about it's like resolution
condemning the illegal US economic
warfare against Cuba two votes against
the United States in Israel the
preceding year the US had gotten Romania
that they dropped off traditional
standard line about the grim-faced
Soviet ambassadors in the Soviet vetoes
that were paralyzing the United Nations
now the only thing that's wrong with
that is the facts which are perfect
they're not debatable
the you know perfectly clear and
explicit facts assess the 1960's the
United States is far in the lead in
vetoing Security Council resolutions in
second place
the United Kingdom France is a distant
third and the Soviet Union is fourth
that's not controversial that's a fact
same is true in the General Assembly
there are plenty of votes in the General
Assembly with numbers like one hundred
and fifty three to one or one hundred
and fifty to two or something like that
why issues including aggression human
rights international law observance of
international law terrorism and so on
through them you'll find consistently
the one is the United States with maybe
Israel or El Salvador or somebody
dragging along
consistent pattern since the nineteen
sixties it's almost totally suppressed
in our Free Press and no it's pressed
but there's just endless lying about the
claim dramatically different from the
easily documentary facts on
controversial fact which again is an
interesting fact about our intellectual
culture you can think about it and draw
these conclusions well let's put that
aside and turn to ethnic conflicts since
the end of the Cold War namely within
the imperial system that collects Soviet
Union so inside the former Soviet Union
and the Balkans were Imperial systems
have collapsed their ethnic conflicts
and it doesn't call for any deep
thoughts from leading intellectuals in
fact it is standard and expected with
the decline of some system of Authority
and tear it so post-colonial Africa
quickly broke into ethnic conflicts work
to take the most recent case prior to
the collapse of the Soviet empire take
the Portuguese Empire that's the last
empire that collapsed in 1975 and
immediately it led to violent ethnic
conflicts in Africa and Southeast Asia
where the Portuguese colonies were the
moat three most important were
Mozambique Angola and teamwork these are
the most cases of ethnic conflict in the
modern era and they don't have anything
to do with the Cold War they go back to
1975 the deccan Angola there's a lot of
time so perhaps I can just cook the
historical Davidson who says that in his
words those responsible for the Contra
subversions
against Mozambique and Angola will be
cursed by history for enormous and
terrible crimes which will Longway
heavily on the whole of southern Africa
he's referring to you and me
incidentally if it's not obvious and
he's quite right in fact too kind the
United Nations Commission on Africa
estimates 1.4 over 1.5 million dead and
over 60 billion in damages in the Reagan
years alone 1980 to 1988 by way of South
Africa with strong us support
that's and within framework of what's
called here constructive engagement and
an angle that continues at a horrible
level worse than the Balkans in fact
well that's - of ethnic conflicts the
third teamer is not a slight matter it's
the worst slaughter relative to
population since the Holocaust a clear
unambiguous ethnic conflict and indeed
the worst case in post-war history
outright aggression still continuing
we're getting to the 20th anniversary
in a few weeks and it's proved that the
United Nations failed to stop it
big failure so therefore let's dismantle
the United Nations until we look a
little more closely and we find that
it's true that the United Nations failed
to stop it because the u.s. blocked the
United Nations in the words of the State
Department things to turn out as they
did and it was my task he writes to
render the United Nations utterly
ineffective in anything it might do to
prevent the aggression and I was very
successful in this task he takes great
pride in it then points out within a few
weeks about a tenth of the population
had been slaughtered approximately the
level of total casualties in Eastern
Europe under the Nazi attack he says I'm
not padding that and then he goes on to
the next sentence so it's true that the
United Nations not next topic so the
United Nations was indeed rendered
utterly ineffective but it's not the
problem with the United Nations the u.s.
role was decisive not only diplomatic ly
but also militarily the invading
Indonesian army was 90 percent equipped
with American arms under a treaty that
required that they can be used only for
self-defense Henry Kissinger who was
then Secretary of State secretly sent
more immediately right after the
invasion the couple years later
indonesian army had actually run out it
was beginning to run out of arms because
of the ferocity of the assault so the
President Jimmy Carter took off a little
time from sermons about human right and
isolated the flow of arms at the point
when the slaughter was really
approaching genocide in 1978 well that
there's consequences to this Anna's
senator is held all over the place for
his dedication of the international law
and morality x' lone voice of honor the
united nations standing up against all
kind of third-world tyrants now for
claiming about the united nations unless
it's able to stop genocide in Bosnia it
has no right to exist and so on and so
forth Jimmy Carter need not mention
Henry Kissinger is also giving speeches
about the importance of peacekeeping at
the United Nations and so on this year
well interestingly the team was pretty
remote place but the coverage of it was
quite hot pretty 1975 in the context of
concern about the collapsing Portuguese
Empire when the invasion took place with
decisive US diplomatic and military
support coverage began to decline that
what there was was mostly with all in
fact reiteration of State Department
lies or quoting Indonesian generals by
1978 when the atrocities peaked and new
US arms were flowing coverage reached
zero in the United States not a word
anywhere also interesting historic by
the 1980s coverage began sometimes
accurate coverage but it's interesting
in character the tone of the coverage
he is given for example by a New York
Times editorial headed Schoen of
Indonesia well ok shaming of Indonesia
but how about shaming of the United
States or shaming of the New York Times
that's a perception and you're not
allowed to have or you read that we
didn't do enough we made a mistake we
didn't do enough to stop the carnage and
the terror and so on well the fact is we
did more than enough as ambassador has
himself written and as the record of
military aid shows it wasn't we didn't
do enough that's not saying that the
rest if the Russians had said we didn't
do enough to stop the atrocities in
Hungary or something
yeah that's not quite the way to put it
the last couple of years to to put some
constraints on US participation in this
still continuing atrocity the Clinton
administration defines have to search
for sort of devious ways to avoid the
congressional restrictions which it
indeed has done but nevertheless that's
important it's symbolically significant
and might even was enough pressure lead
to Indonesian withdrawal that's
conceivable there are also inside
Indonesia that we don't hear about human
rights groups student groups labor
leaders and so on has begun to speak way
out condemning the Indonesian invasion
of East Timor and in fact speaking up
for human rights and working with
working people and so on now in
Indonesia's and
and talk about these things it's not so
simple it's not like here here you do it
nothing happens to you there you're in a
terrorist tyrannical and vicious state
but there and that's another thing that
might be called the shaming of the
United States I think that we don't
report it and support them whether we
don't do it ourselves it's certainly a
lot easier well the end of Portuguese
Empire 20 years ago that are far the
consequence is the end of the Soviet
empire the end of the French Empire long
slow process that still works
consequences the Algerian war the words
in Indochina our own wars in Indochina
left about 4 million people dead in 3
countries in total ruin and this the
aggressors benefit from impunity within
the doctrinal system and these aren't
even called ethnic conflicts because
we're one of the participants but if we
use the term in any meat since these are
ethnic conflicts on a huge scale with
dwarfed anything that's happened after
the fall of the Soviet empire there was
all of these things but it was very far
at the margins when you take a serious
look and indeed that's recognized in
internal documents say the Middle East
there's a ethnic conflict mainly for
quite some time 20 years so nothing to
do at the end of the Cold War makes it
to the front pages here so for example
after the bombing of Oklahoma City
bombing you remember big headlines all
over about how Oklahoma City looks like
Beirut big tragedy you know the horrors
of Beirut are coming right the
mainstream America furthermore if we
have
find the guy if it turns out that the
people who did that horrible atrocity
we're from the Middle East we're gonna
bomb everybody in sight and so on and so
forth Oklahoma City was indeed looking
like Beirut of course has been looking
like Beirut for quite some time exactly
ten years earlier most of the day since
we like anniversaries that was when the
largest part bomb in history went off in
Beirut this was a the worst terrorist
act in the Middle East at the peak of
concern about international terrorism it
was a bomb big huge car bomb very much
like Oklahoma City who was set off
outside of Moz time to go off to kill
the maximum number of people when they
were leaving killed mostly women and
children you know all over the place
children in their beds and all sorts of
things like I'm very much like Oklahoma
City huge catastrophes no in that case
it's not too difficult to chase the
perpetrators to the ends of the earth or
at the bomb any country that's harboring
them and so on at least if the US Air
Force has the capacity to bomb
Washington and California and Texas and
so on with maybe a few extra bombs left
in London and the reason is because as
is perfectly openly acknowledged the
bombing was carried out the CIA with the
assistance of British intelligence so
it's true Oklahoma City was looking like
Beirut for good reasons because they
looked like Beirut there's no problem
finding the perpetrators and punishing
them just Sunday and the United Nations
Clinton called on all the nations of the
world to join with us in ending the
horror of international terrorism and
making sure that any nation that
tolerates international terrorists has
becomes a pariah and is punished and so
on again that's easily within our power
but somehow this ever gets discussed
it's not the fact that the Oklahoma City
bombing was a virtual duplicate of the
Beirut bombing ten years earlier of
course they're aware of it I mean I know
personally I brought the attention of
lots of journalists in the United States
and England if they hadn't been aware of
it themselves they probably were but
this is undiscussables you cannot speak
of u.s. aggression or ethnic conflict
when there's a conflict between us and
people in Indochina it ends up with
formal you know them killed and so on is
the very symbol of ethnic conflict and
there's some reasons for the problems
there there is also a grand success in
the least right next door overcoming
ethnic conflicts just with Nobel Peace
Prizes recently Oslo to just the place
it was a day of all as the headlines
said in which we celebrated the u.s.
triumphs and bringing to an end at least
close to an end this terrible ethnic
conflict between Jews and Arabs and the
Middle East actually what happened there
is a little different there's not much
time to talk about it but in fact what
happened was a most impressive power
played by the United States involving
which tells a lot about the New World
Order and also about the failures of the
United Nations fact of the matter is
that for about 25 years
the United States
rendering the United Nations utterly
ineffective in anything it might do to
bring about a resolution of that
conflict the diplomatic resolution
that's certainly been true since
February 1971 when Egypt accepted US
policy official US policy on the Middle
East and call for a full peace treaty
with Israel on the international borders
with all the security guarantees and all
the wordings of the resolutions in fact
identical to official US policy that was
with the support of virtually the entire
world Israel rejected it recognized it
to be a genuine peace order but we offer
but rejected it and Henry Kissinger
succeeded in the split inside the US
government as to whether to continue
with their traditional policy or to
shift to opposing our traditional policy
and opposing negotiations and diplomatic
settlement then Kissinger won men battle
achieving what he called Stanley meaning
no diplomacy and ever since then the
United States has been opposed Mac
settlement well that was by the United
Nations UN mediator so that's one time
when the UN was rendered utterly
ineffective by a u.s. veto a few years
later January 1976 when the Security
Council debated a resolution calling for
political settlement in sported by the
entire world in fact the Arab states PLO
supported it Western Europe supported
non-aligned countries Eastern Europe it
was vetoed by the United States history
like the February 71 events that was
Kissinger again same thing happened
under Carter same resolution eliminated
the UN the Security Council was
eliminated the issue therefore came up
regularly in the General Assembly in
fact every year the votes were always
like 150 to 200 or something like that
was December last serious vote was
December 1990 stage is important that
was the last of the annual votes that
was 144 to usual numbers what happened
December 1990 well and the the Gulf were
effectively understand that
well actually George Bush put it rather
clearly that the new world order is in
effect in his words it means what we say
goes certainly in the Middle East and
the rest of the world is back off Europe
pulled out of the game the non-aligned
countries we're out of it this array
Arab world completely collapsed at this
point the US but ran through its own
completely rejectionist proposal which
involves limited instead of complete
withdrawal and no rights at all for the
Palestinians that's the position the US
had upheld against the rest of the world
for 25 years and now is able to ran
through a genuine peace process could be
instituted as it was immediately at
Madrid it's genuine because
was under a unilateral us control and it
followed the rejectionist u.s. position
and that's exactly what has been
implemented in fact what has been
implemented even Oslo two is partially
than any proposal that the Israeli
government itself had ever made from
1968 right up to the present so
naturally it's a day of law and another
case in which the UN failed for reasons
that are worth thinking about well we're
not UN after 50 years now there's a good
deal of self-righteous commentary and
it's about its failings I've given some
indication of why and where it failed I
think you can check and see if you think
this is right the lion's share of those
risk of that responsibility falls not
very surprisingly on the world's most
powerful states and in particular its
most powerful State exactly as any
rational person would have expected the
most powerful state has indeed been
rendering the United Nations ineffective
and ambassador Moynihan's words since
the 1960s when the United Nations fell
under what is called here the tyranny of
the majority sometimes known as
democracy the whole story is amazing
well right now the years and
increasingly now in fact more
announcements in this morning's paper
the United States is proceeding to
dismantle the United Nations on May 1st
Congress announced radical cuts in US
assistance to UNICEF and similar
organizations I was very well time on
May 1st UNICEF had its annual press
conference the UNICEF of course is run
by an American the u.s. insisted on that
does another standard power play Carol
Bellamy and she gave the press
conference which wasn't reported but
interesting UNICEF estimated that the
number of children who were dying from
easily treatable diseases meaning and
can cure it for a few pennies a day had
risen from 11 that in a year to 13
million a year and that's what UNICEF
was trying to deal with so on that day
aside from not reporting the UNICEF
report Congress cut Congress cut aid the
UNICEF and in fact UNICEF will disappear
it has the wrong priorities the federal
the FAO the Food and Agricultural
organization that's slated for
disappearance again as the wrong
priorities poor and hungry people around
the world the international labor
organization that's going to go the same
way and there's a reason for that
the deals with worker rights and the US
as the worst record in the Western
Hemisphere and Europe with the exception
of El Salvador and Lithuania so we're
third actually in ratifying conventions
on worker rights including things like
children's labor and things like that
and further
additional crime two years ago it
Christmas the United States it very
rarely criticizes a rich industrial
country but it broke the pattern and
criticized the United States for
violating international labor standards
by the employment of permanent
replacement workers which is in gross
violation of universally accepted
international labor standards so that
they're obviously not to be allowed
disappear the UN the same story
USS sharp cut funding for it and is
going to get rid of it it has the wrong
priorities the vast majority of the
world's population there used to be a
monitoring office just provided data on
transnational corporations in fact it
was the only source of information on
transnational corporations that was
killed the couple years ago it's the
wrong information I mean it was pretty
hard to get the information anyway but
at least you could know you just can't
that's almost dead and we'll blatant
fraud about new information order and so
on which is well documented in scholarly
work published by university presses but
unreviewable the UN conference on Trade
and Development that's slated to
disappear was announced this morning in
fact because its functions will be taken
over by the World Trade Organization so
it's irrelevant well for those of you
who know about these issues that's total
nonsense the problem with that is that
it keeps refuting the neoliberal
fundamentalism of the World Trade
Organization and showing that it's false
and fabricated and so on they've got
their the gut economists are giving the
wrong analysis they're continually
undermining the claims about the wonders
of the free market
that are preached to by the World Trade
Organization but preached in a very
special way there preached to the poor
abroad and at home they have to accept
market discipline but they are not
preached to people I say Newt Gingrich
and his constituency Cobb County Georgia
which gets more federal subsidies than
any comparable county in the country
because it's represented by the biggest
welfare in the country the market
discipline they always have massive
state protection in all sorts of ways in
our case the biggest form of sets of the
transfer payments to the rich is the
penny and that's why the budget doesn't
go down in fact goes up when reactionary
status of the current type take over so
no one for them disciplined for the poor
next mistake of documenting explaining
and analyzing the consequences of all of
this so they go to be taken over by the
World Trade Organization that doesn't
have defects the United Nations are
slated for dismissal amazing thing will
go that's not passed unnoticed they
should say the South Commission which
represents the overwhelming majority of
the population of the world the
non-aligned countries couple years ago
called challenge to the South published
by Oxford University Press unreviewed to
my knowledge which called for a new
world order based on justice and freedom
and they explained what's going on in
the world
well and they pointed out that the
Democratic parts of the UN are being
dismantled the parts that have
commitment to the general population
instead of those who matter none as
areas discussed or recorded apart from
the margins just as the actual record on
vetoes some General Assembly votes and
much else again these are things that
might interest us might even concern us
least those people who have some concern
for the nature of their own society and
our own culture well the principle that
explains the attitudes towards the
United Nations that are articulated by
the intellectual culture
I'm afraid the principle is all too
simple in so far the United Nations is
following the orders of Churchill's rich
men and the rich societies exactly to
that extent it is honored to the extent
it deviates from that it is condemned
it's rare in a complicated world for a
simple criterion to be such a good
predictor but if you look carefully
you'll find that this is an extremely
good predictor of the whole oscillation
of them back including the hopefulness
in 1990
well if Churchillian realism continues
to prevail in a global system and
there's no way increasingly at home as
well because there's an obvious domestic
analog to all this if that's the case
then the future is going to be bleak but
we should remember that these are by no
means laws of nature nor are they laws
of society even if such laws exist but
these are human decisions that can be
made differently within human decisions
the unit institutions that have no
particular claims of permanence or
legitimacy as throughout history all of
this can be changed as it has been in
the past and in the same ways in the
age-old freedom can be advanced if we so
choose you've been listening to MIT
professor of linguistics and philosophy
know'm Chomsky delivering the 1995 ava
helen and linus pauling memorial lecture
for world peace the title of professor
Chomsky's lecture was prospects for
world order the lecture was delivered on
the Oregon State University campus in
Corvallis Oregon on October 24th 1995 in
a moment we'll return to the question
and answer segment of the program
no Amjad Sookie is world renowned for
his revolutionary work in linguistics
and philosophy he was an early opponent
of the United States invasion and war in
Vietnam and has since become equally
well known for his criticism of u.s.
foreign policy throughout the world at
the time of this lecture October 24th
1995
his most recent book was World Order's
old and new in recent years his
publications include hegemony or
survival America's quest for global
dominance failed States the abuse of
power and the assault on democracy and
perilous power the Middle East and u.s.
foreign policy dialogues on terror
democracy war and justice with Jill Baer
H Carr to find out more about Noam
Chomsky and his work please visit his
website at WWE Champion foe and now we
return to the question and answer
segment of the program
but if people want to say something and
talk it you speak up I hear you and I'll
repeat if people can't meet Opower
simply look at the simply take the
realest position that Churchill
articulated the rich men and the rich
societies run the show and simply ask
yourself who's the richest who are the
richest men and which is the richest
Society the United States is
overwhelming the richest and most
powerful Society in the world by any
measure economic power military power
security you name so of course if that's
the biggest voice I mean you know what
could be more obvious propaganda system
which naturally tries to efface the
obvious but if you think about it
reasonably what else would you expect to
happen doesn't happen but it'll only
changes people inside the United States
which is also maybe the freest country
in the world do something about it we're
not living in Indonesia you know I mean
we're not living in Iraq it's easy to
get here to change policy but of course
first you have to be aware and you have
to want to change it you have to do
something about it otherwise it'll just
go by the natural processes
western press 1983 around 1983 early the
unesco called for what was called a new
information order and it came under
better attack in the West American press
government intellectuals and so on still
being attacked for trying to impose
constraints on press freedom and in fact
that's not what it was claiming did
that's not what you what the new
information order was calling for what
it was calling for was an end to the
monopoly over global information on the
part of powerful Western actually
tyrannical institutions which is what
the private the media corporations are
they're calling for the fraud was
exposed at once there are very good
academic studies that the best one I
know is a book published by the
University of Minnesota press by edited
by winning pressed and Edwin Herman and
Herbert Schiller careful academic study
showing what the actual information were
was how reacted how that how the
exposing the lies about it very
effective never reviewed never discussed
the books called hope and folly and the
attack on the UNESCO continues unchanged
just like the revolution Without Borders
is
the people like say Erskine childr is a
distinguished Irish diplomat has been in
the UN forever has written about this
and others write about it but without
eight without any ability to penetrate
into our intellectual culture which
isn't remarkably I mean you know we
don't live under tyranny but the
similarity the totalitarianism is pretty
dramatic sometimes but it doesn't
compare with the usual consequences of
the breakup of tyrannical systems like
it's nowhere near as bad as what
followed the breakup of the Portuguese
Empire the French Empire and so on but
it's bad enough and few years it's been
going on since 1985 and even in the 90s
the atrocities in Angola were worse by a
long shot than the Balkans so compare
for example Sarajevo and quita well
everybody knows about Sarajevo huge
coverage of Sarajevo you know horror
Serbian crude Serbian peasants
bombarding sorry AVO it is an atrocity
and about 10,000 people have been killed
during the same years about 25,000
people have been killed in cuido that's
just one town and Angola of course
they've been killed - you can check to
see how many index entries there are for
Crito in the new york times they're
being killed by the wrong kind of person
is the wrong person to mention namely by
a person who was hailed as a leading
freedom fighter in the 1980s and a great
hero namely the man who was
the Contra subversion that we were
backing that basil Davidson who I quoted
said would be cursed by history so we
don't talk about that the it's bad
enough you know it's nowhere near other
things but bad enough the reasons for it
you can debate and argue but I think
it's pretty clear where it's going u.s.
policy has been more or less the the
Europe wants to quiet it has wanted to
quiet it down because it's dangerous for
Europe the United States also wants it
to quiet down not blow up into a
regional conflict that might involve
Turkey and Greece and harm u.s.
interests anywhere as long as it's
contained it's not a big problem for the
West and therefore you know the European
powers have become involved in
peacekeeping and relief operations the
u.s. refuses to become involved at all
except just to bomb somebody but not do
anything else US policy has been to keep
it contained and now that it looks like
the kind of solution that Washington is
wanted may be achievable the u.s. is
moving in to try to achieve it that
solution is a partition of the former
Yugoslavia into a greater Serbia and a
greater Croatia Croatia being our ally
which is getting us military support and
aid and training and it looks like
that's what's happening I mean behind
the facade of you know preserving Bosnia
and so on it looks like what's emerging
is a partition between Serbia and
Croatia in which there may be something
called Bosnia but mostly on paper and
now that that looks feasible Washington
is indeed trying to move in to implement
it and there's some conflict now between
the White House and Congress is to you
know whether to even go that far I mean
there are all sorts of reasons for this
and one could look into it but yeah I
think that's the rough contours of it
this country depends what we do with it
now this country has all sorts of
advantages all sorts of prospects
extraordinary wealth tremendous amount
of freedom and all kind of privilege I
mean it is what you make of it just ask
yourself what's changed anything in the
past and we got a couple thousand years
of history to look at what individuals
did never made any difference what
organized groups of people did made a
big difference I mean we you know that's
why we don't have feudalism we don't
have slavery in recent years the civil
rights movement as an example the
anti-war movement solidarity movements
environmental movements feminist
movements you name them right in our own
immediate history they've made a big
difference when the labor movement has
been the centerpiece of most struggles
for social justice for obvious reasons
when people get together even people who
are poor and without power and privilege
and so on what they get together they
can do quite a lot in fact there's no
limits to what they can do but if they
sit alone and ask what can I do nothing
and it's not that there's any big
secrets about this I mean we all know
how to do it if you're interested in if
you're concerned with something you ask
first of all what it is you find other
people who have similar concerns they
usually exist right near you and maybe
they're even organized you join them and
you do the kinds of things that will
advance those interests and concerns in
coordination with others it can get to
be huge mass movements I mean for
example let's take say that we're the
richest country in the world let's take
the poorest country in the hemisphere
where people and ask how they reacted
Haiti you know there is no country that
has fewer opportunities than Haiti I
mean it is just totally it was a very
rich country I should say and a lot of
Europe's wealth comes from Haiti which
was the richest colony in the world and
the u.s. plenty of it too but now it's a
desert practically well you know a
couple of years ago people in the desert
the poorest people in hemisphere
the Haitian slums and Hills managed to
construct out of their own efforts a
vibrant lively civil society based on
grassroots movements and unions and all
sorts of things and it was so powerful
nobody was paying any attention to it
because nobody looks at what goes on
with those weird people but it got
powerful enough so it swept its own
president office astonishing everybody
and calling forth a huge terror of
course which we incidentally back but
that's what you do about it now you know
if we were to do that no country would
there would be no terror because nobody
knew that does and you know the capacity
if we want to understand something about
democracy we should go to places like
Haiti and ask people there what
democracy is now the idea that we're
going to Haiti to teach them democracy
isn't even ludicrous I mean we should go
there to learn lessons and what
democracy is so that we would understand
the kinds of things that you're asking
about which people here have forgotten
you know they don't understand what they
know up in the what literate peasants
know up in the hills and hate and hate
so let's go there and ask them you know
actually we can figure it out without
asking them but those are the answers
and people do it under conditions in
comparably worse than any we can dream
of so we can certainly do it
balcony I'm sorry it's pretty hard for
me to see the balcony but if somebody
will make them so okay I see some hands
but what somebody yeah
mm-hmm well you certainly write about
spending the money and in fact there's
good data on this which just came out
for the from the won one of the Center
for Responsive Politics I think it's
cool just came out with a data analyst
study of the effect of camp the
correlation between campaign spending
and electoral victory in the 1994
elections they do this regularly and it
turns out that about 90% of the people
elected in 1994 were people who spent
much more than their opponent that's
higher than 1992 and this is a pattern
that goes way back in history which
translates into saying that those who
are capable of buying the election win
the election to an overwhelming degree
90% is not a small number of course they
are the transnational corporations and
the other business groups and those who
amass an enormous amounts of capital and
can only be combated in an electoral
arena by a very highly organized public
that's one of the reasons why business
and the government that they more or
less run are so intent on destroying
labor unions because they are the core
of the opposition to this the best major
way in which people have been able to
combat it so you're right about spending
money but it doesn't help if one of us
spends money you're not going to compete
with the private tyrannies who its
profits are going through the roof and
control know that fortune 500 for
example control about two-thirds of the
entire gross domestic product of the
United States right now
plus a big piece of the International
economy and those are private tyrannies
remember that those are totalitarian
institutions if any if anything deserves
the name then not public they're
completely hierarchic internally they do
what they want you know main controller
the more I'm in very limited controls
actually technically there is a control
they all have state charters and it
could be taken away
but until we remember what democracy is
that question won't arise
as it stands they have tyrannical
control and extraordinary power and if
and while you can try to compete with
them in the electoral arena and it's
worth doing if you remember that that
requires massive organization of say the
Haitian type on the transnational
corporations I think you're right and I
don't know exactly what your group is
doing but you got to think through what
this means I mean you know the problem
isn't a chip manufacturing plant that
may be good or bad you can worry about
it but the problem is who's making the
decision to put it there and who's gonna
run it and who's gonna decide what it
does and so on in a democratic system
people here and elsewhere would be
making those decisions in a system where
power is vested in private tyrannical
unaccountable systems it's done other
ways institutions it's done other ways
and those are the crucial issues I mean
we could very maybe own our opinions as
to whether it's a good or bad idea to
have a chip plan but I don't think at
least people who believe in democracy
oughta differ on the question of who
should make that decision somebody else
up there
yeah
yeah she pointed out that I had said
that what happened Haiti wouldn't happen
to us but garment workers were killed in
the United States and students were
killed did you mean Kent State yeah at
Kent State and in fact authorities can
do things to us - yeah things can happen
but have a look at the scale Kent State
four people were killed actually it's
kind of interesting that we only
remember Kent State like about a week or
so before that I think it was eight
students were killed at Jackson State
which is a black college but somehow
that's disappeared so okay I don't mean
to say that you forgot I mean we forget
but yes a few students were killed and
that's an atrocity but twelve you know
the garment workers yes they were killed
in fact throughout the early part of the
century the United States had an
unusually violent labor history in fact
it appalled most even the right wing in
Europe into the late 1930s workers were
getting killed I think if I recall about
700 through the early part of this
century from about 1900 up till the late
30s well you know 700 is an unpleasant
number but and full and 12 is an
unpleasant number but you know in Haiti
in two years little tiny country in two
years it was like 4,000 and in Central
America and in the 1980s it was maybe
200,000 and in you know in Indonesia in
1965 when it became our huge friend it
was maybe half a million or a million
something in that order
mostly landless peasants within four
months which led to total euphoria in
the United States I should say so you
know yeah you're right about the
violence but look at the ski
and the scale tells you something I mean
whatever kinds of repression people face
here is invisible by comparative
standards at least for those of us who
are relatively privileged and the right
color skin and that sort of thing
for people with a relative degree of
privilege and color or right color and
so on there's by comparative standards
you know the repression is extremely
limited it's true it's there but you
know very limited and the chances that
the terror of the say Haitian type could
be used against a popular movement in
the United States are pretty remote
there's certainly nothing in history to
suggest that it could happen but I think
you can understand the appeal it's easy
to understand the appeal the fact is
that to an astonishing extent the civil
society has dissolved in the United
States it's a pretty astonishing so for
for example over 80% of the population
the latest figures or 82 percent of
population don't think that there's a
democratic system at all and that is
they on the regular Gallup polls there's
a question who does the government work
for and their various choices and one of
them is the few and the special
interests not the people meaning it's
not a democratic system that's been
running about 50% for a while it just
shot up to over 80% on the economic
system over 80% think it's inherently
unfair in recent polls cynicism about
institutions is going through the roof
you know it's also accompanied by huge
confusion so for example a considerable
majority of the population thinks that
the government has a responsibility to
help poor people but a considerable
majority the population as opposed to
welfare that is the government helping
poor people well that's a success of the
doctrinal system
which has gotten into people's heads the
idea that welfare means giving money to
black women maybe black teenagers or
black women driving Cadillacs and you
know breeding like rabbits because we're
gonna pay for them okay if that's what
welfare is then no sane person wants to
pay their hard-earned money for that but
if money's going to go to poor people
which indeed welfare does then they're
perfectly happy to pay for that and
certainly people vastly overestimate the
part of the federal budget that goes the
welfare it's very slight it's always
been slight it's declined about almost
close to half since 1970 but so you get
plenty confusion like over 80% of the
population thinks that working people
don't have enough say in things but a
majority think that unions have too much
of a say in things that's the only way
in which things but unions have been
demonized okay so what you have is a
very cynical population very confused
scared frightened angry full of hate you
know easy to very dangerous situation
you know kind of situation which
demagogues can easily construct the
scapegoats that people want to kill you
know immigrants welfare mothers who
knows what and in that civil societies
collapsed in another respect there is
virtually there's very little in the way
of organization in the United States so
political parties don't exist both of
the parties should simply be disbanded
with anything they're not participant
parties anyway you can't get together
and decide on the party platform it's
handed down from above unions are which
were that traditionally in most
countries here to leading force for
social justice and democracy they have
declined they still exist but they
severely declined and the same is true
of other kinds of organizations people
literally don't even join bowling
leagues anymore on the
there's a very significant proliferation
of grassroots organizations on every
imaginable issue but very localized
often people don't know what's going on
in the other you know a couple blocks
away so there's plenty of people
involved I don't know how many but huge
numbers of people and are involved in
something or other but in a highly local
way think made usually very specific
issues very specific issue oriented and
unrelated to other things that ought to
be connected with them you know a little
bit somewhere else no in those
conditions very strange things can
happen one of the things that can happen
is the Ross Perot phenomena people just
looking for something anything maybe
that you know I mean if you know
somebody came and said I'm from Mars and
I'm gonna lead you under which
millenarian movements with messiahs have
in fact developed in many societies yeah
we don't look back very far to see
similar situations you know we're
different than other countries but there
are there are analogs if not parallels
so in a way I think it's analogous to
Iran around the late seventies when you
know there were big popular movements
developed to try to get rid of this
tyranny well they ended up you know
under control of extreme religious
fundamentalism actually something like
this happened in Germany in the late 30s
it's not people were frightened you know
society was dissolving everything was
going wrong they didn't know who to
blame and somebody come along came along
and said you know blame it on the Jews
okay blame it on the Jews it worked
well it'll work if we let it work
there's certainly a lot of people would
like it to work
what's all the hysteria about immigrants
about or about welfare mothers or you
know what's that for well you know
that's part of these efforts it's like
it's like it's blaming it on the Jews
you believe
well who have the people higher up
stopped from speaking you who have the
people from higher up stopped from
speaking well first of all we don't
other people from higher up did it but
let's say they did let's say they did
you know I mean there are plenty of
people who are speaking there plenty of
snake activists plenty of other civil
rights activists they keep speaking I
mean to the extent that there has there
has been repression here like black
panther leaders were killed and it's not
zero but the idea that we face the kind
of repression that keeps us from
speaking up I don't think is to be taken
seriously when you think about what is
faced by other people who do speak up
yes that's true
yeah yeah so your point is that there's
the government is trying to keep us
disempowered so that the game goes on
and to parties and it's not really
democratic I think there's something
right about what you're saying but if
you don't mind my saying so I think
you're being caught up in the propaganda
system it's not the government is doing
this the government is a reflection of
private power and part of the property
there's been a huge propaganda campaign
in the last 50 years on the part of a
very class conscious business community
who are kind enough to tell us what
they're doing namely fighting the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
and indoctrinating people with a
capitalist story and so on and so forth
that's what the huge public relations
industry is about and they are had very
definitely have the goals that you're
mentioning and indeed one of their goals
is to make you hate the government but
know there's plenty wrong with the
government and they'd love you to blame
everything on the government but the
reason that they want you to hate the
government the reason that they've been
building up this sense of anti politics
you know let's get rid of schools and
public assistance for health and
everything else is because they would
like you to blame it on the government
and not look and see where power is
namely in the fortune 500
the government government has a flaw
that General Electric doesn't have
government is potentially democratic
youth there's a way of inflating and
when you when you say the government is
doing this that and the other thing to
us well yeah I mean sure the government
is reflecting the interests of the
people in it but that's because but they
could be representing us there is no way
for private tyrannies to be representing
us so yes they would like you to hate
the government a lot wrong with the
government lot to be hated about it a
lot to be changed about it but the main
thing about is is you can participate in
it and there are ways of changing what
it does and therefore it's got for at
least people who believe in democracy
advantages that other systems of power
don't have it's potentially our system
of power and private corporations aren't
so yeah I think you go along with what
you're saying and if the system is not
them to the extent that the system is
not democratic you know it's not zero or
a hundred percent somewhere in there and
it changes to that extent it's because
we've succumbed to propaganda offensive
and institutional arrangements which
have
you know atoms of consumption and not
dealing with each other and hating each
other and so on
now that's within our control you know
especially for relatively wealthy and
privileged people it's very much within
your control and it's true that there's
some repressive apparatus down there but
you know when you look at what happens
around the world I mean for us to be
talking about repression is a joke I
mean if people if student groups in
Indonesia resolutions saying Indonesia
ought to get out of East Timor if
working people in Indonesia can stand up
and say we want to have unions if
writers in Indonesia can get up and say
we want a Free Press
under the conditions of Indonesia and
they do for us worried about repression
is not even a joke and you don't have to
go as far as Indonesia can go right
south of the border I mean just cross
the border into error that our
traditional domains and you will see
what it means for people to speak up if
Jesuits in Central America and I'll saw
the door speak up they get their brains
brains blown out by the US train
security forces that's not happening
does
Oh
so the question if I understood it
correctly is what happens to movements
that are so key to particularly ders
that if they are taking out the movement
does well you know that to the extent
that that exists we just don't
understand what democracy is I mean a
democratic system is one in which the
population is doing things now you know
if a group gets organized there's always
somebody to come around and say I'm
happy to be your leader follow my orders
and to the extent that you allow that to
happen well you've given up you know not
just because their orders will be for
them not for you which is usually the
case but that's the wrong structure so
it's perfectly true that if a popular
organization is so hierarchically
structured and hasn't controlled in such
an authoritarian fashion that taking out
a leader can kill it well there was
something wrong with that popular
organization from the very beginning and
that's you know that's that's Leninist
organization on the left and of course
it's tyrannical what else can you expect
it to be it'll lead to the Soviet Union
we in the day that Adam Smith was
talking about well it's not really the
individuals you know it is the
institutional structures that exist just
as in his day like when he said when he
was talking about the men and the
merchants and the manufacturers who have
taken state power to advance their
interests he wasn't necessarily talking
about this particular person over here
maybe that particular person over there
as a merchant that meets very benevolent
and wants to give away everything and so
on maybe but he was talking about a
structure of merchants and manufacturers
and we have a structure of institutions
too we we have our economic system our
social and economic system is based on
arrangements of private power they are
fairly recent dense corporations
basically they're pretty recently they
don't go back that far they got their
powers mostly in the early part of the
century you know it's not like ancient
history
they achieved through courts mainly not
through legislation the rights of
private persons in fact immortal persons
with all the rights of persons except
your immortal and your huge and even
things like freedom of speech don't make
any sense for an institution that's for
people and they have now grown and
expanded enormously to the extent that
the top 500 of them which have just
celebrated their fourth straight year of
double-digit profit growth now control
two-thirds of the domestic economy and
as I say a large part of the
International economy and they're pretty
much out of control unaccountable
there's there that that you don't know
what they're doing and they don't have
to ask you what they're doing you can
follow their orders if you want but
that's about it
those are hugely powerful institutions
basically totalitarian in character and
yes they have an
that's effect on what the government
does that's why 90% of those who spent
more than their opponent won the last
election the that's the main reason and
it's also why the policies of both
political parties are way to the right
of the attitudes of the general
population so the general population on
issue after issue is over here and both
political parties are over there and if
you look where they are it's where the
bosses are takes a balancing the budget
that's considered the major issue
we gotta balance the budget you know
business is totally in favor of it both
political parties are in favor of it
when Clinton gets up and makes a speech
you said of course of course we have to
balance the budget that's not in
question
well population thinks it's the most
important issue 5% that's the same
percent that thinks that homelessness is
the most important issue that's where
the public ranks when people are asked
should we even do it about a quarter say
yes when they're asked the sensible way
should we balance the budget if the cost
is education or health or environment
and so on in fact we truly balance the
budget under any realistic conditions
well it's pending on how the question is
asked it's usually about a quarter of
the population think so at all and 5%
think it's an important issue so but
nevertheless the party somewhere else
well there happen to be where the
business community is same on every
other thing depending on but some parts
of the budget cut namely primarily
about 61 by about 6 to 1 the population
is opposed to raising the Pentagon
budget that's the one part that's going
up okay and in fact it's dramatic no
it's rather dramatic to see how
overwhelmingly opposed the public is to
almost everything that's being rammed
through well okay that you know that
gives you the beginnings of an
indication of where of where the roots
of political power are if you look more
closely you'll find that this goes way
back in fact if you look very closely
you'll find that the country was founded
on that principle go back to the
Constitutional Convention and have a
look at what James Madison was
explaining to the to the convention
which in fact got implemented in the
Constitution his he insisted we made was
that democracy is very dangerous if they
had it in England you know their model
for a possible society at the time if
there was democracy in England people
would get together and vote and take
away the rights of landed proprietors
and there we can't permit that so we
better not have democracy and he said
the government has to be constituted so
that it fulfills the prime
responsibility of government which is in
his words to protect the minority of the
opulent against the majority has to be
set up that way and in fact it was set
up in that debate you know this goes on
right up to the present that's the core
of the Eisenhower Dulles Congress and
the discussions that I was referring to
and the whole democratic theory
so-called which is about this and so on
and so forth but that doesn't have to be
the case and in fact you know over time
there been many struggles many victories
for democracy and freedom and rights in
this country I mean in the 1920s it
looked very similar to now total
business dominance you know no workers
rights the Red Scare or the Wilson
administration had
virtually destroyed the unions that
eliminated independent thought it was
considered the end of history
in fact great joy about the end of
history you know tyranny of the Masters
and so on okay a couple years later it
all fell apart and you know there was a
popular reaction which led to
substantial range of rights for working
people and poor people an organization
and so on and yet it succeeded to devote
some of its resources not a trivial part
in fact to the wealth to the needs of
the general population instead of the
minority of the upland and it just goes
on and on like that you know there's a
constant struggle sometimes you win
sometimes you lose there will continue
to be an unequal struggle as long as
there is concentration as long as there
are tyrannical systems that control
internal to them the mass
decision-making over how the country
works in other words as long as there's
a private corporate system of
manufacturing and financial and service
and other industries but those are
illegitimate structures there's no
reason why they should exist and I
credit society I don't think they'd
exist
he pointed out tell me if I get it
straight that a lot of people think the
war on drugs is the disaster and social
disaster and all sorts of problems but
the common wisdom is that for a
politician to get up and say we ought to
do something sensible about this is
suicidal and the president in his speech
at the UN the other day made this the
centerpiece in the war on drugs that's
quite correct but the reason why it's I
mean there isn't it's very it's had very
clear effects on the non society it has
had no effect on the use of drugs but at
plenty of social things
you know the prison rate in the United
States has zoomed since 1980 we were at
the level of the worst countries in the
industrial world around 1980 we're now
way on the prison population has gone up
by three or four per capita since 1980
without any change in the crime rate and
it's going up even further
and it's mostly possession of drugs and
highly targeted possession of drugs and
laws are crafted so that the urban
ghettos get way more penalties than say
the white suburbs but yes it's had those
effects it has had almost no effect on
the use of drugs and I don't think it
was intended to the same is true in the
third world it's been a big intensifying
counter insurgency operations against
peasants and you know massacres by
paramilitary forces run by landowners
and the military hasn't changed drug
production so whatever it is it's not
having an effect on drugs and I think
it's intended to in fact if you look at
the president's message the other day
here's what a Free Press ought to say
about it in my opinion be you in on
Sunday President Clinton announced that
we were now in a national emergency and
unusual threat for the national security
and all that kind of stuff and he called
he said you know the US government - and
he now called upon others to join us
with this people and other countries to
identify nation's persons and companies
businesses that were involved in money
laundering or that were significantly
involved in the drug traffic in Colombia
the wording was approximately like that
well if we all want to do our patriotic
duty we can easily help him out on that
easily
in fact just using straight just playing
government sources so for example who's
involved in money laundering well there
was a year ago studied by the OECD you
know the organization of the rich
countries did a analysis of the flow of
money from narco trafficking it's
illegal so you can't be certain of the
numbers but their estimates are that
more than half of it goes through US
banks okay so we know institutions to go
after if we're interested in money goes
to Colombia according to them well that
was a secret it was reported in the
country's leading newspaper but
unfortunately not this country's leading
newspaper is reported in Mexico's
leading this paper excelsior I don't
think was ever recorded you although
it's a oacd study so if we want to go
after institutions involved in money
laundering we know just where to start
and put them out of business because
that's what the president said we have
to do in Colombia well there's some
evidence about that too during the
Reagan years the CIA and I think the
Congressional Research Service one of
the main research services government
research services did some studies of
flow of chemicals from the United States
descent Latin America from big American
corporations to Latin America well it
turned out they discovered that there's
a the capital exports to Latin America
are way in excess of industrial needs
and if you look at the chemicals that
are being sent it's the ones that are
being used to make cocaine so we know
just which companies to go at if we're
interested in the significant
involvement in the drug flow in Colombia
well what about nations that was the
other what nations are involved in the
drug racket in Colombia what was one
obvious one
giving half of its military aid for
Latin America to Colombian to the
military which is all in bed with a
narco traffickers I mean you know if you
want to it's not a big secret either you
read in every Amnesty International
report and Human Rights Watch report and
church group study and every
international monitor in the European
Parliament everyone else what is obvious
to anyone that the there's a linkage
close linkage between the military the
narco traffickers the landowners the
paramilitary forces and funding isn't
even officially involved in drugs that's
the police we're not you know we're
funding them to some extent but it's
almost sort of an obvious start on
nations that are involved in you know
production in Colombia and we can go on
like this again if there was a fruit
press that's what it would be saying and
if it doesn't say it you ought to be
saying it or at least look into it and
find out about it and then there's an
answer to those questions and also an
answer to your question if this is
correct and I think it is it means that
there's that this has nothing to do with
the war on drugs and in fact why is
there a name you can ask the question
well why is there a war on drugs
altogether I mean you know drugs aren't
good for you but in terms of the actual
harm that they carry out most of the
harm that they carry out is due to the
fact that they're illegal the actual if
you look at say deaths from drugs and
comparing with say deaths from tobacco
it's like I wanna although it's surely
not good for you I don't think there is
a single recorded overdose you but
doesn't harm other people the use of
tobacco farms other people and it's
vastly greater in scale well I don't
Philip Morris is the biggest corporate
to advertiser for the Gingrich Congress
and the deregulation is just freeing
them up from in the tort reform from any
protection by victims okay and if you
look at what they're doing in the third
world the u.s. is using muscle real
muscle to force open foreign markets to
advertising aimed at women and children
in Thailand and you know China and so on
and if countries won't agreed to let us
advertise our lethal narcotics there
we're gonna impose trade sanctions on
them which is serious in the case of a
big country like the United States
that's how it directly involved in
serious narco trafficking not at a small
scale in China there was one recent
study by an Oxford University
epidemiologist who estimated that about
50 million people will die from the use
of tobacco in China who are I think he
said now the one now under 20 or
something like that big numbers
okay so trafficking and illegal
narcotics in not illegal unfortunately
but in maybe they shouldn't even be
illegal but not suggesting that they
should but trafficking and lethal
narcotics yes but getting back your
point about why is it suicidal for any
politician to say any of these things
the reason is we've let the propaganda
win so yes it's it possible for people
to say obvious things
yeah all years is that so you're sure
they believe it I mean if the only thing
here is one thing well you know why
shouldn't you believe it nobody's saying
anything else but we have plenty of
opportunities to get a different message
out again there's a lot of opportunities
for people like us in a society like
this and you don't make use of them then
yes it will be still be impossible for
people to think rationally about the
topic drugs is something comparable to
social cleansing in Colombia in Colombia
the paramilitary forces go out and get
rid of people that they don't like you
know peasants union leaders Street kids
whoever they don't like you get rid of
them you can slaughter them that's
called social cleansing well here we're
more civilized society we put them in
jail okay instead of social cleansing
and the technique for putting them in
jail to an overwhelming extent is
actions which are called crimes like
having a joint in your pocket so there's
a reason for it
and there's an effective and people
should be able to understand that but
not if they don't hear it
so how do you change universities so
they're more open to critical thought
and independent ideas and so on and so
forth it's about the easiest I mean
there are a lot of hard tasks in the
world but this is about the easiest one
there is I mean they're very few you
know universities are not utopia you
know but of all the institutions you can
think of it's hard to imagine one that's
as free you know at least an enormous
range of things that people can do
inside a university to change just
changed radically in the late 60s
through the action of a relatively small
number of students who managed to
organize most of the student body to
free to place up and make them think
about all kind of things they never
talked about like the dependence of the
university on military spending and you
know the social effect of Technology and
all sorts of questions that nobody ever
thought about this is the main it was
the main university in the world in the
country meaning in the world small
number of students before I came here
you know teachers at Evergreen State
University was undergraduate then good
things like South End press grew out of
it the magazine grew out of it a lot of
the local organizing around grows out of
it and so on well it's a couple of kids
from MIT who actually the majority of
the student body directly involved in
these things okay you know what I
wouldn't say it's not a revolution but
it's a big change now there can be more
changes like that and there if you can
you know there
is no place easier to carry changes like
that out than inside a college and
university they're gonna be universities
got to free and independent you would
run into problems not so much inside the
university as in the relation between
the university and the outside society
so universities are parasitic they
depend on outside systems like state
legislatures and private corporations
and so on and in fact in the late
sixties when universities like MIT we're
starting to get to free and independent
places like IBM we're starting to set up
their own counterpart colleges saying
okay you don't teach obedience the way
we want we'll do it ourselves you know
and the state legislature isn't even
more of this you know force in a state
university but that's the point at which
train free up the universities becomes
engaged with the problem of
democratizing the whole society and
