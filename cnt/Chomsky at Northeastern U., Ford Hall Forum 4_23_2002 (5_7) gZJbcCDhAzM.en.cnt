so let's take October 89 right before
the fall of the wall a national security
directive on the Middle East recommended
continued support for our friend Saddam
Hussein called for the use of military
force where necessary and appropriate to
defend their vital interests against the
Soviet Union or any other regional power
not ever act notice a couple of weeks
later the Berlin Wall fell a few months
later in March 1990 George Bush number
one sent the annual message to Congress
on the Pentagon budget same as previous
years we need a huge Pentagon budget but
now the pretext were changed so we still
needed a huge intervention force
directed at the Middle East where I'm
quoting the threats to our interests
could not be laid at the Kremlin's door
that's contrary to the preceding October
and all the years before in fact the
threats were exactly the same as they
had always been namely indigenous
nationalism just as in 1958 when I was
internally conceded there were no
Russians or in Latin America or South
East Asia or Africa in fact if you look
closely consistently so the policies
therefore continue but now it's not in
defense against the Russians because
they're not there anymore other policies
remain intact as well in March 1990 we
still needed the enormous military
system not to deter the Russians but in
defense against the technological
sophistication of third world powers and
it's necessary to maintain what they
call the defense industrial base it's a
euphemism for high-tech industry as
before the Pentagon system has to remain
in order to provide a cover for the
dynamic state sector of the economy that
serves to socialize risk and cost while
privatizing profit and it's yields
concentrated private power from market
discipline it's a leading factor in
economic development and
the creation of the so-called new
economy and it also has to be extended
without substantial change same after
September 11th but just intensified well
back to nineteen ninety military tactics
did change the Pentagon explained at the
time that the in that the international
environment has changed from being
weapon from the targets being weapon
rich that's a name reference to the
Soviet Union to being target rich that's
a reference to the south former colonial
world where there are increasingly
capable third world threats it's the
joint chief of staff at March 1990 quite
in conformity with the public message to
Congress targets are now going to
include nations capable of developing
weapons of mass destruction well who are
they any nation is capable of developing
weapons of mass destruction if it has
some laboratories a little bit industry
some infrastructure so that's just about
everyone the south is to be specifically
targeted as indeed was true had been
true throughout the whole Cold War
period but now new options are available
because the deterrent is gone so we can
do it more openly and with less fewer
devious means nuclear weapons remain the
centerpiece of us strategy but now
enhanced to include the were called mini
nukes which are tailored for use against
rogue elements and and these change now
and then so in 1988 shortly before
Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress was designated officially as
one of the most more notorious terrorist
organizations in the world while South
Africa was a valued Ally having killed
only a million and a half people in the
surrounding areas forget South Africa
itself just in the Reagan years at that
was part of the war on against
international terrorism which is now
rida cleared by the same people a few
years later that calculation changed
and the recent past goes right down the
memory hole teaching us absolutely
nothing returning to post Cold War
planning Clinton's Strategic Command
recommended that nuclear weapons should
be used when needed in what they called
pre-emptive reaction leave it to you to
figure that one out but even if they're
not used they cast a shadow over any
crisis or conflict so they must be
available and visible to adversaries the
US must also move on to placing
offensive weapons in space it's in
violation of the Outer Space Treaty of
1967 which has so far been observed and
at the UN it's been reaffirmed in the
last few years the US and Israel
abstaining it's being renovated and for
good reasons which are clearly explained
in clinton-era documents of the Space
Command they point out that in the past
navies were created in order to protect
commercial interests and investments and
space is the next frontier and we are
powerful enough to monopolize it war
planners furthermore accept the same
projections as the intelligence
community they also anticipate a growing
gap between what they call the haves and
the have-nots as the preferred style of
globalization proceeds therefore follows
that we need enormous destructive power
and space on here trigger alert in order
to control the unruly and have-nots who
are going to be extending with
globalization well these clinton-era
documents go on to give a quite a
chilling analysis of the intended future
they're actually not very different from
the recently leaked Nuclear Posture
review of the Bush administration which
created a considerable stir when it was
leaked to military analyst William Arkin
a couple of weeks ago and published the
difference and reaction raises a number
of questions but
put that aside and keep to the main
point which is that the basic policies
remain stable through to recent critical
moments the collapse of the Soviet Union
and September 11th the primary effect of
the rida clared war on terror has been
to provide the United States with a
major military base in central asia for
the first time that puts the u.s. in a
strong position to dominate the energy
resources of Central Asia but also and I
think more important it complements the
intervention system that's aimed that
the far richer Gulf oil reserves that
goes from Guam to the Azores but the
closest nearby base up until now was the
island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean from which the population was
expelled the British courts have since
accepted their pleas British island
their plea that they have a right to
return but there's a higher authority
which overturns that decision the next
target in the war on terror is supposed
to be Iraq according to bush and Blair
and Clinton administration officials and
others we cannot tolerate Saddam Hussein
because he is so evil that he committed
the ultimate crime he even used chemical
weapons against his own people those
charges are completely accurate they're
missing only three little words namely
with our support which continued without
any change for years after the ultimate
atrocity he's also charged with seeking
to develop weapons of mass destruction
which I presume is probably true but
that charge also emits a slight fact
namely that the US and Britain continued
to provide him with the means to develop
weapons of mass destruction well after
his worst crimes when he was a far
greater danger than he is now oh that
means straight out that we can't
possibly take these official pretext
seriously and anyone who even repeats
them is just saying
servant of power and a total hypocrite
but there are more obvious reasons there
are reasons I mean there are reasons and
obvious reasons to overthrow the old
friend and trading partner of George
Bush the first namely he's sitting on
the largest oil reserves in the Middle
East after Saudi Arabia and one way or
another the United States is likely to
try to regain control over them and the
post-september 11 circumstances may
provide a do provide a window of
opportunity however the project faces
several problems the most fundamental
one I think is trying to find an
acceptable successor regime that's not
simple the successor regime has to meet
some conditions it cannot allow any
Democratic tendencies because if it does
the Shiite majority might influence
policy towards accommodation with Iran
and the u.s. don't want that and
furthermore the Kurdish minority might
gain rights that would threaten us back
to repression of turkeys Kurdish
population which remains very severe
