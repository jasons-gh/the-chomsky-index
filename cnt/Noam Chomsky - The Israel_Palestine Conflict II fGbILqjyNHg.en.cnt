there are a lot of problems in the world
for which it's pretty hard to figure out
a solution though this one happens to be
particularly uniquely easy to figure out
the solution there is one it's been on
the table for 35 years virtually the
entire world supports it
the only holdouts are the United States
and Israel these in theory and words in
Europe non-aligned countries the Arab
states the Organization of Islamic
states which includes Iran they
basically all agree on a political
settlement on the internationally
recognized border so-called Green Line
six three sixty seven borders with two
states Israel and a Palestinian state
and the occupied territories and
possibly some adjustment of the border
it was a ceasefire line so when the US
was still part of this consensus it
called for mutual of moderate and mutual
border adjustments that was actually
brought to the Security Council in
January 1976 the u.s. we did it again in
nineteen eighties won't run through the
whole record but basically a record of
US refusal to accept it of course is
refuses they want to take over as much
as is valuable to them of the occupied
territories now since that there
actually is one occasion when the u.s.
came close to accepting it that was in
January 2001 Clinton's
last month in office he did provided
recalled parameters for settlement both
sides accepted them as he pointed out
they met for a week and Papa Egypt
tried to work out the details and they
apparently came pretty close to a
settlement well I was in the Middle East
recently as well and one of the things I
heard we were in Ramallah we were talked
to a lot of Palestinians on both sides
of the border that the split between
Hamas and Fatah is number one weakening
any real form of resistance and number
two that any state that might emerge out
of this two state if in fact
anything does and there's generally a
feeling that Israel the current
leadership of Israel and most of the
Israeli elite has no interest in it but
that this this split between Hamas and
Fatah is really undermining any real
Palestinian resistance what do you what
do you make it's real and it's there's a
background that since the early 90s
the United States and Israel have been
working to try to separate the Gaza
Strip from the West Bank by now they're
almost totally separated a student in
Gaza who wants to go to the University
in the West Bank almost impossible
somebody wants to go for medical
treatment in a Palestinian Hospital in
East Jerusalem which isn't available on
the Gaza Strip but it's essentially
blocked not partly by Palestinian
Authority and Hamas but primarily by
Israel so that that's gone very far even
by the 80s the Israel had recognized it
just wants to get rid of the Gaza Strip
it's so devastated no use handed over to
Egypt that increased in January 2006
there was a free election in Palestine
first one in the Arab world carefully
monitored and so on it came out the
wrong way Hamas won the election okay
that's not what the u.s. wanted and in
the typical disdain for free elections
if they don't come out the right way of
the United States and of course Israel
instantly turned to harsh punishment of
the population for the crime of voting
the wrong way that Europe Trail belong
timidly as it usually does in a June
2007 the US and Israel tried to carry
out a military coup to overthrow the
results of the election in in Gaza that
didn't work it was beaten back and Hamas
took over and at that point sanctions
became much harsher and what you now
read is you know Hamas Blackhorse took
over the Gaza Strip well sort of half
true but it was in beating back a u.s.
Israeli planned a military coup
initiative by now Hamas kind of
runs the Gaza Strip with a pretty horse
and the Palestinian Authority runs the
as much of the West Bank as they control
which is very little of it pretty
harshly and with international support
and yes that split is there and both
sides by now have a stake in it Hamas to
run the Gaza Strip the photographer's
know I was in authority to run the West
Bank and it's a barrier to joint
resistance of course the US and Israel
very happy because they want to
undermine the possibility of a
settlement now the settlement possible
option is still there January 2001 is
not that far back things have changed
but not so much and it's feasible if the
United States shifted its policy right
now the United States is basically
blocking it talking it not in words they
say yes we want it but they're blocking
it by providing decisive and military
economic diplomatic and ideological
support for the Israeli takeover
ideological means as well that's the way
it's presented and discussed and so on
our most cherished ally yeah but it's
significant I mean by now Israel the
settlements occupied over 40 percent of
the territory about 60 percent of the
territory is under called area cities
under the control of the Israeli army
it's not necessary when I was in the
West Bank and in some of the refugee
camps in Beirut and other in Lebanon a
lot of Palestinians were saying they
thought that the two-state solution did
is dead and that there's really is one
state and then they're all living under
the same one state it's just that some
people get to vote and others don't and
that the issue now is that there should
be a movement one person one vote and
that people the Palestinians and Jews
that want a democratic state should
simply take over that the one state
that's there personally I've been in
favor of that since the nineteen forties
but it's pie-in-the-sky and they're
omitting the fact this is a common
discussion on both sides and in the
and it's just omitting an elementary
fact there aren't two alternatives there
are three alternatives they're only
talking about two one alternative is the
international consensus on through
states second alternative let's all be
live together in one state the third
alternative which is the one that's
being implemented is that the US and
Israel take what they want and continue
to take what they want and those who are
talking about let's have one state are
actually assisting in that because you
know the United States is perfectly
happy to have articles and newspaper
saying violence everybody live together
meanwhile they are participating with
Israel in separating Gaza from the West
Bank crucial fact and providing the
decisive support for the implementation
of the programs which are sometimes
called ashore on the plan take over
whatever you want in the West Bank
behind the everything behind the
annexation wall called separation walls
basically annexation that means the
arable land the water resources the
pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv support the completely illegal
expansion of Jerusalem that's not only
in violation of international law but
even of direct explicit Security Council
resolutions which the US and he voted
for the whole occupation is a settlement
program is illegal and it's been known
Israel even accepted it at 67 so we're
going to do it anyway it's not worth
discussing this universal agreement on
this but the u.s. is blocking and that
permits the these programs of taking
over what's valuable everything hugely
expanded Jerusalem everything behind the
separation wall the annexation wall the
Jordan Valley which imprisons everything
else a couple of cents cutting through
it which essentially canonized
the rest by now Israel's constructed a
huge infrastructure project huge
highways and so on you can
now you can drive from Tel Aviv to the
most easternmost towns like melamine or
REO without ever seeing a Palestinian
the Palestinians are sort of off there
and the hill somewhere so that's the
real alternative
if there isn't a two-state settlement
this is what there's going to be you can
talk about one state and you know it
would be nice to be democratic and so on
but nothing is supporting it there is
enough support in the world there's no
steps towards it it's sometimes it's
compared to South Africa but what people
are forgetting is there was decades a
struggle to get the world to oppose
apartheid and in fact until the United
States changed position in the late
1980s didn't really matter what the
world thought the US was still
supporting that Reagan was violating the
congressional sanctions at that point
but until the u.s. shifted its position
it was there as late as 1988 the Riggin
administration condemned the African
National Congress
Mandela's National Congress is the most
one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world you see any
potential for a change in u.s. position
to some extent a change in US public
opinion there's a substantial change in
US public opinion I mean a lot of issues
there was a time not long ago and I
talked about these issues and a police
protection
but now there's huge audiences they're
engaged there's a PDS and sanctions
divestment program which is substantial
a large part of the American public if
they knew about it would be opposed in
fact outraged by the idea that Obama
made a commitment to Israel to provide
them with 30 billion dollars of military
aid over the next decade later even
talking about the US military budget
most people don't want it handed over
Israel so sure it would be and in fact
if Obama or anybody in the
administration I was willing to take a
stand on this they could mobilize public
opinion that's what's happening is
pretty striking the strongest support in
the media the most extreme support for
Israeli expansion and aggression is the
far-right it's the wall street journal'
much more than say the New York Times in
the political system it's the
Republicans the party of big business
even more so than Democrats - but
they're more so and in fact the military
industry high-tech industry and so on
they think this is fine you know they're
investing their Lockheed Martin is
delighted when we get that give Israel
funds to buy advanced aircraft and so on
there is a base of support for these
policies right at the core of the of the
system there's also a substantial Lobby
which is influential well I think that's
minor as compared with these more
fundamental sources of supporting but
those are not kind of like what we
talked about on another occasion it's
not what the public wants and that can
be changed
