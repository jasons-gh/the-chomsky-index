well I'll make an effort to live up to
the reputation of being disreputable I
was asked to talk about an important
topic dilemmas in a humanitarian
intervention and there are a number of
very striking dilemmas one question that
arises about humanitarian intervention
is whether the category even exists are
there examples of it and that that's a
serious question I'll talk about it the
it's kind of surprising in many ways
that you should even ask the question
because there are so many perfectly
straightforward and simple forms of
humanitarian intervention which could
have a massive effect and cost virtually
nothing and so for example according to
the The Lancet the leading world medical
journal in England six million infants
die every year just from lack of from
the failure to apply very simple
procedures which would cost almost
nothing the there are cement I just
happened to have come from a conference
in Norway of a group called academic
stand against poverty
we're Norwegian jock doctors talk about
this and their political scientists
pointed out that they've done studies
and it shows that a tiny percentage of
the GDP of the rich countries would
suffice to save six million infants
every year that's not a small number and
there are many other similar things
that's elementary forms of humanitarian
intervention no controversies about
doing it no votes at the United Nations
just a willingness to spend what amounts
to pennies on the part of the rich
countries nevertheless it is
a question whether the catechist doesn't
exist and we can ask whether the general
category exists actually that question
arises right away in the first serious
essay about the topic of humanitarian
intervention term 1859 the term doesn't
use it wasn't used but that's what it's
about this is an essay by John Stuart
Mill and it's of particular significance
not only because of its content it is
kind of the classical essay on the topic
but because of who he was he was a man
of unusual moral integrity intelligence
pretty hard to match him it turns out
that with a few changes of names the
content of his essay could appear today
I think don't want a quote sure some of
the central parts I don't want a
paraphrase milk there was a view in
England at the times the late 1850s that
England which was of course the world's
hegemonic power of the day that England
should keep away from intervention
unless some quoting him unless its
safety is threatened or any of its
interests hostile and unfairly or
endangered but Mill objected to that
standard view he thought that was a
mistake and the reason was he said that
England is a novelty in the world
it's a remarkable nation that acts only
in the service of others it's dedicated
to peace but if the aggressions of
barbarians force it through a successful
war itself lessly bears the cost while
the fruits it shares in fraternal
equality with the whole human race that
even includes the barbarians that had
conquered for their own benefit he does
say that England has a fault misplaced
modesty that leads Englishmen to
AB negate the character which we might
with truth lay claim to of being
incomparably the most conscientious of
All Nations in our national acts England
is not only peerless but near-perfect it
has no aggressive designs it desires no
benefit to itself at the expense of
others its policies are blameless and
laudable and he went on to say that
England should not be deterred by the
fact that it is held up to habla qui on
the continent incidentally the thoughts
of others outside the continent don't
enter into this question including those
who Adam Smith referred to long before
and when he condemned the what he called
the savage injustice of the Europeans
particularly the vile acts of the
British in India but not by 1859 it's
only that we in England who receives
publicly on the continent held up toggle
flee on the continent but he
nevertheless said despite this England
should be ready to intervene in the
service of others of course however its
motives may be misrepresented by those
who cannot believe the magnificence that
is before their eyes and atribute
cynical motives to the British it's a
great philosopher he went in to study
the criteria for intervention and he
said it's permissible when dealing with
barbarians those with a low degree of
civilization whose minds are not capable
of comprehending rules let alone
observing them these barbarians which is
essentially everyone outside of Europe
even outside of England they need the
protection of a civilised power of
Christian Europe particularly of course
the noblest among them well mill was
interesting to look at the timing of
when mill was writing it was 1859 that
was right after the public exposure very
public exposure of Britons and vicious
atrocities in India and suppressing what
in British history is called the Indian
Mutiny
a rebellion in India now this was my
tell you how Johar Lal Nehru described
it in his history of India written from
his prison cell he was imprisoned by the
British he described it as a ghastly and
horrible picture showing man at his
worst sighting contemporary records both
British and Indian which are quite
accurate this incidentally was not long
after the Irish Famine horrible Irish
Famine in which the England's role was
not obscure it was it was also in the
midst of the Second Opium War that was
1856 to 1860 this is right in the middle
of it when bill was writing and that had
its own horrors bombardment and
deliberate burning down of thousands of
houses and densely settled the Canton
for example with many killed that had
caused such an uproar in England that
Parliament was dissolved and a new
election was called all of this shortly
before Mill Road and of course he knew
all about it he was an educated literate
person he was also an official of the
East India Company which was right at
the center of the atrocities and Indian
well that's the context in short we can
say that England was the
nineteenth-century
counterpart of today's and now quoting
today's idealistic new world bent on
ending inhumanity in a noble phase of
its foreign policy pursuing policies
with a saintly glow quoting The New York
Times leading commentators
in the 1990s at the end of the 90s the
nation reached the height of its glory
acting from altruism and moral fervor
alone it's a historian David from cand
dedicating itself for the first time in
history to principles and values instead
of self-interest sweat Slav Havel and
thus opening a new era of enlightenment
very much like England the England that
Mill was describing well that raises
some questions plainly if that's the
peak of nobility of humanitarian
intervention exactly what is
humanitarian intervention I should say
that there was very little writing about
humanitarian intervention after mill and
up till the 1990s that's when the flurry
of writing and discussion and the
concept really reached you know public
attention became a major topic of
international efforts and discussion and
debate and discussion and intellectual
circles we might ask why the 1990s well
a cynic might have an answer than being
disreputable I tend to think that the
cynical answer is correct now there were
plenty of interventions before 1990 but
they always had a pretext reflexive
pretext whatever the circumstances they
were defense against the hideous enemy
the monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
aiming to take over the world john f
kennedy's description and of course to
defend ourselves against that and defend
the civilization against that it was
necessary to carry out interventions
which killed millions of people
destroyed countries overthrew democratic
governments and so on i won't run
through it but by 1990 that pretext was
gone
the ruthless conspiracy had disappeared
so some the cynic would say some new
pretext is needed for intervention and
in fact policies didn't change after
1990 and quite interesting ways if you
want to if anyone wants to understand
the Cold War the obvious place to look
is what happened right after the fall of
the Berlin Wall when all of the pretext
for us actions in the so-called third
world which is where the Cold War was
fought all of them disappeared so what
happened after 1989 after the fall of
wool well one obvious question is what
happened to NATO NATO was established
with the fourth official reason was to
defend Western Europe from the Russian
hordes 1989 no more a Russian hordes so
what happens to NATO
anyone who believed any of the
propaganda of the preceding 50 years who
would have expected NATO to be dissolved
no more hordes coming what happened is
the opposite it expanded in violation of
prompt promises to Gorbachev the korba
Jeff had agreed to the unification of
Germany an incorporation and a Western
military alliance which is quite a
concession if you look at history
Germany alone had virtually destroyed
Russia several times in the century but
he was agreeing to letting it join 1/2
of Western military alliance on a
condition the condition was that NATO
would not expand one inch to the east
that was the phrase used by President
Bush and Secretary of State Baker well
that man wouldn't extend to eastern
Germany NATO immediately expanded the
eastern Germany then farther east by now
it's a Gorbachev and certainly
furious but when he brought this up the
James Baker and Bush pointed out to him
that these were only gentlemen's
agreements they had been very careful
never to put it on paper and if he was
stupid enough to believe a promise by
Western diplomats that's his problem
anyway
they'd have expanded to the east then it
expanded further it's by now a global us
run intervention force it's official
tasks official is to guard the global
energy system pipelines naval mail lanes
sea lanes and so on and in general to
act as a global US intervention force
well that's NATO what about US policy
itself well the first there was an
intervention right after the fall of the
Berlin Wall the u.s. invaded Panama they
killed probably a couple thousand people
instituted a puppet government the goal
was to kidnap a minor thug who had
stopped following orders he had been a
loyal killer and murderer but he was out
getting out of line so the u.s. invaded
kind of a footnote to history it's so
common it was a little different because
it had a new pretext the pretext wasn't
the Russians are coming but there's a
Hispanic narco-traffickers are trying to
destroy the United States and we have to
go after them about as plausible as the
Russians are coming
there was also an interesting comment on
the invasion by Elliott Abrams who had
been under secretary of state than the
Reagan administration until he was
removed for lying to Congress and
felonies and so on then reinstated he
pointed out accurately that this was the
first time that the US could intervene
anywhere without concern that there
might be a Russian reaction somewhere
they wouldn't try to block
intervention that crazy but they might
do something somewhere else however not
this time so it was safe intervention
there were also foreign policy decisions
made right away
and again anyone who wants to understand
the Cold War would would look exactly at
these the Bush administration is as Bush
one immediately instituted a new
national security strategy and passed a
defense budget which were quite
interesting should read them reviewed
them if you like basically what they
said is everything that's going to
remain exactly as before but with no
pretext so we still need a huge military
system it's roughly comparable to the
rest of the world combined it's not to
defend ourselves from the Russians it's
because of literally the technological
sophistication of third world powers
you're not supposed to laugh if you're a
well-educated intellectual and academic
and nobody left so that's why we need
this huge military system we still need
huge intervention forces aimed at the
Middle East and then comes an
interesting phrase aimed at the Middle
East worthy serious problems that we
faced could not have been laid at the
Kremlin's door
in other words sorry folks we've been
lying to you for 50 years it's really
independent nationalism now we can't lie
anymore so wasn't the Kremlin that was
responsible we still need them we still
need to maintain what's called the
defense industrial base it's a kind of a
euphemism for high-tech industry largely
financed supported in fact initiated in
many respects by the state under the
pretext of defense but now we've got to
maintain it but for other reasons well
those are the major changes non changes
after the fall of the wall the
disappearance of the Soviet Union but
there was an ideological change too
large a sudden interest in the concept
of humanitarian intervention a lot by
since then huge literature and so on so
going back to the cynical interpretation
and one might suggest a new pretext was
needed for intervention well you can
decide that this went on through the 90s
finally in 1999 came the jewel in the
crown the bombing of Serbia the Kosovo
bombing and that's what elicited a lot
of this elevated the rhetoric that I
mentioned about principles and values
for the first time pure altruism and so
on the bombing of in Kosovo is one of
the best documented events in maybe in
history certainly in modern history now
we have two massive State Department
compilations of events that took place
prior to the bombing we have NATO
records we have UN records we have the
British parliamentary inquiry into it
there were monitors on the ground OSCE
monitors reporting regularly all that's
available this documentation is not only
massive but uniformed it concludes that
was a pretty ugly place with you know
that some level of atrocities going on
divided between the Serbs and the KLA
the guerrilla force that was mostly
attacking from Albania and it was pretty
well divided I mean the British the most
hawkish element of the coalition they
actually thought that the KLA was
responsible for most of the atrocities
well that was what was going on up until
March 1999 at that point a decision was
made to bomb and the question was well
what's going to happen the general in
charge General Clark
spoke to the link the Clinton White
House secretary State Albright
the National Security Advisor burger we
have the records and he told that they
asked him what's going to happen if he
bomb he said well if we bomb the sort
Serbs at least it can't react to our
bombing but they'll react were they're
strong they'll react on the ground so
they'll carry out atrocities on the
ground that'll be the effect of the
bombing then it was asked well what do
you do then they said we bought more
when the bombing started at the end of
March he informed the press that it is
predictable his words that there will be
atrocities yes for the reason that he
mentioned and indeed there were the
bombing started about a week after the
UN registered its first refugees then
there were a lot of people that was
ethnic cleansing people driven out
plenty of atrocities Milosh of it sir
prime minister was brought to the
International Criminal Court he was
indicted right in the middle of the war
if you look at the indictment every
charge but one has to do with post
bombing atrocities well that's not a
proper story so it's been inverted if
you look at the literature on the
subject you know academic journalism it
turns out that the u.s. the NATO bombed
in order to prevent these just put an
end to the ethnic cleansing that was
going on so it was a wonderful
humanitarian intervention pure altruism
and so on and so forth well I believe
that as it stands it was not accepted
that way in the third world in fact it
was bitterly condemned in most of the
world outside of Europe the governments
of the south as it's called there was
bitterly condemned and jointly there's
what they called the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention which they
described as just a new version of
imperialism that's most of the world and
that continued right through the
following years same attitude at that
point a new concept was developed
apparently humanitarian intervention
wasn't going to work
we needed a new concept that's what's
called the responsibility to protect r2p
it's called big thing in international
affairs literature now r2p is quite
interesting there's two versions of it
one version was accepted by the United
Nations General Assembly in 2005 it
passed a responsibility to protect
resolution and virtually every country
signed it the same countries that
condemn the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention the reason is
pretty straightforward if you read it
it's almost entirely innocuous it just
repeats positions already taken with
slightly more emphasis on the need for
the responsibility of countries to
protect their own populations but
essentially nothing new that's one
version that's the version that's
referred to when you read that the whole
world accepts the responsibility to
protect there's another version a
Western version it was it's discussed
and it's developed in a commission study
run by Gareth Evans former Australian
Prime Minister's the Evans Commission
they came out with a long report which
discussed the responsibility to protect
and that's that's the one that's
actually applied it's very much like the
world resolution with one crucial
distinction it provides for NATO and
NATO alone to intervene freely anywhere
without authorization from the Security
Council now it doesn't put it in those
words what it says is if the Security
Council cannot agree on to authorize
intervention then regional groupings can
act on their own within the region of
their authority subject to later
approval or not approval by the Security
Council well there's only one regional
grouping that can do that
you know not you know not the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations
the one regional grouping that can do it
is NATO and their regional the region of
their authority is whatever they say the
world for example so in effect that
means the responsibility to protect
comes down to granting NATO meaning the
US Britain maybe some followers of the
right to use military force it will of
course the world doesn't accept that but
in western doctrine that's the
responsibility to protect and it's
justified by the claim that the whole
world accepts it as you can see by
looking at the General Assembly
resolution which is the same except for
barring this provision well that's more
on humanitarian intervention as the
literature expanded in the 90s
scholarship expanded with it with
scholarly studies of humanitarian
intervention and they're interesting to
read one of the main ones is by Sean
Murphy major book scholarly study on
humanitarian intervention he works
pretty hard to try to find examples and
he doesn't find many in fact the ones he
finds are kind of interesting so between
the two world wars literally between the
kellogg-briand pact which outlawed war
and world war ii he finds three examples
of humanitarian intervention the one was
the Italian invasion of Ethiopia the
second was the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria North China and the third was
Hitler's takeover of parts of
Czechoslovakia and of course he doesn't
mean to say that these were in fact
humanitarian interventions what he means
to say is they had all the usual
properties of humanitarian intervention
they were kind of like move nil or what
I read from the 1990s they were the
people who carried the declarations were
just a few
with the most humanitarian noble
rhetoric so therefore they were
humanitarian interventions and Mussolini
was going to Christianize the pagans the
Japanese were going to bring an earthly
paradise to the people they were
slaughtering Hitler was going to end
ethnic conflicts bring the benefits of a
superior civilization to this troubled
region and furthermore it's and some of
these cases at least this pretty good
reason to believe that they meant it we
have our good records on especially on
Japanese conquests I actually wrote
about them 45 years ago the RAND
Corporation released a massive set of
records on a Japanese counterinsurgency
doctrine wrote an article if you want to
look at it just reviewing a lot of them
and its internal discussion and there's
every reason to believe it was sincere
they really convinced themselves that
they were sacrificing themselves just
like mill sacrificing themselves for the
benefit of the poor Chinese protecting
them from Chinese bandits bringing about
an earthly paradise they were
sacrificing blood and money and so on it
was utterly Noble just like everything
we're familiar with in the West and it's
possible that maybe Hitler believed the
same thing and maybe miscellany well
those are the cases he could find a
humanitarian intervention there are
cases where intervention has had
benevolent effects that's for sure since
the Second World War there are two major
examples one of both in the 1970s one
was 1971 when India intervened in East
Pakistan what's now Bangladesh and put
an end to Pakistani atrocities which are
killing ten hundreds of thousands of
people horrifying atrocities India
intervened and putting into it and East
Pakistan and separated from West
Pakistan's now Bangladesh
that was a case that really did have
major humanitarian benign effects nobody
calls it humanitarian intervention
because that wasn't India's goal and
they are their own power of reasons but
that was the effect the other major
example was 1979 when Vietnam invaded
Cambodia and drove out the Khmer Rouge
put an end to Pol Pot's crimes just at
the point where they were peaking they
were driven and that again had Vietnam
coulda did they don't know if they did
but they could have argued defensive the
purposes they were being attacked across
the border from Khmer extremists anyhow
that's a second case that had massive
benign effects none of neither of these
figures in the literature on
humanitarian intervention and there are
two reasons but one reason is wrong
agency they did it we didn't do it so
therefore it doesn't count the second
and more powerful reason is that the US
was bitterly opposed to both of these
interventions and at once moved to
punish the perpetrators sent an aircraft
carrier the bay of bengal threatened
india with sanctions extremely angry at
them for doing this in the case of
vietnam and cambodia the vietnamese were
instantly condemned as you know the
prussians of asia and worst gangsters
ever the u.s. immediately turned the
support of the Khmer Rouge a military
and diplomatic support backed their
position at the United Nations began to
arm them trained them and in fact the
supported openly supported a Chinese
invasion to punish the Vietnamese for
the crime of ending Pol Pot's atrocities
all on the record nothing controversial
about it but kind of disappeared from
history to borrow that
of our Latin American clients when they
get rid of people disappear them so you
have to look to find it but it's there
so obviously these couldn't have been
humanitarian interventions and they're
not counted I want to go on too long
because I'd like leave time for
discussion but let me just end by
quoting one of the earliest decisions of
the World Court the International Court
of Justice shortly after it was formed
that was in 1949 and it was on a case of
alleged humanitarian intervention they
the court rejected the claim denied the
appeal and said the court can only
regard the alleged right of intervention
as the manifestation of a policy of
force such as has in the past given rise
to most serious abuses and such as
cannot whatever be the defects in
international organization find a place
in international law from the nature of
things intervention would be reserved
for the most powerful states and might
easily lead to perverting the
administration of justice itself I think
those words ought to be seriously
pondered when one thinks about what's
called humanitarian intervention and the
actions that are not taken that could be
very simple humanitarian intervention
there are some mics around somewhere
there we're gonna tag-team a little bit
for these questions so we have about
half an hour for questions for professor
Chomsky if if you put your hands up nice
and high state your question loudly I
will solemnly restate your question for
the microphone and we'd like we'd like
to hear from lots of people yes please
yeah and the second tier up there so the
question is do you mean that the the use
the American use of the word terrorists
to describe so the question is about the
use of the word terrorism that's an
interesting one actually have written a
lot about it if you're interested so you
can find stuff in print I started
writing about terrorism in I had I
started writing about it explicitly in
1981 the reason was that Ronald Reagan
had just declared a war on terror the
Reagan administration came into office
declaring that a prime focus of its
foreign policy would be state directed
international terrorism plague of the
modern age returned to barbarism in our
times on and on and there was a lot of
public you know literature clear
sterling Jeanne Kirkpatrick and so on so
I started writing about it and I did
something utterly disreputable I used
the official definition of the word
terrorism from the US Code and army
manuals and British law they're all
approximately the same well if you use
that word if that the definition it
follows almost immediately that the u.s.
is the leading perpetrator of terror of
international terrorism
written the second Israel the third and
so on that won't work so therefore this
all this work is all that I gave plenty
of examples it's easy to find them in
fact Reagan's war on terror has also
been disappeared when Bush declared a
war on terror in 2001 he was read eclair
in it but you'll have to look hard to
find that the reason is that Reagan's
so-called war on terror immediately
turned into a vicious terrorist war
hundreds of thousands of corpses in
Central America well over a million and
southern Africa
Reagan was strongly supporting apartheid
South Africa as part of the war on
terror they had to defend South Africa
from the African National Congress in
1988 the Pentagon declared it to be one
of the more notorious terrorist groups
in the world obviously we had to defend
South Africans against that in fact
Mandela himself was just taken off the
terrorist list about two years ago now
he can come to the u.s. without special
dispensation and tens of thousands in
the Middle East and in general was a
major Horror Story so that's what that
history but an interesting industry
developed at that point early 80s to try
to find a definite definition of terror
it's considered something extremely
difficult to define so there are
academic publications international
conferences lots of literature trying to
somehow define this complex concept
seems to me this very simple definition
it's in the US code in army manuals and
in British law does take that definition
works fine but there's a problem with
that definition it doesn't differentiate
between what we do to them and what they
do to us so therefore can't be so you
got to find the concept of terror which
will be restricted to what they
to us not what we do to them and that's
subtle and difficult you can see why a
lot of academic research and conferences
and so on
and we see that all the time we just saw
it a couple of days ago a couple of days
ago there was a commemoration of 9/11 no
terrible horrible terrorist act actually
in South America it's called the second
9/11
the first 9/11 was September 11th 1973
that's when US initiated and US
supported the military coup took place
in Chile overthrowing the parliamentary
government killing the president
installing a vicious military
dictatorship which killed thousands of
people that tortured tens of thousands
established a a international terror
center in Chile which was conducting
assassinations all over and over that
helping overthrow governments install
similar monstrous regimes also brought
in a bunch of economists Chicago boys
they're called who very quickly that
drove the country into its worst
recession and one of the worst
recessions in its history well that's
what happened on the first 9/11 by any
dimension I can think of it was much
worse than the second 9/11 but that
one's gone from history same reason we
did it to them and you know this just it
runs through most everything you look at
so what do I think about the concept of
terrorism I think there's a perfectly
good concept but it's unusual
it doesn't distinguish the crucial
distinction between our atrocities
against them and their for lesser
atrocities against us and therefore it's
a big problem how do you deal with that
that's what said so what do you think
European country
maybe rethink
so the question is what does professor
Chomsky think about the question of
intervention with specific reference to
Syria Syria well nobody has suggested
intervention in Syria and there's a
reason the West is the only countries
that can intervene are the powerful
state okay so the United States the
traditional imperial powers there is an
imperial triumvirate then Britain the
United States and France and there are
the traditional imperial powers
throughout that whole region and they
could intervene but they don't want to
for one thing because theory they prefer
Assad and the President to any likely
alternative so there's no question to
answer I'm a weak if they decided to
intervene we could decide whether it's
the right thing to do and that raises
all kind of questions
same kind of questions that trace back
to John Stuart Mill what's involved
whether the purposes were the likely
consequences and so on but the questions
just don't arise yes please straight
right there
I understand well other we really have
to look at it in a case-by-case basis I
think it's really hard to find you can
make some general statements but the
trick is to apply them in the particular
cases so let's look at the particular
humanitarian crises and see what we can
do about it okay so take say the 1990s
the period when the US was in a noble
phase of its foreign policy with a
saintly globe we can look there were
many humanitarian crises then one of the
worst of them was in Iraq US sanctions
in Iraq killed hundreds of thousands of
people maybe up to a million people they
strengthened Saddam Hussein they under
destroyed so they destroyed any
possibility of any uprising against
Saddam they forced the population to
rely on him for survival they were so
horrendous that the the administrators
of the so-called oil-for-food program
two distinguished international
diplomats Dennis Halliday hunts von
sponeck both of them resigned in protest
because they regarded the sanctions they
were asked to administer as genocide 'el
okay actually just yesterday I got a
letter from Huntsman sponeck thanking me
for having brought this up in a
discussion and Oslo a couple of days ago
which was about your question so yes
that there was an easy way to end that
humanitarian crisis namely don't take
part in it okay that's easy doesn't cost
anything and there are many like that
one that was going on at the same time
actually
and Turkey not in the Balkans
inside native not near NATO Turkey at
that time was carrying out vicious
atrocities trying to suppress a Kurdish
protest movement in southeastern Turkey
occurs were deprived of the most
elementary rights they couldn't speak
Turkish illegally couldn't have the
Turkish color as anything had to pretend
to be mountain Turks as they were cold
and there was an uprising and Turkey
launched the counterinsurgency campaign
killed tens of thousands of people
destroyed about 3,500 towns and villages
drove roughly 3 million people something
like that out of the region
I was pretty awful it was an easy way to
stop that namely stop participating in
it the arms were coming almost entirely
from the United States about 80 percent
as the atrocities increased u.s. arms
increased in the year 1997 which
incidentally is the year when Clinton
was praised for the noble phase of his
foreign policy with a saintly glow in
the new york times in that year the
clinton sent more arms to turkey than in
the entire Cold War period combined up
until the onset of the insurgency so yes
there's an easy way to stop that one
stop providing the arms and if you like
I can run through a lot of other cases
so many cases of major atrocities can
very easily be stopped by stopping our
participation in them and it works one
case that Illustrated that is the
Indonesian invasion of East Timor in
1975 authorized by the United States
supported us provided arms Britain came
in provided
in fact most of the arms this one was
about as close to genocide 'el as
anything in the post-war period period
it was aggression and invasion and
occupation wiped out maybe quarter of
the population third of the population
they went on right through 1999 always
with strong us support the atrocities
there were worse in 1999 than anything
reported and Kosovo and in fact of
course the background was icomparable
worse than anything in the Balkans
finally in September 1999 under quite a
lot of domestic and international
pressure Clinton quietly informed the
Indonesians that the game was over they
told them you're gonna have to leave
they left instantly a day later that
could have been done for the preceding
25 years though that's now called a
humanitarian intervention you know with
a level of cynicism they don't know how
to describe so yeah you could stop that
one too and there are many other cases
like that but those are not the kind of
cases that are ever discussed the only
cases that are discussed is what are the
criteria when somebody else is carrying
out a crime okay that's harder it's much
harder to stop somebody else's crimes
than to stop your own and what are the
criteria well you know difficult
criteria they have to ask what are the
purposes what are the likely
consequences what are the general
effects a lot of particular
considerations have to be looked at
which are complex but I don't really
could be an interesting question I don't
think there's much point discussing it
frankly because the question almost
never arises in fact I can't think of a
case where it's arisen as I said at the
very beginning it's hard to find a case
in history of a genuine humanitarian
intervention one carried out for
humanitarian goals and with
consideration of what the
Pence's would be and says if the
question doesn't arise it's very hard to
answer right here up front so the
question is was the recent NATO
incursion into Libya humanitarian well
there were two interventions in Libya we
have to distinguish them one was both by
the Imperial triumvirate in both cases
it was the US France and Britain mainly
France and Britain and traditional
imperial powers the first one had
substantial global support it was
authorized by the United Nations look at
United Nations Security Council
resolution 1973 which had a fair amount
of international support it called for a
no-fly zone and actions to protect
civilians as soon as that was passed
came the second intervention namely the
decision of the Imperial triumvirate to
violate 1973 that's exactly what
happened they instantly intervened not
to protect civilians and not with a
no-fly zone but to participate in a
rebellion and they participated actively
in a rebellion finally the rebellion
succeeded with NATO support so we have
to ask which of these interventions were
talking about in my personal opinion I
wrote about at the time I thought that
the first one it could be justified the
decision to institute a no-fly zone and
to protect civilians I thought made
sense in particular it it prevented what
might have been you don't know but it
might have been a massacre in Benghazi
the second one is much more difficult
and in fact it's worth noting that the
second one is did not receive global
support so the African Union opposed
opposed to this in African country the
so-called BRICS countries developing
countries Brazil Russia India China
South Africa they strongly opposed it
they had a meeting which they called for
negotiations and diplomatic efforts as
did the African Union even within NATO
support was pretty tepid most Germany
didn't participate at all and other
countries did to an extent part of the
part of the formal justification is that
the Arab League requested it this is not
true
the first intervention the UN resolution
had limited support from the Arab League
a minority of Arab League countries
approved it mostly the Gulf countries
not the regional ones the second
intervention is most support from the
Arab League Qatar provided a couple of
airplanes nobody else Turkey didn't
support it the major NATO party nearby
and most countries called for
negotiations and an effort at diplomacy
which might have worked or might not
have the actual second intervention
according to the rebel leadership that
killed about 30,000 people it's not
slight Libya is a complicated society
it's a tribal society the beginning of
the uprising in Benghazi is you know a
region of Libya which is pretty much
separated from the tribal society the
Western uprising Misrata conquest of
Tripoli that's Western tribes partly
Bedouin tribes you know when Berber
tribes partly Libyan they're the ones
who did the fighting they're kind of
bitter they're the ones who in fact now
have the military command and switch
article about it today's New York Times
the right now it's not being reported
much the NATO is bombing the bases of
the largest Libyan
that which happens to be supportive of
Gaddafi so there's a lot to say about it
I'm you know maybe even make an argument
for it maybe not but a case has to be
made I don't think there's even been an
effort to make the case I might mention
as with regard to the Arab League call
for a no-fly zone limited call at the
same time they called for a no-fly zone
over Gaza oh yeah you can see how far
that went
so there's a lot of questions to ask I
don't think there's a simple answer
frankly but incidentally as to whether
what the goals were of course their
professed to be completely humanitarian
but it's worth remembering that when a
state claims that's not only a state but
its intellectual class and others when
they claim to be acting on humanitarian
grounds that statement in the technical
sense carries zero information and the
reason is it's completely predictable
that happens all the time
I gave a couple of examples you know
Hitler Mussolini John Stuart Mill you
pick them every just about every use of
forces vested in noble humanitarian
terms if something's predictable it just
doesn't carry any information so you
disregard it you dismiss it doesn't mean
anything so then you have to ask was it
really with humanitarian intent well
there you have to judge one interesting
piece of evidence perhaps is that the
day in which the Western tribes were
beginning to enter Tripoli you take a
look at the New York Times the business
section the lead story in the business
section had a title something like
energy corporations scramble for to gain
Libyan oil contracts maybe irrelevant
maybe not you can decide
- I don't whether it was justified or
not I don't think it begins to meet the
criteria for humanitarian intervention
so here in the first balcony on the Left
right at right right up front just there
yeah the question is what would be a
proper resolution to the conflict
between the Palestinians and the
Israelis well I'm pretty conservative I
still have the same views ahead in the
1940s when I was a scientist youth
leader those views were then called
Zionists they're now called anti Zionist
but the views are approximately the same
circumstances of course changed since
the 1940s so you know judgment of what
should be done at least in the short
term changes right now in fact for the
last roughly 40 years 35 years to be
exact
there's been a pretty straightforward
simple short-term settlement I wouldn't
call it a solution because I don't think
it's much of a solution but at least a
settlement that would reduce the cycle
of violence maybe eliminate it prepared
a way for further steps and everyone
knows what it is all over the world
there's an overwhelming international
consensus on it it's one of the simplest
problems in the world to solve from the
point of view of not solved but settle
these terms and that's to state
settlement on the international
internationally recognized border and
I'll quote the official terms with minor
and mutual modifications that was the
position of the United States from 1967
to the mid-70s at a time when the United
States was still part of the world on
this issue
so a two-state settled an international
border minor and mutual modifications
estranged straightening out lines from a
ceasefire lines and stuff and then
various things to do about the Jerusalem
refugees and so on as I said there's
overwhelming agreement on that there's
one barrier to it the same one there's
been for 35 years the United States
won't accept them and of course the
United States has overwhelming power
that Israel of course rejects it but and
can reject it as long as the United
States backs them so that's a short-term
settlement if it can be instituted and I
don't think it's that hard frankly so if
the United States if the United States
gives orders to Israel it has no choice
but to accept them the relations of
power make that obvious and the orders
can be pretty simple withdraw the army
from the occupied territories in fact
Human Rights Watch and not a
particularly radical organization has
called on the United States to to
withdraw any funding to Israel that has
anything to do with the occupied
territories or with discrimination
within Israel that's Human Rights Watch
Amnesty International's called for an
arms embargo just simple steps like that
would lead Israel to make a decision are
we gonna withdraw the army from the
territories where everyone agrees it's
criminal occupation even Israel are we
going to do that or are we going to
withdraw or are we going to stand alone
against the world without the support of
the United States I'm pretty sure what
they would do in that case there have
been similar cases before and then what
happens to the half-million settlers
well they have a choice to if they can
climb into the trucks that Israel will
provide for them and move from there
subsidized
homes in the territories to subsidized
homes in Israel and my guess is probably
90% of them will do that there's
probably a segment of you know religious
Jews from Brooklyn or want to cling onto
every rock ok they can do that they'll
be in the Palestinian state that's not a
big problem what would happen after that
well you know we can only speculate but
my guess is that what would happen after
that
at the border anyone who's been in the
region knows that you just can't cut a
line through that small territory that
makes any sense at all so my guess is
that what would happen is as has been
happening occasionally is that cultural
commercial social relations would
develop and gradually over time the
border would begin to erode and you
could move towards some sort of by
National Federation in the former
Palestine actually that was my view the
1940s and as I say it still is and
that's not the end of the road either
sometimes that's called a one state
solution it's a confusing term the the
the country itself is bordered by
Imperial decisions so the difference
Israel and Lebanon are separated by a
border that makes no geographical or any
other sense it cuts right across the
Galilee and it was established by the
British and the French for their own
Imperial purposes I should say my wife
and I lived there for a little while
back in the early 50s and we were
backpacking up there once and we
accidentally crossed into Lebanon there
was no marking of the border and it was
the same place some guy came by in a
jeep and yelled at us and told us to
come back but the and that's the way it
ought to be there shouldn't be a border
there there should be a broader regional
settlement which will integrate both
societies into a broader system and
maybe that'll happen and so it's in that
content
and only in that context that there
might be some kind of a solution for the
Palestinian refugees abroad I don't see
any other place so I think that's those
are directions that could be followed
they have to have a first step which is
accepting the international consensus
that's coming up in the UN and a week in
fact and the u.s. will again block it if
it comes up as it's been doing since it
feet the first such resolution in 1976
that's under our control you know if
this is the kind of if you like a
humanitarian action that can be taken if
the American population compels the
government to join the world on this
this is painful to say but we have time
for one more question I should tell you
that if you wish to stay behind
professor Chomsky will be signing books
just for a little bit in the lobby
outside yeah right down here up front
please partition of India most
unnecessary violence how do you think
our bounty program genomic but they have
the power to initiative
particularly so the question begins with
the observation that the partition of
India in the partition of India was
unusually violent so the question that
follows from that is whether the South
Asian leaders at the time whether the
South Asian leaders of the time and
particularly Gandhi could have mobilized
the energies and forces to intervene in
in the midst of that generalized
atrocity
yeah the partition of India was of
course done by the British and for their
own interests not for the interests of
the populations and it was pretty
horrible hundreds of thousands of people
killed maybe millions huge immigration
awful consequences going right up to the
present would anything else have been
possible I mean yeah I think other
things could have been possible wouldn't
just have been Gandhi it had to be
neighbor Jinnah others with a more
humane approach and without the British
intervention maybe something else could
have been done it didn't start in 1947
there's a long background of British
support for a Muslim nationalism as a
weapon against the Hindu based
independence movement a Churchill in
particulars despised the Indians the
Hindus and he was I mean you've read his
what he wrote about it it's hair-raising
he in fact was substantially responsible
for the last major famine and India the
huge famine in 1943 when there was
plenty of food around but he made sure
it went to England so that they could
have white bread in England instead of
while they're starving and Bengal and so
on there's a good book about this that
just came out by somebody named mahadji
Indian historian
and that's part of the background for
the partition didn't come from nowhere
could it have been different you know I
think you can think of ways it could
have been different but I should say
that that's one of the problems
unlike the israel-palestine one where
it's really hard to think of a
settlement especially in Kashmir which
is the core of the conflict now not
simple
