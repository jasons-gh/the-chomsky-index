well welcome to this interview today
with dr. Noam Chomsky a world-renowned
linguist philosopher and true American
genius dr. Noam Chomsky thank you for
being here with us today love to be with
you I want to begin the discussion by
talking about your work in linguistics
the things that you've done in
linguistics that have been so important
that they've led to being called by
several intellectuals as Chomsky
revolution so maybe in a few minutes if
you could just describe your ideas on
grammar and things like that the study
of language has been an object of
fascination back to classical times
language has been recognized for
millennia as a kind of defining property
of human beings and uniform among human
groups there's no variations that are
known and it's very its distinctive
there are no comparable or analogous
systems anywhere else in the organic
world and it seems but now we know it
seems to evolved pretty much along with
modern humans couple hundred thousand
years ago by the time you get to the
modern scientific revolution of 17th
century Galileo and his contemporaries
were looking at the world in a new
fashion and recognizing that there are
many puzzling and amazing features that
really hadn't been seriously
investigated before one of them was
language so they were awed and amazed by
the fact that which is amazing that
there was a couple of dozen sounds you
can formulate unbounded
/ of thoughts that you can convey them
to another person who has no access to
your mind which they regarded and I
think properly as a remarkable feature
of this system and nothing like it
elsewhere
really wasn't until the 20th century
that this could be this these properties
could be investigated in a rather deep
void thanks to discoveries and
mathematics that theories computation in
the mid twentieth century so now we have
the task a well-defined task of trying
to determine first of all for each
particular language what is the system
that you and I have in our brains other
people have in their brains that permits
this amazing property to exist how come
the finite brand generate freely an
infinite number of thoughts and find a
way to externalize them in the some
sensory system usually speech could be
saw and couldn't touch so that another
person can determine what's actually
going on in our minds the second problem
is to show how such a system can be
learned given the very sparse data that
a child has and third related to that
how the whole system could have evolved
by now it seems reasonably clear that
there's a kind of a common core system
of which the individual languages are
superficial they're variants they look
very different on the surface but when
you investigate
they think have common characteristics
of these basic principles seem to be
part of our biological endowment so
child doesn't learn them any more than
you learned of arms the meditative
visual system it's just part of your
nature and then minor variations
determined this of that language and the
idea then is the challenge is to try to
show that the immense superficial
diversity of languages and they're
apparently complex properties can in
fact be reduced to simple fundamental
principles shared among humans evolved a
fairly recent time and now we have the
task of filling in the massive details
that will accommodate to this basic
picture which looks pretty pretty solid
well to move on just for the sake of
time to the other side of your way even
famous for political activism and so the
world that we live in today is obviously
changing rapidly perhaps more than ever
has in any time before and so with this
what would be your expert opinion on
what the biggest problems are that we're
facing today in the world well I think
there are two huge problems which are
really existential I mean your
generation has to face a challenge that
has never arisen in human history that's
gonna be your generation which will
decide whether the human species will
continue to survive in any
organized form that's not an
exaggeration there isn't much time one
of them is a threat that we've been
living with for over 70 years namely the
threat of nuclear war which if you look
at the record and it's worth studying in
detail it's virtually a miracle would be
escaped and a nuclear war is essentially
terminal no point going into the details
but there are no small nuclear Wars but
that danger is in fact increasing right
now
and there were three major arms treaties
that did reduce the threat of the Attic
ballistic missile treaty was the first
the u.s. pulled out of it in 2002 the
INF treaty and intermediate nuclear
forces treaty signed by Reagan and
Gorbachev in 1987 second one u.s. just
pulled out of it the third is the New
START treaty which sharply reduced the
numbers that took their weapons for
Russia in the United States very
dramatically well that's up for renewal
and 2021 and president Trump's already
indicated he doesn't think he might read
what it's worth renewing that puts the
world in extreme danger the other threat
which was not understood that back in
1945 when the nuclear age began is the
threat of global warming we now know
that by the end of row 19 end of the
Second World War of the u.s. entered
to a new geological euro geologists
called the Anthropocene that era in
which human activities radically affect
the environment the global warming is
the most serious but there plenty of
others like within a couple of decades
plastics in the ocean will weigh more
than all the fish in the ocean and this
is has a lethal effect of mineral others
the one effect of the global warming and
the loss of habitat is that we are in
the midst of a period that biologists
call the sixth extinction rapid
extinction of species in fact it's going
on a level faster than it has for the
last 65 million years
when an asteroid hit the earth led to
the end of the age of dinosaurs
an opening for mammals then for all of
the humans were known back to them as
far as global warming is concerned we're
now close to a period ominously close to
a theory of one hundred and twenty five
thousand years ago when the sea level
was about twenty-five to thirty feet
higher than it is today of the West
Antarctic ice caps ice sheets are huge
enormous they're melting and it's
predicted that if they melt but in fact
that you can just imagine what effect
that would have on human life there are
parts of the world that were becoming
virtually on him have a
South Asians in danger of losing its
main water supplies that hundreds of
millions of people were facing major
catastrophes now there are things that
can be done that both visit if their
weapons threat and the global warming
threat but has to be done expeditiously
and seriously and unfortunately the
United States is an outlier this
campaign effort alone in the united
states has pulled out of the
international treaties to try to deal
with global warming last year the united
states was the only developed country
where emissions increased considerably
the trump administration is tearing away
the environmental restrictions and
restrictions on emissions and so on
opening up new areas of oil exploration
it said knowing perfectly well that
they're doing so for example the one of
the bureaucracies is national
transformation the transportation
administration produced an amazing
document about a year ago long detailed
study of why we don't need that
emissions controls on transportation and
the argument was that we're going over
the cliff anyway they predicted that by
2100 of the temperature will risen seven
degrees
I was way beyond possibility of survival
so everything's finished anyhow so why
not try it feel I mean I don't think
there's a document like that in human
history literally no but that's and
unfortunately much of a population it is
influenced by the parts of the
leadership that simply did not like
what's happening they know that they
know it of course but they're denying it
and so if the leadership in specifically
the United States is denying this I mean
what is it that it's unique to the
United States
it's very marginal in other countries
and other countries in fact they're
doing things like Denmark is on track to
move towards fully sustainable energy
within a couple of decades China which
is still a major polluter is produced
more solar panels last year than the
rest of the world combined
also more wind turbines and so on are
moving seriously towards eliminating the
deeply polluting industries United
States even go on estates of localities
in the United States are doing things
but we're laggards and in fact pulling
the world backwards and unfortunately a
large part of the population simply
doesn't see the problem among
Republicans barely 2/3 you can think
it's happening which is shocking I think
about a quarter something series has to
be done this is very dangerous there are
plenty of other problems like one of the
serious aspects of species extinction
very serious is that insects are
radically declining insects
for not only human life but life
generally it's predicted that the insect
population might virtually disappear
within not too long an attack a look at
the EPA it's eliminating regulations on
pesticides that are known to be lethal
to these which are declining population
on the main sources of pollination it's
as if there's an element's in the
species which is just suicidal so what
can we as college students facing these
major problems that are mostly coming
from people who are in leadership who
would rather just make a buck tomorrow
rather than to actually deal with the
problems that future generations like my
generation can continue to survive and
to live well to carry on the human
species and to carry on the earth as a
habitable place what what can we do
going into the world to try to make a
difference everything it's a very free
society there's a lot wrong but it's
maybe the freest most open society in
the world which means there endless
opportunities and they are being pursued
so just to take one example the sunrise
movement which is young people have
organized activities which actually led
to parts of Congress and proposing
legislation for what's called a green
green New Deal maybe it's not exactly
the right legislation but it's certainly
a move in the right direction to try to
bring the United States in line with
much of the rest of the world to
undertake serious steps to confront the
climate crisis and incidentally this
doesn't mean losing
it doesn't mean a more inconvenient or
worse life quite the contrary
there's nothing lovely about sitting in
a traffic jam for a couple hours a day
to get open back from work or about
having everything wolf clean water to
drink plenty of immense solar solar
panels actually want the biggest job
producing industries in the country coal
love the other employees very few people
as very lethal and so the recent I guess
you could say positions of the GOP that
if we move towards cold and that's
what's going to make the United States
create more jobs and help working-class
people that just completely let's just
take a look at the job I'm in the job
there very few jobs and coal anyway and
they're disappearing me simply because
of automation plus the fact that coal
has to go out of future we're just over
the cliff I mean they were that's just
one example there many others there are
activities being undertaken by young
people as a group called Earth strike
which is or young people which is
organizing regular demonstrations to try
to bring to the population that urgency
of these this situation there there's a
desperate need for simply educational
programs so that people will come to
understand what's actually happening in
the world and unfortunately there's it's
a big hill to climb I mean there are
tens of millions of people
Oklahoma sure who listened to Rush
Limbaugh who tells them that there are
four corners of deceit immediate
government academia and science which
live on the seat so pay any attention to
what the scientists are saying and that
same commits suicide
literally and that has to be overcome by
educational and organizational
activities plenty of from college
students are perfectly positioned to
undertake such efforts well we're about
out of time now thank you for your
answer to that question I have one more
question for you if you could answer it
and that is throughout your life having
been a very successful intellectual
whatever how was your perspective of the
world changed since whenever you were 20
years old to now whenever you're nine
years old
well you mentioned something a root when
I was 10 years old I have pretty much
the same perspective at that time that
was an article I'm sure it's not much
worth reading
but I remember part of it but was mainly
about the seemingly inexorable spread of
fascism over Europe maybe the world and
that was an extremely grim picture
fascism was not pretty looks like
nothing
today and that looked almost in every
known that fear is incidentally not gone
there were symptoms of it arising but
there are much greater fears existential
ones like the ones you mentioned has
also been quite a lot of programs just
in the last 50 or 60 years for example
you take a look at the United States
back in the nineteen sixties in the
nineteen sixties the United States had
anti-miscegenation laws which were so
extreme that when the Nazis were
constructing the Nuremberg was looking
for a model in the world that this was
their only model but the US laws were so
extreme that the Nazis couldn't adopt
them and they've got mildly milder
versions in the nineteen sixties the
federal government by law when it
created public housing miss necessarily
kept it segregated that's the 1960s
women's rights women literally did not
get have the right to be peers they they
were originally considered property they
became peers in 1975 other Supreme Court
rules the many changes have taken place
and they didn't just happen they happen
because mostly young people were out
working hard organizing
is demonstrating protesting sometimes so
it was wrong so I was right the maiden
had an enormous civilizing effect and
that goes on right to the present like
take these arms control treaties I
mentioned the INF treaty on the main
ones 1987 it was largely the result of
an enormous the public outcry and tens
of millions of people protesting
demanding that something be done to end
the threat of nuclear war and steps were
taken of the result of all these things
that's in many ways a better world in
other ways it's regressing that means
thinking back over 80 years that there
are things you can do but you know
they're not easy they were caused but
they're also great benefits that one
just the benefit of recognizing that
you're doing something to lead to a
better world
