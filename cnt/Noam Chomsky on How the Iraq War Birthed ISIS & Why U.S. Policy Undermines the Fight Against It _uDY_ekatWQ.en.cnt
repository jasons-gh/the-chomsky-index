I'm Amy Goodman with Aaron Matt a Noam
Chomsky's our guest for the hour the
world renowned political dissident
linguist author of over a hundred books
MIT professor emeritus Aaron yes no I
wanted to ask you about Isis the big
news is that Iraq is planning a major
offensive to retake Mosul it's currently
launching strikes to recapture to create
with us support my question is about the
effectiveness of the u.s. strategy to
what extent is the u.s. constrained by
its own policies in terms of the
effectiveness of defeating Isis
constrains in terms of its ties to Saudi
Arabia and its refusal to engage with
Iran and groups like Hezbollah which
have been effective in fighting Isis
it's Patrick Coburn who's done by far
the best reporting on this describes it
as an Alice in Wonderland strategy of
the u.s. is client wants to destroy Isis
but it's opposing every force that's
fighting Isis so the main state that's
opposed to Isis is Iran they support the
Iraqi government the Shiite government
but Iran is you know on our enemies list
probably the main ground forces fighting
Isis are the PKK and its allies which
are on the US terrorist list that's both
in Iraq and in and in Syria Saudi Arabia
our major ally along with Israel is both
traditionally for a long time the main
funder of Isis and similar groups not
necessarily the government rich Saudis
other people in the in the Emirates not
only the Thunderer but the their the
ideological source Saudi Arabia is
committed as dominated by an extremist
fundamentalist version of Islam Wahhabi
doctrine and Isis is an extremist
offshoot of the Hobby doctrine Saudi
Arabia is a missionary state that
establishes schools mosques of spreading
its radical Islamic version so there are
a lie our enemies are the those who are
fighting Isis and it's more complex Isis
is a monstrosity there's not much doubt
about that didn't come from nowhere it's
one of the results of the US hitting a
very vulnerable Society wracked with a
sledgehammer which elicited sectarian
conflicts that had not existed they
became very violent the u.s. violence
made it worse we were all familiar with
the crimes out of this came lots of
violent murderers forces Isis is one but
the Shiite militias are not that
different they're carrying out their the
kind of the when they say the Iraqi army
is attacking it's probably mostly the
Shiite militias with the Iraqi army in
the background I'm the way the Iraqi
army collapsed is an astonishing
military fact this is an army of I think
350,000 people heavily armed by the
United States trained by the United
States for ten years a couple of
thousand guerillas showed up that they
all run away
the generals run away first and the
soldiers didn't know what to do they run
away after they leave 20 seconds we have
20 seconds well no it's basically the
effect it's hard to see how Iraq can
even be held together at this point
it's been devastated by the u.s. US
sanctions the war the atrocities that
followed from it the current policy
whatever it is is not very likely to
even patch up they'll put band-aids on
the cancer we're gonna have to leave it
there but we'll continue this discussion
tomorrow on Democracy Now our guest Noam
Chomsky Institute professor emeritus of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology
