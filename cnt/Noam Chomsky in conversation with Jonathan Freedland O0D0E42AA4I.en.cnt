[Music]
welcome thank you already for giving our
distinguished guests guests such a such
a warm welcome yourselves and we
appreciate that I'm Roley Keating on
chief executive here at the British
Library and it is a pleasure to see you
all at this very very special event here
propaganda is going to be the big theme
of the year here at the British Library
come May the 17th will be opening one of
our most substantial exhibitions
propaganda power and persuasion which we
think is the first time a major national
institution has tackled this idea in the
round drawing extensively on our own
collections we're going to be exploring
state propaganda in all its forms in war
and peace across the centuries from
ancient origins particular focus on the
20th century and also looking at where
we are now and flashing ahead into the
future and this will be surrounded we
hope by one of the biggest public
programs of events and discussions and
debates we've ever had and nothing could
be more appropriate or wonderful than
that we kick off this great summer of
reflection and debate than to have our
guest tonight probably the best person
we could possibly have to stimulate
discussion and debate it's great to have
him in London last night he was up the
road I think at the friend's house
delivering the Edward W Sayid London
lecture tackling in that case the Middle
East tonight Noam Chomsky as I think
needing very little introduction has
been at MIT for over 50 years is of
course perhaps the most influential
figure in modern linguistics one of the
greats of analytic philosophy also
though of course the very model of the
engaged public intellectuals someone who
brings their wisdom spirit intellectual
curiosity and passion to bear on the
great issues of our time most famously
most trenchant Lee perhaps for his
consistent critique of American foreign
policy state capitalism and news media
and I think that may be part of our
focus for discussion tonight Noam has
written over a hundred
but one that resonates to this day and I
think will for a very very long time
indeed is manufacturing consent from
1988 which established yes the
propaganda model or analysis of news
media where 25 years on are we with that
thesis I think that'll be one of the
questions we explore tonight as
collectively we swim in a sea of social
media the internet transforming the
provision and shaping of news in front
of our eyes here at the library we try
to collect the news we collect
newspapers we collect online materials
we try and create a record of how news
documents and shapes our world and I can
think of no one better to challenge us
professionally and intellectually as to
how we do that than gnome and I'm
looking forward greatly to hearing what
he has to say it remains only for me to
say thank you to the Eccles Center for
American studies based here at the
library it was founded by David and Mary
Echols by with a bequest in 1991 and it
is one of the ways in which the the the
wonders and depth of our American
collections a celebrated year in year
out here an events like this a typical
of the kinds of events that the team put
on and we're very grateful for that
also delighted to welcome Jonathan
Freedland he and I worked together in
the founding days of BBC four and it's
very nice to be reunited here tonight of
course you'll have seen Jonathan's work
in Britain in the Guardian you may see
him in the New York Times New York
Review of Books and familiar as a voice
to millions on Radio fours the long view
connecting past present and future and
I'm sure that's what we're going to hear
tonight
so please our distinguished speakers
thank you
[Applause]
thank you thank you very much
rody for that warm introduction and
really really covering the ground of
setting up what the conversation we have
tonight and is as he said so aptly our
speaker our guest of honor couldn't be
better placed to discuss this subject we
thought we would do is plunge right in
with a flavor of the exhibition that's
coming propaganda power and persuasion
and Noam Chomsky's given me permission
to do two things firstly to do what
doesn't often happen in intellectually
hallowed environments like this which is
to do a quick fire round which we will
do on the screen in a moment but also he
tells me very graciously that he his own
children
and I'm guessing paps grandchildren as
well sometimes say and they've asked a
question please give me the five minute
lecture version so I say I pass that on
because it means that if you see me
appearing to be rudely winding up or
moving on our honored guest that is
because I have the blessing and
permission to do it just as we move on
cuz we've got a lot of ground together
so on with the quick fire round I I
thought it would be useful before we ask
you to give us a very distilled version
of the propaganda model that is the core
thesis of manufacturing concern if we
just had a look at some examples of
propaganda from the exhibition and in a
way just to do have a quick look at what
is and what isn't and I'm gonna have a
go with it there we are
I hope everyone can see that I'm Volk
ein Reich ein Fuhrer one people one
state as opposed one Fuhrer from we
guess either in the 1930s this a
soviet-era depiction of a weeping Statue
of Liberty I'm not sure how clearly as
to all of you but we have sort of secret
police in the eyes of Lady Liberty one a
truncheon serving as a tear and then
this from the wartime period in the
United States the artist George a rather
Norman Rockwell have very different
meaning Georgia Norman Rockwell Seyfried
was feech by war bonds now Noam Chomsky
just start with these three - the lay
eye these all look like examples of
propaganda what would you say the first
evokes childhood memories which aren't
pleasant there were it was a very scary
period the 1930s especially if you're
Jewish and for me it was I remember my
parents would sometimes play Hitler's
speeches on the radio I couldn't
understand the words but you could get
the tone and it was very frightening
especially the reaction and it had a lot
of personal meaning for me because we
were the only Jewish family in a mostly
Irish and German Catholic neighborhood
and boys on the street since that was
very anti-semitic though the kids were
all going to a Jesuit school and when
they came out they were raving
anti-semite so this was when they'd calm
down later in the afternoon you could
but I grew up with a visceral fear of
Catholics and I'm the Irish where
pro-nazi because they were Irish they
hated the British and the Germans
because they were German this is all our
topic but now that we have a Jesuit Pope
to give it a little tremble when you
heard about well it changed enough so
that when liberation theology came along
I got very close to the Jesuit when I
would visit say Nicaragua I often lived
in the Jesuit house but it took a while
to get over it because some of these
childhood and fears or can be pretty
deep I got when I got older I realized
what this ridiculous but it's deep and
the Hitler imagery was very striking I
remember beer parties when Paris Ville
it's that was the environment the
interestingly I never told my parents
and in those days the children these
boys didn't talk to their parents about
personal things so they never knew I
don't even think they knew what kind of
neighborhood we lived in I mean they
didn't know your fear of some of them
nothing maybe they didn't have any sense
of what the neighborhood was like they
lived in a way you know it was like they
lived their Hebrew teachers they lived
in a kind of Hebrew ghetto not
physically but the only people they knew
were similar people I mean I remember
the women my mother's friends who would
all bilingual of course but they would
call the if they had to order something
from a downtown department store they'd
insist on speaking Hebrew so they'd get
a Hebrew translator you know it was
quite and there was a big kulturkampf
going on at the time between the Hebrew
and the yiddish diaspora and they were
uh neighbors sites of their language was
Yiddish but I never heard a word of the
addition when I was growing up so very
potent memories for you
well maybe I'll colleagues they can turn
up the volume on the microphone so
you're here is amplified so we'll take
note of that to move to this painting
this poster from the water it does this
count as propaganda as much as that
first picture of it's a perversion of
socialist realism it's basically the
same and if this was the Second World
War of course it's them trying to stir
up patriotism for the Second World War
it's kind of striking to think about
what went on in the First World War the
Second World War the United States
didn't get into it until it was attacked
some wanted to get in but they didn't
First World War was quite different the
British had a the first state propaganda
system that I know of was called the
ministry of information that
natural name for a propaganda system and
the purpose of the the main purpose of
the Ministry of information was to
convince Americans American
intellectuals in particular this is
relevant to the propaganda bottle
convinced American intellectuals that it
was a noble war during the first world
war
intellectuals in every participant
country were lauding the magnificence of
their own state the few people that be
great mostly ended up in jail like
Bertrand Russell but they had to
convince they were trying desperately of
course to get the Americans into the war
and Woodrow Wilson had been elected in
1916 on a peace platform slogan was
peace not victory and they had to
somehow turn the population around very
quickly so they'd begin to hate
everything German you know and it was
really and it was very successful and it
particularly the progressive American
intellectuals you know the John Dewey
circle New Republic intellectuals they
turned completely and they convinced
themselves that as they put it this is
the first time in history that a country
has gone into war not because of
military leaders and chauvinistic
leaders but because of the the
intelligent members of the community
reflected and decided that this is what
had to be done and then we turned the
population around so that they joined us
of course the intellectuals that were
they were being fed ludicrous British
propaganda the kind that was as later
exposed and the brice report and you
know the belgian children with their
arms torn - all that stuff and it worked
very well and that's a kind of set off
the modern system of propaganda I want
to get on to you particularly your point
about the propaganda model but just
people we leave our quickfire round I
would have a look at two newer examples
now
that's from the Occupy movement as you
said the 99% have no borders that's the
clue it's quite a deliberately retro
style but here's a cause I particularly
signaled this out because I thought
here's a cause that broadly you might be
sympathetic to and yet would you apply
the label of propaganda to this image
sympathetic to the cause but I don't
like this technique of trying to bring
people in in fact I I can't stand
listening to what's called the no you
know uplifting rhetoric it just really
turns me off and for the same reason
this kind of thing it's an appeal to
emotions not understanding and it's
obvious what it's trying to say but you
didn't like it even when it's in the
service of a cause you might simply
understand it well I mean I can't listen
to Martin Luther King's speeches
literally although I greatly admire him
because it's in a just the style you
know it's a it's an appeal it's trying
to arouse emotional support for
something very significant I mean I
don't criticize it obviously meant
something but if you didn't like Martin
Luther King what about this man no
that's extreme you can see the effect it
had by the on the funeral yes it was
just worship fact about the only thing
like it outside of Kimmel song maybe it
was Ronald Reagan's death it was treated
like a king had died in fact you can
read in publications of the Hoover
Institution you know at Stanford
University serious research outfit
describing Reagan as a they put a
colossal figure whose spirit hovers over
us like a warm and friendly ghost that's
actually George Washington was treated
the same way when the colonies the
colonies had to create some sort of
sense of national identity
I mean the term United States
plural until the Civil War there's a lot
of states you know and they tried to
create a national identity you needed a
heroic figure so the in the early 19th
century there was a George Washington
cult that was stirred it's where you get
these cherry trees stories and all that
business it was all concocted to try to
show that he was practically not human
he was a noble gentleman that's very
funny for example if you go to the
Capitol building today there's a statue
of George around 1830 I think of
Washington in the style of a Greek god
you know he's Zeus and there was
criticism of it but the criticism was
because he was wearing a toga and his
shoulder was showing but other than that
that's fine he was God you know perfect
perfect Roman perfectly and this would
fit that category of myth-making it's
the same kind of thing and it leaves you
cold regardless of the cause this if
that was by way of preamble really - and
it's it's been very instructive already
this notion of myth making bit what a
lot of people in this room will have
read manufacturing consent I'm guessing
quite a few will have read it several
times and committed it to memory but for
those who haven't and I'm quoting now
your children if you can give us the
distilled version the five minute
lecture on what the propaganda model is
and who wrote the book of regionally in
1988 and then I want to sort of push you
on what how that stands now well
actually I should say that the most of
the work on the propaganda model itself
was due to my colleague Edward Herrmann
he's a professor of finances in fact
he's it professionally was a specialist
in corporate power and corporate control
wrote the standard work on it and it's I
mean I agreed with it but I can't take
credit for it was mostly his initiative
and I didn't totally agree for reasons
I'll tell you but what it is is a
discussion of the institutional
structure of the media but it's looking
at the US media so now
state media but corporate media and asks
an obvious question if you look at the
institutional structure and you ask what
content you would expect to flow from it
what would you predict and briefly
without going to the details the the
media are huge corporations parts of
larger conglomerates they sell a like
other businesses they sell a product to
a market the market is other businesses
advertisers the product is people so
they sell people to advertisers so
television for example makes nothing no
profit if you turn on the tube but they
get it from the advertisers and the
newspapers mostly lose money when you
subscribe they do better from the
advertising so so it so the first part
of it is it's major corporations showing
people to other corporations and then
there are other factors like it's very
easy to show that the corporate system
is very tightly linked to government
that people flow in and out the and then
the government itself produces just
plain state propaganda and that matters
and other factors like that no we asked
well what would you expect to happen
what you'd expect to see overwhelmingly
is a choice of issues and framing of
issues which reflects the interests and
concerns of the state corporate Nexus
that's what you'd predict and then the
rest of the book is running through
examples it's been a little
misunderstood it's a lot of journalists
regard as a criticism of journalists
it's exactly the opposite in fact about
a third of the book the latter third I
suspect nobody ever read it is a defense
of journalists against attacks from
liberals from Freedom House you know the
Freedom House wrote a
vicious attack couple volumes of attacks
on American journalists for stabbing the
United States in the back in Vietnam and
losing the Vietnam War and so on and
they it's to them the two volumes one
commentary and the other the documentary
background for it
and I'm kind of a masochist so I
actually read the documents and probably
the only person ever read them when you
read the documents you find that the
commentary is totally falsified and in
fact what it shows is that the
journalists did an honest courageous job
what they saw they described accurately
and the criticisms are mostly fabricated
but they did it within the framework of
a an interpretation which is super
chauvinistic so for example that if the
United States carried out some atrocity
it was a mistake or the other side's
amount cost to do it and then they leave
things out that but the actual reporting
was first-rate and I think you can trust
it and typically the case so it's a
defense of journalism which the
journalists didn't like how is able to
do that kind of reporting that you do
trust if they are simultaneously framing
it in a way that you don't you know it's
honest professionals they have integrity
and especially working in the field
takes a lot of courage and and they do
an excellent job but within a narrow
structure like there are certain topics
that just not want report not out of
there it might be editorial pressure and
when they do report it the framework is
essentially a patriotic framework you
can see it all the time I mean we give
lots of examples just distinguish or you
say that the media distinguishes between
worthy victims and unworthy victims and
worthy victims tend to be the victims of
the United States enemies or unworthy
victims of those who are whether its
client yeah
so when say the Russians invade
Afghanistan the Afghans are worthy
victims because the enemy is attacking
them and in fact reporting from
Afghanistan during the Russian invasion
was from the side of the Mujahideen
that's where reporters went to work with
the guerillas and when the u.s. invaded
Afghanistan is exactly the opposite
reporters didn't go work with the
Taliban you know they reported from the
point of view of the American army I'm
interested in how sincere your
expression of admiration for journalists
is well I want to push you on how
sincere that your admiration that you
expressed before for journalists how
sincere can that be if you're saying
that they locate themselves on this side
or that side depending on what's going
on they accept the frame and the
narrative that sounds like a criticism
to me well actually that's the one point
in which it and I somewhat disagreed
about the whole thing I think that's to
have the book refer to the media is too
narrow because I think that applies to
the whole intellectual class that's the
way intellectuals are overwhelmingly all
through history intellectuals
overwhelmingly are servants of power now
intellectuals write history so when you
read what they write they look very
noble and adversarial and so on but when
you look at what actually happened there
all the criticisms we make of the media
apply to them and that's significant
because none of the institutional
factors hold in that case none of the
institutional factors that we looked at
have to do with the corporate structure
you know the advertisers who purchase it
but that's not apply to the a doesn't
apply to a college professor I'm there
other pressures but not those but the
outcome is pretty much the same this is
again slightly off topic but if that is
the case what made you so different in
other words if even intellectuals are
subsumed into the always a fringe of
dissidents any society look at there's a
fringe of dissidents
they're treated badly usually this goes
back to the earliest recorded history I
so got classical Greece who drank the
hemlock it was the guy who was
corrupting the youth by worshipping
false gods you know and it wasn't the
guys who followed orders or take a look
at at the same time of the other ancient
records we have are the biblical records
in the biblical records there's there
are people who we would call
intellectuals they weren't in the
English translations it's called
prophets that's a bad translation of a
very obscure Hebrew word which nobody
understands and they they weren't
prophets they didn't prophesy they were
decent intellectuals you know they
condemned the evil king they gave
geopolitical analysis said you're
leading us into disaster you you should
be merciful to widows and orphans and
these are decent intellectuals how are
they treated they were imprisoned thrown
into the desert one of them elijah was
called the hater of israel no fairness
or Albay epitome of evil in the Bible
King Ahab that's the first use that I
know of this notion self-hating Jew you
know it's King Ahab referring to
probably Elijah
yes and the and they were all treated
badly now there were people who were
treated well flatterers at the court a
couple of centuries later they were
condemned as false prophets and that's
very typical I don't know the society
where that's not true but I've heard it
said just at this point about you that
if the argument of the you just advanced
and manufacture manufacturing consent
was completely right the book should
have gone nowhere and you should have
been an obscure figure who was shoved to
the margins but the fact that you are
this giant figure in the book is still
cited and quoted it's because of the
popular movement if the when I started
giving talks about the Vietnam War in
early nineteen sixties I
I was giving talks in somebody's living
room or a church with four people the
minister the organizer a guy who wanted
to kill me and a drunk girl walking off
the streets and that went on for quite a
while
finally a popular movement developed and
when popular - the movements develop
people who have some degree of privilege
can float above them actually the same
was true of Martin Luther King I'm sure
he would have been the first to say if
if it hadn't been for the young students
sitting in and lunch counters and
writing freedom buses and getting beaten
to a pulp by state troopers and
everything that grew from that he
wouldn't have nobody would hurt him
either it's just I said we were gonna
just challenge a few things about it
the book was written 1988 since then
we've had this explosion of other media
social media the internet obviously and
access is now available to many who
would at least consider themselves and I
want to give you if you think they would
be right but they would consider
themselves outside the corporate media
they have their own voices separate to
that exchange and need for advertising
etc and in fact just to illustrate the
point I tweeted earlier today that I was
going to have this conversation with you
and elicited this question from a Chris
Wood here in Britain who said can we
still talk about dominance or hegemony
in a world where there are so many
competing sources of information and
propaganda the internet and blogs and
Twitter etc does that does this change
in the last 25 years render any part of
your thesis out of it it's not a great
change like when I was growing up in the
1930s now there were all sorts of
radical newspapers I mean every
imaginable kind in fact as a kid I'd go
down to the Philadelphia public library
err analog to this not the same
obviously and spend Saturday afternoon
reading radical periodicals every
imaginable kind and I got
you know what they were like but but
they were other interpretations now
sources of information is not exactly
correct because the the internet access
makes that easier like I don't have to
go downtown to the library I can punch
something on my computer but it's not
that different and they are not really
sources of information the information
is still coming from journalists in the
field is that right so I'm thinking of
some of the in the Arab awakenings
in Egypt and other places people were
reporting as eyewitnesses immediately in
real time it wasn't going through the
filter of any journalist that's how we
found out about it but if you take a
look the internet was used for art and
social media were used for organizing in
Tahrir Square but take a look at what
happened when Mubarak tried to stop it
by closing down the internet it turned
out it accelerated it because people
just contact one another in other ways
but that face-to-face that is a profound
change isn't it because there you'll
saying that the authoritarian who in the
past could have shut down the six state
newspapers he couldn't shut down after
had then people would have reacted the
same way by face-to-face communication
you've got lots of ways of communicating
and that's just what they didn't tell
her Square and in fact it didn't it
didn't even hinder the demonstrations so
you didn't feel the we're in any way
made it a change in sort of a change but
but not in time not in kind
I mean degree much less of a change then
say from the creation of libraries I
mean that was a much bigger change that
gave people access to huge amounts of
material that before that they couldn't
have in comparison the Internet is a
small change and which is fine I use it
all the time I'm not criticizing it but
it's a little different from libraries
crucially different in the case of
libraries you could be pretty confident
that what you would read in the library
is more or less serious
had some value otherwise it wouldn't
have been preserved and stayed there and
when you look at the Internet an awful
lot of it is just total garbage and if
you if you approach it without any
framework of understanding which is what
happens quite often it can just be a
source of deception you get that's how a
lot of contemporary cults develop and
you don't you I know you told me before
you consider yourself a technophobe you
don't use social media yourself social
media at all I don't like them for other
reasons it seems to me they're they
create I can see with my grandchildren
you know they create very superficial
appearances of relationships you know
like a kid thinking of a case will write
on Facebook you know I'm having an exam
this afternoon and immediately a hundred
French so-called friends will write back
because she never heard from saying gee
I I hope it hope you do will and the kid
thinks she has a hundred friends it's
nothing
you know it's just replacing real
friends by virtual friends somebody who
doesn't use social media you've got
quite a good grasp of the teenage thing
going on I've got an experimental
subject I promise but the argument is
out for to wider conversation and soon
there's a couple of areas I just want to
probe before we do another change that's
happened besides the internet change has
been a kind of fragmentation of the big
media that you were talking a big way in
1988 decline of the big city newspapers
would be one phenomena but for example
the cable television so there is now Fox
News on the right and an MSNBC News on
the left that feels like a proliferation
of a range of views or for you are they
just two heads of the same corporate
Beast I think if you look over the last
say my lifetime last my conscious
lifetime last seventy years there's been
a narrowing of media's sharp
arrowing in england to remember that as
late as the 1960s of the British
tabloids which you know beyond junk were
serious newspapers mainly labor
newspapers and pretty serious ones
the New York Post which is a tabloid
that was the left-wing newspaper now
it's beyond the idiocy The Daily Herald
I think it was was the best-selling
newspaper in England until the early
sixties it was a social democratic labor
newspaper also had a lot of loyalty
reader loyalty people read it serious it
couldn't survive capital concentration
and advertising and in fact if you look
back from the 19th century to the old
today there's been a sharp narrowing of
media in the nineteenth century there
was a huge proliferation of media labor
press ethnic press all kinds of things
but all these things are now there on
the only instances but all these things
are there now are they on the internet
it's blogs for every possible political
world Australia were actually there were
serious newspapers that people
participated in and it wasn't just
anything that comes to mind or write it
down they were committed and they're
very interesting survived in fact if
there's a very good book which maybe
some of you have read by on the reading
habits of the British working-class
Jonathan rose a big eight hundred page
book and it's it's fascinating
he points out he concludes that working
people in England were I had a richer
cultural life than the aristocrats
because they were really reading serious
work the same in the United States take
a look at the labor press in the late
nineteenth century
the press was written by Irish artisans
going into the mills what they called
factory girls young women from the farms
who were essentially being driven into
the mills as the early industrial
revolution and it's it's very
interesting very insightful very very
for them there was no marks no European
socialists have never heard about that
they were just writing from their own
experience of the degrading a character
of the industrial system which was
destroying their culture their
independence their freedom in fact one
of the interesting things which is
relevant wasn't one of the things they
denounced was what they call this is
1850 the new spirit of the age gained
wealth for getting all but self you ever
hear that that was the new spirit of the
age in 1850 and they were bitterly
condemning it and there's been a hundred
and fifty years of intense propaganda to
get this sociopathic concept into
people's heads
they were resisting it much less now and
and and even in my childhood there was
still a wide proliferation of newspapers
I'm in Philadelphia where I lived there
were in those days there was a morning
paper and an evening paper and then you
got the New York papers and it was quite
arranged well that certainly
countercultural that view that with the
media have narrowed rather than widened
let me just get your quick responses on
three things and then we're gonna open
it up the first one is something going
on in Britain at the moment part of the
thesis of manufacturing consent is that
there is this convergence between the
politics and the corporate interest
right now more less as you landed here
there is this proposal from the
government of that from all the
political parties to have a form of
regulation that will be underpinned or
backed by law so the state and on the
other hand the people opposing it are
the big corporate newspaper groups and
there's this divergence of interest and
what each one says they're doing the
right thing and the corporate business
voice says we're speaking for freedom of
expression given that you lump the two
together you fuse the together in the
argument who
where do you stand with this argument
who's right in this outlet you know I
haven't read the report yet so I really
can't comment I like that I would
probably hope yeah but so I can't
comment on if it's even published but
divergences between the corporate sector
and the state are extremely interesting
and they do happen on major issues and
they're very revealing and the way
intellectuals and the media deal with
them is revealing so take for example
the u.s. crusade against Cuba it's been
going on for 50 years in virtually total
isolation the United States practically
didn't kicked out of the Western
Hemisphere because of it because there's
so much opposition when it comes up in
the United Nations the votes are you
know hundred eighty two United States
and Israel if you take a look at
malicious it includes a lot of terrorism
serious terrorism strangulation of the
economy you know and it goes back to
Kennedy who was kind of saying about it
and it's persisted and there's two
interesting things about this a public
opinion on this has been studied for
about forty years the public is
overwhelmingly in favor of normalization
okay it's normal for public opinion to
be disregarded that's what we call
democracy but it's what's interesting in
this case is that the corporate sectors
opposed big sectors of it
agribusiness energy pharmaceuticals
these are the guys are usually set
policy and they're opposed to it but the
state interest in punishing disobedience
overwhelms the pressure from the
corporate sector I think that tells us
something about International Affairs
and it says something about yeah because
some people if they crudely summarize
your politics would say you imagine the
politicians are merely the tools of
corporate interests and here's an
example where they are sovereign they're
making a decision and sometimes transit
state interests it's not so much
Congress it's the executive and they see
themselves mostly as responsible for the
overall health of the corporate system
not the parochial interests of
particular corporations and for them
it's a crucial necessity and this runs
right through the Cold War much earlier
to treat the world kind of like the
Mafia in fact I think that's the major
principle of international affairs you
don't read it in journals but I think
international affairs can very well be a
lot of it can be understood on the Mafia
model the Godfather does not Brooke
disobedience if some small grocer
doesn't pay protection money which the
Godfather wouldn't even notice they
don't accept that and they don't send
the goons in to get the money they get
the goons in to beat him to a pulp so
others will understand that disobedience
is not tolerated it would be an example
of that in Cuba you take a look at the
actual dump it's a very free country the
United States we have rich documentary
record nobody looks at it so it doesn't
matter much but if you look at it it
it's very revealing so the primary
concern about Cuba under Kennedy was
what they called successful defiance of
US policy going back to the Monroe
Doctrine in 1823 no Russians just the
principle that the hemisphere has to be
obedient to us and these guys are not
only defying it but they're getting away
with it you've just mentioned that you
said you've conceded if you like the
United States very free country you've
talked before elsewhere about the so
called freedom of expression in the
United States there's a lot of debate
going on about United States being in
decline and its place losing its place
perhaps to China
well I mean how do you maybe don't get
into the question of whether the u.s. is
going to be overtaken but more narrowly
how the United States freedom of
expression and propaganda compares to
other countries is there is the
propaganda less coercive in the United
States than it is say in China is there
is there freer expression more
sophisticated hell in fact some of these
images Illustrated the US commercial
propaganda which grew out of the wartime
experience of this great success and
what what they called a manufacturing
consent that's not our term we took it
from an intellectual walter Lippmann
leading public intellectual it was very
successful that out of that grew the
public relations industry it's guru came
out of the propaganda commission in the
First World War
I'm very impressed and then a commercial
propagate of commercial advertising that
was created now it was called propaganda
then so the founding document of the
public relations industry written in the
late 20s by Edward Bernays was he was
someone who had been in Wilson's
propaganda Commission he called this
book propaganda and it's about it's it
gives the standard doctrines of the
intellectual classes the which goes back
to the English Civil War the people are
a rabble they're stupid and ignorant
they're meddlesome Outsiders quoting and
for their own benefit and we have to
take care of them it's straight out of
Lenin it's almost identical with
Leninist Vanguard ISM that people don't
understand we're the responsible men we
understand and for their benefit we have
to engineer consent and we have to
control the minds of the people so that
they do the right thing and that's our
task that's what propaganda is for
whether it's state or commercial
and the commercial cases were kind of
interesting Bernays himself made his
reputation and became a great figure
because of the first major advertising
campaign that he ran in those days this
1920s that women didn't smoke and the
you know the manufacturers realized
there's a big market out there losing so
he was hired to convince women to smoke
and he ran campaigns in which you know
models would walk down Fifth Avenue
holding cigarettes and presenting the
image you want to be cool and modern you
know I should like the models you should
smoke I don't know how many tens of
millions of corpses he created but he
became a liberal hero for this
that's what commercial advertising was
then until today and it was very much
admire gurbles picked up he was very
impressed by American commercial profit
propaganda it was called propaganda
advertising we called it now and in fact
the Nazi propaganda was modeled on it
and he describes in detail how gerbils
how you know these simple images you
know appeal to the emotions all that and
the Nazis picked it up and ran with it
now the Bolsheviks tried and that
Bolshevik picture is an example but they
were too crude to get away with it so
the Bolshevik propaganda you can barely
believe that given the sophistication of
a youth words excitation does that mean
you said how sophisticated it operates
the United States but does it mean that
you would trust information that you got
in the American media less than
information you would read in the
Chinese media for example oak I mean I
was in China a couple of years ago and
I'm I can't read Chinese but they have a
an English newspaper and you can kind of
watch television and figure out what
they're talking about well anything in
written was
comical you couldn't believe it but what
was interesting was what they didn't
report when I got back to the United
States after a week in China
I discovered that there had been a
massive traffic jam from Mongolia to
Beijing with trucks sitting there for
days because they couldn't get through
nobody knew about it there wasn't a word
about it there I found out when I came
back for all your criticisms of the
American media there are still they
still value in it you still regard it as
free free relatively insane free because
there's the United States has very
little government coercion but it has
enormous obedience which is kind of
striking the and I think that relates to
what I said about the intellectual
classes there there's no coercion at all
the only coercion is you know maybe you
won't get a good review or something but
it's not like being sent to a torture
chamber okay well good I'm glad you made
the distinction before we wanted him
cite another response that came in when
I offered people on Twitter to suggest
questions to you and one of them was
this about Serb propaganda in the Serb
propaganda servers in Serbia and the
question was the suggestion was that I
should ask you why did he endorse Serb
propaganda and imply do mascar and turn
up lowly a camps were invented shameful
said this person on Twitter and it was
actually the person sending it was
somebody who had themselves lived in
sarajevo during the siege of sarajevo
who said I was in Sarajevo at the time I
could see very well from where mortars
and bullets were coming etc and you know
you've had this battle with a few people
publicly I never said anything about the
Balkans but I wrote about Kosovo but
said practically nothing about the
Balkan but I don't understand exactly
what was said he says we accepted sir
propaganda the criticism was you had and
the particular claim is you know centers
on schreiber need sir
and the idea that you have tossed down
since repartee you've no idea but I say
to say yo Pisa what I did it what I said
is you should tell the truth about it
instead of lying and I do believe that I
think it's useful to tell the truth what
happened in England particularly in the
early 90s was quite dramatic I'm in
British journalists and intellectuals
seized on the Serb atrocities which were
real with just love I mean finally they
had a chance to condemn somebody else
and seem very noble by agreeing with a
hundred percent of opinion and that's
irresistible and you start getting a
ludicrous propaganda coming out
including the left press and that it
just became a passion you couldn't tell
the truth about it
so so I'm certain wouldn't Stryper needs
you said you need someone to tell the
truth all the truth
those those pajamas who were there who
reported on it believe the truth this
was offering all the Whirley weren't
journalists there they were they
reported afterwards and what's what do
you say is the treatment of what the
truth is that well the truth is if you
want to go back a few months that the
the armies of the Bosnian armies sir Sir
Trevor Nietzsche was a protected base
theoretically it was so nobody could get
in presumably and the the Muslim armies
were using it as a base to attack
Serbian villages outside and they were
very frank and open about it another
orage the head of the militias a brag to
the press and was reported in the United
States and Washington Post and so on but
he was sending his troops out into the
Serb villages and beheading people and
torturing them and then they go back
into the safe zone well you know it was
pretty clear that sooner or later is
going to be a response to this now what
he then did was pull out his militias
and when the Serbs came in
which they did in reaction they were
kind of surprised there was no military
defense and then they carried out a lot
of atrocities the Serb forces did a
survey yeah we don't I'm it's called
genocide and I don't use the word
genocide much I think it's the way it's
used strikes me as a kind of Holocaust
denial I'm going to use genocide when
you kill a bunch of people you don't
like
that's demeans the victims of the
Holocaust I think so I rarely use the
word I don't think it's used properly
but to kill say a couple of thousand men
in a village and after you've allowed
the women and children to escape in fact
truck them out that doesn't count as
genocide it's a horror story but it's
not generous you say a couple of
thousand to be people claim and would
argue that the figure is much higher
than that well the figures debated but
then you don't really know I mean the
highest figures that are given are
around 8,000 but it's not from there's
been an intensive effort to when enemies
carry out an atrocity this huge effort
that goes into finding every piece of a
bone and DNA analysis and try to get the
biggest number you can and when we carry
out a comparable atrocity you know even
investigation and the Bosnian woman who
wrote to me on Twitter said that you
were often cited she said by Serb
propaganda that children of Professor
Chomsky agrees with us does that trouble
you if you were being held up prayed in
aid by the Serbs no you can't not a like
I'm I'm quoted by Iranian propaganda
because I say things critical about the
United States they can't help that it's
I can't help what they do but I think
we're to tell the truth about it and the
truth is it was an atrocity but nothing
like what his claim didn't say the
British press that atrocity and this is
also true the camps that's an
interesting story and there were a
couple of
[Music]
the detention and concentration camps of
the first one that was investigated was
a Guardian reporter at Vidya me and some
ITN yes TV people and they reported on
this camp which they described as a
detention camp they pointed out that you
weren't forced to stay there you could
read the early report the eyewitness
reports people could get out if you
wanted they were holding them there but
not a concentration camp later the story
changed it became a schvitz same
journalists incidentally reported as
kind of Auschwitz and Europe they just
changed the story not on the basis of
new evidence it's just the mood changed
there was a small newspaper kind of
crazy newspaper LM was called yes hadn't
four people or something they said a
photographer to the camps who took
photographs and essentially confirmed
the original story you don't claiming
the original story was faked oh no I
think it was an eyewitness story a
reporter gives an eyewitness description
it's usually true you know so I assume
it was true that's British reporters
then what happened is interesting ITN
and the Guardian incidentally went after
LM in order to destroy it and they
relied on these utterly scandalous
British libel laws which are an
international scandal and do make it
possible for a big corporation to put a
tiny newspaper out of business they
can't pay the legal costs and so on and
then there was a euphoria about it I
said great we managed to put out a
business a tiny newspaper which
published something we don't like
okay then something else happened the
most respected photojournalist may be
anywhere certainly here Philip Knightley
looked into it
and he's a you know a very respected
work goes back to the Spanish Civil War
and he did an analysis and he concluded
that the LM analysis was probably
correct he didn't accuse anyone of
distortion and he just said if you look
at if you look at it it's probably
correct he also wrote a very interesting
article to the British addressed the
British journalists said you ought to
learned something about freedom of the
press okay I don't think either of those
things was never published
no the I was gonna say for the record
obviously ITN and the Guardian would say
that they've been accused of faking
evidence in their foreign but also the
and just before we and you know George
Mumby is somebody who admires you
tremendously in every area so it's just
on this issue he feels you're just on
the wrong side but it'd be you know but
let's let see because obviously we've
got bigger themes and topics here I
might be good idea to bring up the the
lights a little bit had only bigger
things with other themes let's take some
questions from Professor Chomsky I think
we started a few minutes later I'm gonna
give give us some added time gentleman
here had his hand up early if there's a
microphone that we can go there in this
front row and you have somebody with a
microphone or you just want to say you
asked something already standing up
that's very enthusiastic is there a
second microphone that we can get so why
did we get into the person who's already
on his feet yeah we'll take two or three
of time professor Chomsky thank you for
your remarks I report on the environment
and I'm interested in language about the
environment so we have a consistent
narrative in this country about the
notion of limitless growth it this is
almost unchallenged the thought that we
can carry on growing forever a recently
david cameron talked about us being in a
global race and we had to be among the
winners but nobody asked who the losers
would be and when the race would ever
end
i'm just wondering in this case whether
it's a question of manufactured consent
or just the lack of a good alternative
well I think I'm gonna take two or three
at a time so I'll bring the question
about an exemplary question from our
colleague from the BBC but we need them
to be shorter than that if we're going
to get through lots so not brevity from
you if you can yeah hello professor
Chomsky thank you very much for being
here enjoy your work yeah we're gonna
have to my question is a little bit more
specific about exploitation of the third
world like say I'm not too sure how many
people in the room has an iPhone or like
say night trainers which I'm wearing so
um
my question basically is shall we just
improve the working standard of like say
you know kids who are making our iPhones
and shoes in China or in various other
countries for us to basically keep
checking our Facebook all right
oh she reaches for well oh i throws away
and and yeah good thank you I got that
and I'll repeat it back to the professor
when we're here if we got the microphone
for this questioner here and maybe we'll
get one more in and we'll do lots of
rounds so don't worry yeah what are your
thoughts about the rise of Chinese power
on the world stage please thank you good
and you were about to begin on that and
I sort of prevented you and why don't we
just tack on one more since the
microphones there yeah hi No thank you
very much for coming I wanted to ask you
a question earlier I think you referred
to comparison between the internet
between the Internet and libraries but I
was just thinking to myself as she was
saying that isn't the comparison a
little bit closer they alternated better
a little bit closer to the development
of the printing press and isn't the
nature of improvement of things to
become more valid information helped by
that because people will then start
speaking to each other communicating
scientific articles and stuff which will
drive up developments you've written
some really interesting stuff but it's
become more interesting over time
because people have said it's rubbish or
it's only partly right or whatever and
you've had to adapt to that and develop
them and in the libraries that become
full of much more valid thank you good I
I'm going to didn't why we're gonna have
other rounds and I will come back to you
so
do that so we'll do why don't we just go
with that last question the questioner
said that you had in some way said that
the internet was not such a profound
change that the library was a much
bigger change and he was saying actually
that maybe this is akin more to the
printing press the invention of the
printing press and that actually would
improve quality of ideas and debates
because people were share and exchange
ideas globally in a way they couldn't do
before
well the printing press was a huge
change I mean it Dwarfs anything we're
talking about the libraries were a major
change the internet from this point of
view is a small change and has mixed
effects as I mentioned that there's no
quality control peer review which is
okay people should be able to say
anything they want but it makes it much
less useful than say a library as a
source of information
now the interchange of ideas is fine but
you know we had I'm it takes a
interchange of ideas between Britain and
the United States two countries they
were pretty close the biggest change in
that kind of interchange that came when
sailing ships were replaced by
steamboats or by the Telegraph it meant
in Smith's 19th century instead of
waiting several months to get an answer
to a letter
The Telegraph you get it instantly
steamboats pretty much and now it's
faster but it's if you think about it in
terms of increments it's not huge it's
not as much as the others and so a
that's true of many other things so to
say the invention of indoor plumbing had
a much bigger effect on health standards
than modern medicine it's all these
things are fine you know but we
shouldn't exaggerate Google get to the
back of the queue behind the toilet
it's basically the argument but the I
think that covers the ground that you
and that you'd also spoken about earlier
I wanted to push on the next point
because I cut you off you were about
this China and us decline thesis the
question are asked about the rise of
China and what you think about that and
particularly relevant to pop propaganda
is very common to talk about us decline
in fact we read the main foreign policy
journalist is one of the main topics is
America over America decline well first
of all we should put that in perspective
the peak of American power was in 1945
at that point the u.s. totally dominated
the world it had half the world's wealth
it gained a lot during the Second World
War industrial production quadrupled
every possible competitor was devastated
and destroyed the security situation was
incomparable it was just enormous power
and American planners understood it and
they laid plans to how to run the world
and go through it it's quite
sophisticated and interesting well that
started declined within four years one
of the plans was that the US would
control all of Asia that's why other
countries were not permitted to
participate in the San Francisco peace
treaty the Japan peace treaty and most
of the Asian countries refused to
participate except so on and I think you
know a lot of British colonies at the
time because the u.s. insisted that the
only Japanese crimes should be from 1941
on and they had already fought ten years
of war under Japanese Imperialism those
are the worst crimes but the whole thing
again China okay let's talk about China
that was 1949 that was 45 in 1949 a very
significant event occurred it's called
the loss of China the China China was
supposed to be a part of the American
Empire
and this event that they're trying to
move the independence actually the
phrase is interesting like I can't lose
your computers right
I could lose my computer but the loss of
China means we own it obviously in fact
we own the world and we lost it and then
one of the big issues in American
domestic politics ever since then is
who's responsible for the loss of China
you know well nobody even questions that
it's a good example of how good
propaganda really works it presupposes
that we own the world menu discuss
things within that assumption and it
goes on like that the loss of Indochina
you know on loss of the Middle East and
so on so that was a and ever see and you
know the decline continued the world's
got more complicated now let's talk
about China China as the last had a
spectacular growth rate it's a very poor
country you take a look at the Human
Development Index you and last time I
looked at it was 90th all the Western
countries are way up on top it's it's
got enormous internal problems
ecological problems
it's got a very militant labor movement
you know thousands tens of thousands of
labor actions every year protesting the
repression it's a major exporter
manufacturing exporter but take a close
look it's mostly an assembly plant so if
you buy a you know an iPad or one of
those things it's assembled in China and
it's called a Chinese export but the
value-added in China is very slight it
almost all comes from the surrounding
industrial countries in Japan Taiwan
South Korea and the West and you know
slowly China will move up the technology
ladder and some domains they've actually
done it so you so you're sounding a
skeptical made there about this rise of
China it's real but you've been a critic
all your working life of American
Imperial
and American domination if and you know
it's obviously from what you decide a
big if but if China does eventually
overtake would it be better to live in a
China dominated world than it's been to
live in a US dominated world and it's
like asking about a Martian dominated
world is so remote from reality there's
not much point thinking about it
do you you've obviously been a critic of
US imperialism and so I'm just imagining
a world without US imperialism there is
that Martian does that ever happen I
don't think it's in the court I mean us
decline has continued the word world
power is much more diverse now than it
was in the past in fact the biggest part
of American decline was quite striking
is what they call the loss of Latin
America I mean Latin America was
supposed to be in the back pocket
that's the backyard they do whatever we
say now a Latin America has become
remarkably independent the fact there
was a case a couple of weeks ago which I
think maybe it was coverage here I
didn't see it it was what happened was
reported but not its meaning there was a
study that came out by the Open Society
Institute of called globalizing torture
of rendition which is a terrible crime
and it studied the countries that
participated in the u.s. global torture
campaign well included most of Europe
included england included sweden and so
on included the middle east because
that's where the people were sent to be
tortured by the dictatorships included
Asia and included Africa one continent
was totally missing not a single Latin
American country was willing to
participate and this is doubly
significant for one thing that was
always as I said the backyard they did
what we said and furthermore as long as
the US ran it it was the torture capital
of the world
that's just 15 years ago 10 15 years ago
and now it told totally free it's
interesting the way that's interpreted
in the
so there's an article coming out and
foreign affairs
you know the main establishment journal
by that one of the Michael shifter was
leading specialists on Latin America and
he describes how up till 20 years ago
everything was going wonderfully in
Latin America countries were modernizing
they accept that the Washington
Consensus in fact they were getting
ruined but forget about that in fact
they were revolting against it so
everything was going great they were
moving towards democracy and markets and
under the benign influence of the United
States and then something bad happened
an evil demon appeared Hugo Chavez and
he destroyed everything because of him
Latin America is going off in this crazy
direction they don't even part he didn't
say this but they don't participate in
globalizing torture and so on
no Travis is regarded as an evil demon
in the Western press in fact the
coverage of Chavez is astonishing
it's I was plenty to criticize not
criticized it but he is the treatment of
his is like I don't want Hitler or
something like that it's to the extent
that the the the ceremony at the you
know the funeral if you read the
American press it says what a terrible
guy is the funeral Hammad no judge I
want to get to that what actually
happened is that every country in the
Western Hemisphere except the US and
Canada sent the president most of the
declared days of mourning that's and
Lula wrote a very supportive comment on
him this is all the right-wing
presidents injera
Santos and others the u.s. sent a
delegation in which the leading member
was a nice guy he's a former congressman
the former congressman and health
representatives who was kind of involved
in Latin
America that's the US delegation the
dictator you know there all of our
clients and presidents and declared days
of the morning but try to find something
about this let's just get you on these
two questions which I'm going to link
the first one was about limitless growth
and the the idea that that despite the
impact that is going to have on the
climate and on the environment has that
too is that too an example of
manufactured consent and I think it
links a little bit with this point about
our desire for and this is the question
I think you didn't quite hear but the
desire for iPhones and Nike trainers
it's at remains that we are exploiting
labor in China and other places and I
think the question was asking advice
really what should we do should we
demand improved standards or should we
just stop buying those kind of goods but
they're both questions that relate to
thing to this global pursuit of growth
and what your first question about the
environment is probably the most
important question there is I mean the
human species has come to a point where
it can and probably will destroy the
possibility for a decent survival and
it's not that remote
you know our grandchildren and it's
pretty sort of pretty severe there's
overwhelming consensus of scientists the
consensus has consistently turned out to
be too conservative it's worse than they
predicted you can read the science
journals every week there's some new
story about it and the effects are quite
interesting
most of them there's one out of 110
relevant countries there's one that has
no national program for the environment
and has no program for a renewable
energy national program the United
States the manufacturing center is
extremely interesting it if you look at
the public opinion in the United States
there's a huge propaganda campaign in
the United States quite open
incidentally
the Chamber of Commerce business lobby
petroleum industry and so have announced
that they're running a campaign huge
campaign to convince Americans that it's
all nonsense that humans don't really do
with it it's not happening anyway and so
on and it's had a slight effect
Americans tend to be somewhat more
skeptical of global warming and its
consequences than other countries but
not a huge effect the American
population is much closer to the
scientific consensus than the media and
policy and that's quite interesting and
it's led to there's a new campaign
that's just underway by an organization
called the Alec the American Legislative
Exchange Council it's a corporate Lobby
heavily funded by corporations and coach
brothers and all those nice guys
what they do is write legislation for
state legislatures to try to get state
legislators to accept legislation and
there they've got a lot of clout so they
get a lot of them in and you can imagine
what they're about they just start a new
one which is quite interesting from the
point of view of propaganda they're
concerned about the fact that the
American population is paying too much
attention to the scientific consensus so
what the new program is designed to do
in the States and a couple of states
have already adopted it is to introduce
what they call balanced teaching in the
K to 12 you know kindergarten to 12th
grade educational system a balanced
teaching means that along with teaching
the overwhelming consensus of scientists
what every National Academy says what
all the science journal says along that
with that you teach climate change
denial and that's valence teaching and
it's in the interests of critical
education you know getting children to
be critical and so on
you know well that's it shows the
desperation of the corporate propaganda
system in its failure to drive the
population totally off the international
spectrum I mean the public opinion as I
mentioned doesn't affect policy much so
the United States has no policies in
disrespect but few but do you want to
get more people in do you have an answer
to the to the man who's asking about
iPhones and things the require exploited
labor or underpaid labor child labor
even I mean if you eat your dinner you
know a lot of it is coming from super
exploited farmworkers under horrible
conditions and you can't look at
anything in a capitalist system which
doesn't involve extensive exploitation
whether we should have iPhones or not I
mean I don't have one but if people like
them ok nothing wrong with it however
the endless growth is a problem the
edges great because and in fact it's
quite interesting here's another thing
which is not being discussed and should
be if there's ever a historian century
from now there may not be but if if we
don't succeed in destroying civilization
which we're trying hard to do and there
are historians around and they look back
at what's happening now they'll be
astonished I mean the evidence for the
climate problem serious problem maybe
catastrophe is overwhelming now there
are various reactions to it at one
extreme there are groups that are trying
to do something about it
they take a look they're mostly
indigenous societies the uncivilized
part of the world the Canadian First
Nations the you know Australian
Aboriginals
in Latin America it's quite striking
because there's a substantial indigenous
population there they didn't wipe them
all out the way the English colonists
did
more efficient but so there's a pretty
big indigenous population and the
countries that have a strong indigenous
population their way in the lead and
doing something about it the most
interesting cases Ecuador under the
pressure it's an oil exporter but under
the pressure of the indigenous
communities Ecuador is the only oil
exporter in the world that's trying to
keep the oil in the ground they're
asking the European Union for aid to
help them not lift the oil keeping the
ground where Otto me I'm sure they're
not going to get the aid but at least
they're trying and we go to the richest
countries the United States and Canada
they are hell-bent on trying to make the
crisis as bad as possible you know very
enthusiastic about finding every
imaginable way to use fossil fuels and
let's go to disaster as quickly as
possible well that's you know that's
what's happening in the world there are
things to say about this but try to find
them thank you let's just take around
here we've got about 13 or 14 minutes
left before we run out so brief
questions and we'll try and get brief
answers to that's who's got the
microphone at the moment okay you go
first and we'll get the microphone down
and then we're gonna go to you yeah do
you see the potential for
anarcho-syndicalism to flourish once
more as it did in Spain during the 1930s
for what I dunno sorry
anarcho-syndicalism to flourish once
more as it did in Spain in the 1930s if
so where okay and that may be up your
street and that's I mean yeah how would
you explain decline of popular
participation in formal political
processes in the West I'm talking about
lower voice turnouts decline in party
membership and so on how would you
explain that
thank you yeah I got this yet and
somebody should have the microphone
there now yes
given today's theme and professor of
Chomsky's association with MIT I wonder
if he has any thoughts about the suicide
of Aaron Schwartz ah okay
can you four people here just give us a
in a sentence that's what the Aaron
Schwartz story is because I've read
you summarizer than I do
access to information and then what did
you just say in a sense who he was what
happened did Aaron Schwartz was an
information activist in the United
States who was targeted by the United
States government for downloading
excessively on mi t--'s campus journals
from JSTOR and what happened to him he
killed himself
thank you that's why I wanted you to
tell the story that's it rather than me
okay and question of two parts it was
discussed how the media has massively
narrowed in breadth between the 19th
century and the president do you see
this as part of a wider trend of reduced
political innovation as a result of
corporate propaganda and then part two
is if so how is it possible to subvert
this trend okay good
and since we this may well be our last
it'll go round will squeeze in a couple
more and I'll try and sort of bunched
them together
so gentlemen Ayers got his hand up we've
managed to get through the whole evening
not talking about the Middle East could
we have a quick Bracy we were doing so
well as well
here we are if you dismiss the internet
as a forum how does a disempowered
individual counterbalance the onslaught
of mainstream propaganda thank you and
last one for me yes hey talking about
the well I mean nowadays for example we
don't have the helmet to deal with this
dissidents but I wonder if you could
give us a contemporary example of how
for example with the using of propaganda
dissidents get silenced an example of
how dissidents against son get silenced
yeah we're against or propaganda rather
than of having in fact perhaps a
personal example yeah okay well let's
see if we can I can think there's a
couple there that pulled together
well the question that came in two parts
was talking about the second part of it
was how is it possible to get round this
narrowing that happens with the
corporate influence over the media
it's
cetera and there was a similarly one
were saying if you are not that
impressed by the internet what then can
an individual do to somehow circumvent
to get round this trend that you've been
describing so I'm putting those two
questions together I'm impressed by the
internet thing actually I was it was
developed in the lab where I was working
in the 1950s and 60s remember that most
of the high tech culture comes out of
the state sector it was we don't have a
capitalist system we have a state sector
which is dynamic that's where the
creative inventive work that goes on the
whole IT revolution including the
internet and computers and the rest of
it most of it was developed in the state
sector places like MIT in fact a very
building lab where I was working in the
50s and 60s that's where the serious
work was done thirty years later roughly
it was handed over to private enterprise
so that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs could
become rich adapting the work that had
been done to commercial uses that's what
we call capitalism one of the many
respects so it's and I appreciate it I
think it's very good in fact I had
personal appreciation my daughter and
who lived in Nicaragua during the
sandanista period and the United States
was basically a war with Nicaragua and
there was no way to communicate no mail
service nothing however there was the
predecessor of the internet the ARPANET
which was a military system and I'm on
it just I'm at MIT so I'm on it and she
managed to get on it so thanks to the
Pentagon we were able to communicate
during the US war against Nicaragua I
like that
but I use it all the time you know I
look things up I find things what can we
do we we've it's better than libraries
if you know what you're looking for you
know
worse if you don't know and that's fine
and we have if we want if we went
through the hard work you can find
access to all sorts of things like in
the United States substantially in
England to a lesser extent the country
is free enough so that you have access a
very rich access to internal records
that's invaluable I mean a lot of lift
just been saying comes out of internal
records we keep emerging people to use
non corporate owned media I mean
representative the BBC over there The
Guardian is not it has an unusual not
conventional corporate structure I mean
would you say that some of those are
ways to get States useful I mean like I
read the Guardian I really independent
but now the fact of the matter is that
if I had one newspaper or stuck with one
newspaper I'd read the New York Times
because the coverage is so much broader
and deeper wouldn't I come to England I
I have to buy five newspapers every
morning and you get put them together
you get a lot of things on a lot of junk
you know I'm an immense amount of junk
but a lot of interesting things but you
stay with the New Times even though your
book is so critical of the New York
Times damning of the New York Times it
as I said it's a it's a it's a selective
criticism what reporters report is
usually quite accurate even though
distorted in many ways first of all what
they don't report which is just being
part of an intellectual community that
it's so subservient to power you can't
look at it and an editorial discretion
and other things but it's a very good
source I read it every morning the
business press is very accurate and very
reliable the Wall Street the Financial
Times is I think very good newspaper The
Wall Street Journal was American
counterpart is so right-wing that when
you read the editorials you know
laugh or cry on the other hand the news
reporting is quite good and often
exposes a corporate crime and things
like that I think the reason is that
that's generally true the business press
Business Week and others a couple of
differences between the business press
and the general press for one thing the
business press trusts its audience and
another thing is its audience
are the guys who run the world they
better have a pretty fair picture of
what's actually going on in the world
there's a lot of other ways do things
yes we're not short of information so
we're gonna try not to do this short as
we can because it goes like that there's
a question there about what's your take
to explain decline in party membership
and in voter turnout in democratic
countries around the world there is a
mark trend in that direction what is
very striking trend and it's only if you
I think it's a reflection of the fact
that democracy is collapsing so people
don't bother participating so take the
United States where it's been closely
studied I don't know if it's studied
that much here but one of the main
topics in professional political science
is studying attitudes and you can do it
very well in the United States as
extensive polls you know a lot of them
are pretty accurate and we'll
constructed so you find out a lot about
attitudes you can then look at policy
because that's right in front of your
eyes
and you can compare attitudes and policy
furthermore a lot of the polls are
stratified so you learn you know what
the rich want and what the poor won that
when you put all this material together
I won't go through the details it turns
out an effect that about 70 percent of
the population is almost totally
disenfranchised that doesn't matter what
they think the political class pays no
attention to them so they wonder they
don't taking power why bother going to
the voting booth
and as you move up the income scale you
get more and more influence that top we
essentially get everything you want and
you can see it in the big issues right
at this moment so if take a look at
American domestic politics the big issue
is the deficit you know the sequester is
you know practically closing down the
government we gotta do something about
the deficit who cares about the deficit
not the population population doesn't
think the deficit is a big issue they
think the big issue is lack of jobs not
the business press the business press
thinks the deficit isn't a big problem
that we should stimulate the economy
which you do with a bigger deficit so it
should be bigger not smaller the people
who don't like the deficit are the
wealthy and the banks other financial
institutions
I mean over the past 40 years the
financial institutions are mostly a
drain on the economy I think they have
become so powerful that they very
largely dominated what goes on in the
political system and if you look at
their just came a study but two good
political scientists looking at
comparing wealth with attitude toward
the deficit in a very close correlation
the richer you are the more you compare
to care about the deficit the financial
institutions care about it so therefore
that's the issue doesn't matter what the
public wants and for reasons like this
and you can see it in polls when people
are asked in polls in the united states
does congress represent the population
the figures run single digits maybe 10
percent some people you have no faith in
it they doesn't have anything with us
in fact one very dramatic illustration
which nobody ever talks about what you
should think about is attitude toward
taxes in the United States on April 15th
you pay your taxes in a functioning
Democratic Society
that would be a day of celebration we're
getting together to fund the projects
that we decided on
in the united states a day of mourning
and alien forces descending on us steal
our money there's nothing there with us
in fact attitude thirds taxes is a
pretty good index of the extent to which
a democracy's functioning and you can
look at it and see yourself so I think
it's reasonable and natural for people
to stop participating the I'm gonna put
together two other questions there will
some somebody asked can you give an
example of a sort of dissenter who is
pushed aside by the system and the
example of Aaron Schwartz in your own
University MIT it doesn't have to be a
long answer on this one because we've
got two more things I want to get in but
well did you have a response on that on
Eric well it's not on dissent it's I
mean the number of dissenters were
pushed aside it's almost universal and
going them either they're in jail or if
it's Latin America they get their heads
below in the United States up in the
United States they're marginalized in
various ways the United States free
country you can't do in the United
States what was done to LM in England
it's not that oppressive of society and
there's more protection for freedom of
speech but they're essentially they
can't get jobs that marginalized the
vilified all sorts things not much
punishment frankly but it's real the
Irish horse is different case at a very
interesting one I know it was reported
here but Aaron Schwartz was a very
bright young kid hacker very didn't very
interesting work on computers and he was
part of the hacking community which is
in favor of opening up false or sources
and the way he went about it was he
broke into the MIT computer system and
what they called liberated JSTOR JSTOR
for those of you know is a
it's a it collects it takes articles and
professional journals and libraries or
individuals they can do it subscribe to
it and then you can get internet access
to articles coming out in journals so
Erin isn't that very nice kid on he
committed suicide what what happened is
he he broke into the MIT system he freed
up JSTOR JSTOR the cold for pressed MIT
to do something about him he was
stealing their stuff so they called the
police they know who it was they
identified him then the federal
prosecutor got involved by the state
prosecutor and proposed a ridiculous
sentence should have been a misdemeanor
or something but she said you know I'm
gonna go to jail for forty years or so
he committed suicide actually there was
a plea bargain offered that he should
agree to jail sentence for a couple of
months and no the oh but they the family
didn't want that they committed suicide
you know it's it's it's a terrible event
I mean everyone involved should have
pressed the prosecutors not to do
anything however there's another issue
which ought to be thought about that has
to do with a freedom of information if
you take JSTOR and make it public the
JSTOR goes out of business we live in a
capitalist society they can't survive if
they don't get subscriptions if JSTOR
goes out of business nobody has access
to the journals so the next step is okay
let's liberate the journals in that case
the journals go out of business and
nobody is anywhere to publish that's you
can't just liberate things pretending
you don't exist in the world a lot of
young kids think you can do that they're
not thinking it through well there are
ways around this but the ways around it
involve collective act
of the kind that doesn't fit with the
new spirit of the age and what ought to
happen is that there ought to be a
public subsidy for creative work okay
then there wouldn't be any copyrights
there wouldn't be patents the huge
saving incredible savings and everything
would be open but that requires doing
something together and we're not allowed
to do that we have to be asked out for
ourselves you know very last thing is
I'm gonna give you a choice
since we've been talking about freedom
partly you can either take the question
about anarcho-syndicalism and where it
might pop up in the world you have
described yourself in some places as a
man I kiss or with amicus leanings so
where money come or you can mmm give us
a pricey of your views in the Middle
East when we are already nine minutes
overtime so the choice is entirely yours
well first about anarchism I think
there's a there's a simple inadequate
but simple answer if you take a look at
what anarchism is meant over the
centuries
it varies all over the place is a very
broad range but there's one theme that
runs through it and I think it's an
important one and I think recognizing it
everyone ought to be an anarchist the
theme is that hierarchy domination
control are not self justifying they
require a justification and that's true
whether it's a patriarchal family or
international society or anything in
between now if they can't give the just
the burden of proof is on those who
exercise authority if they can't give a
justification which is almost always
then the system ought to be dismantled
in my view that's mannerism then there's
a lot of variants and I think it's a
very powerful notion a lot more to say
about it of course on the Middle East
that depends what you're talking about
I mean if you take a look at it well
it's just for simplicity let's take us
politics the most important country in
the world if you look at the
presidential debate on foreign policy or
you look at the truck Hegel hearing on
defense there were two names that came
up far more than anything else in the
world Israel and Iran Israel because
other countries are kind of mentioned
but marginally Israel because both
candidates had to show that they sort of
vied for who loved it and worshiped it
more Iran because it's the gravest
threat to world peace so those are the
two that were discussed and interesting
question is what though there are a lot
of questions about why what the US is a
real relationship is that would be too
long to discuss but the Iran one is
quite interesting very interesting and
what's particularly interesting it's not
getting reported and the United States
have checked not at all you can tell me
whether it's reported here let's say
Iran is the greatest threat to world
peace okay
you could argue about it but let's
assume that it's true what's the threat
the threat is that they might be
developing a nuclear capability which
plenty of countries have okay so let's
say that's not weapons but capability so
what do you do let's grant that it's a
threat I might mention incidentally that
that's a Western obsession outside of
the United States England and a couple
of European countries it's not regarded
as much of a threat non-line countries
don't think so the Arab world doesn't
think so it's a it's a Western obsession
but let's accept that since we're here
what do you do about the threat well
there's a number of possibilities
there's some technical proposals that
could be pursued one of them in fact was
implemented until it was blocked by the
West in May 2010 Turkey and Brazil that
made a deal with Iran and which Iran
would ship its low enriched uranium for
storage to Turkey and in return the
nuclear powers would provide Iran with
the isotopes that it needs for its
medical reactor
okay that would end the end the alleged
threat what happened when they reached
the deal as soon as they made the deal
and ended the gravest threat the World
Peace the Obama administration and the
media thrilling behind as always
bitterly condemned Turkey and Brazil for
breaking ranks and Obama went off to the
UN and tried to get harsher sanctions
well the Brazilian foreign minister was
a bit annoyed with this and he released
a letter in which it's from Obama to
president Lula president Brazil in which
Obama had proposed this probably
assuming that Iran would reject it you
win some propaganda points then Iran
except that it so you kill it
it was that a story here okay well
that's what happened but it's not in
doubt there's something much more
interesting there's a much broader
approach to the question moved to
establish a nuclear weapons free zone in
the region there's overwhelming
international support for that an online
movement to the Arab states Egypt's been
pressing it hard for twenty years
there's so much international support
that the Obama administration's
predecessors have been compelled to give
kind of verbal assent it would be a nice
idea but not now and don't bother us the
it's possible to implement the last
December there was supposed to be an
international conference in Finland
under UN auspices to carry this idea
forward Iran agreed to attend in early
November within days Obama canceled the
conference well it says more but I'll
stop there you know this ought to be
front-page headlines in the United
States not a word here probably the same
well this is not a case of reporters
distorting the facts
it's reporters being so obedient as part
of the intellectual culture like other
intellectuals not reported either so
subservient the state corporate power
that you just don't report things like
that
you don't look even and of course we
know the reason the basic reason is the
United States does not want to allow
Israel's hundreds of nuclear weapons
that to be either inspected or even
discussed well okay that's a serious
question I might say that the US
strategic analysts many of them
disagreed so the former head of the
Strategic Command you know that which
controls nuclear weapons policy is a it
was headed you'll develop one of the
founders of the whole deterrence theory
and so on he he said he said it is
dangerous in the extreme for in the
cauldron of animosities that we call the
Middle East for one country meaning
Israel to have hundreds of nuclear
weapons which encourages others to
develop them well that's pretty
important try to find that I mean I've
quoted a couple other people but and
he's correct
it is dangerous in the extreme but that
doesn't fit the paradigm so it's not
discussed and as I said before I don't
think that our institutional analysis
really accounts for this because as a
it's over the whole intellectual
community and the institutional analysis
doesn't apply there I'm glad to hear
it's not just journalists who are in
your sights but it's a larger and deeper
problem you've explored it and expanded
it with such clarity I knew the people
here would probably have stayed for
another hour and a half gladly to hear
more review the exhibition propaganda
power and persuasion opens here at the
British Library 17th of May and runs
till the 17th of September it only
remains for all of you to join me in
thanking professor Noam Chomsky
