applaud compadre 
good good night again 
in these meetings in a half-crazed plinth this one that does not lower the heat or 
speed is a pleasure to have you with us 
as a reference to libertarian critical thinking 
Thank you very much for being in Mexico again 
has he receives images from the public jose ramon if he receives images from the public 
okay 
I think the first thing we could say is that 
that the profound changes that have occurred in Mexico are somehow 
reestablishes the connection with the us and I don't mean the formal connections with the 
trump usa i mean real country to country connections 
ever jokingly said what 
I said some places in the US had to be bombarded with your books and 
rita hayworth movies when she takes off her glove 
the pan the globe and the famous field [Music]

our message must not be reaching 
if we wanted to ask you about everything 
How do you see the perspective of Mexico-United States relations from 
down right now

what Chomsky says is that this question refers to him makes him remember some 
occasion in which he taught at the University of Arizona a course in 
radical political philosophy and then they began to have contact with the 
University of Hermosillo which is very close to the University of Arizona 
[Music] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
and then [Music] 
there are many ways to connect there are the real ways while i was giving 
This course in Arizona Chomsky found a way to invite students from the 
University of Hermosillo so that they could visit them on that side of the border and 
at the same time that this visit was reciprocal of seeing students visiting 
also the university of hermosillo and some some connection mechanisms 
between peoples are real are materials like this like this example but that 
there are also many other symbolic ways through which 
North American peoples of the American and the Mexican can 
may have contact that even this same event that we are carrying out in 
this moment and through which, thanks to which we are being able to 
knowing chomsky's library because he is from his home is a way too 
through which the peoples are getting closer since we are people 
real 
if not 
the necessary relationship between two peoples that are separated by a meter of 
border 
would necessarily pose a connection from below in terms of the problems 
common we have because suddenly we think 
like Latin Americans who suffer from the presence of the United States 
from Latin American 
but at the same time and the injustices suffered by the American people 
This is a historic moment although it is not very clear who can help 
who

says that one of the examples in which the problematic 
that you live day by day or you live day by day the peoples saw the night of 
yesterday well with the battles so strong with the violence so strong that it was lived 
in Culiacan between the drug cartels and the Mexican state itself 
battles same violent events that would not happen were it not for the 
the United States there is a huge consumption of drugs that remain illegal and that if not 
the illegality or that amount of consumption existed from outside because drug traffickers do not 
they would have the power they have

[Music] 
45 years ago 
[Music] 4 or 5 years ago there was a meeting one 
summit of all of all america of all not only north america but also 
in Central and South America and there were aptas and I don't remember Jones that it was in 
Cartagena Colombia and there were two things in which you can never reach a 
The first agreement was the admission of Cuba once again to the economy of 
Latin America so that it could also trade and the US did not vote in favor and 
Canada vote in the same direction to support the United States and the other 
situation in which they could not reach a new account agreement with 
the same procedure due to the refusal of the United States and the endorsement and with the endorsement of 
Canada was the decriminalization of drugs and this has to be understood 
the decriminalization of drug use no that does not mean in a way 
immediate legalization of drugs but at least the decriminalization of 
drug use, the US did not want to and this has been a suffering 
effects have continued to be felt by the two peoples 
the usa which has a huge amount of consumption and therefore also a 
huge number of people who are considered criminals for consuming 
drugs and on the other hand Mexico, which being a producer and exporter to the 
America is falling apart due to the violence generated by the 
criminalization of drugs 
In Mexico it is very common to say poor Mexico so far from God and so close to 
The USA phase that is attributed to many characters including Porfirio Diaz 
I would like to reverse the phrase 
I would like to reverse the phrase that is to say poor of the us so close to 
Mexico and so far from the best of its history 
I don't tell you this because because I couldn't think I couldn't think of me 
same in 200 references of culture 
American who have formed me 
from from the best novels of chandler hammett 
raymond chandler and dashiell hammett up hardware books' fast up 
your first arguments against the vietnam war 
and I can spend hours saying plays movies songs yes that would be 
of me without blowing in the wind and no 
where to where I want to take you to the idea that the only real bridge to 
from which we can create a new relationship with the us is culture 
also control 
[Music] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
[Music] 
Well, if indeed he can notice it at the University of Tucson in Arizona 
which is in new classes at least half of the student population are 
Mexicans not only in the university but throughout the entire southern strip 
of the border between the us and mexico because there is a huge amount of population 
Mexican Mexican music has also greatly influenced music 
North America in those same regions and but beyond that beyond this 
mutual influence that both peoples have culturally speaking from the 
creation of our Chomsky popular culture also observes the enormous 
concern that the two peoples have in reference to the conflicts that 
exist because of the militarization of the border militarization that began to 
occur in a more intense way with the administration of bill clinton but that 
started from the time of the signature here I have known as the tlc I do not know 
began to militarize the border and that has reached its maximum expression with 
this government of trump chomsky considers that a fate should be established 
in agreement similar to that of the countries of the European Union in that 
Well, they also have their free trade agreement, finally that is what 
the european union is where there is not only transit of goods and capital 
but there is also free transit of people and that is the point at which 
We would have to reach the United States and Mexico where the borders 
still exist geographically and politically but that people already 
could move freely between those two countries without so much 
protocol no 
have been a permanent political analyst for the last 50 years or 40 years 
good news donald trump stay or go 
[Laughs] 
[Music] 
[Music] three hands 
[Music] 
Oh no 
yes luck of the organization 
[Music] and well we are considers that it is known that 
There are several various statistical models thanks to which one can with a 
more or a greater or lesser closeness to predict what will be the result of 
elections and one of those models has to do with investigating what is the 
perception that the people have about the state of the economy this does not want 
say the real state that the economies keep but the perception they have 
people regarding their country's economy and that these studies indicate that 
the American people consider the economy to be good enough 
and if that perception is maintained, there is a high probability that Trump will win 
elections unless something unexpected happened 
within which could be some that people begin to take more 
importance to certain policies and certain decisions that trump makes 
with respect to other topics within which probably the most 
terrifying and the most troublesome from Chomsky's perspective whether 
your statements and your attitude towards climate change climate change 
that trump denies and in fact not only trump but the entire republican party and that and 
that if concrete actions are not taken, Chomsky considers that the 
humanity only a few years before the 
true atrocities of this climate change

and not only that, but even though most of the countries in the world are already 
doing something to change their extractive policies and change their policies 
Regarding the exploitation of the environment, it seems that the United States is the 
the only country in the world where this has not changed and is not being carried out and 
continue to extract using natural resources in a way 
indiscriminate this is going to affect, in general terms, the whole world of 
a lethal way in a lethal way changing the natural relationships of 
unimaginable ways 
This would directly affect Mexico, particularly it could be noted in the 
gulf of mexico where if oil is exploited as it has been proposed that 
exploit people and animals the ecosystem could die poisoned by 
time that in case the poles will actually end up melting for 
global warming there would be many areas that will end up being unavoidable 
the same gulf would overflow and that can already be seen in some other latitudes 
the world effects of climate change chomsky shares that in india 
this past summer temperatures exceeded 50 degrees were reached 
where people then had to protect themselves from and sleep in the open 
because it was absolutely impossible to stay inside the houses during 
night by the amount of heat they absorbed and she at and at the same time in 
Japan we could see this in images on the news and on the internet 
just a few weeks ago there was a cyclone 
because of a force also unusual despite being an industrial country and being 
a technologically developed country are not exempt from suffering the force of 
nature and well that

and there is more 
[Music] 
[Music] 
Well then, four more years of trump in environmental terms 
could be the difference between still having chances to survive as 
kind or of probably succumbing this hard the facts and that is why it is only 
the first of the two great problems that Chomsky observes in case of 
Trump to continue in power and the next problem is the reopening of the 
huge risk posed by a nuclear war worldwide 
Chomsky shares that Trump has just recently annulled a treaty that 
had been signed by Gorbachev and Reagan since the 1980s for the 
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and that it breaks just annulled that agreement and 
not only that but another one that prohibited countries from developing technology 
nuclear nuclear weapons that could be fired executed from space and 
then with these two missing treaties it seems that he is 
is inviting Russia to enter a new nuclear arms race that 
could endanger all of humanity particularly these 
next four years maybe i could ask a question 
after 
He states that he is still in the first four years of the government 
American presidents tend to be less belligerent to unleash on 
the following a tougher policy and thus reelection space 
that happened and records the last American presidencies 
Do you think we would expect a movie in case of Trump re-election 
even more belligerent more regressive politics 
no

and nothing 
on mondays where 
Well, in front of Trump, what we have is a single president of the state of the 
The US has never had a previous president who said that he is the chosen one 
the sous en one while stretching the arms with the palms facing the 
sky and himself looking up at the sky and that there had never been a 
secretary of state who would be the equivalent of our secretary of 
government that says our president was sent by god to protect the 
people of israel from the iranis then we are in one we are in one dimension 
completely different awareness of a supposed historical role that he has 
as president in the us at the same time even though trump has said that 
has withdrawn troops from the Middle East as announced when withdrawing troops from 
Syrian and Afghan troops but on the other side is sending new 
Troops have just sent two thousand elements 2.000 troops to Saudi Arabia with the 
intention that the war that country is carrying 
carried out against Yemen and that is leaving that country destroyed, I mean Yemen and 
returning to europe these this treaty that trump abolished between gorbachev and 
Reagan had to do with the proliferation of short-term missiles. 
achieve this means constantly the anato or the organization of the 
treaty of the north atlantic and the countries of europe were constantly 
threatening each other with short-range ballistic missiles however 
once reagan and trump sorry reagan and that cork signing this 
treaty withdrew the missiles that were threatening each other there are 
since the abolition of this treaty by trump has put everything 
along the border between western europe and russia new missiles 
threatening it 
a war could break out at any moment

[Music] 
[Music] 
Well, and to complete the question I asked him, he says well, you propose that the 
better trump will not have anything to worry about because in his second 
candidacy as it would be the last and then it would no longer have a third term 
to the presidency but today what would happen if I decided not to release the presidency 
legally in the US if you could apply a third time you do not have legally no 
they have limits they do not do it by tradition but they could run forever if 
so they decided like george washington did it only twice then 
respect that tradition but what if trump decided no no 
leave the presidency and then it will turn out that although he decides to stay 
de facto with the support of a whole series of militias that exist because besides the 
American people is a people that is heavily armed many of the 
which are considered to be identified with ideology of white supremacy and that 
they have a real fear it is not a scam it is not an unfounded fear but there is 
statistics that contemplate that in the coming years 
what today is still the white majority will end is 
became a white minority and under no circumstances consider 
that this is desirable because it would imply what they call it 
to the disappearance of Anglo-Saxon Christian culture while they are 
also strongly and radically Christian and therefore are 
seeing them threatened by cultures by barbaric non-Christian civilizations 
that endanger their own survival and that many of these 
groups are so heavily armed that they even exceed the reaction force 
what the local police have, not the US army, the army 
American would have the ability to subdue them 
but but already when you are in front of such a particular scenario where 
It could be that the peoples who support these discourses of supremacy 
white and who support trump, who is their because their leader took to the streets to 
defend their permanence and the military would have to respond to 
submit to those groups because we are talking about a highly 
chaotic for the us and what and what not if not highly probable 
if there is a possibility that it will happen 
restoration 
after an absolutely discouraging outlook like the one you just 
trace in Mexico at the moment we are living in a climate of relative 
euphoria 
you were about to throw an ice cube on our backs 
let's say we can still tell us tell us how we can help you not relax

at 
well there is not being honest there is not much that the Mexican people can do 
But if there is much that the American people can do and that of 
fact is already being done particularly by generations of 
young people who are organizing to try that through repudiation 
towards the liberal model that has been implemented in the US during the 
last 40 years and the results of which have been appalling 
is and is proliferating the idea for the first time of something that is quite 
new to the American mindset that would be the establishment of 
social democratic policies and not only that but movements that are 
taking to the streets through speeches particularly at this time of 
environmental claims where they have forced the same companies and have 
forced the us congress to have to put it on its legislative agenda 
to discuss the new legislation that must lead to 
carry out the legislative reforms that they have to carry out precisely 
to avoid all these issues of ecological devastation in parallel with 
environmental movements also exist particularly along the 
border between arizona and mexico young people who are organizing to go and 
helping migrants to people who are trying to flee from a 
reality of poverty of suffering where survival conditions 
are extremely difficult towards the US and they have to cross the desert and then 
young people are organizing to help them cross the desert at the time 
that giving them food and on many occasions also shelter 
yes 
I asked him who thinks he could and who thinks he could be a 
option to defeat trump in the next election and in particular to 
by bernie sanders demille 
[Music] 
and 
[Music] 
[Music] 
and 
one 
Thank you 
[Music] 
in the existing thick 
from our side 
God has brought us to our 
[Music] Can't tell yet who will be 
candidate by the Democrats cannot be known yet towards 
where is noam chomsky going to attend the next vote 
particularly the candidate that would be of his predilection would be bernie sanders 
but at the same time bernie is constantly getting attacks from 
media that caricature him that ridicule him that 
they misrepresent all his statements to make him look like an unviable person 
and that perhaps the only person he considers could be a candidate 
democrat would be elizabeth warren, which is that within what is possible is 
better than donald trump because basically anyone else would be 
better than donald trump consider chomsky and then why can't you tell 
still properly what is going to happen, however what can 
to know is that there is some hope because throughout the United States there are 
movements of people who are raising awareness the same tucson their 
city   the city he lives in is arguing over whether he should 
consider whether it owes itself a sanctuary city which 
would mean that all those people who are being persecuted 
by the border patrol and that they had managed to escape could arrive 
to Tucson and there they could not be arrested and then they would receive refuge 
throughout the length and breadth of the city so that I can no longer not live with fear 
of being persecuted and yet you still cannot know what is going to happen 
next year there is however still some hope and would like to 
chomsky close with the following reflection something that the 
people of Mexico to show the North American people how convenient 
is to have a social democratic government progress in such a way that we 
let us set an example for them that our relationships 
better sociopolitical do in such a way that then the Americans 
they will turn what they do to the south and say look what can be done look 
what can be done without having a social democratic government and finally 
well we are on the edge of what will determine the fate of the 
humanity for normal good in the next 20 years he says this has been 
said many times but it had never been true but this time it is true 
what is decided now is what will lead to what will lead to 
short humanity 
no 
Thank you very much it has been a pleasure to have you with us again in the socket of the 
Mexico City 
thank you very much to all 
they also have a chelsea suddenly it's very good gives him the chances and 
the dimension of what a book fair is the book as a vehicle for 
transport ideas debates reflections to transport to this city and 
this moment one of the smartest thinkers on the planet today 
good night thank you very much marina has information
