has been oust as a dictator who doesn't
allow free press if there was a military
coup here say and under your kind
supported it they'd of course be allowed
to publish freely afterwards I could
doubt that the main organization that
the u.s. is supporting sumach they
supported the code openly and the
destruction of democracy but therefore
we support them in the interest of
democracy promotion and if you're
properly educated you don't notice
things like that one of the things
education is for well that's going on
right now
well Central America was pretty much
subdued at least temporarily by
Reaganite tour but the region from
Venezuela Argentina is falling out of
control
and that's quite serious Venezuela is
forging closer relations with China it's
planning to sell increasing amounts of
oil to China that's part of its effort
to diversify export and reduce its
dependence on the openly hostile US
government and in fact Latin America as
a whole is increasing trade and other
relations with China also Europe but
China's more worries into the United
States with very likely expansion that's
in particular true for the raw material
exporters like Brazil and Chile and
China is investing in Latin America
challenging u.s. dominance if you look
at us documents in terms of public
documents China is regarded as the main
potential threat they're not a military
threat type of the major powers it's
been the most restrained in military
expenditures but it is a threat the
threat is it can't be intimidated when
the u.s. shakes its fist at Europe and
tells them to stop investing in Iran the
Europeans obediently pull out China just
moves in they've been there for 3,000
years
don't care much about the barbarians
still don't and they can't be
intimidated which is very frightening
just put yourself in a situation of a
mafic it done and suppose there's
somebody who can't be intimidated that's
scary and International Affairs is
pretty much like the Matthew in Latin
America China's just moving along
elsewhere too you may recall that spring
the Bush administration decided to
insult the president of China he came to
visit Washington and they insulted him
by not allowing him to have a state
dinner only a state lunch the insult he
took it pretty calmly and what he did
was fly off to Saudi Arabia where he
entered into the new trade relations
investment relations and so on with
Saudi Arabia which is the oldest and
most precious US ally in the Middle East
but that's where the mostly the oil is
so fine we won't have a state dinner but
meanwhile we'll take away you're the
jewel in your crown okay fine well going
back to Venezuela it joined the Americas
or the South American economic bloc
which isn't doing much but may someday
that was welcomed by Kirchner President
of Argentina and Lula president Brazil
who's welcomed as opening a new chapter
in our integration the Venezuela also
supplied Argentina with fuel oil to help
stave off an energy crisis and most
important the Venezuela brought about a
third of the Argentine debt that's one
element of a region-wide effort to free
the countries from the controls of the
International Monetary Fund it's after
two decades of disastrous effects of
conformity to its rules the way Kirchner
put it he said the IMF International
Monetary Fund has acted towards our
country
promoter and vehicle of policies that
cause poverty and pain among the
Argentine people so he said when he
announced his decision to pay almost a
trillion dollars in his words to rid
Argentina of IMF forever radically
violating IMF rules Argentina did enjoy
a substantial economic recovery from the
disaster that was left by IMF policies
other countries are going in the same
direction steps towards Latin American
independence advanced further with the
election of Ava Morales in Bolivia last
December a real democratic election of
the kind that didn't take place in the
West it's worth talking about the
election of Rafael Correa and Ecuador a
few days ago is another step a Morales
moved very quickly to reach a series of
energy of course with Venezuela and he
committed himself to reversing the
neoliberal policies that Bolivia had
pursued rigorously for 25 years leaving
the country with lower per capita income
than at the outset well in fact
throughout South America the governments
that are now supported by Washington and
a lead opinion might have been subjected
to us violence and economic punishment
many years ago so it takes a Lula in
Brasil policies aren't all that
different from goulart
in the early 60s but his policies led
the Kennedy administration to instigate
a military coup which was the first
neo-nazi style national security state
and Latin America led to a plate of
repression throughout the continent now
Lula is the great hope this policy is
not dissimilar one of the that's one of
the signs of independence in Latin
America since Lugo is now one of the
good
it was necessary to ignore the fact that
the first thing he did after his
reelection recently first thing he did
was fly to Venezuela to offer his
support to Chavez in the upcoming
election and also put it to promote
regional integration with Chavez by
ignore inaugurating a Brazilian built
bridge across the iron up the river and
overseeing work by Brazil's State oil
companies the indigenous populations are
becoming much more active and
influential many of them want oil and
gas to be and other resources mines and
so on to be domestically controlled or
in some cases they oppose production
altogether some are even calling for an
Indian nation in South America that's
challenging a race class divide racing
class are very closely correlated race
class divide that goes back to the
Spanish conquests the elites that run
the place are white European population
is they call themselves Indians are
black and that's a sharp distinction the
internal economic integration is also
taking place for the first time since
the Spanish conquest and Latin American
elites in the past the way Dale eats
have been linked to the imperial powers
but not to one another and that's
beginning to change what America is now
I think the most exciting part of the
world and there are opportunities for
cooperative development and interchange
which are quite real one step towards
that is the Solidarity movements that
developed in the United States in the
1980s that was something new and
hundreds of years of Western imperialism
no one in France ever thought of going
to live in an Algerian village or no one
here
going to a Vietnamese village to live
with the people to help them and support
them and just to protect them with a
white face but that started in the 80s
on a quite a substantial scale thousands
of people many of them coming from
churches evangelical churches the
internal and that's a mass popular
movement in the United States now all
over the world the internal developments
in much of Latin America as you know are
strongly influenced by mass popular
movements they're coming together in the
global justice movement well just where
all this will lead the weak can say that
there definitely are opportunities now
for real progress towards more freedom
and justice in cooperation across the
hemisphere extending beyond there's a
very welcome prospect and I think to
make use of these opportunities is the
critical task for today
your task right here and I very much
hope that these meetings will be very
successful then carrying forward the
very impressive work of city life you
know Urbana in the past years and make
the right to the city a living reality
and carry achievements beyond
