before we end I want to ask you
something a little bit more personal and
it's something that's always intrigued
me about you your your parents I think
your father was originally a Ukraine
from Ukraine your mum was from what's
now known as Belarus both both were Jews
both arrived in the United States and
it's perhaps fair to say that had they
not made it to the United States they
have been killed
sure faced terrible turmoil like the
rest of the family who didn't come your
work for more than 40 years has focused
on what you call the terrorism the
criminal acts of the United States and
yet your parents knew America as a safe
haven as a place of opportunity of
security how did those two elements of
your life fit together very simply the
same way they did for my parents yes
it's a land of opportunity and in fact
we know why it's a land of opportunity
because the British colonists came and
effectively exterminated the indigenous
population which is a typical property
of settler colonialism the worst kind of
imperialism conquered half of Mexico
instituted slavery I mean committed huge
crimes and created a rich prosperous
country from which I benefit enormous
Lee well there's an elementary moral
principle and since then have gone on to
carry out horrendous crimes everywhere I
mean the Vietnam War alone is probably I
think the worst crime since the Second
World War
maybe four million people killed for
three countries devastated these are
real crimes and there are many others I
think the style of argument should be we
should tell the truth about important
things and for each of us the most in
this is an elementary moral principle
the most important thing for each of us
is the predictable consequences of our
own actions
I was very easy to condemn the crimes of
others so you know Stalinist tax
condemned the crimes of the West
I don't applaud them for that
I applaud the Soviet dissidents who
condemned the crimes of the Soviet Union
and it's the same for each of us but
individual life or anywhere no no
Chomsky's world is a black and white
world when it comes to the United States
you constantly focus upon what you
regard as the evils done the crimes
committed by the United States for a
reason what about the good things there
are United States that's what about the
reasons which drive millions of people
from the poorest parts of this planet to
want to live in the United in the
reaches of a very American in the
richest country in the world yeah and
I'm glad my parents came here otherwise
they would have been in death camps but
sure that's true and in fact what you
say it's not just consider these last
few minutes of discussion one of the
things that I did was praise the United
States appraise it for the significant
changes that civilized the society
substantially in the last 40 years
coming from popular activism or it takes
a freedom of speech which I talk about
all the time it's one of the highest
values it's it's protected in the United
States beyond any country the world that
I know of it's a major achievement it
doesn't go back to the Bill of Rights it
substantially comes from the civil
rights movement the major Supreme Court
cases establishing a high standard of
freedom of speech were in in connection
with the civil rights movement actions
so yes there are very great things that
have happened I talk about them all the
time they come primarily from popular
activism which is directed against the
crimes of the country in fact I'm struck
by the changes in the last 40 years
which have come from an organized active
public much of it initiated by young
people students and others and it's had
a huge effect well it hasn't affected
the basic constructions and you know it
has not affected the institution's but
it's affected the way they act I know
that's quite important opposition to the
Iraq war for example was far higher than
opposition to the Vietnam War at any
comparable stage and it's had an impact
in Iraq it was bad enough but the US and
Britain could not do what they did in
Vietnam
the population would never have
tolerated it yes those are important
changes I think it would be fair to say
that you've always had an extraordinary
confidence in your own righteousness and
as you enter your eighties I just wonder
are you as sure about being right now as
you ever were yes but I was never that
sure because you kind of cross as
extraordinary as you know if if you have
to state an opinion in two seconds it
sounds very confident but I think I
mentioned earlier that in the sciences
you have a framework of understanding
you pursue you what you think is
important but you maintain in the back
of your mind the recognition you may be
off on completely the wrong track and
you have to backtrack into the back of
your mind to the whole blazer and if I
for example take you say there's a flood
of criticism that you have welcomed it
and I read it carefully and I look to
see if there's anything there that's
valid and with astonishing consistency
there's nothing as in the case that you
mentioned about the descent and the
notification the context is always
eliminated when you put the context back
in I think almost any normal person
would say that's the right thing they
were strong professor Noam Chomsky we
were out of time but thank you very much
for being on
you
