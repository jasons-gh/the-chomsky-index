you
well the things i want to ask you and I
think that a lot of people are trying to
figure this out is what do you think
Obama's what Kim do you think we can
expect from Obama foreign policy wise
when talking about us and Middle East
relations like do you think he's really
going to be like the diplomat that he
kind of says he will be or do you think
there's no evidence were the only
evidence we have is what he said what's
on his website and the appointment to
tease me what he said is that he won't
say anything about this I'll say things
but anything else but not this so not
about the invasion of Gaza and sodium
talk about then if I guess it won't
thing namely when he went to Israel last
July if he visited stay wrote the town
which is targeted by rockets and he said
that if my daughters were here I would
do anything to stop the Rockets that
he's repeated again as Israel is
blasting people two Marines and Gaza
that he would do anything to stop an
attack on steroid period that's what we
said his said on his website it's just
love for Israel nothing about the
Palestinians that I think he has some
vague reference to a Palestinian state
somewhere but everything that's the
worship according to the defense of
Israel and he mentions Lebanon once
namely he takes pride in his having
sponsored a resolution during Israel's
invasion of Lebanon saying that we
should support Israel and Israel should
be permitted to go on kill as many
peoples at likes and so on and so forth
those are statements his appointments
are just pro-israeli hooks right down on
line Clinton that is Ross fan kretser
kretser is the most modern among them
and who is his middle east advisor was
the co-author or helper at least in the
speech that he gave to a peck which
broke records and obsequious pneus no
one has ever gone that far in fact he
went so far that his campaign had to
publicly withdraw some of his statement
he stated that the fact that Jerusalem
must remain the undivided capital of
Israel and for thoughts
radically opposed to international laws
against Security Council resolutions of
the us-supported against US policy it
was so extreme that his campaign had to
essentially retract it and say well the
words didn't mean what he said and
that's what we know so you can guess
what you want my thing thanks Asheville
guess right now it will probably be like
the second Bush administration his I
remember um I think it was like it was
during the primaries I was watching a go
meet the press and they were talking to
Ralph Nader and nadir of saying how he
doesn't trust Obama's foreign policy and
he said the reason why is because I'm
when Obama was first starting out his
political career he was actually
pro-palestinian and now he's become like
this total pro-israel apologists and
that just got me thinking like I don't
know that he was ever hurt Bell spinning
he had a few Palestinian friends
but he's been very cagey about not
seeing anything in fact his whole
campaign was rather striking for its
vacuity it was what the press called
soaring rhetoric class 8 admired about
hope and change but essentially
presented himself as a kind of a blank
slate of the Jews right where he wanted
I don't see any particular hope and his
other clinton's either then maybe the
Secretary of Labor has got a good record
but if you run down a list of
appointments they're all very much
longer she should decide maybe Santos
did was do you think there's a
particular reason why he would like
annoying all the song talks to his
cabinet and then because before he said
he would say like oh I'm going to be mr.
diplomacy I really did talk with our
enemies and then people yeah but I mean
you know if the bush if Bush had a third
administration and the day because of
the advantage to because it's insane to
the end but that's all and he's
maintained the position that we must be
with a writer I ran his position is the
United States must be an outlaw state in
radical violation
law that's what it means to say he's
going to keep all options on the table
the UN Charter he's a lawyer he knows
the UN Charter explicitly bad as the
threat of force the American population
is overwhelmingly opposed the threat of
force is the whole world but he says we
got to keep it open so we must be an
outlaw state but he's living thought
that before he goes on to use of force
with regard to Iraq he's described eaten
by people on the Left as having had a
principled opposition to the war that's
simply false his only critique of the
war is that it was what he calls a
strategic blunder you know that's no
more principle that nazi general after
Stalin grub I said two-front war was the
strategic blunder effect he can read
things like that in profit during the
1980s I wouldn't commentators argue that
it was a strategic blunder for the
Russians to invade Afghanistan we didn't
call that a principled stand though
they're learning principles and failed
and I found it very hard to find a
principled stand on any
