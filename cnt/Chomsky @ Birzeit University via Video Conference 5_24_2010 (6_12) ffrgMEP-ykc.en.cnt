it was in fact session in 1978 was
harsher from the us-israeli point of
view than in 1971 because in the
intervening period Palestinian
nationalism had arisen as a major issue
in world affairs such a thought that
insist on the Palestinian national right
silly in the occupied territories and
Israel in the United States kind of
accepted the words but not the meaning
so practices went on but anyways you
know but the other different terminology
in 1976 in the intervening period the
major Arab states said that were called
the confrontation states Egypt Syria and
Jordan proposed a resolution at the
Security Council calling for a two-state
settlement Palestinian nationalism was
now an issue so a two-state settlement
and the terms of un 42 which everyone
agrees is the founding document they
interpret it differently but everyone
accepts it it essentially called for
Israeli withdrawal to the international
border and in return it guarantees for
the security of Independence of every
state in the region including Israel
secure and recognized boundaries and so
on well that well that wording was
included in the scurry council
resolution in 1976 Israel refused to
attend session the United States has
entered the resolution when the
godfather vetoes a resolution it's
actually a double veto the first of all
the resolution isn't enacted and
secondly it's painted from history so if
you look at scholarship and commentary
and so on except in very remote places
it's gone that's AB history as is the
fact that the United States need to
essentially the same resolution in 1980
of the other Carter and I won't run
through the history but that's pretty
much the record sense for about 35 years
there has been an overwhelming
international consensus on pretty much
the terms of the 1976 resolution first
aid settlement on the international
borders guarantees for peace and so on
and so forth everything that could be
accepted in a peace agreement it was
also assumed that there could be
remember that the international border
is a truth that was not established as a
permanent border it was a truce and its
curves and so on so there was the
official u.s. position during the
position when time when the US was still
part of the world up to nineteen seventy
one official US position was that there
could be the liner and mutual
modifications in the border okay that
remains part of the terms of the
international consensus so to state
settlement on the international border
wire and mutual modifications various
arrangements about other questions
refugees status of Jerusalem and so on
well through the last 35 years the
United States and Israel have been the
one barrier to realizing this resolution
and it's because of the same principle
that was established in 1971 as
expansion is more important than
security the security issue today is
almost entirely transparent the Arab
League accepted a Saudi proposal which
reiterates the international consensus
and goes on to say that the Arab states
should normalize relations with Israel
after this Agreement the Organization of
Islamic states accepted the same
position that includes it ran and
non-state actors relevant non-state
actors like Hamas say they sort of
tolerate that agreement has bella said
they want to interfere with anything the
Palestinians accept so it's essentially
universal but the US and Israel are not
accepting it well there is one exception
to
crucial exception in the record of this
entire period and it's very crucial it's
in january two thousand and one that's
the last month of president clinton's
term in office he recognized that they
Camp David negotiations which had
collapsed he recognized that in those
negotiations the Israel and the United
States had presented a position that no
I was saying could possibly accept what
Abbas anybody so Quentin changed the
terms in december two thousand right
near the end of his term he presented
what he called his parameters you know a
framework were a resolution he then they
were vague but more forthcoming the
closer to the international consensus we
then gave a speech in which he said that
both sides have accepted the parameters
and both sides have expressed
reservations well besides Israel and
Palestine lat taba injured in january
two thousand one to deal with the
reservations and they came very close to
a complete settlement we incidentally
have an extremely good record of this
course record primarily from hebrew
sources israeli sources covered in close
detail highest level also there was
international representative of spanish
representative more tennis and uh
brother covered so that's exactly what
happened and it's true they came very
close to a settlement in fact in their
last press conference press conference
they said that if we had a few more days
we could probably settle everything
borders refugees and jerusalem
everything well Israel called off the
negotiations the elections came in
Clinton and Barack were replaced by Bush
and Sharon ago she ations never
continued it continued informally again
at quite a high level and they led to
what
the Geneva Accord that was presented the
world a couple of days who years later
Israel rejected it the United States
didn't mention it the rest of the world
praised it and it was pretty similar to
the Taba agreement well you know things
have happened since then but fundamental
situation has not changed very much that
agreement could be implemented is there
an alternative whether there are now
what are called proximity talks and
within Western doctrine proximity talks
involved the United States as the
neutral arbiter you know there try to
bring the two sides together and then
there are these two irrational
antagonists of Israel and the
Palestinians and the u.s. is trying to
bring them together and that's the way
it's universally described in the West
may be here too i don't know that makes
absolutely no sense there should be
proximity talks between the united
states and the rest of the world that's
the conflict the united states on one
side israel along with it and the rest
of the world on the other side and there
should be some neutral party maybe the
United Nations negotiating between these
two adversaries of the world and the
United States the world happens to be
supported by international law judgments
the World Court and so on so that's one
side and then there's the United States
on the other side but the United States
happens to be the most powerful state in
the world and the way the world is run
that means it determines how things are
viewed and how things are discussed and
the way intellectuals present the world
and so on so that's not what you read in
western commentary but it's what you
ought to read in a realistic commentary
and unless those two sides going to be
brought together there won't be a
settlement can lay be
well what are the options now let me
just finish with that one option is the
international consensus of the past 35
years may be modified in terms of Taba
or the Geneva Accords or maybe some
other minor modifications but those are
the basic principles really no dispute
about them that's one possibility now
there's another possibility that is
proposed but I think that's leading Lee
its proposed now by many of the
Palestinian leaders and also by many
people concerned with Palestinian rights
what is now proposed the idea that's
very common now is in these circles is
well the tri-state settlement is
finished we can't do it anymore because
of the settlements so let's move to just
have Israel take over the whole
territory so it's to say okay we give
you the keys as one Palestinian later
said we'll give you the keys they had
take over the whole territory and will
then have a civil rights struggle like
an apartheid South Africa and we can win
that struggle
