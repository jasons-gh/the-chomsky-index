here on democracy now the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman as we go to
historical notes of professor Noam
Chomsky professor of linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
he spoke just before our steed was
ousted in Haiti you can read on the
front pages of the main newspapers that
death squad leaders are rampaging
through the country the death squad
leaders apart from a hideous record in
the in earlier years were responsible
for maybe four to five thousand deaths
during the period of the military hunter
from 1990 to 94 91 to 94 the military
hunt though though it's this that much
is reported they were leaders of the
military Hunta which killed maybe four
or five thousand people the death squads
did the paramilitaries what's not
mentioned it is that the military hunter
was supported by the Bush and the
Clinton administration's in fact just to
quickly go over the background there's a
long ugly horrifying history going back
to centuries but just starting in 1990
the Haiti did have its first free
election in 1990 the US had a candidate
world bank official mark Beza who had
assumed would obviously win yet all the
money and everything else nobody was
paying attention to what was going on in
the slums and the streets and the hills
and what was going on was pretty
impressive
a lot of large-scale effective
organizing among some of the poorest
most miserable people in the world and
grassroots movements had developed with
nobody paying any attention which were
so powerful that when it did come to an
election they swept the election
the u.s. candidate got 14% of the vote
and her state president our steed won by
a very large majority which shocked
everybody the United States instantly
instantly turned to overthrowing the
government it withdrew support from
badly desperately needed support from
the government not because the
government was inefficient it was
getting very good marks from the
international lending institutions and
so on but because it had broken the
rules it was a popular government that
had been elected on the basis of
large-scale grassroots organizing all
Aid was withdrawn from the government
aid was given but only to the opposition
up until that point under agreements
first with Carter then intensified with
Reagan the US had a virtual blockade
around the island during the period of
the vicious military dictatorships that
the US was supporting to try to prevent
people from escaping
that's illegal of course it's a gross
violation of the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights and conventional
humanitarian law but anyway that's what
was going on they changed it when our
state was elected for the first time
Haitians were allowed to come to the
United States and accept political
asylum not when they were being tortured
by duvets thugs
it didn't matter too much because very
few people were trying to get out in
fact during that moment of hope people
for the first time we're trying to get
in but if anyone was trying to get out
they were for the first time allowed to
be called political refugees when the
coup took place as was anticipated seven
months later it reversed then nobody
could flee again because they weren't
political refugees the Organization of
American States called an embargo after
the military coup Bush was in president
announced right away that the US would
disregard it
it would permit US firms to break the
embargo to continue providing aid
commerce with the military hunter and
the rich P it's rich backers the press
did report this New York Times reported
it as an effort to fine-tune embargo for
the benefit of the Haitian poor namely
by allowing US firms to violate the
embargo that passed without comment
and in fact trade with Haiti continued
extended under Clinton even further the
crucial element in the embargo any
embargo is oil Haiti you know military
would and the rich elite would run out
wouldn't be able to continue if they
didn't have oil the CIA was testifying
solemnly to Congress that no oil was
getting in I was there for some of the
time I've been in a lot of horrible
places most I've never seen people so
terrorized and terrified straight of
their mouths but I had to do was walk
around the streets of port-au-prince to
see the CIA was lying I mean you can see
the oil forms being built you could go
to the harbor and see the ships coming
into the oil
but the pretense was maintained that the
US was not permitting oil to go in it
later turned out that the Bush and the
Clinton administration's had authorized
Texaco oil corporation to circumvent
presidential directives and supply of
oil illegally to the gangsters who were
torturing and terrorizing the population
that has yet to be printed outside of
the business press it was known in 1994
the end of dissident press of course
which isn't subject to this constraints
and finally in 1994 Clinton decided that
the population been tortured enough and
the president was permitted to return
that is described this what I've just
said you don't read in the front pages
but I'm coming back to what you do read
what you do read is that this was a
magnificent act of humanitarian
intervention pure altruism entering the
noble phase of foreign policy as we
restored the democratically elected
president 1994 continuing with what
isn't reported the president was indeed
allowed the return but on a condition
namely the condition that he accept the
program of the defeated us candidate in
the 1990 election who had gotten 14
percent of the vote that is a very harsh
neoliberal program which opens Haiti up
to complete takeover by foreign court
meaning us mainly corporations no
constraints it was bound to be a
economic disaster for what shreds of the
economy remained it's a familiar program
your it has just been imposed on Iraq by
the proconsul Paul Bremer order 39 last
October declares that Iraq the Iraqi
economy must be open to and takeover by
foreign mainly US multinationals the
bank's US banks JPMorgan others have be
able to take over the financial
institutions which means essentially
running the economy and everything else
can be brought up by foreign mainly US
businesses that no sovereign country
would ever accept that but this is a
country under military occupation the
business classes and Iraq are protesting
because they know they can't withstand
international competition from us
massively subsidized US multinationals
but doesn't matter
Bremer also imposed a 15% top tax Bush
administration delight again no
sovereign country would accept that its
programs like that that in the last
couple of cent that Adam Smith was
complaining about in fact its programs
like that forced imposition of market
principles on countries under military
occupation that's basically what's
created what's today the third world the
rich countries including the United
States have never accepted such rules
and if they actually it's interesting
Adam Smith urged the US colonies this is
1776 to pursue comparative advantage to
do what they're good at what they were
good at was agricultural production you
know catching beavers sending fish to
England said concentrate on that that's
the best way to maximize efficiency but
don't try to develop industry that would
be crazy
because British industry is far more
efficient which was true and you'll just
be harming overall efficiency if you try
to develop your own industry well you
know same laws for India but India had
to accept them because they were under
occupation the US was able to throw the
British out disregard the advice which
happens to be the same advice that
economists are now giving to the poor
countries of the world and it violated
the principles of comparative advantage
and economic efficiency and developed
his own industry and story goes on from
there if the US had followed the rules
the ones now imposed on Iraq and Haiti
and others we would be not here we'd be
maybe a couple of us would be around
talking in some Hut somewhere while
we're off to catch fish to send to
England or something pursuing our
compare
advantage anyhow Haiti had to accept
that as a condition on the return of the
elected president that's the great
humanitarian achievement well it was
what was predicted at once happened the
remnants of Haitian economic functioning
were destroyed of course Haitian farmers
rice farmers for example happened to be
quite efficient they're producing they
are producing we're producing rice
efficiently the high quality which was
feeding the population and now you'll
read that Haiti can't feed itself which
is correct because Haitian rice farmers
though efficient I could not begin to
compete with us
agribusiness high-tech agribusiness
which make gets maybe 40 percent of its
profits from subsidies granted to it by
the Reaganites under a free-market
doctrine the way it actually works the
same happened with just about whatever
was left one of the few businesses that
was actually functioning in Haiti was
making chicken parts but it turned out
turns out that Americans don't like dark
meat so there's lots of extra dark meat
lying around here and companies like
Tyson don't want to throw it out they
would like to force other countries to
buy it at dumped prices so they dumped
dark meat on Haiti they tried to do it
in Canada and Mexico but those countries
are able to impose barriers to dumping
however Haiti wasn't allowed to because
of the condition for their freedom so
that industry was wiped out and so it
goes case after case the result is
complete chaos destruction what you're
described seeing today on the page on
the front pages well that's the
background and now let's come to the
doctrine of the Bush Doctrine
the head of the paramilitary forces that
are now rampaging once again in Haiti is
a gentleman named Amano L constant who
is living happily in Queens the there's
no question about his responsibility
he's already been tried in absentia in
Haitian courts and there's no known
really questions that he was the leader
of frappe and terrorist forces state
terrorist forces Haiti has made several
efforts to have the United States
extradite him but they rarely even get a
response some of these are interesting
the timing is interesting one request
was on September 30th 2001 I was right
in the middle of the furor over the fact
that the Taliban are unwilling to turn
over to us someone who the u.s. accuses
of terrorism without providing any
evidence big topic if we're going to
bomb Afghanistan Haiti requested
extradition of the Manorville constant
it was mentioned sort of back pages but
obviously no response it's not our kind
of thing President noam chomsky talking
about Haiti and global order if you'd
like to get a copy of today's show you
can call one eight hundred eight eight
one two three five nine one eight
hundred eight eight one two three five
nine our website democracynow.org
tomorrow we look at the relationship
between the bushes and the sods I'm Amy
Goodman stay with us
