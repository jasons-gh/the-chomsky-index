okay in human intelligence in the
environment you raise the possibility of
factory workers taking control the means
of production and autonomously deciding
to break with business as usual opting
instead to produce solar panels or
high-speed rail this recommendation is
entirely anarcho-syndicalism nature in
keeping with your own proclivities
indeed it bears much affinity with the
prospect of an ecological
anarcho-syndicalism a concept that has
been advanced by the environmental union
caucus of the Industrial Workers of the
world recently a particularly promising
proposal that the environmental union
caucus has made is that of an ecological
general strike in a similar vein
economic historian Richard Smith
recently called for the mass shuttering
of large corporations and vast swathes
of industry as a means of giving
humanity and nature a chance against
climate destruction moreover since the
US military is the single largest
contributor to the problem of
anthropogenic climate disruption the
Pentagon should effectively be
dismantled for this reason among others
of course how my activists present these
pressing goals in ways that do not lend
themselves being dismissed as mere
utopianism well let's pay good the idea
of serving industry to producing a solar
panels mass transportation so on that
was not utopian the US government
virtually nationalized the auto industry
a couple years ago not tired but took
over large parts of it there were
choices at that point if there had been
a powerful movement of the kind that
we're discussing this popular base it
could have pressed for something very
realistic which i think would
support of the working class not even
guarded as a strike will be regarded as
a a weapon against them taking away
their livelihoods their survival but
there's something could support them
have them take over the choices were to
really either the government rescues the
auto industry had the taxpayers expense
and hands it back to the pretty much the
original owners may be different faces
but structurally the same owners and
having produced what they were doing
before which is distraught that was one
possibility one more statement the other
possibility which could have been taken
and with a sufficiently powerful popular
movement might well and take it is to
put those factories into the hands of
the working class and have them direct
their make their choices rationally in
the interests of themselves their
communities the general society and do
exactly what you were describing that
produce solar panels as they take mass
transportation going back to markets you
take an economics course they tell you
markets offer choices it's partly true
but very narrowly markets restrict
choices sharply restrictions the mass
transportation is an example the mass
transportation is not a choice offered
up market cliff I want to go home
tonight the market does offer me a
choice between a for Toyota but not
between a car and subway that's just not
one of the choices of
market systems and this is not a small
point the things at choices that involve
common effort and solidarity and mutual
support and concern for others those are
out of the market system the market
system is based on a maximization of
individual consumption and that is
highly destructive in itself its
destructive even for the human beings
involved that destroys that turns them
into sociopathic individuals but it also
means that the kinds of things that are
needed for survival are out of the
market system like mass transportation
that's that's that's the form of
economic growth that could help preserve
the hopes for survival and it I don't
think was all unrealistic for that duket
not there's nothing utopian about them
now as compared with things like say
general strikes I think that's a much
better step step to take from it's it's
not saying let's throw a wrench in the
machine and arm everybody in the
interest is a longer-term goal it's
saying let's take a wrench and fix the
machine so it can function right now
with all you guys working doing better
jobs running it yourselves you're better
off psychologically socially in every
respect and you're also producing the
world that makes sense to limit that's I
think the better way to proceed in
general
