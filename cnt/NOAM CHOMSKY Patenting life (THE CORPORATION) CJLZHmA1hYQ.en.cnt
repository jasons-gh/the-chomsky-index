the corporations that are getting the
patents on life forms and jeans are for
the most part are heavily publicly
subsidized I think a huge public subsidy
for research and development and so on
so what you get is the public is paying
for the monopolization of the technology
of the future and even for interfering
with growth and is also paying to be
propagandized since they do a ton of
advertising when you get to genes and
life forms it's particularly extreme
because you're going right of the genes
or you don't know what the genes are for
but do you think maybe they'll be used
for something someday and all on them so
I'm going on jeans or I'm going on
somebody's blood or something like that
furthermore on top of all of this it's
pure shear robbery I mean that when they
patent life-forms they are using the
knowledge and expertise that's been
gained over thousands of years by
experimentation and research and
achievements of what we call indigenous
societies that don't have our form of
ownership control this is mostly work
done by women I mean transmitted from
mother to daughter over forever
techniques of you know a breeding what
should be grown where of what's useful
for this purpose and so on a big
pharmaceutical company comes in and just
steals all that then painting for it
since there's no technical ownership in
the Western since you don't have to pay
people for the fact that for thousands
of years they've been developing these
things and figuring out what to do and
so on you just steal it from them then
you make a minor modification of it and
you patent the modification and then
they have to buy it back from you
because your market power is so extreme
that you know you they're going to have
to go to you for C's or whatever so it's
a combination of extraordinary robbery I
mean profound immorality
and undermining of probably undermining
of economic growth it's a quite apart
from the whole moral question of the
right to own life forms which you know
again that's a value question but it
looks to me that kind of a slavish
