rational choices right then you have
rational choice theory go on from there
well have you ever turned on at
televisions and specific you've seen an
advertisement let's say for an
automobile or lifestyle drug toothpaste
I mean is the advertisement giving you
information about the product yeah I
mean if they were giving information
about if they're trying to have informed
consumers they say here's specifications
for model so and so next year instead
the it's doing exactly what Adam Smith
said is the job of business to delude an
depress the public he was correct the
goal of business is to delude an depress
the public and they delude the public by
not telling you what this automobile is
but having a beautiful actress is saying
sitting on top of it or the climbing up
some impossible mountain or something
like that all right business is spending
hundreds of millions of dollars a year
to undermine the threat of markets with
informed consumers making rational
choices they want uninformed consumers
to make irrational choices and on top of
that they want to fabricate consumers
create wants that's the business
literature points out so at either end
we don't really have market systems and
it goes on imma take what's called trade
it's mostly a economists myth I mean in
the old Soviet Union if something was
produced if parts were produced in
Leningrad and sent to Bulgaria for
assembly and then you know norm bo was
sold in Poland it crossed borders but we
didn't call a trade it was all within a
command economy well when General Motors
produces parts in Indiana sends him into
Mexico for assembly and sells them in
California we call a trade in both
directions but its internal to a command
economy it's not trade any meaningful
sense certainly not free trade
I think to free trade is the last thing
that states want if you take a phrase
like North American Free Trade Agreement
the only accurate words in it or North
America was an agreement either people
count because most people were against
it so you just have to decode an awful
lot of Mythology before you can even
talk about these questions
you
oh I think so in fact it's
that the fact that consumption is the
sort of the goal of life was
manufactured unconsciously you go back
to the business literature in the 1920s
and ever since at an increasing scale it
was recognized that we must turn on
almost quoting focused people on the
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption if we don't do
that they're going to get involved in
the political system we don't want that
what was happening in the nineteen
roughly the 1920s is that in the most
free countries in the world Britain in
the United States enough freedom had
been one so that it was becoming
impossible for the state to control
people by force the old way getting
parliamentary Labour Party's women were
getting the right to vote to you know
the vulgar masses we're getting involved
in running their own affairs which
cannot be tolerated you couldn't control
them by force that's when conceptions
like manufacturing consent or
fabricating consumers engineering
consent were developed that's when the
public relations industry developed in
the freest countries in the United
States and Britain it and its goal was
to create consumerism at one of its main
goals first of all because it's
profitable but also because it's
anti-democratic and the main goal of
business invariably or other elites is
to undermine democracy which is regarded
as a very threatening actually I should
say that elections in the United States
are now run the same way that
commodities are sold and by the same
institutions so it's not accidental so
you undermine markets by creating
uninformed consumers making irrational
choices and the same public relations
institutions when they run elections
look at the ads to try to do the same
thing keep away from issues present
imagery
and so on you don't want people to pay
attention to issues because on issues
the public disagrees enormously with the
two factions of the business party so
keep issues out of it people don't know
the stands of the candidate on issues
you focus on whether he's a nice guy
you'd like to be in a bar I mean does
Hillary Clinton have too much of a sex
problem as I don't know whatever it may
be but those are the things you focus on
just take a look at the newspapers
utility and it's very much like
undermining markets but this came in the
free societies as a result of the
victory of struggles to attain democracy
which is frightening has to be beaten
back and consumerism is to a large
extent to created by conscious effort
but that means it's fragile and it is
and by now you know there are large
sectors of society that I just don't
want it I mean they want to live a
decent life style not a you know not
have every imaginable gadget you can
have in your home can that develop yeah
sure these are cultural changes that can
certainly develop and no never easy to
do these things but of course there are
no major institutions backing it has to
be done through popular popular action
and it has two at a higher level at a
state level it has to be done by
cooperation with the oil producers and
the old consumers actually sure you know
that when Hugo Chavez appeared at the
United Nations it was tremendous
ridicule of his outrageous speech and
screeching and so on he actually gave a
very sensible speech at the Security
Council at the United General Assembly
against which I don't think was ever
reported his speech started by saying
that the exactly this point he said
we're facing and an environmental crisis
the oil producers like my country and
the oil consumers like many others
gathered here have to cooperate to deal
with this crisis which will require
carrying out significant socio-economic
changes changing the nature of the world
order the way we live and so on so that
we can reduce and maybe end the use of
petroleum for a reduction of energy and
use it for more healthy things and find
other ways to live and he went on with a
number of constructive suggestions well
that as far as I can recall then you can
get reported it's much more interesting
to report in calling bushy tail
you
i G nobody can predict the future of
technology so it makes good sense to
explore technological solutions to
things like environmental problems but
of course you can't faith in them and
hope you can be pretty confident that
any technological solution that comes
along we'll have negative side effects
as well which will have to be balanced
it's none of these you know nothing
comes free there's not going to Esther
is any guide history of science to there
is not going to be a magic solution I
mean it was thought at one point that
nuclear power would be a magic solution
quickly discovered that they're very
harmful negative effects and it's very
likely that that will be true of any
kind of technology that's developed I
mean the cosmos is a complex system
anyway you manipulate it something else
is going to happen that you vent thought
about so yes these every such efforts
should be pursued if they're if they
make any sense but with a recognition
that at the core of the problem is
serious socio-economic and cultural
changes we just have to live in other
ways not like the ones we have been
driven to live in there's nothing
natural or nothing in human nature that
forces people to work 20 hours a day to
accumulate as many commodities as they
can stuff into their house I mean that's
a an imposed lifestyle which like any
imposed lifestyle has some attraction or
people would accept it but it certainly
doesn't have to be the one that's
followed I mean I could give you a
personal stories about things like this
but it requires a change and among and
these changes can take place I mean but
the result of the 1960s the activism at
60s it did have a big effect on this and
it did make the societies much more
civilized
it's one of the reasons why it's called
the Time of Troubles was making the
countries too civilized no it's
dangerous and two Democratic but one of
the effects was simply on lifestyle so
during late 1970s in the 1980s you know
this was sort of reaching becoming
ingrained in large parts of the public
there was a very and you know I don't
know the figures to Europe but in the
United States there was a steady decline
in among younger people and use of
tobacco red meat coffee marijuana which
is less dangerous but things that really
are dangerous just decline sharply knock
there was no legislation that said don't
smoke tobacco you know don't eat red
meat it's just a change in lifestyle
people want to be more healthy and we're
activity you know go to the gym jog
whatever it may be well you know these
are changes in culture and lifestyle
which to some extent two separate people
from the culture of consumption and you
know destruction by no means of all like
this I mean at the same time in the
United States general health was
declining so actually height which is a
fairly good measure of health is
declining in the United States the u.s.
used the genes are pretty much all the
same but the tallest people are the
Dutch are the Germans you know and not
Americans you know shorter you notice it
when you go to them you know you go to
the airport in Frankfurt six feet tall
womens on but that's just a chain it's a
reflections of changes in lifestyle and
you know probably even in hours of work
on hours of work of declined in Europe
going up in the United States and that
has health effects
you know the things that they measure
say well you know GDP per capita than
going up as I sure because people are
choosing a different lifestyle I mean
they're choosing to add a couple of
weeks off instead of being a kind of a
copying a Japanese salary man who has to
be talked about leisure is
