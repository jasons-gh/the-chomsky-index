hi everyone I am Taylor Hudak with
activism Munich bringing you the latest
update on the Julian Assange case
Sarge's partner and the mother of his
children attorney Stella Morris broke
her anonymity last week in a video
interview published on Wikileaks website
Morris identity became a matter of the
public record after submitting a
statement to the court during one of
Assange is bail hearings journalist
Stefania Murray who has been reporting
on WikiLeaks documents for the past 11
years wrote an article after obtaining
access to Morris statement and other
documents
Muricy wrote in the article her
statement FOIA documents and files on
the espionage activities by you see
global revealed an extreme situation of
Julian Assange more easy reported that
in Morris statement to the judge she
expressed a great fear of losing Assange
to suicide Cove in 19 or other health
related issues Morris also described how
she witnessed the effects of Assange as
prolonged isolation her article Muricy
also reported on additional documents
that she obtained through a FOIA request
which showed the UK's lack of concern
over Assange as health and well-being
she specifically cited emails dating
back to 2012 where CPS the Crown
Prosecution Service showed a clear lack
of care and concern for Assange Stella
Morris is now active on social media and
is publicly advocating for her fiance
additionally Morris is an attorney and
has been a member of the WikiLeaks legal
team for a number of years in other
journalists legal experts and activists
are continuing to show support for the
First Amendment and press freedoms
despite the koban 19 crisis over the
weekend two online events were held
featuring high-profile supporters the
first event was hosted by the don't
extradite Assange campaign and featured
three journalists stephania Marie Z John
Pilger in Charles glass John Pilger was
the first guest to speak and he started
off with a very powerful message there's
no more important
in my opinion than Julian's Julian is
has become the touchstone for so much of
our understanding and misunderstanding
the relationship between the u.s. and
the UK is frequently discussed when
talking about Assange as potential
extradition Charles glass shared his
thoughts on a topic sooner it's dealt
with the sooner Julian is released
the sooner that the British stopped
responding stop rewarding perverting
their own justice system in order to
please the US person all these things
happens better and the better for us
journalists because Julian is taking the
hint for us as Stefania said newspapers
around the world published the WikiLeaks
documents the New York Times and by ACE
The Guardian at all.they but they're not
being charged because these are big
powerful institutions so the woman who
will take the hit was the man who
provided them with the documents that
gave them their scoops gave them their
journalist surprises it gave them their
headlines and a lot of them are not
coming to his defense which is I think
disgraceful
a similar event was held the following
day by the United National anti-war
Coalition guests included Margaret
Kimberly Nathan fuller Jeff Lombardo
Nozomi hey II see Jim Lafferty and Jeff
McClure video statements were also
provided by high-profile and longtime
supporters of Assange namely Noam
Chomsky take a look Josh perform the
major service he has found ways to gain
access to materials that the population
should definitely know about and he's
released them to the public an effort
for this he's already been very severely
punished he was under punitive very
punitive house arrest for years
sequester's and vehicle to an embassy
they kicked him out he's been placed in
a high-security prison his life is in
danger from the treatment he's received
and he's now facing the threat of the
versiv your punishment for by the US
government for the services that he's
performed for the public a matter of
extreme importance for those who have
care about the brutal and unfair
treatment of someone and also to care
about the right of citizens to gain
access to knowledge about what their
elected representatives are doing
director of the courage foundation
nathan fuller provided his suggestions
for supporters who want to take actions
absolutely important they get in touch
with your representatives and spread the
word through up ads or letters to your
local editors I also really think it's
important to especially in the u.s. now
to get organized to start talking to
your friends locally and and find out
who's who else supports Assange and what
you guys can do together this committee
to defend Julian Assange started out
with some big branches of already
organized people in New York and Los
Angeles in the San Francisco Bay Area
and we want to expand that so if you're
in a different region get together with
some local supporters and organizers and
get in touch with us and let's build a
branch in your area we can you know take
advantage of this time that we have in
the quarantine and it's coronavirus
containment to get organized online to
build up our websites and get and find
