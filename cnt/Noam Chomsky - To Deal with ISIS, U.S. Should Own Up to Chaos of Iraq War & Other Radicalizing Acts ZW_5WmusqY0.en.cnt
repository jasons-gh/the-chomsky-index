the war and peace report
I'm Amy Goodman today part two of our
discussion with Noam Chomsky the world
renowned political dissident linguist
and author Institute professor emeritus
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
where he's talked for more than half a
century on Monday on Democracy Now Aaron
Matta and I interviewed him about
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's speech on Iran to Congress
today in part two we look at blowback
from the US drone program the legacy of
slavery in the United States the leaks
of Edward Snowden u.s. meddling in
Venezuela and the thawing of u.s. Cuba
relations we began by asking professor
Chomsky how the US should respond to the
self-proclaimed Islamic state it's very
hard to think of anything serious that
can be done I mean it should be settled
diplomatically and peacefully to the
extent that that's possible it's not
inconceivable I mean there are Isis it's
a horrible manifestation of hideous
actions it's a real danger to anyone
nearby but so are other forces and we we
should be getting together with Iran
which has a huge stake in the matter and
is the main force involved and with the
Iraqi government which is calling for an
applauding Iranian support and trying to
work out with them some arrangement
which will satisfy the legitimate
demands of the Sunni population which is
the which is what Isis is protecting and
defending and gaining their support from
they're not coming out of nowhere they
are one of the effects the main effects
of the US invasion of Iraq
there are many horrible effects but one
of them was to incite sectarian
conflicts
that have not been there before if take
a look at Baghdad before the invasion
Sunni and Shiah lived intermingled same
neighborhoods in are married sometimes
they say that they didn't even know if
their neighbor was sunny or she was like
knowing what Protestants said your
neighbor belongs to it was very pretty
close it wasn't not claiming was wasn't
utopia there were conflicts but there
was no serious conflict there's so much
so that Iraqis at the time predicted
there would never be a conflict well
within a couple of years it turned into
a violent conflict you look at Baghdad
today it's segregated what's left of the
Sunni communities are isolated people
camped off to the neighbors this war
going all over the ISIS is murderous
infertile the same is true of the
militias which confronted and this is
now spread over the region there's now a
major sunni-shia conflict rending the
region - apart tearing to shreds
now this cannot be dealt with by bombs
this is much more serious than that it's
got to be dealt with by steps towards
records it's recovering remedying the
massive damage that was initiated by the
sledgehammer smashing Iraq and has now
spread and that does require the
diplomatic peaceful means dealing with
people who are pretty ugly and we're not
very pretty either for that matter
but this just has to be done exactly
what steps should be taken it's hard to
say there are people whose lives are at
stake
like the Assyrian Christians the other
day and so on apparently the fighting
that protected the we don't know a lot
but it looks as though the ground
fighting that protected the Yazidi
largely was carried out by PKK the
Turkish guerrilla group that's fighting
for the Kurds and Turkey but based in
northern Iraq and there on the US
terrorist list we can't hope to have a
strategy that deals with Isis well
opposing and attacking the group that's
fighting just as doesn't make sense to
try to have a strategy that explodes
around the major state supporting the
Iraq and its battle Isis what about the
fact that so many of those who are
joining Isis now and a lot has been made
follow of the young people young women
and young men who were going into Syria
through Turkey
I mean Turkey is a US ally and there is
a border there and they freely go back
and forth that's right then it's not
just young people the one thing that's
pretty striking is that it includes
people with educated people doctors
professionals and others whatever we may
not like it that Isis is the idea of the
Islamic caliphate is does have an appeal
to large sectors of a brutalized global
population which is under severe attack
everywhere has been for a long time and
something has appeared which has an
appeal to them and that can't be
overlooked if we want to deal with the
issue we have to ask what's the nature
the appeal why is it there how can we
accommodate it and lead to some if not
at least amelioration of the murderer's
conflict and maybe some kind of
settlement
you can't ignore these factors if you
want to deal with the issue I want to
ask you about more information that's
come out on the British man who is known
as jihadi John
who appears in the Islamic state the
heading videos mohamed emwazi has been
identified as that man by british
security they say he's a 26 year old
born in Kuwait who moved to the UK as a
child and studied computer science at
the University of Westminster the
British group cage said he faced at
least four years of harassment detention
deportations threats and attempts to
recruit him by British security agencies
which prevented him from leading a
normal life and was a approached cage in
2009 after he was detained and
interrogated by the British intelligence
and agency mi5 on what he called a
safari vacation in Tanzania in 2010
after him huazi was barred from
returning to Kuwait he wrote quote I had
a job waiting for me and marriage to get
started but now I feel like a prisoner
only not in a cage in London in 2013 a
week after he was barred from Kuwait for
a third time and waz he left home and
ended up in Syria at a news conference
cage research director Aseem Qureshi
spoke about his recollections of my Z
and compared his case to another British
man Michael adebolajo who had to soldier
to death in London in 2013 sorry
it's quite hard because he's such a side
[Applause]
such a beautiful young really you know
it's it's hard to imagine the trajectory
but it's not ridiculous unfamiliar with
us for us we've seen Mike light of a
larger once again somebody that I met
you know you came to me for help looking
to change the situation in the system
when when are we going to finally learn
that when we treat people as if they're
Outsiders they will inevitably feel like
outsiders and they will look for
belonging and elsewhere that's kage
research director a same Qureshi your
response to this Noam Chomsky writes if
the same let's take a look at the those
who perpetrated the crimes and Charlie
Hebdo they also have a history of
oppression violence they come from
Algeria in the background the horrible
French participation and the murderous
war in the 90s in Algeria is their
immediate background they live under and
these harshly repressed areas those
there's much more than that so you
mentioned that informations coming out
about so-called jihadi john'
other information is coming out which we
don't pay much attention to for example
the Guardian had a an article a couple
of weeks ago about a Yemeni boy I think
it was about 14 or so who was murdered
in a drone strike and shortly before
they had interviewed him about his
history his parents and family went
through them were murdered in drone
strikes he watched them burn to death
and we get upset about the headings they
get upset about seeing their father
burned to death and a drone strike
he said they live in a situation of
constant terror
not knowing when the person ten feet
away from you is suddenly going to be
blown away that's their lives people
like those who live in the slums of
around Paris or in this case a
relatively privileged a man under the
harsh pretty harsh repression in England
they also know about that we may choose
not to know about it that they know when
we talk about the headings they know
that in the us-backed Israeli attack on
Gaza at the points where the attack was
most fierce like this fire neighborhood
people weren't just beheaded there were
their bodies were torn to shreds people
came later trying to put the pieces of
the bodies together to find out who they
were you know these things happen too
and they have an impact all of this has
an impact along with what was described
and if we seriously want to deal with
the question we can't ignore that that's
part of the background of people who are
reacting this way you spoke before about
how the US invasion set off the
sunni-shia conflict in Iraq and out of
that came Isis I wonder if you see a
parallel in Libya where the US and NATO
had a mandate to stop a potential
massacre in Benghazi but then went much
further than a no-fly zone and helped
topple Qaddafi and now we have four days
later we have Isis in Libya and they're
beheading Coptic Christians Egypt now
bombing and with the u.s. debating this
expansive war measure Libya could be
next on the US target list well that's a
very important analogy what happened as
as you say there was a claim that there
might be Massacre and Benghazi and in
response to that the there was a UN
resolution which had several elements
one a call for a ceasefire and
negotiations which apparently Qaddafi
accepted another was a no-fly zone
okay to stop attacks in Benghazi the
three traditional imperial powers
Britain France in the United States
immediately violated the resolution no
diplomacy no ceasefire they immediately
became the air force of the rebel forces
and in fact the war itself had plenty of
brutality the violent militias attacks
on my African Mike the Africans living
in the VA all sorts of things the end
result is just a terror livia to shreds
by now it's torn between two major
warring militias many other small ones
it's gotten to the point where they
can't even export their main export oil
it's just a disaster
total disaster that's what happens when
you strike vulnerable systems as I said
with a sledgehammer that all kind of
horrible things can happen in the case
of Iraq it's worth recalling that the
there had been an almost a decade of
sanctions which were really destructive
we know about we can if we like know
about the sanctions for not two but we
can find out there were there was a sort
of humanitarian component of the
sanctions so-called was the oil for
feets peace program instituted when the
reports of the sanctions were so
horrendous you know hundreds of
thousands of children dying and so on
that it was necessary for the US and
Britain to institute some humanitarian
part that was directed by prominent
respected international diplomats Dennis
holiday
that's Transpo neck both Halliday and
font sponeck resigned because they
called the humanitarian aspect genocidal
that's their description von sponeck
published a detail the important book on
it called I think a different kind of
war or something like that
which I've never seen a review of or
even a mention of in the United States
which detailed in great detail exactly
how these sanctions were devastating the
civilian society supporting Saddam
because the people have it simply huddle
under the umbrella of power for survival
probably they didn't say this fella loud
it probably saving Saddam from the fate
of other dictators who the US had
supported and were overthrown by popular
uprisings and there's a long list of
them Somoza Marcos do you know even
Ceausescu US was supporting they were
overthrown from within
Saddam wasn't because the society the
civil society that might have carried
that out was devastated he had a pretty
efficient rationing system people were
living on it for survival but it just
severely harmed the civilian society
then comes the war you know a massive
war plenty of destruction destruction of
Antiquities there's no know properly
denunciation of Isis for destroying
antiquities the US invasion did the same
thing millions of refugees horrible blow
that's the society these things have
terrible consequences after there's a
interesting interview with Graham fuller
he's one of the leading Middle East
analyst long background in CIA US
intelligence
in the interview he says something like
the u.s. created Isis he hates him sad
that he's not joining with the
conspiracy theories that are floating
around Middle East about how the u.s. is
supporting Isis of course it's not but
what he says is the u.s. created Isis in
the sense that we established the
background from which Isis developed as
terrible offered and we can't overlook
MIT professor Noam Chomsky when we come
back from break he talks about Cuba US
relations with Venezuela Edward Snowden
US drones the legacy of slavery and a
new chapter in nomes
own life stay with us
