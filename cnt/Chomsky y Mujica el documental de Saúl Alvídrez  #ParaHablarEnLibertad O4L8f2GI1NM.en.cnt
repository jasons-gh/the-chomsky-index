I do have directly 
thank you very much 
i but no 
welcome we are all in another to speak freely and this time 
We have the great pleasure of having Alvidres the director with us 
of the long-awaited documentary that I think all of us in this 
transmission we are waiting for chomsky and music thank you very much first 
know by inviting you can accept the invitation and welcome to the networks of 
the brigade to daniela, thank you very much 
true that all the pleasure is mine and well greetings to you and all the people who 
They see us they listen to us still good and I think that for everyone it is 
It is important to know where you come from, not these projects are not born out of nowhere and 
that have to do absolutely with your personal training and port interests 
so I would like you to tell us before anything else is that you studied 
where did you study and it's good to enter 
Well this I am 32 years old I am from Chihuahua but as I was 20 I came 
for here I studied law and economics of Monterrey this 
Well, initially I see it that way, before I was a classic cricket that 
I wanted to do I wanted to be a politician and I dreamed of myself 
of being deputy president and things like that and then I had some experiences 
very strong policies and as a result of that my way of seeing things about 
a whole time I lived in South America for about four years from the 
2014 and well then now I see it is a little different if I have a one line 
and a goal of life without a doubt political but right now what interests me is not 
is to govern the people but that the people govern themselves and well, I am doing everything 
what is possible from different trenches audits the cinema among other things 
Well, we are walking I understand flavor that you studied 
law and economics is the basis and I also think it is important that the 
comment on his passage through the 132 movement that was therefore iconic for everyone not 
in this country I think that talking about 132 is talking about a whole context of everything 
that moved in this country and that were the bases for the change of some u 
otherwise it would be reflected in the ballot box in 2018 yes without a doubt I think 
I think yes I am 132 it is of the dimension that you mention and to me in 
particular in a personal way because it also has a very tint 
important this was a moment in my life that completely transformed me 
Well, you know, on May 11, 2002, a simple campaign Enrique Pena Nieto- 
Fa libero the kids a lot of kids deliberated organized to make a 
demonstration against what the guy represented 
And well to make a short story I communicated with those guys this my 
facebook i made a group called university union in which i 
argued that the four social private schools in this case and tam anahuac and 
tec de monterrey will show solidarity with the 131 kids who uploaded a video 
saying they weren't by or grabbed and showing their ID 
about three days later that group had 90 thousand people on facebook me 
I approached with the kids, deliberated, I suggested that we make a movement that 
It is called I am 132 and that I ran for 22 basic actions this is you 
speaking like May 16 not 15 and that run by two basic lines one 
the rejection of Enrique Pena Nieto for everything he represents and two 
democratization of the media because without media democracy is inconceivable and 
I also suggested that as part of the project we would march on May 18 at 
you televise both San Angel and Santa Fe and that there are different 
light cameras we expected that on May 23 the same thing will be replicated in 
all the public squares of the country and well the response was tremendous 
the movement and then to make the story a little 
short we all know more or less what happened in terms of the 
movement but in my personal experience I without realizing it during a 
month and a half I was followed by a spy of the system a guy called Manuel 
cooked it was known that the guy worked in the cisen until a year after 932 
but what this guy did is that he was stealthily and legally 
recording for a month and a half for not being I imagine that with 
hidden things me and a week before the elections I was actually in 
the capes because I had done there is a matter with the Ecuadorian press I do not 
agreement where it was for the case write there is a letter of 132 and it is going to 
give each president but 5 in the morning of that day which was June 12 
2012 June 18 but they do not speak to me on the phone very early and I 
they say saul look at youtube there are some videos of you i know i dont know what i wear i watch it and 
Before I finish watching the videos, close the computer like a plane and 
return to Mexico City and well in those videos this character with videos with 
talks completely decontextualized and edited in itself 
same with hours and hours of recording I do not know if 
there are many conversations that I am going to identify with many 
different conversations that do not have a coherence in conversation because 
He never answers me, it's basically the bits that I use it and that way 
I posed as a leader in his visible moment of the movement because I was 
first that he worked for lopez obrador which in reality never had much 
felt, although there was a lot of flight in the media because there was no 
financial bond there was nothing at all nothing actually 40 or strong and other than 
I said the word web after each sentence to which the date is already not 
I know a person who talks like that but hey tells me it was my voice they were my 
words and I insist on Wayne now I am not very clear as always saying 
but it was very difficult to defend myself from that, the situation was 
politically unsustainable to me politically they closed all the 
doors the right of the people because they did not approach me to approach me but in that 
moment the left the left also closed ranks this I was like 
that the plagued did not want it to look good for me to appear and with anyone and it was 
very difficult for me even at this moment not to see me 
movement I was posing you want 
transform into a national student federation like the Chilean or something like that 
so that it did not die as an electoral project that was but good and in that 
At the time, it was impossible for me to participate politically because everything was very 
contaminated some groups immediately took me out 
publicly known or possible in a movement of this kind and well 
death threats and a lot of clear things is that you already know and then 
After a while for me it was very difficult and while South America and well there 
I tried to keep growing politically and learning 
So even after all this complicated thing that you lived through being 
victim after social networks because everyone 
We perfectly remember the media scandal, it was how it is from yours 
they said everything that can be invented at that moment make the decision to leave 
to South America and at that time he says is chomsky and mujica or how not exactly 
22 weeks before it started I am 132 my father had passed away and this 
and well from that 
well step 132 with my father step 132 then I had a problem because he did a 
so much business but hey is another story and the fact is that suddenly 
I was in a lot of trouble politically I couldn't participate in 
nothing I wanted to continue doing something for my 132 was in terms of property but 
of feeling it was like my baby was not something that my life has confirmed to me 
that extraordinary things happen and what to tell them by chasing 
So then I decide to go to South America and there I go with doing two things 
trying to promote a project using a technology that 
Right now this technology is already half outdated but at the time in Bolivia 
and Ecuador- I was trying to come up with a technology to radiate internet from 
high quality in areas of difficult access and with low cost I never managed to get 
this project was going ahead but in the process it also got there, a 
computer project that since 2003 I began to develop precisely thinking 
in I am 132 and well I have been trying that for a long time and above all I 
I got to study a lot, a lot of many things from intelligence 
synthetic biology everything that seems to me to be relevant for the next 30 
years and I mean the next 30 years because I think the window we have 
so that our civilization does not collapse if we make the decisions 
correct I deposed is to take care of that a lot and there 
here and although I already knew who they were, I began to study noam in particular 
chomsky pepe mujica and good to identify first that the two 
characters strangely have never met 
second that the characters that I studied were based on everything that 
I personally more admire and consider wiser 
I insist that is my personal opinion and then from that and above all 
identifying that they as two great heads of the story of forgiveness of two 
big heads of the left they have a speech that not necessarily 
went hand in hand with the most important factors ins than on the left in 
the left active in the political left not only theoretical no and that 
message was precisely what the idea commented a bit at the beginning 
not so much to govern the people but that the people govern themselves is not saying what 
It is real democracy and something for example I asked for I learned a lot from them and it is 
to say that democracy is to vote every 4 or 6 years who said everything else is not 
no company and I think that is precisely the key or the possibility that we have 
to avoid this apocalypse that I consider us millennials and 
ante lean are the heirs of that apocalypse while from my point 
in view civilization is ecological, economically, politically and socially 
unsustainable then well the intention after having a lot of 
conversations and by mail from that 
precisely starting with the issue of 632 because after many months I asked him 
that if then I at that time well Ecuador asked him if he could go to 
visit boston haiti i went and talked to him about the computer project that 
I have been developing and for which at that time it is in Ecuador which is 
inspired by pp is inspired by pp and well filled to me and I told him how good 
I considered that both he and Mujica were the two most 
wise that existed and that given the particular concern I have about 
the civilizational collapse seemed to me that the indispensable thing that 
they knew each other and that there was a witness or an element that we 
could make use of the enormous value 
that the wisdom of these characters and well he is also very curious 
I knew what would happen if you got two people like that together and well it was a 
hard work of a long time of much insisting more than anything by stubborn this and 
for many years I was promoting the project until I managed not to 
Managed wife abroad is not going to spend a weekend at Pepe's house we signed it 
this then I started battaglia and then I returned to Mexico and we started 
again with post-production then some financial problems and 
Then I decided to do the kick. People found out it helped us a lot. 
in kickstarter is this page on the internet in the usa where people can 
donate to make a project happen and well fortunately obviously for the 
weight of the characters and how interesting it could be to see them together after we 
The kickstart was very good and we started that was in December and well in January or 
February we resumed post-production unfortunately it arrived 
the coronavirus and that stopped us in several ways because in theory to 
right now I should be finished though first 
you know that the crown lives the world will be another after the 
coronavirus and I did not want this movie to be left behind and expired 
so right now we are just in the process of including those elements of the 
what is coronavirus and things that are present and are not present 
they were necessarily part of the conversation because impossible to know 
when they were pp and not attached we are not including that we have also 
had some delays in the process because there are not some libraries 
closed to get footage and well a series of 
circumstances apart from certain materials to transform that then 
Right now due to the circumstances of the confinement it is not possible but I hope 
that and I also say it as a commercial warning that at the end of this 
year is already ready and what I can assure you is that it will be a movie 
amazing 
Saul, taking up what you just told them, we all agree on 
that we are a generation that is no longer sustainable from neoliberalism or 
ecological, social, or economic, nor in any way has this 
model in the economy but I am very curious 
I think all of us who follow or believe on the left are two 
referents pp and chomsky not each in their own way 
Pepe from the passionate way in which he speaks and transmits to us and is capable of 
tell us that this thing absolutely difficult to understand in a practical way 
it is not brought down by our real life and has an incredible ability to communicate and 
Chomsky that throughout all these years he is the philosopher who most 
still in the world right now tell us what it is like to work with them no 
with the characters but because normally we not only have access 
to them that are what we see in conferences in what we can see 
on their channels but live with them because at the end of the weekend you 
you were with them you talked with them how they are as people well apart 
of the character that can represent yes yes it touched me lucky is a 
blessing for me I fortunately had to spend a lot of time with 
them and as you say at the beginning in effect both are excellent 
excellent communicators communicators with very different styles 
dp I tell him that he is a philosopher poet of the people because precisely they have the 
ability to say the most important things in the simplest words and 
whoever it is, no and well, no, I'm an intellectual of the highest level, no 
is your name your name represents that in itself but well yes 
there are many things that frankly I had to see that it is not that they are not there in 
what one can see from the outside, for example, I can not tell you that 
It is not something that I did not expect it is a guy with a great sense of humor a 
great sense of humor a very warm person very very fine very 
Well the word goes away at this moment for 
a person of tremendous human warmth extremely educated extremely he 
always never gets in the middle never assumes the always I don't know with one 
incredible human quality pp as you say is a lot of passion is an incredible guy 
talking to him is fascinating in this that I can tell you is 
What I know is a guy who inspires is a guy who inspires as much as you are with 
he and as soon as you talk to him is a guy who knows how to generate empathy with you 
incredible and it is just a matter of starting a conversation especially if you raise 
interesting topics and you realize with the two that you are talking to 
monsters today is taste me in some interviews 
who has given about this what the documentary is about I love the part in the 
What are you talking about? They are talking about the two of them globally, but they are not 
speaking only of politics, they do not honor the idea of   the documentary but they speak of the 
love of the society of relationships evidently we gave a spin to a 
geopolitical analysis practically the whole globe analyzes economic models 
stories and many intellectual questions but nevertheless there is clear 
a part a part more introspective not so much intellectual that it was an intention 
very important of the documentary and also for that reason the reason for taking their wives 
and that it was a question of home and more or less cold - stiff than 
allowed characters who had never seen each other to meet 
Obviously who he was and I both tell them they both had a lot they have 
mutually enormous respect in the intention was to look for a more or 
a warmer situation that would allow us to allow 
get to topics like the ones you mention this we talk about what is the 
old age of what is life of what is death of what is the truth of what 
what is love what is justice what it is to have a meaningful life 
that is to say, give meaning to your life and not just let life give you 
carry around and well, many really powerful messages even arrive 
beautiful of both characters personal experiences that I know why 
I have studied them very well that there is nothing out there, we can see for example no 
he's a very hermetic guy in his private life he always has been 
and well here we see him telling stories that I frankly 
I was surprised that he was counting them and laughing and well then what are we going to do 
to see a different perspective of both Saul what you mention seems to me 
important the role that your partners play in your life we   all know what 
this pp spent 15 years in jail we know that his wife lucia is dedicated 
also to politics and that is also involved in this is not publishing 
loose complaint and that he was also in jail 
and so different they are because it is not so much I think that if there is one the wife of 
Lennon is not as public as if she could be the wife of 
Pepe, not them, how did you feel it? How did they participate in the project? 
understood that the recording was made in the house or the little girl I pretended that 
It has pp and it was the same one who looked after them or who made the food 
who was there with you, tell us a little about that if it is correct because the 
The truth is that their participation was something that helped precisely that 
moment out and another much more interesting she yes I know if they withdraw a 
little is to say fundamentally is a conversation 
between the two of them but without a doubt they participate and if indeed it looked, it is the one that 
a famous sanz its famous Uruguayan barbecue very good by the way it was my fortune 
to sit with them at the table to eat and this and if they took great care of us 
the truth is that Lucia is also an extraordinary person with a warmth 
incredible and obviously they were very attentive to Pepe's visit in fact 
against uruguay to fuck not hunger next to uruguay they were news that was new 
mother 
I want to take up a part that you said at the beginning 
where both nadal and music understand the part of what it means 
democracy does not and that power does not reside in being the president and that democracy 
no, she is not going to vote every four every six years but they have very 
Of course, democracy is what what the people themselves were telling us 
is correct if this I think the reflection goes just in that sense in the 
sense that homework and I believe in that sense that millennials homework 
it is my mission in particular is to try to amplify the public debate and focus it 
in the solution of global problems and I believe that the solution of 
global problems come precisely from transferring decision-making power over 
issues of public interest to society that is to say that citizens begin to 
decide as we mentioned beyond deciding every 4 or 6 years who decides 
everything else is obviously not possible or desirable that from 
tomorrow everyone make all the decisions to be made in terms 
public in a country is unfeasible nobody wants that but I think they should 
have a movement that comes from below that comes from the people for that 
I think the revolution is not in government right now, the revolution is in the 
people and the revolution is to convince ourselves and have the tools and the idea in 
head the clarity that decision power must be transferred to the people and 
that is done by organizing ourselves and little by little starting I don't see why 
you can't decide what time the street lights turn off 
or at what time does the garbage happen little by little I even think that beyond that in 
that will appeal that what is lacking is education what is lacking is practice 
politics what is lacking is getting involved being part of the decisions empowering 
about that and learn as decisions are made because if not what 
we have is a system where very few people a handful a few hundred 
people all over the planet when we are almost eight million people every day 
these are the decision-makers and that is what has achieved good that 
we as a civilization as a species do not attend to the needs of 
our group simply cater to the needs of the guidelines of a 
small group that is the one that controls practically everything that is what 
orders human civilization and from there to attend only to these 
needs of those interests of tiny domes since we as a species 
we are putting aside vital needs 
as clean water or as clean air or as the possibility of being 
relatively humble minded happy don't you know right now suicide rates and 
well we can start mentioning crises everywhere right now 
So even if we understood the project, it had to be because it would have to 
not having left earlier this year but I travel to berlanga in the middle of this 
year but because of what happened to the quabit pandemic they decided to stop it so that 
during this in the documentary there was also participation of pepe and des 
hommes that talking about the pandemic or is just going to be an addition that 
doing that is precisely one of the issues that we are seeing how we are going to 
include the topic of the coronavirus and some other things and yes, above all 
I will tell you as soon as some things are reactivated in some libraries that 
are needed to be able to continue with the project because we advance but 
almost assured that by the end of this year it will be ready 
Hey, I was struck by the work team with which the 
documentary could you tell us about who is with you so that everyone 
Let's know the quality of the people who are involved in this project, yes of course 
yes, just let me turn on the light for a second 
better this yes look me good I am director and producer of the film now 
turn there are two other producers and stacy perskie a very large product very very 
interesting movies like james bond godzilla bad boys for life 
Breitbart nerd things of that level and Maria and a friend also a producer and 
recently two other very tall characters have joined the team 
level in the film industry one is free swat who is one of the 
best editors in mexico and the other is lucia gaja, a documentary director 
from the hollywood academy and amazing mexican incredibly talented and 
well, together we are right now working very hard to make this 
project as I tell you how I tell you you can leave and at the end of the year and what 
I can also assure you its weaving a little in the characters that I am 
saying they are supporting us this is going to be great material 
hear how the cinematographer maria seco got involved in the project 
forgive me forgive me how is it possible how is it possible and from here I send you a kiss 
huge and I apologize that it was one of the fundamental parts of 
this project mariah seco maria seco a photographer 
Uruguayan, by the way, this was the one who helped them from the beginning since this 
project always went to talk because he vibrated and looked and they just entered 
just a short time ago but but if Maria did a job 
amazing and she was her we contacted her through stacy perskie precisely 
because it seemed to us that he was the ideal character for a project like this and wow 
that your work was amazing today during some interviews that you have 
given to another medium you said that this documentary had a dedication to 
julian assange if it is correct that with the character 
I would say maybe after the pp and not am he would 
I am the one who most admire the third character the most, I think I most admire 
and precisely on the day that he took this unemployed manuel stopped he met the audios 
the one with the cisen precisely found the one that Julian entered into 
London to the Ecuadorian descent and if he seems to me the revolutionary of our 
Times seems to me to be a reference that must be fundamental for millennials 
and the previous ones and I am very sorry and I am very concerned about knowing the 
situation in which it is and all the powers that it has over and go well it is 
a guy we should be stuffing medals with and 
unfortunately I'm locked in a room like I'm not a hero 
of journalism but quite the opposite and we know that at any moment 
he can die, both things cannot kill him 
and well, I think it's a fight that has to continue because 
unfortunately although problems are not made in what is the debate 
public or what is handled in the discourse in the discourse of the status quo 
Well, sometimes things as important as these are lost but nevertheless 
for me that theme has not lost its validity and I think that this character 
we have to go out for him he has to go out and he has to have our support from 
somehow I can't do much that I wanted and go to jail and 
get it out of there but at least that's the least we can do 
Saul I would like to know what is your opinion of the role of the 4th I think that in 
at some point you were very undisputed in the politics of this country that you think 
that it may be that the government could be better I never like to speak in 
negative I like it I can say it could be better without a doubt any 
government could always be better because I don't think there is a perfect government 
Well, there are no perfect citizens either, but nevertheless I think it is 
a blessing that there has been a change in the country is a blessing something is 
had to stir the waters the thing was too toxic and evidently 
the country that runs through this new one that collects this new administration is a 
burning country that is happening to you all at the same time literally everything is a 
very difficult situation this seems to me that there are some things that were due 
of having handled some issues better, some handling of issues such as feminism 
I don't really like the way the president handles this issue and so 
I can get some some as I hope but I certainly think I think 
we still have to give it a chance that this project is not 
I would say being born but it already has a little more considerable time but 
It is a project that has very interesting ambitions and 
precisely through what said what the Argentine president said that only 
There are two in America that are trying to change 
the world or not is he and the other and doctor andres manuel lopez obrador i 
i think she's definitely trying to make a change i hope that's 
possible I think the truth is that what I never liked is that he can understand 
politically but in the heart there are not many dark people that I did not like 
to participate which seems to me to undermine the leadership of 
Until recently, a brunette seemed to me an aberrant fatal fatal thing at such a level 
that I better say that if I have nothing to do with that I hope I know 
take the appropriate measures this is a historical process and a responsibility 
history that this party has and that I believe unfortunately even if it 
there are a huge amount of very valuable people I think they have not yet 
managed to tighten the nuts that are necessary for it to be a 
instrument of democracy beyond andres manuel lopez obrador I don't know if 
brunette can can do something beyond lopez obrador i say obviously going 
is going to monopolize many spaces of power but but I think internally it makes 
much improvement remains, I think it was lasting very slowly and I think the country did not 
it is for him for that it is for more and it is what they are waiting for, not this avalanche 
of non-federal votes Saul normally during these 
broadcasts we also give the floor to colleagues through chat and 
then all can read some questions and we will continue with the 
interview but so that they do not stay in the air, ask the xxi how to ensure 
that the teachings of the un and pepe are applied in this transformation in 
our good country to assure seems to me a very 
strong because we would have to enter as dictators without getting off that everything 
world do what you want and that is not necessarily desirable but what 
what can be done is to try to make it heard as far and as loudest and loudest 
possible that is not why I chose the cinema I think it is a good window in these 
moments and especially when the target is millennials and centennial to leave 
that seed to leave the message now because I say it cannot be assured 
because you can sow a seed in the middle of what is possible but take care of it 
water it germinate line and wait until there are fruits and responsibility of 
each then from my point of view the most that can be done is 
find valuable messages by dispersing as much as possible in the best way 
as I told you my mission in life, I widely consider it to be 
amplify public debate and focus it on solving global problems but 
I insist this is everyone's thing and only if we all participate will it be possible 
that we move forward in relation to what you are commenting on 
there are several questions on the same topic on which platform you plan to do the 
documentary or if it is going to make movies or it is going to be netflix amazon they have that 
part is going to be one of those that one of those you comment on is the one that 
diffusion has the one that offers the greatest diffusion but I comment on that more 
go ahead but you will be available for everything 
They also ask what other topics you are interested in making documentaries 
a very interesting question because now that I'm with this movie thing too 
being in South America I tell him that you made me see a lot many songs of 
technology and social trends that are seen in the programs I am was 
focused on 2020 or 2050 precisely because of this the minute global collapse and 
Well right now this there I also had the luxury of writing a series a series 
from television this one I cannot advance much right now we are already playing 
the is a very ambitious project I would say without detracting from the size of 
the characters of course but it is a much more ambitious project than chomsky 
mujica in terms of everything the production and quantity represents 
of characters to participate etc. but hey what I can tell you is that 
right now we are because I am producing a 
the new series a very high level television series is but with a view 
and that it can reinforce precisely this intention to continue 
focusing on amplifying the debate the debate the public conversation about the 
solutions to global problems and well, as I was saying, we talked a lot about 
technology of the new circumstances that may arise from 
these technological disruptions how it changes how morality changes how 
ethics changes how the concept of being civilized changes, I am sure that in 
ten years the concept of being civilized is going to be something very different from what it is 
today and well the series touches many of these 
themes and the intention is therefore to start producing next year 
serena asks us or in which the thought of music and Trotsky converge in 
three words 
no doubt good but say real democracy 
Saul I see that you are very interested in the subject and in the idea that as a generation 
We only have this 30-year window of opportunity to take the 
adequate decisions that do not lead us to succumb as a species 
because you think that apart from the obvious what we all live from all that 
we know that ecologically you are unsustainable 
of the world but to you personally who gets to say that good as you mention 
We all know everything that is evident when you start to study the 
depth you scare more outside of that than intellectual 
I feel I feel that if we are almost on board and I think that and in this 
case because it seems to me that the best that you can not the most interesting that they can 
to do with your life is to try to avoid something like that. 
possible there are times that I am optimistic times that not so much but 
quite a few comments during the chat saying they are waiting for the 
documentary and what a great idea that can be contacted there is no app I think also 
it would be nice to encourage them so things are not impossible 
clearly, maybe all of us would have the idea that it is not impossible that 
pp before a message that is not going to read something that you write and for your 
experience we see that the topics were not assigned what matters is the topic 
that potential guests are asked to chilli people with the 
that one wants to talk I think that is one of the things that you leave us 
documentary is knowing that these characters are not unattainable for most 
of us and I believe that I believe that everything is 
impossible until you go and do it and I think the way to break that 
barrier is certainly determination to know what you are doing and why you are 
doing because only then can you fall in love with something to 
enough desire and what it takes to do the essentials until it happens 
and the second is tenacity I say it humbly is what I is what I 
I believe and the truth is that I had an advantage, well, from a very young age I have always 
I had more or less idea of   what I am passionate about and from there it always grabbed me 
no and that helps me but also the experience I am 132 as I told you 
I separated from the tremendous media kick they gave me 
I also learned that amazing and extraordinary things happen to 
ordinary people when you do something with the heart not then that and about 
all too that the way it ended for me and the fact of knowing 
that I was a pissed off politician thinking about myself the worst I lost confidence 
of a lot of people nobody nobody in the political sphere everybody closed me 
the doors there were many people who believed that they really was it was because 
more or less what those audios painted and it was very difficult for me and I even 
until a few years later I got over it, I think, but for a long time that 
left too marked that changed my life because for me it was personally 
very strong I also think that's why I left the country and well, I grabbed hold of that 
courage and ides at the beginning it was I wanted to make wayne very big something 
important again to vindicate myself little by little because I matured it 
and I just took that desire to do the things that I was passionate about, not so much 
thinking about erasing what I thought at the time 
that it was going to be indelible and that I knew I did not deserve it and that it 
horrible heart but well I think that is what to take from those of the defeats 
take strength and if if you get up from a very big defeat it can lift you very 
high how beautiful this is the super incredible 
that they say these things later every time something happens to them we believe that it is the end of 
world and that we are not going to get up from those things if life continues no 
Then you have to stop and what follows, Maria de Lourdes asks us if you 
would like to participate in politics again at some point as you 
I commented from the beginning, I, my way of doing politics and what will be 
here in front it is not seeking to rule the people but I want the people to 
rule herself then for me party politics is not an option 
I want to organize people but size but not organize it I know with the 
that people organize, this is not my thing, I will always be giving my 
opinions I from 132 and since always I say what I think this and I will 
participate in me as much as possible because with this with the cinema with the software that I go 
to take out in about two months is interesting I know I will tell you and well I will 
to try that but no I do not want to rule the people lately 
who seeks to govern in general, there is no longer me, too, I think I think the 
grid is something that I detest, I know many people who are doing politics and not 
This has no objective other than to be a politician yes and that seems to me 
emptier than there is and 99% of the people who are in politics are people who want 
power is people who want to rule others are people who see themselves on the stage and 
you feel that in that photo he would be important to a large number of people 
that is in politics, unfortunately it is like that I have had to see it in many 
countries and I'm not like that and I don't like it 
endure those partisan logics that this is the leader and the leader who possesses 
say no then I the truth what I invite you especially those who are very 
crickets we have to find different ways 
to do politics because if it is not 30 years the revolution will not be there 
the change is not there 
it is evident although I am certainly glad that there has been this 
change that lopez obrador is in the presidency, it is evident that the 
won Lopez Obrador the presidency is not going to save the world, it is not true at all 
more likely in the air when lopez obrador finishes he will not save the 
country of the level in which we are maybe the best hopefully not but then I know 
install there is the key fact you aspire to make a new great work lopez 
because it seems to me that he is a ney type he is intelligent, very hardworking and sincere 
but the world needs another type of revolutionaries the revolutionary of the 
21st century is not who takes power to distribute it is who distributes power without 
take it 
Of course, if the idea is that we suddenly have deep roots in amd in America 
Latina of caudillismo I think it is time to leave it and know that where it goes 
to be the change is in an organized civil society but good coming back 
Alicia Rodriguez asks us after these great thinkers live together 
actors on the left do you think they want Mexico 
we have the opportunity to travel is to travel there this administration 
it is just open the door we can achieve something in effect it is just open the 
door and surely things will be achieved I believe that there are already some achievements 
important, for example, I am very pleased that large companies and 
start paying taxes for example for saying something or the big cuts the 
austerity came to me here, I also told about some problems and some 
disorders in some cases but hey I think there have been important changes 
but they will never be enough we will never be in the best place always 
it is a permanent process because change is constant and what we can 
wait or what we should do rather is take advantage of this circumstance 
history of change that allows certain things to happen but lopez obrador 
I insist he will not be able to change the world much less but he will not be able to 
change the country only us the world in general needs to move from this 
capitalism which is one that capitalism is a culture 
it is not just a system it is much stronger than that culture it is stronger than 
even armies and this capitalist culture is 
individualistic and competitive think individualistic and competitive is a 
completely antisocial formula well that is the model that governs us and 
we have to move from that individualistic and competitive culture to 
a collaborative collective culture yes and for and that is precisely why the 
change the revolution has to come from the masses and the agent organizing 
because we have to move to the collaborative collective and that alone 
it works it does not work when someone arrives and they say this is done like this 
It works when people get fed up, they say I'll do it myself and that's what 
needs Mexico and humanity in general 
Of course I think what you say is important to pass from thought 
individual to collective thought not at the moment we remove the chip 
As long as it doesn't affect me that the world burns, I think that at that moment we will arrive 
to advance in many ways as your life there is even something more dangerous 
still well, I hardly eat meat and I always throw the garbage in the can 
So let the world burn, ham or brother, reach me with that and you think 
I use an electric car because the world is not enough with that 
finishing and we need you to go out and organize with the people and 
that they solve the problems of your colony and that they save and if not 
enough for them to organize themselves with the colony right away and that 
create a collective organization from the grassroots that of and if I go running and 
Yes I am and I am a very conscious millennial that I do not know that I love them 
the puppies and adopting is not much more than that the situation is much more serious 
that what worries me when you see human history is that we are not 
we are very good for the short term to plan in the short term and it is 
positive that sometimes I am half pessimistic but that you have to feel like it because 
you have to do as much as you can hear they ask us in relation to the government 
This is the future that you see for Mexican cinema 
Mexican cinema is in a very good moment, the industry in general is in 
a very good moment because the model is the model of streaming platforms 
hain implies that there is a lot and there is a lot 
need for many materials because people are consuming a lot of one 
much faster and that is why this industry seems to me to be something very 
interesting because there is the opportunity to enter certain information that 
necessarily kiss but in Mexican cinema in particular and I think 
to begin with, it is evident that there is a lot of talent and it is not just these three 
directors, that is, there are producers, there are writers, there is Mexico, it's very talented 
not for nothing do we have the tremendous history and the tremendous culture that we have to 
we have that that that that is not part of what this country gives this wealth to its 
great creativity to its great artistic nature in short I think it is a great 
At the moment, I hope that the government also has all the support 
Incentives are needed because because not only baseball is not very good 
that supports that and many other things but I think that cinema is a branch 
important to develop one's own society, especially if 
you're talking about cool things it's not being done by reality shows 
of people yes of course maybe it would be important 
emphasize that it is understood and to whom they had been supported lately in the 
cinema or what kind of projects are those that were sponsored by the 
government and well, we'll see what happens with the cuts in that area but 
I do think it is important to say that if a review had to be made 
people to whom the money was being given and the type of projects to which 
is sponsoring the state that the state we are all are not ours 
taxes and it is super clear and super good that we all have interference from 
know to whom it is given and why it was almost always given to them clear 
Well, like all the things the government did before, this post was pure 
piggy and of course you have to lift the mat everywhere and sweep it 
well the cinema the organisms that play the cinema do not 
must be the exception and well if I hope that this way in the 
The film industry and everything else in Mexico is gradually being refined in 
that sense seems to me very interesting the obsession that lopez has 
work with the issue of corruption I think it has been consistent with this 
theme in particular and well, I hope they are that is heard louder and that 
go ahead and go ahead miguel macedo asks us if you don't fancy doing 
a second part a mujica change spoke 
I think it would have to be something different you 
I spoke quite logically about amlo there are many things that I have there that are not 
out there they talk a lot also with not talk much about andres manuel and 
of Mexico in particular of the circumstance that is lived and what 
It would not have to happen for a country like this to get ahead 
unfortunately the short version of the documentary will not be able to put this 
part of Mexico because literally not every time I have many hours of 
graduation but I'm going to do a broader section where a 
a little more of this but hey that's a good idea and there are several ideas 
I say on the way this I the truth I'm not putting this the cinema with everything 
I say we are starting a very interesting series then it has never done like this 
as champ means in some way and well, interesting projects come and 
I'm going to talk to you, you'll see 
they also ask us if you are doing a particular action to 
try to help make the case of gil arias h visible 
Well the most I can do today right now is say well right now 
especially when the film is finished is when I have a microphone 
above to be able to talk about the subject and say that it is dedicated to this 
character outside of that is the cause of getting Julian out of jail 
Julian Causes on Transparency Convey transparency in the 
democratization of information privacy all these are issues that 
on all the other projects I'm working on double is practical well in 
everyone is that philosophy inside as with what as lions mujica everything is with 
all you can do is not consistent with well with these three 
characters that is what I try with these three characters that I so much 
I admire and I admire them precisely because the three of them are 
huge and beautiful coincidences too and very inspiring 
especially because they themselves as characters beyond their speech 
they are has a level of congruence such that they themselves physically de 
flesh and blood represent that either simply by their trajectory and that 
for me it is a huge impact and hates this question manu comment 
that reach us has to do with what you are saying and it gives saints what 
great opportunity and responsibility to communicate the options they find 
these great thinkers so that ordinary mortals can participate in 
this change 
They have put me like this but the truth is that if I feel a great responsibility to 
fact at times that I felt tremendous pressure because when I could 
making a mistake can't go wrong but well, I imagine that's normal 
apart this is my first film is my first film but I am completely 
sure and as I see the progress, this has turned out very well and 
by my doing but because as we said from the beginning the characters both 
They are exceptional communicators and that makes things much easier. 
quite a few complications with the language issue because by the way he does not speak 
Spanish Pepe does not speak English so there is an issue but it is a great 
responsibility and therefore I hope to be at the height and measure in you 
to close this interviews they still ask us if you think that this 
we are living with the crisis with the pandemic is the end at last but the 
capitalism I don't think it's the end of capitalism 
this first because I do not see another well structured and powerful option in 
no area of   the world well we can talk about china but we will also talk 
of capitalism with its variants I do not believe that unfortunately if a 
tightening of the states especially with the arrival of certain 
new technologies are much discussed and given mind they will be first where 
there is always power I believe that I believe that a time is coming 
particularly harsh I don't think the coronavirus is definitely coming to 
comes to lift that mat and show all the rottenness of this system and 
put it beyond neoliberal and apart many circumstances trump the 
break sheet many things are marking a change of time in that sense but 
I do not think that from this everything will start to improve no no no no 
I believe I precisely believe that what has to be is a lot of conscience 
first of the problems and possible solutions, so I insist I believe that the 
mission should be to try to amplify the public conversation and focus on the 
solution of global problems then the first thing is a lot of awareness and 
second indispensable a lot of action and the third 
that this action is collective you only there compadre you are not going to change the world 
Hey, I would like to know your opinion, you talk a lot about responsibility 
that we have as a generation evaluate the generations left behind us 
what do you think about what happened in the trump campaign was not very viral 
the matter that at his start of the campaign he was waiting for the crowds and 
seas of people and how the millennials organized not to sabotage their event 
and that it was basically which its closest site not situations like 
Those without a doubt all of us who are on this side fill us with emotion and 
expectations sometimes not but sorry for being so pessimistic or changing it so 
quick look what happened with sanders of course this is possible or yes of course 
There are many people in the United States there are many people awake in many people very 
valuable this those who are asleep are also valuable but it would be more 
valuable if they weren't, the point is that 
unless i don't know maybe it's all new floyd and black light matter case 
I do not know something has to happen but but I am not necessarily very 
convinced that this is going to happen in the usa 
I hope so because that would imply a huge change but he blocked me 
just happened with with with bernie sanders that practically sensed me 
this because it comes to reinforce it, it comes to sit us again in the 
earth and tell us this is the deep state of the us this is how this organism works this 
This is what you can, this is what you can't and this is what you should be able to 
later is to say that the fight continues, I'm not saying that it is 
that bernie sanders participation has not historically transformed 
many things in fact he is creating a new electorate that is going to be bigger 
still in the next elections but well let's see I think there is a lot to 
do and leave with the US they end up doing a lot because there are many people out there without 
They arrive at Lopez Obrador, the left has already won, so we are already on the road 
correct correct is that we all 
Let's change for the things that belong to everyone and it is no longer lopez himself 
Obrador has said it many times, that is, they want to prosecute presidents 
they want to do this in the people who organize themselves 
can not yet it has not happened to you that when you already knew that you will have the opportunity the 
opportunity to be with pepe and chomsky you said I'm going to talk about this 
theme of this theme of this theme and throughout the emotion and what you recorded will be 
There was some issue in the inkwell that I am already in the position well, notice that not good 
to begin with I was with them several times before they met 
and we had the opportunity to talk a lot and well, the truth is that I 
I was also very prepared that it was all I wanted to play more than that. 
I think that rather what happened is that things happened that I did not have 
planned and that were of enormous value in vicky I did not know what will happen or 
that what had occurred to me to ask I explain myself as for example if 
these personal stories that they drew from any topic and from 
suddenly stories of enormous historical value and if I believe it was more that 
more than that I have forgotten what it is that we had many problems when 
beginning with the translation in fact we have a translator and at the beginning we 
it worked like this good at the beginning first bring some chicharitos here 
then they did not have enough volume and they did not hear thread after we removed them and 
the translator came in the translator was very slow very professional but very slow 
then later I got into the conversation and then there I was between 
directing and translating, I trained my pp and he was half run over 
medium complicated but luckily it turned out very well 
Saul and to finish they ask us in the chat what do you like the most and what 
It is the type of cinema that you see 
what do I like the most about good cinema in life than what I like the most 
in general, I really enjoy these topics having interesting conversations 
meet people who have done things that interest me and that I am passionate about and 
above all this I am looking for how to fix big problems not because I 
I consider myself very great but I believe that I have death very much in mind and 
I am very convinced that tomorrow may be the last no and yes too 
that you only live once I'm not particularly in one 
religion in a particular belief in that sense then I think 
What to do is take advantage of the time that is obtained in the best way 
what is trying to do something positive for others not or something like that 
[Music] and the cinema the cinema the cinema that most 
I like to watch well notice that I really like science fiction 
You some season in which I like the horror ones, the bad thing is the horror ones 
that very few are good very few are good this I like comedy but I 
The same thing happens with terror the lagoon from which all rocks I know 
all of pedro infante for example jorge negrete this that time of cinema 
I am fascinated by this Mexican grade sign and well there are some pearls too 
out there but but hey, the truth is that at the cinema, I'm not a passionate cinephile 
lately it has put me much more especially to learn but to me the most 
nothing I like is when I see something that has important content something 
that leaves you that leaves you something that you did not have before seeing it not then me 
admires and I approach the cinema, this is how it interests me that the content 
be something from another world and then we see how we make production be 
something amazing especially is a beginner somehow still in 
I'm telling people who know the most, but what nurtures me the most is putting a 
plate on the table that has something truly valuable 
yes of course I am I am convinced that in particular art has to move you 
that you have to go out with something different after seeing a movie or a play 
of theater reading something that has to move you and that is the beauty of art and that 
type of expressions and yes when you are the spectator I think that when you are 
who produces it who creates it you have and especially if you are going to make art I would say 
that in anything in life any job they do but you have 
to be in love with that because it is very difficult I can maybe do in another 
talk but the truth is that for me to get into these kinds of projects 
in fact life is very complicated because not necessarily all the 
world supports you, I had already had a habitat for a while today, I'm 32 years old 
hey sauli what are you doing not with your cited software and a movie and I don't know what 
put hand as well as what to see there is a movie that destroys I'm about
