Radio Free Maine presents noam chomsky
speaking on breaking the myth an expose
of the exploitative mechanisms that
underlie the international political
economy February 13 1996 Brandeis
University watham Massachusetts the
title that was announced is rather tall
order and I can't possibly try to do
more than chip away a bits and pieces of
it which is what I'll do and I hope you
please feel free and discussion to pick
up the threads or things I've gotten to
and so on which they'll be made well the
first point that bears mention is that
any discussion of the International in
any discussion of the international
economic order is that it's always
closely related through the domestic
socio-economic word of course it's
related in different ways for different
kinds of places so take say the Western
Hemisphere actually measured but I
suppose one of the smallest countries if
that's what it is and the Western
Hemisphere is Bermuda but even Bermuda
is closely related to the internal order
is closely related to the international
economic order in fact in pretty
dramatic ways though maybe the smallest
country in the hemisphere Bermuda
happens to be the largest recipient of
US foreign investment in the hemisphere
foreign direct investment back last I
looked about a quarter of it went to
Bermuda well that's not because we're
building lots of factories and Bermuda
and that sort of thing it's because
Bermuda is a well-known tax haven so if
you have a lot of if you're a bank and
you want to make an industry or money
or something like that and you have
problems where you don't want anybody to
have a look at them you invest its
what's called investing in Bermuda and
in fact if you add the other tax havens
like say the Cayman Islands and so on
you get pretty close to 50% of the total
US foreign direct investment in the
hemisphere so if we look at the pennies
little spots we choose in fact often
more so than the tiniest ones we find
that they're international that they're
a domestic economy happens to be late
and quite intriguing ways that are worth
pursuing the international economy well
going to the other extreme in the
hemisphere it's United States is far and
away the richest and most powerful
country in fact in the world parallel to
it so turn to the United States
I hear there's all kinds of links
between the domestic socio-economic
order and the international political
economy one of those links which is
particularly worth noting is one that
was actually well I mean in the case of
the United States it's plainly going to
be overwhelming because of its power the
same was true England before it but in
the case of the United States
particularly since 1945 though the
richest and most powerful country in the
world long before and say by the turn of
the century had by far the largest
economy in the world it wasn't really
until the second world war that the
United States became a major player in
the international scene in fact the
designer of the post-war international
order as the United States out of
self-interest assumed responsibility for
the welfare of the world capitalist
system actually those words aren't mine
I'm quoting a well known diplomatic
historian Gerald Haines
also happens to be senior historian at
the CIA in an important
they respected an interesting book on
the u.s. some latin america and the post
word and the comment is correct the
united states it assumed out of
self-interest responsibility for the
welfare of the world capitalist system
it's only almost correct to make it
actually correct we have to add a
correction that the traces back how far
but at least as far as adam smith
someone we're taught to revere and
worship but not the read because he's
interesting to read one of the things
that pointed out and wealth of nations
is that there's no such thing as wealth
of nations doesn't make any sense rather
a nation you have to in order to discuss
the wealth of england which is primary
interest obviously three hundred years
ago live i after through what's later
called class analysis you have to
recognize that england isn't in it
rather as he put it the merchants and
manufacturers who were the principal
architects of state policy in england
made sure that their own interests were
most peculiarly attended to no matter
how Grievous the impact on other
colonies but also the people of england
and then correct that's necessary that
truism which is what it ought to be that
comes right up into the present in fact
only in fairly recent years that these
words have been completely unspeakable
so to take the leading american social
philosopher of the twentieth century
John Dewey who was incidentally great
out of mainstream America American as
apple pie famous phrase for him that was
equally a truism that politics in his
words it's a shadow cast by big business
over society and if you do things that
attenuate the shadow you won't really
affect the substance you change very
much and that required as he felt but
this again goes way back in American
history
it requires Democratic control of
investment decisions and commerce and in
fact every aspect of life
democracy are also gonna have only very
limited democracy well these are truisms
of American workers and their
independence or 150 years ago we're
writing that sort of thing without the
benefit of any radical intellectuals and
their truisms because they're obvious so
I apologize to you for saying what's
obvious but what's obvious is that when
we talk about England or the United
States or whatever we have to ask
whether we're talking about the
principal architects of policy and the
substance that casts the shadow in Adam
Smith stays the merchants and
manufacturers and our days huge
transnational corporations and financial
institutions and they play their own
game and they're the ones so making that
correction to Hansen's comment what in
fact happened is that after the second
world war the Masters of the domestic
economy in the United States out of
self-interest assumed responsibility for
the welfare of the financial and
industrial institutions of state of
corporate state capitalism and they
determined to use the state power that
they could control the shadow that they
cast by for their own end however three
that's the impact on others including
their own population well a lot of
modern history actually follows almost
directly from these truisms and when we
make these slight Corrections we begin
at least to approach the real world as
seen incidentally from a rather
conservative perspective I haven't been
quoting far-out radicals but actually
the most conservative traditional
thinkers when you go to a radical
critique it's much sharper and we're far
reaching but I'll keep the conservative
side of the spectrum here the well going
to the US dominated global economic
order that was crafted after World War
two the United States was in a position
of unparalleled combination planners
knew it and they designed a world never
seen before
and one of their goals as they assumed
responsibility for the welfare of the
financial and industrial corporations
was one of the effects was not
surprisingly that the
design that they laid out led to an
enormous worth of overseas investment
and in fact was the basically the
groundwork for the contemporary
multinational corporation
at first they were mostly American for
reasons of wealth and power gradually as
Europe and Japan reconstructed the war
in parchment their own ways and they
there's a distribution reflecting power
they're still primarily American us well
the about 25 years ago there were
substantial changes in this
international order and they'd like to a
still closer integration of the
international and the domestic
socio-economic orders a phenomenon that
sometimes called globalization here the
connections are of a different sort oh
yeah
but when we look at the international
order at the United States we
increasingly find similar structures
because something is indeed getting
internationalize in fact what I think
it's getting internationalized there's
if you take any third world Society they
always have basically the same structure
there's a small sector of great wealth
and opulence sometimes extraordinary
there's a large mass of people who are
somewhere between suffering and total
misery and there's a big superfluous
population much to do with wealth
production theory that's what and the
United States is coming more inward to
resemble its name with written
there's nothing about markets or
anything like that it's perfectly
conscious and perfectly natural social
policy on the part of the Masters Adam
Smith we'll see new and said follow what
he called there by all maxim namely
all for ourselves and the thing for
anyone else masters of men have the
power to implement that social policy
that's precisely what any rational
person at least the good old-fashioned
conservative like Adam Smith would take
for granted all right so those that's
might do what the globalization is and
coming back to it as we proceed well
about 25 years ago the globalization
which isn't new it's different form it
took out a new form a different form
different not so slightly significantly
different form realm 19-7 there were a
lot of reasons for it but basically what
the crucial thing that happened is that
part of the design of the post World War
system was no longer sustainable by the
Masters of the American it was very
official it was organized in a way which
was highly beneficial to them one of the
things that was beneficial was the
central point was the regulated
financial market international
currencies were regulated after World
War Two that's agreement and they were
regulated in such a way as to make the
dollar more or less the international
you know making us the International
Bank so the dollar was for anything the
dollar of the dollar was fixed relative
to gold gold and other currencies were
regulated relative to the dollar
in fact the first the earliest role of
the famous IMF was to do sort of slight
adjustments and currencies that were
made when there were recessions well
that was the International economy up
until 1974 the financial core of it and
that role for the dollar making the
United States you know the world banker
was to a large extent was very
beneficial to us based industry and
gracious in fact with a large part of
the reason for the vast expansion of US
base
the national corporate structures
however by around 1970 was being hard
harder and more costly to the United
States again when I say the United
States I mean the decision-making sector
the principal architects of policy in
Smith's shortening the it was becoming a
partner for them to sustain this rule
and when you rule the world you make
rules so they just said the game's over
Richard Nixon just unilaterally
dismantled international financial
markets were within three years
regulated there was a theory around free
market capitalism and according free
market theory this was going to be
terrific it's gonna stabilize everything
everything to be regulated the best of
all possible worlds it's called chaos
and financial markets sharp casino
economy with enormous fluctuations and
but things did change in many ways
always one thing to change is simply a
huge explosion of financial capital in
the world I mean it's just shot up the
astronomical scale the last time the
World Bank tried to measure the Tres
years ago they estimated about 14
trillion dollars of which about a
trillion dollars a day it moves from one
exchange to another crosses moves around
it's mostly awful lot of it being used
for speculation against currencies very
small scale speculation that's why when
you go to a place like MIT where they
have corporate recruiters coming around
PhDs in mathematics and physics these
come from General Electric and so on but
last year 25 percent of them came from
Wall Street looking for mathematics and
physics PhDs
about Wall Street but configure at all
sorts of complicated scammed that you
can use for minuscule shifting around of
this trillion-dollar today to make a
little money and on the side that's
happening in England well if you go back
and not only did the amount of exploded
scale but it also changed radically
character
so around 1970 it was estimates but the
standard estimate was that about ninety
percent of the capital in international
exchanges was related to the real
economy was for investment like that
about ten percent was speculated by 1990
after less than twenty years that's
because it reversed about ten percent
was really economy related ninety
percent was speculated the last figures
that were put out by it was 95 percent
speculative and five percent slightly
different numbers but qualitatively
that's standard estimate right now and
that's of a far bigger pool than in 1970
because huge explosion well as I say
some of the predictions worked out the
opposite of the way they were supposed
to but some of them worked out as was so
early on in fact in the late seventies
was already recognized in 1978 the
presidential address of the American
Economic Association was given by James
Tobin it was on this topic and he
pointed out that this the effect of this
by now already obvious a huge growth in
speculative capital was going to drive
the world towards a low growth low wage
equilibrium also very high profit
because this money is looking for low
growth you can see that when you read
the business pages
terrifies financial markets or you know
unemployment rise in his stocks go up
and that sort of thing the so he
predicted that we would be moving
towards low growth period of low growth
and low wages and high profits which
means sharper inequalities in fact the
move towards what in fact is a structure
which is pretty much what's been
happening for the past twenty years
dramatically so I there was recently a
study run by Paul Volcker who was a head
of the Federal Reserve under Reagan
which tried to look into the fact it's
well known that growth has lowered since
that point it's been much international
considerably lower since that time and
they estimated that about half of the
decline in growth rates was just due to
the increase in the flow of speculative
financial capital I
Tobin also had a proposal as to what to
do with about this simple-minded it
straight forward proposal that is that
you put a tax on speculative on short
term speculative transcripts like
speculation against currencies short
term transfers of the kind of air
exploding you put a slight tax to the if
you put a tax on them it'll slow down
the exchange the bigger the tax inward
will slow it down he's a team yes work
it out but a small tax would in fact
slow it down enough so you have more
capital going into the really gun not
just driving everything driving the
economy down which is what this stuff is
doing Tobin tax ever since then been on
the UN Agenda since that time although
there have been some calculations as to
what the consequences would be
they're pretty rough like all the
numbers that are thrown around one
recent estimate is you had a tax of one
half of one percent on speculative flows
it's quite small it would yield on the
order of a trillion and a half dollars a
year a sense of what some of these
numbers mean US gross domestic product
is around seven trillion a year of which
one one seventh
about a trillion dollars is spent on
marketing marketing means deceit and
manipulation and furthermore this
roughly trillion dollars on marketing is
for the most part tax-deductible which
means that the population pays with the
privilege of being propagandized and
that's so those are the just as a
background to sort of talk what scale
we're talking about I against that
background there's an estimate of
measure which would come from a very
small Tobin tax
transfers and that would also have
whatever effect it would have on slowing
down the weapons that are driving the
world down to low growth and low wages
and sharp inequalities well just to see
what you could do with the trillion and
a half dollars a year pursuing the
estimates that's that would eliminate
the annual debt payment for the third
world incidentally the debts are going
up not down as they really program began
15 years ago so freely nine half dollars
a year would eliminate the debt
repayments which are a huge burden most
of the world they would provide basic
health care to the whole population of
the world which would estimated for
example cut infant mortality by about
50%
these are here through the numbers are
not trivial UNICEF in its latest report
estimated that the number of children
who die from easily treatable diseases
assault or something has risen from 11
million a year which is what was the
previous year the 13 million a year and
they could be saved for pennies a day
the estimate if the master said
and didn't have something else on their
mind the same for the half dollars I
could also provide the universal access
to safe drinking water which most of the
world doesn't have which is an enormous
factor in deaths and disease and misery
and so on it could provide primary
education for the whole world including
literacy crime specifically for women
most of the world also family planning
and it's a well-known fact that family
planning women's literacy rights in
general is the major factor that leads
to decline in fertility so estimate is
this would maybe stabilize the world's
population in another 15 years that's
we're still talking about the what comes
from a tiny Tobin tags and that would
leave 90% of that untouched for other
purposes which one can think about at
the same time weakening very powerful
weapons which are used against growth
well as I say this the financial
institutions won't hear powerful however
there is an interesting question as to
why the manufacturing corporations
aren't interested because it would
probably benefit them that is they
increase the profits presumably if were
capital went into say manufacturing and
trade and less into financial
speculation
so how come they're not in favor of it
they have a fair amount of club to that
has interested some international
economic journal and he offered what I
think is a plausible speculation he said
yeah it's true the Tobin tax would
probably be profitable for industrial
corporations but they have a certain
class interest that overrides profit
name is smashing people in the face that
is extremely important for them to
undermine and destroy a democratic
formed to reduce most of the population
to you know Henry suffering and to
concentrate wealth among the very narrow
fringe the super wealthy workers they
are and that
kind of class interest he argued
probably overrides the short-term profit
interest that is one of the effects of
this slow growth is you got to cut
social spending where you don't have to
but that's the line the line is you go
cut social spending goes after all this
low and cutting social spending means
cutting those parts of governments
meaning people's tax money that goes to
the general population a small footnote
is you know not keep but you expand the
parts that go to the rich anyhow it's
been a terrific weapon against social
spending in the United States and
England increasingly and the rest of the
world Sweden and so on profits are
shooting up but social spending is going
down and this lowering of growth is one
is largely an ideological weapon that is
used to carry out those useful tasks so
it's worth doing this even if in fact it
harms profits that's not unreasonable I
think if you look at modern history as
far back as we can go in fact but surely
in the modern period you can find many
times when the class interest of
increasing inequality or undermining
democratic forms or eliminating social
spending and so on has in fact
overridden the interest of short-term
maximization of profit there are many
interesting examples of that I'll come
back to some more so that's a
speculation but I think Felix's
speculation it's not at all implausible
anyway the Tobin tax is not on the
agenda in the real world
in the UN and economists talk about it
and other people think about these
things well that was one thing that
happened and that's a pretty
conservative proposal he's not
suggesting like what I would suggest the
financial institutions are totally
legitimate and should be dismantled he's
the same time small but a like a half
percent tax on their currency transfers
the so as I say I'm keeping to the
conservative end inspect the another
change that took place around 25 years
ago which was important was the
beginning of what sometimes is called
the telecommunications revolution which
you know about and that has been very
expeditious and making it possible to do
like transfer a trillion dollars around
this day between capital markets let's
say taking virtually the entire New York
Stock Exchange capital and putting it in
Tokyo every day so you can and then back
so that you can take advantage of the
you know the daytime hours and the two
countries which are opposite things like
that
telecommunications has been a big
contributor to this in fact if you look
at the big news agencies like say
they're really only three left
Reuters Associated Press which is Dow
Jones o AP Dow Jones and Knight Ridder
I think that's virtually everything
there are some smaller ones but that's
the main ones I news is one of their
East useful commodities that they're
least interested in at this point I mean
they live at distribute news but the
main thing that they distribute is
information to investors so writers for
example or I mean what they do is they
reporters like if say the president's
giving a speech and what the word are
supposed to do is to see if there's some
hint in the speech as to whether maybe
like there'll be a slight stimulus for
the economy and maybe taxable drop or
something rather and the minute the
reporter picks that out the races outlet
is portable telephone screaming into it
and talking to some central computer
somewhere and saying the president said
X and the guy types it out in the
computer goes all the world trillion
dollars a day so it's moving around
because various people think they can
make a little money by moving the money
from here to there and so on and so
forth on the side there's some there's
the triple set alright that's that's
more and more reflection of these
developments anyway fellow community
growth of the telecommunications
industry was a big fact of the
technology and so on didn't have to be
used for this purpose of course
technology doesn't care what it's used
for it reflects power interest I
extradited these developments very
significantly a third thing that
happened to happen around
well it's independently about the same
time but but contributed to the same
tendencies
it was the huge sudden explosion in
commodity prices now the one that made
all the headlines was oil price which
about quadrupled early in the 70s
actually less fewer headlines were given
to the fact that coal prices which coal
is mostly a us-based export they went up
by a factor of eight the year before oil
prices went up and other USX works like
grain also went up and so on but the one
that you know was important the masters
of mankind was the oil prices so that's
so we all talk about you know the oil
the oil sheiks more terrible things they
did well any one of the things that
happened with the rise of oil prices was
that a huge amount of capital got poured
into international exchanges in
interesting ways if you look a large
part of that increase in profits went
straight to the energy companies the
energy company because their profits
might not even faster than the oil price
well the energy company is a US based or
elfish base for the most part so that's
all money coming back to the United
States and Britain again every time I
say these words you'll remember whom I
mean a little sector of the United
States and Britain so that the rise in
oil you look back you'll notice that the
US did not make efforts to try to get
the price down in fact it was basically
telling other countries layoffs we don't
mind and it's not surprising that the US
and Britain didn't mind because this was
not a very beneficial food not only in
pouring money back into the US and
secondarily British based energy
companies but also into making it
profitable for them to open up less more
expensive oil resources which they'd
already always known about and could
have you developed but with less profit
but as the prices shifted it became
profitable to open up North Sea oil and
Alaska way and they have
asian-american so they so that's another
big benefit to the u.s. and saving the
early British economy also Norway people
gain but they're the big us is the big
player and the puppy dog is the second
player the in addition to that an awful
at reduce amount of this capital went
straight into US Treasury securities the
family dictatorships that are the local
managers of the oil resources they know
their job their job was determined years
and years ago the British Foreign Office
back during World War one when they read
when the British recognized they just
didn't have the troops any longer to
hold the empire by force worked out some
other ways of doing it and one of the
ways they worked out as was to as they
put it set up what they called an Arab
facade that would manage things behind
British rule and they would manage
behind what they called various
constitutional fictions like buffer
state the other thing the Arab facade
has a test its task is to make sure that
the wealth of the region does not go to
the people of the region but rather it
goes to the west meaning the United
States and since the people of the
region are in fact if you look at where
oil Western well investment has
most-hated place it's mostly in places
with very low local populations this
plain petroleum an India but right on
the other half of the Gulf reading you
know Saudi Arabia Emirates that's a
great place as long as you can make sure
the people of the region don't get any
funny ideas like you know maybe people
in the slums in Cairo or somewhere don't
understand exactly why all the wealth of
that region has to go to rich investors
in London and New York well that's why
you have the powerful John dogs you know
regional policemen local cops on the
beaches the Nixon administration put it
to sort of hit him over the head if they
don't get the idea and then there's
British and American force and reserve
guessing was really good in the problem
that's basically the system which the
u.s. took over from the British and the
Eric facade the local family
dictatorships they're allowed to get
wealthy themselves and in fact didn't be
it's corrupt and brutal
whatever they like they can be Islamic
fundamentals fanatics a nobody cares as
long as they do their job and make sure
that the profits from oil flow to the
west the people in the region and they
did that's why Saudi Arabian funds
poured into Treasury securities and also
huge purchases of things like USO arms
or thank you construction product
projects you know that tell corporation
and all that sort of thing all that is
just ways of recycling petrodollars
factor where they belong in the same
banks where they started in fact there
was a huge flow of funds during that
period from one bank account and Chase
Manhattan and Citibank to another bank
account either there or in the next bank
down the stream and these were some of
the mechanisms another mechanism that
would use to recycle money through
Western financial institutions mainly
us-british was the third-world debt the
World Bank and its wisdom advised third
world dictatorship that the best way to
develop is to borrow lots and lots of
money uh which then of course stays in
the banks because they then purchase
Treasury securities or you know
something rather and that was a nice
arrangement it led to the third world
debt and the debt crisis when the whole
thing collapsed it was obviously gonna
do collapse mainly because US interest
rates shut up in the early eighties and
at that point something had to be done
I saw the obvious thing was done the
debt burden was shifted to the vast
majority of the population in the third
world and all of a sudden countries
became not the little sector that rules
things and profits but rather the rest
of it we get beaten over the head
that's the country and they're the ones
that to paper so the payment of the debt
falls on the large majority who had
nothing to do with it and gain nothing
from it
the debt is then paid to the guys who
got rich in the first place
and the local elites who of course
always profit part of the same system
they're doing just fine some of the debt
was not payable so you had to do
something about that
but that was that was handled was to
socialize it in the rich countries so
American taxpayers and so on they pay
they pick up the debt in one or another
form as it
as the manipulations in effect socialize
it this tells you know the crucial
lesson about what's called capitalism it
has to be risk-free you're allowed to
make a lot of profits but the nanny
state has to move in and protect you in
case you get into any trouble the debt
crisis is a perfectly good example the
S&L collapse is another one which has
happened in Mexico is another one the
Mexican economic miracle was a
transparent fraud
it was obvious it was going to collapse
and para de for everyone except the
World Bank economists another
professionals but it was perfectly
obvious was my clients the only question
was when when it did and you gotta make
sure that the big American investment
firms like the people and staff Nixon's
something has you know Goldman Sachs is
supposed to make money take risks so
there's a huge public payoff which is
called payments to Mexico but is in fact
a means to us investors and the firm's
that account and that's another part of
the free market miracle and there's
thousands of similar examples well
that's all of this to go back these
major fact there is the deregulation of
international financial markets the
telecommunications revolution the huge
increase in the amount of capital
flipping around the world partly caused
by the right sudden rise in commodity
prices and splits way down now for oil
that all of these had a big effect the
major effect that they had was to put
very powerful weapons into the hands of
the principal architects of policy the
people who are called countries when you
study international affairs of science
and so on
they're called the United States sir you
know Somalia or something like that but
in fact or maybe Bermuda but in fact
it's not it's not referring to that as
say was obvious to Adam Smith flamin
radical well they've put a powerful
weapons into their hands and they use it
the transnational corporations and fine
to institutions who are the principal
architects of policy and who casts the
shadow politics they use the power
exactly as any rational person would
expect them to somebody might think a
little bit about scale here to a Fortune
magazine every year lists with Fortune
500 once a year top corporations know
the last time around what made the top
500 which were rich unprecedented
profits there because for about the
fourth straight year of double-digit
profit gross profit growths of fifty
four percent less you're after four
straight years nobody ever heard of that
they controlled at that point close to
two-thirds of domestic gross domestic
product and most of the International
economy that's again hard to measure but
to give you a world bank an estimate
sales of foreign subsidiaries meaning
subsidiary of Ford Motor Company and
sales of foreign subsidiaries of
transnationals was far higher than the
total of world trade that's what sales
of foreign subsidiaries it's in LA
what's called trade is another term they
go to look into and covered some number
of myths what about 50 percent of what's
called US trade happens to be internal
to corporations transactions that cross
borders but within the corporation so
for example when Ford Motor Company
makes a car they may do something in the
United States let's say somewhere in
Michigan or wherever it's done and then
ship it across the border to northern
Mexico where you get much much cheaper
workers and you don't worry about
pollution and that sort of thing and
then they you know assemble pieces and
then they ship them back across the
border where you add more value and that
sort of thing in both directions it's
called trade of course it has nothing to
do with trade in any market sense
these are managed highly controlled
interactions within totalitarian systems
which is what corporations are huge
these are huge the tellurian systems
being command economies where the top
level
unites
and legislative and executive function
is into the latarian state and if you
look at their structure it's completely
terian and that again these again were
truism it's not very long ago the within
these totalitarian institutions
manipulations are made with a very
visible path and with all kinds of
techniques for undermining markets and
so on and that amounts to 50% of world
trade of US trade Japan is approximately
the same and for the whole world it's
estimated roughly at around 40 percent
well you know these are not small
proportions the that there's a
traditional view in economics that
there's kinda like a free market see and
little tiny islands in it isn't like
everyone recognized at a mom-and-pop
grocery store internally doesn't work by
the free market so you've got these
little tiny islands around different but
if we're interested in the real world
that's where we look so as I say the
sales of overseas of support those
subsidiaries of transnationals far
greater than world trade but what's
world trade is also to a large extent
not trade in any meaningful sense it's
just a form of it's part of what some
economists have described this corporate
corporate mercantilism that's a name for
the whole system you read the NAFTA and
GATT and all that sort of thing it's
going to increase trade well they're
very likely to increase flows across
borders but whether they increase trade
or not in any meaningful sense is
another question to answer that question
you have to do a different kind of
analysis GATT and NAFTA are not free
trade agreements they're investor rights
agreements which give more mixture of
liberalisation and protectionism
designed to give more power through
transnationals and if one effect of that
is to increase their internal
interactions that someone to trade in
any meaningful sentence so those are
things one would look at it if you're
just in the real world the there were
other things happening through this
period that contributed to these
tendencies one of them fairly recent is
the end of the Cold War
Eastern Europe was the original third
world
that goes back to pre-columbian times
was declining relative to the west from
around the 15th century and that decline
continued right into the century Phil
first world war for Russia and second
world war for most of Eastern Europe and
it was standard third world relations to
the first world being the West resources
markets investment opportunities cheap
labor usual stuff there one of the rules
of world order is that the service areas
are not allowed to become independent if
they do they get you know they suffer a
second rule of world order is that
they're not supposed to be economically
successful that's even worse then it has
it could have a demonstration effect
others might try to follow the same path
that's what Henry Kissinger called a
virus that might infect others when he
was explaining I was necessary to
overthrow the long vibrant democratic
tradition of Chile and instituted rule
of the gang of murderers he says it's a
virus that might infect people all the
way to southern Europe not to us the
Chilean army was going to conquer Rome
but because he may not right understood
that it's because the Italian workers
might get a bad idea like maybe you can
vote in a Social Democratic Party or
something like that so we have to get
rid of this virus and any form of
successful NAFTA and GATT and all that
sort of thing I was going to increase
trade well they're very likely to
increase flows across borders but
whether they increase trade or not in
any meaningful sense as another question
to answer that question you have to do a
different kind of analysis GATT and ACTA
are not free trade agreements they're
investor rights agreements which give
more mixture of liberalisation and
protectionism designed to give more
power through transnationals and if one
effect of that is to increase their
internal interactions that someone to
trade in any enforcement so those are
things one would look at it if you're in
the real world the there were other
things happening through this period
that contributed to these tendencies one
of them fairly recent it's the end of
the Cold War at Eastern Europe was the
original third world that goes back to
pre-columbian times it was declining
relative
the West from around the 15th century
and that decline continued right into
the center till first world war for
Russia and the Second World War for most
in Eastern Europe and it was standard
third world relations to the first world
being the West resources markets
investment opportunities cheap labor
usual stuff there's one of the rules of
world order is that the service areas
are not allowed to become independent
but if they do they get a second rule of
world order is that they're not supposed
to be economically successful that's
even worse then it has it could have a
demonstration effect others might try to
follow the same path that's what Henry
Kissinger called a virus that might
infect others money he was explaining I
was necessary to overthrow the long
vibrant democratic tradition in Chile
and instituted rule of the gang of
murderers he said it's a virus that
might infect people all the way to
southern Europe not because the Chilean
army was been a conquer Rome but because
it's because the Italian workers might
get a bad idea like maybe you can vote
in a Social Democratic Party or
something like that
so we have to get rid of this virus and
any form of potential development
successful in terms that influence
others might have doubly dangerous I
mean that's in fact there's some of the
guided rules of world order and it
doesn't matter whether you Grenada or
whether you're Russia the same rules
apply well the application of those
rules is a large part of what's called
the Cold War the scale was so different
than the normal north-south conflicts
that it took on a life of its own sorts
of properties but in effect the basic
logic is not very different from Grenada
other places you can mention well you
know takes a weekend to overthrow the
government Grenada and maybe 70 years to
get rid of the rotten apples somewhere
that's a sixth of the world but it
happened finally just really at first
its fact none of this into the way has
anything to do with human rights or
freedom or anything
easy to prove that the I don't waste
your time on it it's too obvious but it
finally under the Cold War was over
around 1989 1990 and since then at all
unpredictably Eastern Europe is going
back to being the third world by very
specific design there's huge social
engineering project called free markets
and there's economics which is driving
Eastern Europe trying to reconstruct the
traditional third world order it's not
true for all of Eastern Europe there
were parts of it that were part of the
industrial West like Western Poland and
Germany and the Czech Republic which was
a rich industrial society and they're
going back to what they were but most of
the region is going back but it was
deeply impoverished third-world
countries with super rich elites mostly
the old communist party who were rich
beyond their wildest dreams and are the
real victors in the Cold War along with
their Western counterparts but for the
general population it's just a standard
third-world misery in prison well one
effect of the return of this huge part
of the third world is to put new weapons
into the hands of the Masters in the
West and they're not at all shy about
telling you that if you read the right
journals like the business press which
is rather frank so the world's leading
business journal and incidentally quite
a good Journal Financial Times couple
years ago they're talking about the
communism they described they hadn't had
a big story with a headline that said
green shoots in communism ruins meaning
the whole thing is a total disaster but
there's a few good things going on and
the green shoots turned out to be that
myth as they put it with the
pauperization
and unemployment caused by the reforms
that you're supposed to like these
things so they're called reforms you
don't call
Hitler's measures reforms reforms as
used for changes you're supposed to like
however destructive they may be whenever
you see the word reform you know
remember so they say one of the results
of the reforms is the pauperization
and unemployment of Eastern Europe
Eastern European Workers which is great
because that
means that Western investors can now get
workers at 10% the cost of what they
called the pampered Western workers and
without benefits and as Businessweek
chimed in happily this means that the
the pampered Western workers are going
to have to abandon their luxurious
lifestyle because after all Volkswagen
and General Motors and so on can just
move a couple miles across the border
and get people who really are beat me
down and we'll work for ten percent the
wages and no benefit
and in case they get into trouble the
new democratic governments have highly
repressive rules to ensure that those
guys don't do things like form unions or
ask for money or something like that
and since remember nobody believes in
the free market except for someone else
that's another point when General Motors
rvw invest in Czechoslovakia Poland they
make sure they get plenty of state
protection high tariffs to insure them
you know domestic monopolies big
subsidies you know the usual stuff that
you get when you invest in the third
world in the free market as it's cold so
that's another weapon in the hands of
the masters to beat down the pampered
Western workers with their luxurious
lifestyles well that again has
contributed it's again pretty friend
it's not like goes the other way too so
it's not just me in this they are people
invest here large parts of the United
States are now treated by the
International economy is basically
third-world so for example Dane laments
the biggest conglomerate in Germany
double years ago investor Sadie's plant
in Alabama where they get it standard
conditions that unions a lot of
protection state gives you subsidy in
fact this was so outlandish that
agreement that even the Wall Street
Journal is critical of but the and
that's a way of beating down the wages
so that pampered German workers who
American workers now have some of the
lowest kind of always oscillating I'm
back with England I'm not sure who's the
first place now as to where the lowest
labor costs are us used to have the high
ask about ten years ago as you'd expect
in the richest country in the world but
the players have reaganism
the lowest and I think England wouldn't
even below
so that's last time I looked about 16
percent the wages of German workers and
much worse benefit protections and so on
so damn events can hit German workers
over the head moving to Poland by even
moving to Alabama that's what's called a
globalized economy and it works here too
there were big strikes last your the
last year at a couple of years there
have been major labor actions in Decatur
Illinois Oh in class town where a couple
of Trent three transnationals we're
determined to destroy the last remnants
of the American industrial unionism and
they won hands down that our struggle no
way to get any support for it or even
knowledge about it and they tried really
hard the Decatur workers even places
like Boston people just wouldn't show up
when they came for support meetings it
was shocking but including the left I
should say but in any event they lost
the first Union to collapse was Lisa to
area a Japanese on transnational rubber
company the next one was caterpillar
last month AOA a subsidiary taken while
British transnational made its money on
the slave trade has been doing similar
things since the caterpillar carefully
with the one us-based one just one the
press business press called a route they
totally smashed the UAW that had to
capitulate to the original very hard
caterpillar proposals the caterpillar
remember these are totalitarian
institutions so it used its power to
impose real Stalinist style rules you
know allowed to talk in the factory and
I like that we are the one wrong kind of
t-shirt and I'll ever mentioned strike
anything that management again even the
Wall Street Journal was a little
surprised that this level but they won
and through the strike they'd explained
why they were going to win first of all
they're making huge profits
secondly they had used those profits for
a certain business strategy namely they
didn't have invested in overseas
facilities not for reasons of profit
it's counter to profit but to give them
access capacity so in case workers in
Decatur Illinois try to maintain
the rights that were finally 160 years
ago they can just shift to production in
Brazil have their plans maybe Poland and
that will fulfill the markets and
that'll get the workers over the hip
same right here in Boston I think the
biggest manufacturer in Boston is
Gillette and they announced the business
press that they're pursuing exactly the
same business strategy in fact they're
even building excess capacity in German
where labor costs are way higher here
just in case boston workers get out of
control
and then you can fill the orders in the
european market from the higher cost
german worth if that's in Italy one of
the many ways many ways in which in fart
recited businessmen carry arranged
policies that had to be countered profit
but have a longer term that's
interesting about
well that's these are among the many
ways in which it now becomes possible to
globalize the economy to bring the third
world home and the US more and more
looks like a third world society I'm
saying
I mean structurally so rich that it's
not gonna look like Egypt but the
structure is very obvious you can't walk
through any American city without seeing
their sectors of a normal growing
opulence most of the wealth there was
low growth in the last year's but its
own growth almost all went to the very
top few percent for most of the
population income either stagnated or in
fact decline of the difference is very
radical and as in the main third world
there's a growing class of useless
people and contribute the profit-making
there's nothing much to do with them
we're a civilized society so we don't
send out death squads we have a
different technique we throw we throw
them the prisons and either we try to
lock them up in urban slums which are
concentration cancer just tossing McCann
and crime hasn't changed much in the
last 20 years but the in big perceptions
of crime that have been manipulated by
the doctrinal system they have changed a
lot and so has incarceration it
approximately tripled during the Reagan
years with no crime and it's going off
even faster now the u.s.
long ago left its major competitors
behind South Africa in Russia we now
lock up more of our population and
proportional population and I think in
the country in the world certainly more
than any industrial country all right
and it's going up and up very fast
that's without any change in crime it's
commonly claimed that the US has
unusually high crime rate so we got to
do something about it even that's not
true
statistics of cross international
statistics only recently become
available and they're not entirely
comparable with slightly different
measures are used but it turns out that
u.s. crime rates although they're at the
high end of the industrial societies
they're not they're not off the scale in
fact they're usually not even at the top
of there's one category of crime where
the u.s. is indeed off the scale and
that's homicides in the course of
anything family arguments to robbery if
you look at homicides with guns it's way
out off the spectrum in the United
States but there's maimed with crime
rate that I said about the fact that
this is the only country that we see
only Western country where you know it's
considered but there's tremendous
pressure to allow people to run around
waiting guns at each other and so
naturally it's a lot of deaths from gun
but if you put that aside u.s. crime
rates are at the high end but not you
know not very unusually so I'm not even
at the top the imprisonment does get rid
of a large part of the population the
this morning the papers reported that in
California about forty percent of the
black population there's a largely
target against blacks although they sort
of come in and away naturally because of
the you know the race class correlation
which is fairly close but it
specifically targeted against blacks on
top of that
forty percent of it I think is at forty
percent of black males between twenty
and thirty are in the criminal system in
California that's a good way to destroy
a population that's the main purpose
certainly of the so-called drug world
virtually no drugs there's an awful lot
to do with locking up parts of the
population you wanna get rid of yes you
have to control them something though
doesn't matter whether you're a
totalitarian state or a democratic state
you somehow have to
and there are a lot of ways to do that
so everyone it's the same methods
whether their name is Adolf Hitler or
something else this is because aren't a
lot you can't think of many methods so
you always get the same one and one of
them isn't just instill fear and hatred
and anger and hatred of the guy next
door something looks a little different
there's something like that that's a
terrific technique of social control and
inspiring fear of crime crime is real
and dangerous but like I say it's not
change the instilling fear of crime and
in particular when you can associate
that with somebody really bad like crime
and that's what's done very consciously
but it seems done with welfare instill
hatred and fear and you know those bad
guys over there fortunately another
color so easy to hate that sort of thing
I'm plenty of history behind it as I
need not tell you the that's a technique
of social control for the whole
population so crime is very incarcerated
the population has a lot of side
benefits I'd also make me make a lot of
money on the growth of the prison system
that's a piece of the state system so
it's you know it's that state economy
and it does give a kind of Keynesian
stimulus to the economy the big
investment firms like Merrill Lynch and
so on foot bonds for tax refunds for
prison construction the construction
industry makes a lot of money by now
prison labor is shooting up that's good
not only because it's very cheap labor
sort of wages but it also has the nice
side effect of undermining wages
elsewhere because you can you can
produce things with slave labor and then
as a natural effect wages elsewhere it's
even gotten a scale where the high tech
where high tech industry is getting
interesting about a year and a half ago
The Wall Street Journal had a story on
how high tech firms are beginning will
recognize if there's another ripoff at
there alongside the Pentagon to get the
public to pay your costs you can invent
you know crazy surveillance systems with
supercomputers implanting electrodes and
people and so
so forth and that's a way of getting the
public to pay the costs of research and
development it's not fast that people
talk about the threat of the explosion
of healthcare well yeah it's true
because of era utterly incompetent
inefficient private that's a health care
system which as the highest
administrative question the world and so
on but it security but the security
systems growing even faster and
consciously and purposely because that's
a good puts money into the right buckets
as well as getting rid of the wrong part
of the population so that's another just
another aspect of bringing in third
world home and a very important one for
its human consequences well let's look
at another aspect of the doctrinal
system one of the things that's supposed
to be going on is a great new era of
free trade well here there's both a kind
of descriptive and a normative side to
it that is what's happening and isn't
good or bad the descriptive side is that
we're in a period of liberalisation and
open markets and free trade and all that
kind of stuff and on this even the
critics agree so if you read the critics
of what's called neoliberalism you know
they agree or then there's the normative
side and says it's a great thing that
even has a meme well the Washington
Consensus meaning US government and the
World Bank and the IMF so the Washington
Consensus says that the path to
development and growth and prosperity is
free markets and well let's take a look
at the descriptive side is there an
increase in free markets like say trade
well I already mentioned one small
aspect that you have to bear in mind
what's called trade is to a large extent
corporate mercantilism
but when you're the whole system you
have to remember that there's a
difference between free-market doctrine
and what you might call really existing
free-market doctrine that is the way it
really works
the way it really works is is and always
has been double edged
means free markets for you but not for
me
it's like VW & GM yeah you guys over
there you have market discipline
we in protection that's history that
goes back to the British in India the
whole history of us development in fact
every developing society every developed
society has used that man
we ran liberalisation down the throats
of people we control but we have a
developmental state with high protective
tariffs and plenty of state intervention
and so on and so forth if there's
anything that's general in economic
history it's that you ask why India
looks different from England or why
India looks different from the United
States that's essentially the large part
of the talk about these details but
that's absolutely true just to give you
an example
true it's well known so if you look at
the standard economic historians they
point out that it's a myth that free
trade has been the engine of growth in
fact historically protectionism has been
the engine of growth and liberalisation
has been a device that has driven the
third world into its present form the
differences between the first and third
world weren't very great in the 18th
century
sometimes it was reversed from today but
now they're huge and this is one of
maybe the most important of the factors
just you might know but it's just to
illustrate that of outside of Europe
there's two parts of the world that
develop namely the United States and
Japan and its region the rest would
smash those also happen to be the two
parts of the world that resisted
colonialism the u.s. path toward
independence and Japan was able to
resist colonial aggression as a result
the US and later Japan and other
countries of Europe were able to follow
the British model that is very high
protection powerful state strong
intervention of the economy and ramming
liberalisation down the throats of your
colonies like in the US and
interestingly for its colonies it
developed them unlike the West which is
why Korea Taiwan industrializing
countries but those are the regions that
develop the ones that were subjected to
what is now called the Washington
Consensus yeah that's
Egypt Africa Philippines most Latin
America and so on well not to talk about
here I'm sure it I'll come back if you
like the and this is exactly the same
today just coming to today the Financial
Times couple of weeks ago had a review
this new study of the hundred top
transnational corporations on the
fortune list of transnational it turns
out of the top hundred about a hundred
of them that is all had benefited from
interventionist policies of their own
government to protect them and
twenty-two hundred according to the
study would have would not have survived
if it had not been for massive state
intervention meaning taxpayer subsidies
like when Reagan rescue Lockheed that's
20 out of 100 which survived because of
state intervention and you see there's
pretty dramatically right in the United
States in recent years so the Reagan
administration was full of talk about
the wonders of the market but to the
business community they were talking a
different line there they were boasting
that they were more protectionist than
any post-war administration which was an
understatement because in fact there
were more protectionist than all
post-war administrations combined double
import barriers meanwhile pouring public
funds into private industry largely
through the pentagon funnel and in fact
that's the reason why the US has a steel
industry and computers in fact virtually
every functioning part of the economy
was reconstructed would have been wiped
out by Japanese competition if free
markets have been allowed but it was
free Japanese imports required
effectively and money was poured in to
allow us industry to recapitalize right
now you'll notice that we're supposed to
be in a budget crunch and everything's
being cut like you know funds for school
lunches and so on not everything's being
cut one things going up namely the
pennant that's going up and the Heritage
Foundation you know the big
conservatives say yeah that's got to go
up not because we're facing any threat I
mean talk about us facing threat
even the drew but it's because people
who live in say Cobb County Georgia are
facing a threat its Newt Gingrich's
district which gets more federal
subsidies than any remotely comparable
one in the country well English is a
biggest welfare freak in the country by
far and to keep his rich constituents
even richer you have to make sure that
the nanny state pours money into their
pocket and the Pentagon is the main way
that's done so that budget has to go up
tough love and all that kind of stuff is
fine for seven-year-old kids who have to
learn responsibility if they're hungry
but not for rich folk in Cobb County if
they were subjected to market discipline
they'd be out selling rags or something
but as long as they've got the nanny
state pouring money under their pockets
they're fine and therefore the budget
has to go up as it's doing I mean this
has gotten to the point where the
business world itself has even forgotten
what capitalism is supposed to be you
know like the Wall Street Journal had a
front page lead story couple of weeks
ago in which they were comparing two
states and their business strategies
Virginia and Maryland we're talking
about how they had slightly of course
both trying to be very business friendly
and that's what I think they did in
slightly different ways and it was
comparing these ways
well you look closely it turns out it's
not Virginia in Maryland it's the parts
of Virginia and Maryland that are
suburbs of Washington and in fact the
two ways that they had picked were in
fact slightly different Maryland had
tried to develop biotechnology figuring
that the biggest cash cow was going to
be the National Institute of Health and
Virginia had been concentrating on
high-tech figuring the biggest cash cow
it's going to remain the Pentagon so
they're different business strategies
were which part of the public sector can
we rip off and it turned that that
Virginia was a little better and its
entrepreneurial value so they were doing
there as I say these guys don't even
remember what capitalism was supposed to
be you know what it is is market
discipline for poor people the world of
course and for people at home but plenty
of protection from us for us and if we
get into trouble you bail us out there's
hard to find an exception to this and in
fact it goes right through history well
let me just briefly comment on the
normative side and then I'll stop
there's a normative aspect to the
Washington Consensus namely supposed to
be a great
well there is some evidence like couple
hundred years of history which happens
to be on the other side but that's the
fact so let's put aside the facts and
just let the theory which is what's
important there is a recent article in
this which I really urge that you look
at it's by one of the best one of the
real leading lights of modern one of the
real hotshots and stuff it's an article
that appears in international affairs
that's the Journal of the Royal
Institute of International Affairs and
it's in their 50th anniversary issue so
very prestigious publications pregnant
makes basically four points his first
point is that this is his field
incidentally he's the top expert on
international trade theory is this first
thing we have to remember is that we
don't really know what's going on
there's no economic theory that as much
to say about questions like development
and that sort of thing he counsels
humility just let's admit we don't know
much the second point he makes is at any
moment of time he runs through written
history last 50 60 years at any moment
economists and public intellectuals are
supremely confident about what the
proper method of development is when two
point three is twenty years later
they're it's reversed
it's the opposite the parents have to be
the right method and they're still
equally confident so you're always
supremely confident but their cycles
about what you're confident about and
nobody really knows what's mine anyway
the fourth point that he makes which is
really just one line is he says at the
end he says well some people say that
these positions are shaken because it
serves the interests of powerful people
in institutions it is doubtless that's
true
yeah and doubtless that's the old story
so if we take the throwaway line and we
spell it out we have pretty much a
picture of the way it works and
incidentally what people are being
trained to do not notice what's going on
in the world and just remember these
lessons I mentioned is that there have
been massive for the experiments being
societal you know social engineering
experiments conducted on experimental
animals who can't answer back for a
couple hundred years
back certainly at least to the what's
called the permanent settlement in India
back in 1793 the British we're gonna ask
a place and it goes right up till today
the you know experiments in Eastern
Europe structural adjustment third-world
stuff between done here you know in the
urban population so on huge experiments
not based on any knowledge of course but
with tremendous effects and there's some
very striking consequences if you look
at these experiments they're almost
always we're called failures and in fact
recognized to be like the permanent
settlement in India which just totally
changed the place and put it under
landlord control the British didn't do a
an analysis oh they're about fifty years
later and they realize you guys total
disaster for the population but they did
point out that it had some good sides
like it created an Indian upper class
which had a stake in British rule and it
created devices to control the rest and
although they didn't say it it in each
the right people in England and that's a
very typical aspect of the experiments
the designers always seem to do fine in
fact if you can find an exception it'd
be interesting but the people who
designed and conducted the experiment
they always it turns out to be very
successful for them it's often a
disaster for everyone else but that's
kind of incidental maybe the game but it
sort of internet'll the one thing that's
constant is that the experimental
designers do a fine job and incidentally
the experimental animals they don't sign
any religious warrants you know they're
just wrong end of the gun so therefore
they experimental animals well that's
another sort of universal feature of
pretty Universal feature of modern
history there's more to talk about in
the about myths but I'm so let me
doesn't make a final comment there's
nothing new about the period I mean it
is it's a very ugly and grim period for
most of the population and in fact
getting worse it's a big attack on
democracy even on markets if you look
closely and certainly I'm right it's not
the first time there was a period which
was called the gay 90's you remember
exactly a hundred years ago it was
really gay for a little percent of the
population who were just doing fine for
most of the population with total
disaster there's a big emigration of
farmers from the central United States
to Canada
take it anymore urban workers were
getting smashed by the state security
forces murdered unions are being
destroyed around Pittsburgh Pennsylvania
it was 50 years before they were even
going to talk to people but sorting some
labor organizers recently one of them
comes from there he says I mean you
thought that you know 80 year old people
they still are afraid to talk to you
because of the totalitarian structure
that was imposed by force on the major
industrial areas that was the gay 90's
well it wasn't the end struggles
continued changes took place and they
made a lot of progress in the 1920s it
looked even more extreme than now it
looked as if it was going to be they
were talking about you know end the
history perfection total controlled by
the business classes no labor role in
anything no democracy just control in
the right hand well turned out not to be
quite true the 1930s there was massive
popular mobilization the United States
was in fact shifted sort of into the
mainstream of industrial society within
a deal that said about a huge
counter-attack which has been going on
since and it's been accelerating in the
past 20 years and in a way we're sort of
back to the 20 is in some respect but
you know this has been going on over and
over again it's the end if you decided
it's the end other than that these are
very fragile institutions they have
known in my opinion and there's no
reason why they can't be why the shadow
can't be attenuated and why the
substance can't be directly in fact but
that's a matter of choice
war crime Strauss I mean the people are
coming under trial in former Yugoslavia
they deserve trial there were criminal
and the original war crimes trials in
Nuremberg and where those guys were
maybe some of the world's worst
criminals Tokyo it's not so obvious
there was a Tokyo tribunal too and
that's a more mixed story however
there's one thing about working on
trials in fact it was established as
Nuremberg custom are you hearing me yeah
yeah yeah Mike sounds like I'm not
hearing it are you hearing me
yes or no no well somebody know what
happened hey I think Wizards around here
all right well I'll uh I'll talk as loud
as I can the basic principle of war
crimes trials was in fact laid down at
Nuremberg very explicitly a crime was
defined at Nuremberg as a crime that
they committed and that we didn't commit
and that was explicit so it was
considered a defense at Nuremberg if you
could show that the Americans and the
British did the same thing like one of
the major Admiral Dennett's one of the
major subdermal Nazi submarine
commanders had a successful defense he
brought an American naval commander said
yeah we did the same thing bombing of
urban bombing which was massively
destructive was not considered a crime
the reason is because the US and Britain
ended up doing way more of it than
anyone else and in fact if you run
through the list that was pretty
explicit there were real crimes they
were tried for but at some part of the
crimes the crimes that you couldn't say
the West committed that generalizes
kernels who are brought to trial are the
ones who lose the ones that win are
never brought to trial the ones who were
in fact we ought to go back very far to
see that much short of were crimes
trials there happens to be one major
country that was condemned by the World
Court for aggression technically
for the unlawful use of force that was
just nine years ago
the reaction to that was that the
government Hemsley us the Congress
reacted to that by increasing instantly
the unlawful use of force increasing the
funding for the terrorist forces
attacking Nicaragua in this case that
the US was condemned for and ordered by
the World Court to stop furthermore the
aid to them which the World Court
determined was not humanitarian aid was
military aid continued without n right
to the end always called humanitarian
aid you can check the press from the
journals and so on and see if aid to the
Contras in 1989 was ever called military
you will find it was a hundred percent
of the time called humanitarian aid in
fact the decision of the World Court was
never reported on these issues the World
Court does not condemn the United States
in fact the reaction of the World Court
decision across the board was that the
decision discredited at the World Court
which must be under Russian control or
something like that they literally said
that it's Harvard professor quoted in
the Washington Post so the World Court
was simply dismissed because it's saying
the wrong thing bringing the wrong
people before the bar of justice and
that's what war crimes trials are it's
not that they're wrong you know but one
of the principles of the law is supposed
to be that it's not selective sure very
well known we've done them in our own
experience to me I mean I'm very
critical media but they're a lot better
than they were thirty years much more
open you know but there's much less
coverage you know because they're trying
to cut down news coverage but if you
look at them the kinds of question
things that come up in the media today
you couldn't imagine coming up thirty
years ago well there's reasons for that
the main reasons are that it reflects
the cultural changes in the general
population since the 60 there was a lot
of ferment and 60s but are really
expanded in the 70s if you look at the
big popular movements they're mostly
from 70 the environmental movement the
feminist movement solidarity movements
and so on they expanded even farther in
the eighties got much bigger deeper
rooted and that had its effect in many
ways for one thing people in the media a
lot of them came through those formative
experiences you know they were changed
like every else was changed for another
thing any institutions gonna have to
reflect even in a totalitarian state the
institutions are gonna have to reflect
what's going on among the public in some
way in a more democratic society like
ours in many ways beyond that there's
all sorts of you know there's this
certainly a possibility of creating
alternative media Radio Free Maine is
what we have but in other places they
have a lot more I think Boston is an
unusual city and it doesn't have
community-based media most a lot of
places who most and when you around the
country a lot and you see the difference
you see the difference in a community
that has a community-based radio you
know the Boston happens to be pre active
City but it's very isolated fragmented
no communication and so on well partly
because we don't have community-based
media but they're possible oh it takes a
cable television that offers endless
opportunities and it's just that people
aren't using and a lot of other things
like that so should have plenty of
strategies quite beyond that let me just
say that a little over the horizon is
the question why you should have
corporate media all together what right
do private tyrannies have to dominate
the communication system well answered
and are they more right than Bolshevism
and fascism
