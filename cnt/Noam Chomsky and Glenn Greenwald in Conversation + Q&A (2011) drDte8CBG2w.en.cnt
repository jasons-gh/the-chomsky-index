so thank you thank you very much
and on behalf of Russell Tomsky thank
you for that very warm reception thanks
very much for for coming this afternoon
and in particular thanks to professor
Chomsky it is indescribably gratifying
to be able to write a book and then
attend an event to talk about it with
the nation's bravest and most
accomplished public intellectual and
political activists so I'm particularly
grateful friends Trotsky for being here
I just want to begin by making a couple
of points that I think will frame the
discussion that we're gonna have nicely
and I'm not sure what that discussion
will be because we haven't talked about
it on purpose but there are a couple
points that I anticipate will help to
highlight that I think I'd like to just
briefly describe so the book really
makes the argument that the rule of law
is we have always understood it has been
radically degraded in a way that wasn't
previously true and the interesting
thing about the rule of law is that it's
a term that has a pretty clear meaning
by consensus it's not a particularly
complex term it essentially means
nothing more than the fact that in a
society we are all bound on equal terms
by a common set of rules and you can
look to contemporary legal scholars who
define it that way you can look more
interestingly to the 1980s in the 1990s
when Western institutions like the IMF
and the World Bank began demanding that
lending country or countries that
received lending comported with the rule
of law and there were lots of lectures
issued about what they were required to
do in order to comport with the rule of
law there was a seminal Journal article
by Thomas Carruthers in foreign affairs
that warned that countries that don't
live under the rule of law in those
countries elites can use their superior
financial power to call out political
institutions and that the critical
requirement to live under the rule of
law is that political and financial
elite cease placing themselves above the
rule of law and are subjected to it on
equal terms to everyone else and you go
back to the founders and as much as
disagreement as they had what you
continuously find is this emphasis not
ancillary or second
but really central at the American
Founding in order to be legitimate and
just had to venerate the rule of law and
this was true despite the fact that
founders almost across the board
believed in the inevitability and even
desirability and virtue of vast levels
of inequality in all sorts of realms
and yet they continuously emphasized
that the only way that that inequality
would be legitimate and just is if
everyone were equal before the law now
you know anytime you make the argument
or point out that the rule of law and
equality before the law was important in
the founding you'll be met with the
objection which is obviously an accurate
one as far as it goes so I don't think
it goes very far that the founders
violently breached those principles in
all sorts of ways and that the country
did as well and that this concept of
equality under law has never been the
predominant theme to describe American
political reality and although that is
true the reason I don't think it goes
very far is because the important part
of that writing and and and that history
is that that principle has always been
affirmed as being central even at the
time that we violated it radically and
the reason that's important is because
if you affirm a principal and deviate
from it and in in your actions there's
an obvious aspect to your behavior that
is hypocritical but if the affirmation
is sincere and ringing and consistent
then those principles even though you're
not comporting with them become
aspirational they become guides to what
progress means how it's understood and
how its achieved so even though the
founders violated that principle in all
sorts of ways the fact that they
continuously enshrined it and it was
affirmed continuously throughout the
next two centuries meant that most of
the events that we consider to be
progress in American history were driven
by the reverence for this concept that
were all equal under the law that
equality under the law is how we
determine if we're perfecting the Union
and there's a real value in affirming
principles even if they're not perfectly
applied and what I think is radically
different about today is not
that the rule of law suddenly is is not
being applied faithfully because that's
always been true what's different about
today radically is that we no longer
even bother to affirm that principle we
pay lip service to the phrase the rule
of law but there's in terms of the
substance of what it requires you can
often and I would say more often than
not in leading opinion making elite
circles find an express renouncement or
repudiation of that principle so you
begin with the Ford pardon of Nixon
continuing through the shielding of
iran-contra criminals into the Obama
administration's decision to shield all
bush crimes of torture and illegal
warrantless eavesdropping obstruction of
justice the aggressive attack on Iraq
the decision now not to prosecute Wall
Street criminals for precipitating the
2008 crisis with systemic financial
fraud all of these acts entail very
aggressive and explicit arguments that
the most powerful political and
financial elites in our society should
not be an are not subject to the rule of
law because it's too disruptive it's too
divisive it's more important that we
look forward that we find ways to avoid
repeating the problem and so you really
see constant arguments and you did for
example during the debate over whether
or not the telecom industry should be
retro actively immunized for its role in
the illegal eavesdropping program that
the rule of law is really not that
important of a value any longer Jerry
Ford when he addressed the nation and
tried to convince it to accept the
pardon said of course I believe in the
rule of law the idea that the law is no
respecter of persons but and this was
the amendment that was concocted for
that episode the law is also a respecter
of reality meaning that if it's too
direct disruptive or divisive that it's
actually in our common good not the
elite criminals but in our common good
to exempt the most powerful from the
consequences of their criminal acts and
that has really become the template used
in each of these instances and that I
think radically is different than how
things were in the past the other point
I want to make just to begin but I'll
turn the floor over to Professor Chomsky
is that the other difference is that if
we had a society
that just decided that we were going to
be very lenient and forgiving and
merciful when people committed crimes as
I just described we do for elites you
could have debates about whether that
was an advisable policy or approach to
criminality about whether or not that
would be produced good results or not
but if it were a quite applied across
the board at the very least it wouldn't
implicate rule of laws Jews there are
countries that take very lenient
approaches to criminal justice and if we
were a country that applied that same
leniency to ordinary Americans as we
apply to elites then there wouldn't be
an issue with the rule of law so for
example of you went and broke into
someone's house and and and and bash the
owner in the head with with a baseball
bat and stole their valuable belongings
and a week later or two months later got
caught by the police and you said the
left officer you got me I did what you
think I did but and isn't it more
important that we could look to the
future why that's why focus on the past
if that were something that worked for
you or for people who sold drugs on
street corners and the like then there
wouldn't be a rule of law issue but the
fact that that applies only to to
political and financial elites and not
to ordinary Americans is the reason why
there's a rule of law problem at the
very same time that we've created this
template of elite immunity we over the
past four decades we have in the name of
law and order and tough-on-crime built
the world's largest and most sprawling
prison state one of its harshest and
most merciless systems of punishment for
ordinary Americans and the irony that
Richard Nixon was the one who received
this pardon when in the 1960s he
rejuvenated his political career by
becoming the law and order candidate
following taking up the mantle of Barry
Goldwater running against the disruption
on the rest of the 1960's demanding
harsh sentences lesser parole that's our
opportunity for release from prison the
drug war was really accelerated first
under him the fact that he built his
political career based on this harsh
law-and-order mentality and then
suddenly when he got caught committing
crimes was completely shielded from
legal consequence is really the
personification of this two-tiered
justice system that I'm writing about
and then of course the war on terror has
brought all new tears of justice where
people accused of terrorism just accused
can have every right deprived from them
including the right to life without any
sort of legal rights or legal process of
any kind it's really a new class a
password there's not even a pretense of
due process it's a persona non-grata
a sub person class where the government
can do anything without any legal
constraints at all and it's this
contrast between the shielding and
immunity that we've vested in the elite
class or more accurately that they've
vested in themselves versus the
extraordinarily unprecedented arsh and
merciless punishment system imposed on
everyone else that is the real menace to
the rule of law and that I think is the
most responsible factor for the loss of
faith in our political institutions and
the widespread accurate belief that you
see motivating the Occupy movement and
other widespread citizen rage that our
political institutions have lost all
remnants of legitimacy and can no longer
be used to effectuate change so I think
it's one of the most menacing problems
and also one of the most consequential
[Applause]
well let me just pick up on Glenn's last
comments and say a few things about the
rule of law happens that last night I
was reading the current journal the
current edition of the journal that went
the main journal of the American Society
for his historical historical relations
the diplomatic history and that happens
to be devoted that several articles are
devoted to the Nuremberg Tribunal and to
what it means and how it developed and
so on and the lead article points out
that one of the most honorable and
admired elements of the American
historical tradition the legal
tradition is the principle of
presumption of innocence that is a
person is presumed innocent a suspect is
presumed innocent until brought to a
fair trial and convicted with proper
procedural guarantees
that's the proudest achievement of the
American legal and ethical tradition and
of course it was recognized at Nuremberg
the British wanted just killed the Nazi
war criminals but justice Jackson the
u.s. chief prosecutor insisted that even
though these people are maybe you know
the worst criminals in history they
should be brought to trial subjected to
a fair trial condemned if they were
proven guilty and furthermore he added
that we're giving these defendants a
poisoned chalice and if we ever sit from
it meaning if we ever do the things that
they're accused of we must suffer the
same consequences otherwise these
proceedings are a complete farce the
core element of the proceedings the main
crime for which the Nazi criminals were
condemned and hanged was what was called
in the tribunal the supreme
international crime the Knightly
aggression pretty clearly defined which
they said is tribunal said is the worst
of all war crimes because it encompasses
all the evil that follows well I won't
run through the way that's been we've
applied that to ourselves but that point
is correct presumption of innocence is a
very deeply rooted principle not of
American law but an anglo-american law
or it used to be that by now it's simply
totally dismissed and with praise so for
example
Osama bin Laden was the prime suspect
for 9/11 plausibly though in fact fact
of the matter is the government has yet
to provide the kind of evidence that
would hold up in a credible court and is
even more or less conceded it doesn't
have it but undoubtedly he's the prime
suspect a couple of months ago Obama
invaded another country commandos
apprehended him and murdered and tossed
his body into the ocean without autopsy
and this was praised this was praised as
a great achievement it's a great
achievement of the Obama administration
a couple of months later the concept was
extended in a manner that Glenn talks
about in his book which is a terrific
book I should say that's the case of
Anwar al-awlaki a lackey an American
citizen a cleric who was accused not of
committing them there was some talk
about involvement in crimes but no
evidence was presented the main charge
against him was he was a fluent speaker
of English and he was a transmitting he
was presented giving offering support
for jihadi operations he was killed a
couple of weeks ago and the general
reaction was illustrated adequately in a
New York Times headline which said West
celebrates death of radical cleric well
it wasn't as death it was murder along
with another American citizen who happen
to be near him and while it's true that
the and there were some who didn't join
in the celebration completely almost all
of them
criticized it because he was an American
citizen which makes him a person in
theory as distinct from non-citizens who
may look like persons but aren't that's
incidentally a core principle of
current American law with regard to
undocumented aliens interesting
interpretation of the 14th amendment but
so he was an actual person and maybe
we're not supposed to murder such people
suspected of inciting others who carry
out terrorist acts now again there were
some critics and the response who went
beyond that and said we should believe
in the principle of presumption of
innocence and the reaction to them
actually I was one was quite interesting
most of it was the usual shrieking which
she can disregard but some of it was
interesting and in fact the most
interesting I thought was a column by a
well-known respected left liberal
commentator matthew Yglesias
who wrote that it is as he put it
amazingly naive to criticize the United
States for violation of international
law or other crimes because the
International the International order is
established precisely in order to
legitimate the use of violence by the
west and by the West he doesn't mean
Norway he means by the United States so
that's the nature of the international
order it's set up to legitimate our
criminal resort to violence and
therefore it's amazingly naive to raise
criticisms about this and certainly this
is not said in criticism he's praising
it he goes on to say it's silly even to
raise these questions that happens to be
directed to me and I'm happy to accept
guilt for that on that charge but and if
you look beyond and ask just what does
it mean to be a non person say at Eric
used of terrorism well there's a
striking example and Linton's book as he
points out the first child soldier in
American history to be brought to trial
for crimes and then ones worth looking
at
that's Omar Khadr there's a 15 year old
boy who was apprehended in Afghanistan
and the charge against him is that when
American soldiers were invading
Afghanistan and attacking his village he
picked up a gun to defend his village so
that makes him a terrorist a non-person
and interesting concept of terrorism and
he was then first sent the Bagram secret
prison in Afghanistan then sent off to
Guantanamo eight years in prison
no charges after eight years in prison
he was going to be brought the truck
what's called a trial before a military
commission we'll have to talk about that
but he pleaded guilty and a plea bargain
and was given an eight-year sentence in
addition to the eight years he spent
without charges we all know what it
means to plead guilty in a plea bargain
after eight years in a torture chambers
he actually is a Canadian citizen and
Canada could extradited but they are
courageously refusing to step on the
toes of the master the concept of terror
and the presumption of innocence is
don't find how it's so far gone that
nobody even bothers to discuss it's not
maybe it was once an ancient tradition
but not for us and Glen is quite right
that the fact that it's been violated in
the past doesn't change the fact that by
now we've changed the principle we've
abandoned even the principle not abandon
it but forcefully rejected it even to
the extent of saying the International
order is established precisely to
legitimate our violation of elementary
legal and moral principles well it goes
beyond one of them give one last example
the one of them most in there was an
article recently by a
Lord law professor who in fact Lin cites
couple times of the book that Jonathan
Turley who argues that Obama may be at
breaking the record for a u.s. president
for violation of civil rights and the
law and you can make a case one example
which actually involves the former dean
of the Harvard Law School is happens to
be of Obama's latest Supreme Court up on
the podium Elena Kagan as she argued a
case brought by the Justice Department
against a group called the humanitarian
law project holder the humanitarian law
project with the support of the
far-right justices Obama won that case
the charges is one that might implicate
plenty of people here at the charges
they provided material assistance to a
group that's on the terrorist list the
material assistance in this case was
legal advice to the PKK a group that's
on the Turkish groups on Kurdish groups
on the US terrorist list which means
then they expanded the concept of
material assistance from say you know
providing guns or something like that to
providing the legal advice and even
advice to turn to nonviolent means
that's now a criminal under US law
thanks to President Obama and Morada Lee
in fact shortly after this Supreme Court
decision dozens of FBI agents raided
homes in Chicago and other cities
destroyed documents a usual thing when a
couple dozen FBI agents raid your home
the charge was they're trying to find
evidence that the people they were
and finally indicted with a grand jury
are supporting a Palestinian group and a
Colombian group pflp and FARC
well maybe they are maybe they aren't
but the idea that expressing support for
groups on the terrorist list is a crime
is material assistance that's novel and
the Justice Department position was
explained by Kagan that if you provide
legal advice to a terrorist group say
advising them to refrain from terror and
pursue nonviolent means you're
legitimizing them and freeing up their
resources to carry out terrorist acts
we'll just think how broadly that can
apply as in these cases which are in
fact underway and a final comment which
has to do with the notion of the
terrorist list that's accepted in the
United States as a legitimate category
why is it a legitimate category now how
is the terrorist list established it's
established by executive Fiat I don't
have to give any justification for those
on the terrorist list can't say I don't
belong there
this is just a decision by the executive
that I don't like you and we're going to
prosecute we're going to kill you and
prosecute anyone
now who advises you not to pursue terror
and then you look back at the history of
the terrorist list it's very striking I
mean one person who was just removed
from it two years ago is Nelson Mandela
the reason is that the African National
Congress was characterized by the Reagan
administration in 1988 right near the
end of apartheid as one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
now therefore the u.s. was entitled to
support the partite South Africa as it
did and not only in its atrocities
internally but in its
attacks on neighboring countries which
apparently killed about a me and a half
people but that's all okay it's part of
the war on terror the fact Reagan had
declared and we have to defend the
apartheid regime against one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
including Nelson Mandela by today's
standards holder vs. humanitarian law
project almost anyone who was involved
in anti-apartheid activity could be
regarded as a terrorist giving material
support for terrorism as I said Mandela
was just removed from the tip from the
terrorists list two years ago he can now
come to the United States without
special dispensation there are other
equally dramatic cases take 1982 there
was a state that had been on the
terrorist list Saddam Hussein's Iraq but
the Reagan administration wanted to
provide aid and assistance to Saddam so
therefore they removed
Iraq from the terrorist list and
proceeded to provide aid and assistance
right through his worst crimes denying
the crimes and in fact rather strikingly
when Saddam was tried it was for crimes
that he committed in 1982 by his
standards pretty minor crimes excluding
the major crimes I presumed because
those were all supported by the United
States and in fact even denied by the
Reagan administration well there was a
gap in the terrorists list because Iraq
was removed had to be filled so it was
filled by Cuba Cuba was added to the
terrorist list partly in order to give
some justification for outlandish claims
about why we were entitled to support
murderous terrorist regimes in Central
America which left a couple hundred
thousand corpses much worse thanks to
our involvement and you had it so the
argument was well they're being
supported by Cuba so it must be a
terrorist state fabrication but that
doesn't matter in these cases however
Cuba was a pretty good choice
in the preceding years the Cuba had been
the target of more international
terrorism than probably the rest of the
world combined a lot of it coming from
right here so therefore a Cuba went into
the terrorists list and said I'm was
taken off so we could support his major
crimes which were coming well these are
we ought to think about why we even
tolerate the concept of a terrorist list
and it's just not questioned the
government says someone's on a terrorist
list period end of discussion and now if
you give say legal advice or other
advice to somebody that they so
designate you're a criminal and if
you're a 15 year old child who's picking
allegedly picking up a gun to defend the
village that's under attack by US
soldiers you sent off for 16 years of
prison torture and so on if that's what
the rule of law has come to it's a sad
situation we want to do we have a few
minutes and to start before we we get to
the question yes I want to make sure to
leave a substantial time but
unsurprisingly what we just heard has
provoked a lot of thoughts that that I
want to make because I think so many
seen points were just raised so one of
the interesting aspects of this two-tier
justice system and the idea that elites
can impose standards on everyone else
that they from which they exempt
themselves it's something that is
obviously mirrored in the context of
foreign relations and I think probably
was even pioneered there this idea that
the United States imposes standards on
everybody else and exempts itself is
really the template that then got
imported domestically and one of the
fascinating things to do is to go and
look at what current political leaders
say about things like war crimes
investigations and accountability when
they're in other countries doling out
sermons and lectures about what those
other countries should do so for example
President
Bhama who promulgated and gifted us all
with the slogan that we as good citizens
should look forward and not backward in
order to justify shielding bush-era
crimes from accountability gave an
interview last year on television in in
indonesia and the obama administration
has been pushing the indonesian
government to prosecute certain work
criminals whom the United States has
long disliked and what he told the
Indonesians was it is impossible to move
forward into a prosperous future until
you've resolved the past and Secretary
of State Clinton has visited both Kenya
and Cambodia where the United States is
similarly urging work crimes
investigations to proceed and has told
them the same thing essentially that you
cannot be among the nation that the
community of decent nations while you
continue to harbor and shield war
criminals from accountability and I
think the time that she visited Kenya
and said that was the time that George
Bush's book was released and he was on
every major television station being
heralded as a great statesman and of
course if you read and I would really
recommend that you do I did this because
I heard professor Chomsky many years ago
talked about it and went and read at the
opening and closing statements by Robert
Jackson that the Nuremberg tribunals
it's incredibly enlightening because
that was supposed to be the expression
of modern justice and not only did
Jackson point out that aggressive war
was the kingpin crime the crime above
all others but he also said that the
Nuremberg tribunals would have value
only if they were applied not only to
the defendants in the dock but also to
all the nations here assembled meaning
the United States and its allies and yet
if you were to cite that and argue that
that meant that George Bush and Dick
Cheney and Don Rumsfeld should be
prosecuted as war criminals for the
aggressive attack on Iraq you could
almost nothing you could do that's more
self marginalizing than that even people
sympathetic to the idea that they should
be investigated criminally for the
torture regime or for a warrantless
eavesdropping somewhat recoil at the
idea that they should be held criminally
accountable for the
100,000 dead innocent Iraqis I think
because they view the act of Congress
authorizing yet and the large majorities
of the American citizen each hearing for
it as something that ought to immunize
them from that and I think shows just
how lawless we become that you can't
even cite the Nuremberg principles and
argue for its applicability in the
clearest possible case without becoming
self marginalized just a quick point
about assassinations and the like
I certainly agree with Professor Chomsky
that from a moral and ethical
perspective there's zero difference
between sending a Skye robot over
another country and eradicating the
lives of non citizens as opposed to
doing that to citizens based upon mere
suspicion or even a lack of suspicion
just as a desire to kill them but I do
think there's a practical difference
that is that there is a greater and
enhanced danger on several levels when
the government begins murdering its own
citizens for political dissidents as
opposed to citizens of other countries
on foreign soil and the difference is
this I think that you know just
legalistically the supreme court for a
writer for better for worse right or
wrong has said that the Constitution
applies to foreigners on US soil and to
American citizens wherever they are
found in the world but more importantly
than that is that when the government
starts acting against its own citizens
it really can escalate a climate of fear
that can lead to political suppression
and I think that's one of the things
that you've really seen in the United
States one of the most striking
experiences I've had since they'd begun
ranting about politics was the first
time that I ever wrote about WikiLeaks
this was back in early 2010 and this was
before really almost nobody knew who
icky leaks was at the time just before
they had released any of their news
making disclosures inside the United
States they had released several
important documents and had exposed
wrongdoing among corporations and
governments in other parts of the world
but not really in the United States and
nobody including me really knew much
about them but the Pentagon had prepared
a top-secret report they literally
classify the top secret in 2008 that
declared WikiLeaks to be an enemy of the
state and it described ways that they
could go about destroying WikiLeaks and
it's incredible
because the way in which WikiLeaks has
been rendered all but inoperable pretty
much comports with the things the
Pentagon laid out in his 2008 report but
in any event in the stupid this 2008
report his top-secret report ironically
was leaked to WikiLeaks which then
published it and the New York Times
wrote about it and in the New York Times
article basically said there's the
pentagon report that's been leaked that
declares WikiLeaks an enemy of the state
and talks about ways to destroy it and I
didn't know very much at all about
WikiLeaks at the time but I kind of
assumed that any organization that had
been targeted that way by the Pentagon
was one that merited a lot more
attention and probably a lot more
encouragement and even support and so I
went and read a lot about them and I
interviewed Julian Assange for the
article that I wrote and I I wrote about
it and I posted the audio interview and
at the end I encourage people to go and
donate to WikiLeaks
because they had budgetary constraints
that were preventing them from going
public with a lot of these disclosures
it takes a lot of time and energy to
authenticate the documents one of the
things the Pentagon talked about to
destroy them was submitting fraudulent
documents to them so that when they
published it it would forever destroy
their credibility and the credibility of
future disclosures and in response to my
recommendation that people go and donate
to them and I provided the link how
people could do that electronically and
online and through PayPal
dozens of people literally told me in
many different venues in the comment
section to what I had written by email
at events like this where I talked to
people that although they agreed
wholeheartedly with what I had written
about the potential of WikiLeaks to
achieve great good that they were afraid
of donating money to WikiLeaks
especially electronically because they
would end up on some government list
somewhere or that they could even be
subjected to criminal liability under
the extraordinarily broad material
support for terrorism statutes that
Professor Chomsky just talked about and
these were not people prone to wild
conspiracy theories these were very
sober Americans who I had interaction
with in the past on other issues a lot
of them were and I could just tell from
the way that they were expressing these
fears that they were very rational
people and they these fears were well
grounded and the reason it was so
amazing to me was because it really
highlighted how this extraordinary
climate of fear has been created the
United States WikiLeaks is a group that
had
ever been and still has never been
charged with a crime let alone convicted
of one and they couldn't be because what
they're doing is pure first and I'm an
activity that the New York Times in the
Washington Post in theory do every day
which is publish a publicize leaks that
are given to them by other people and
yet these were American citizens who
were petrified of exercising core First
Amendment rights which is what donating
money to an organization whose political
cause you support is and they were
basically intimidated from the things
we've seen over the last ten years in
terms of lawlessness by what the
government has done from exercising
these right so you can offer all the
rights in the world on a piece of paper
or a piece of parchment that you want
you don't need to eliminate those rights
if you can intimidate and bully the
population into refraining from
exercising them and this really occurred
to me even more when I wrote for the
first time about the extremely harsh and
oppressive conditions in which Bradley
Manning was being detained and I
remember when I first wrote about it a
lot of people wondered and I actually
even wondered myself why would the Obama
administration basically turn bradley
manning into almost a martyr and even
jeopardize its own ability to prosecute
him by subjecting him to this extremely
severe you could call it torture but at
the very least it's inhumane treatment
he was in prolonged solitary confinement
for nine months despite being convicted
of nothing his clothes were taken from
him he was stripped nude and forced to
stand naked for many of those days just
completely punitive measures and at some
point shortly thereafter I realized that
the reason that that was done was the
same reason that the Bush administration
took people who were completely innocent
by the hundreds and shipped them
thousands of miles away to a Caribbean
island and dressed them in orange
jumpsuits and sack holes and showed the
world what we had done it's a way of
signaling to the world and to would-be
challengers to American power both
domestically and internationally that we
are not constrained by law we don't have
any limits on what we can do if you're
somebody who thinks about challenging
what we can do take a look at these
pictures of people at Guantanamo who are
gonna be there for as long as we want to
keep them there even if they're innocent
or if you're somebody who discovers
wrongdoing in seriously legality on the
highest levels of our government and you
want to expose it to the world think
about and look at what we've done to
Bradley Manning or what we're now doing
to WikiLeaks without any even pretense
to legal authority and without any
constraint whatsoever it's really the
use of law as a means of coercion which
is the exact antithesis of what it was
supposed to be it's those in power using
law as a weapon to entrench their power
and to shield their ill-gotten gains and
the fact that we can call terrorism
whatever we want it to be the fact that
people who as Professor Chomsky said
take up arms and fight against American
troops or terrorists the fact that we
just indicted someone nine months ago
for quote raising funds to kill American
troops in Iraq this was an Iraqi who had
raised money to defend his own homeland
from an invading army so if you're an
Iraqi and the American army invades your
country and you take up arms against
them you're a terrorist Nidal Hasan who
attacked a military base of a country
that has spent 10 years for claiming
we're at war and killed soldiers about
to be deployed to war he is a terrorist
as well and yet when the United States
or Israel our allies directly target and
kill civilians by enormous numbers
whether recklessly or deliberately it
would be a radical act to describe that
as terrorism this is all designed to be
able to criminalize whomever the United
States wants namely those who challenge
it in any meaningful way and that really
is the use of law coercively to entrench
those in power rather than to equalize
the playing field the final point I want
to make of and I think we can turn it
over to questions and answers is
Professor Chomsky referenced this post
by Matt Iglesias who is a byproduct of
this school near near where we're
talking any also works for the center of
American prosthetic for American
Progress which is basically an
organization run by John Podesta the
former Clinton White House official that
was founded in essence to justify and
defend whatever the Obama White House
does with some exceptions here and there
if you search hard enough but basically
that's its function and the fact that
people who write for them do things and
say things to mitigate or defend things
like assassinating an American citizen
with no deep
it's probably the most radical act that
you can think of really underscores an
important point about the way the Obama
legacy is being defined in the way that
lawlessness has become normalized so if
you know three years ago and I know I
say this is somebody who was doing it if
you were to go to an event like this and
fill the room with 50% Republicans and
50% Democrats and you were to talk about
and condemn things like wild assertions
of executive authority the idea that the
president can act against anyone he
wants with no constraints whatsoever
including killing him that he can do so
in total secrecy and with no
transparency or checks and of course
after we killed Anwar Awlaki two weeks
later a drone attack killed his 16 year
old son and his 17 year old cousin in
Yemen and that the US government refuses
to even account for what it did there or
describe what principles if you were to
talk about those things and the other
radical secrecy doctrines the Bush
administration used you would have 50%
of the room the ones identified
self-identified as Republicans
supporting it cheering for it justifying
it apologizing for it
and being happy with it but 50 percent
of the room the ones self-identified as
Democrats would be feigning anger over
it they'd be objecting to it as
shredding the Constitution and
right-wing radicalism and all of this if
you were to take that same exact group
of people and put them in a room like
this now and talk about those same exact
things that I just described you would
now have 90% of the room cheering for it
and supporting it or at least justifying
it and mitigating it the way that you
glacis from that post did or at least
acquiesce in to it maybe 10% of the room
continuing to be angry about it because
they were actually angry about its being
done the first time around and not
pretending to be angry opportunistically
for partisan gain and this has really
changed the way these issues are
discussed the fact that now it's not
just the Republican Party standing for
this form of lawlessness but that it's
become under President Obama bipartisan
consensus which means it's removed from
political debate it is hardly
controversial any longer and it's
entrenched as orthodoxy and American
political life for at least a generation
there's Jack Balkan who's a yellow
professor has talked about how what when
one party objects to a policy and the
other opposes it or supports it
what happens when the other party gets
into office and starts continuing it it
becomes no longer a controversial policy
it becomes American consensus and
indoors without much challenge for at
least a generation that is what has
happened to these policies of
lawlessness
and wild theories of executive power and
the right of the American president to
target anyone for violence or
interrogation or incarceration without
any oversight it has now taken on the
face of both parties and is therefore
likely normalized for a very long time
and to me that's one of the most
significant legacies of the Obama
presidency so with that I think it's a
good time to take questions I think the
mechanics were described at the start I
didn't hear it so I will rely on you the
first thanks to our speakers
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
we have about 15-20 minutes for
questions so just head down to this mic
and try to keep your questions brief so
we can get to as many as you as possible
Thanks
so how do you feel after all these years
are seeing and all that you've done
seeing what's happened to our country
that yes to won't to you professor
Chomsky first I've had more years
well actually it's it's it's pretty bad
but we should recognize that it's not
really all that new go back to the the
the the day the the modern conception of
international law was pretty well
founded right after the Second World War
the Nuremberg Tribunal chartered the
United Nations and so on but what so
what was the position of the United
States then well the United States was
instrumental in setting up the World
Court in International Court of Justice
but at once of the United States
declared that it is not subject to any
charges based on international treaties
meaning the UN Charter the Charter the
Organization of American States or
others and in fact that actually came to
the court it came to the court during
the Reagan years when the government of
Nicaragua brought a charges against the
United States for essentially war
against Nicaragua or international
terrorism if you want to lower the
charge the Nicaraguan case was presented
by a distinguished Harvard Law School
professor most of it was thrown out and
it was thrown out because the case
appealed to the core principles of
entered modern international law UN
Charter OAS and so on so in fact the lid
in the case was finally you know judged
it was restricted to very narrow grounds
bilateral the u.s. Nicaraguan treaty and
what's called a common common
international law was generally
understood even on that narrow basis the
US was accused of unlawful use of force
which means terrorism and late language
and ordered to pay substantial
reparations well how did the bipartisan
Congress react by increasing aid to the
Contras increasing the actions just
condemned this criminal meanwhile the
New York Times for example dismissed the
court as a hostile for a proof that it's
a hostile and therefore insignificant
hostile forum because it made charges
against the u.s. a couple of years
earlier the same times and other
commentators were praising the court
because it supported the u.s. in a
charge against Iran
well that's in fact the United States
went on to veto I think two Security
Council resolutions which called on all
states to observe international law well
all of that passed with virtually no
comment almost nobody knows about this
except maybe some specialists and it
goes beyond in 1948
the you know the United Nations passed a
genocide condemnation of genocide
genocide major crime forty years later
the United States ratified it but with
the reservation inapplicable to the
United States and that came to the
courts to couple years later Yugoslavia
brought charges against NATO for bombing
and among the charges was a reference to
genocide the united states
representative appealed to the court and
said that the united states would
withdraw from the proceedings because
the united states was formally entitled
to commit genocide which is true by this
reservation and the court accepted that
correctly the court rules are that they
can't try bringing him into trial unless
they agree to the proceedings so the
united states was excluded from the
charges the rest of the NATO powers
weren't that was reported but with no
comment if we declare that we're
entitled to carry out genocide fine then
we're entitled to carry out genocide now
these things are pretty deep it's
probably true that Bush broke
let's take even the torture charges if
you look carefully it's not so clear
that Bush was in serious violation of US
law when they carried out torture at
Guantanamo or at Abu Ghraib because the
u.s. never really signed the torture
convention it was rewritten by the
Senate to exclude certain categories of
torture and if you look at those
categories they are the categories that
the CIA carries out the CIA back in the
50s basing themselves on KGB manuals and
so on they redefined tortured to allow
what's called mental torture you know
the kind that doesn't leave marks so for
example actually even waterboarding so
you know take a Bradley Manning and
solitary confinement of course torture
or any reasonable means but not by US
law and that was then signed to the
legislation under Clinton so what's
called torture here is a very narrow
category and a good deal of the torture
that the u.s. carries out is actually
legal under US law well you know this is
discussed by specialists in
constitutional law and Sanford
Levinson and others but almost nobody
knows about it well you know these are
things everyone know to know of it okay
yep okay I wanted to ask you about two
implications or suggestions that I drew
from your book the first is that it
excuse me um the there's really the
unmistakable conclusion that that our
officials you know judges politicians
won't or can't which is more scary holt
powerful powerful criminal behavior
accountable even in the most egregious
examples such as torture and this the
the possibility that the cognitive
dissonance that this raises and our
officials that they're not you know the
constant awareness that they're not
their role as officials may be driving
this need to sort of scapegoat to find
the most vulnerable the mo the least
politically powerful for the most
trivial offenses accountable so to be
able to demonstrate okay look we are
holding we're holding a lot of people
accountable they're just not holding you
know accountable according to law so
it's this kind of charade of judicious
nest it sort of passes for lawfulness
and it's kind of vigorousness behind it
that maybe you know not this knowledge
of this imbalanced may be driving this
kind of and perpetuating the imbalance
and then the second implication was that
when our when our officials give up on
law enforcement as their role that
perhaps law-breaking greater greater
extremes of law-breaking becomes a means
of expressing power so that yes you know
our financial system engages in
widespread fraud but only the president
can violate the Constitution yeah those
are both interesting and important
points you know it is true that law and
order basically tends to mean get drug
dealers off the corner who are smelling
selling small quantities of drugs to two
other adults who want to buy them and of
course that has all kinds of
implications I mean the drug war is
incredibly racist it has incredibly
disproportionate effects on the poor and
yet at the same time or or law and order
means and the rule of law means you know
pepper spraying protestors and putting
them into prison for peacefully
assembling at the same time that the
police are protecting the criminals on
Wall Street who destroyed the economy
and committed fraud on an
incomprehensible scale so I think you're
right that essentially these kind of
petty transgressions that are punished
so harshly is a way of obscuring the
fact that the most significant criminals
the most consequential crimes are are
shielded and that the the biggest
criminals are allowed to continue to run
rampant with their criminality on the
other point about as a way of expressing
power you know one of the fascinating
things about this whole idea of look for
not backwards and the like is that at
the same time the very same
administration that has invoked this
Orwellian slogan as a means of saying
we shouldn't look to political crimes of
the bush-era on has waged the most the
harshest and the most unprecedented war
on whistleblowers people who have leaked
what unquestionably is evidence of
serious wrongdoing so for example the
NSA scandal that revealed that the Bush
administration was spying on American
citizens without the law without the
warrants the criminal law said is
required and that the law calls a felony
if you do the only person to suffer any
consequences from that scandal is
someone named Thomas Tamm who was a
mid-level Department of Justice lawyer
who found out the Bush administration
was doing this in one day called Eric
Lichtblau at the New York Times to tell
him that this was going on he was he was
a grand jury was convened he was
continuously subpoenaed he lost his job
he couldn't afford lawyers he went
bankrupt and became had Syria's
emotional and psychological problems as
a result of that persecution all of the
people who broke the law have been
completely shielded they want on to
write books and get very rich only the
person who exposed it has been subjected
to any form of of sanction and and
punishment that absolutely is about
expressing power and saying that you
know if you expose any of the things
that we're doing that are criminal and
wrong you will be the one who will be
punished
using the dressings of law to do it
while we simultaneously shield ourselves
hi I hope you both have time to answer
this but first professor Chomsky
and I came down from occupy Burlington
Vermont today to be here
[Applause]
and I'm really inspired by the number of
people that have risen up to protest the
bullying as you put it of American
elites in many respects through the
Occupy movement do you think that the
Occupy movement has the potential to
revolutionize revolutionize the system
to the point that we can topple the
power that has so corrupted the rule of
law what do you think the movement will
need to achieve in order to achieve and
overcome in order to do this well I mean
I think the Occupy movements which are
now all over the country in fact all
over the world are very exciting
development in fact inspiring in a lot
of ways and really unprecedented I don't
know of anything quite like them in the
past which is make sense this is an
unprecedented period in many ways what
can they achieve they've already
achieved a lot I think they've put
things they've shifted the range of
discussion which is quite important
they've at the very least are laying
down a legacy from which you can move on
there are short-term things that they
might be able to achieve which are quite
urgent so to take one in just a couple
of weeks the deficit Commission is due
to reach it's a decision which will
probably be stalemate but whether it
reaches a decision or stalemates it's a
real dagger pointed at the heart of the
country either way because if it doesn't
reach a decision you go into kind of an
automatic trap that's been set up which
is aimed at doing exactly the opposite
of what Americans want it's a rather
striking fact you take a look at polls
first of all large majority the people
don't think that the deficit is the
problem anyway and they're right the
problems joblessness there shouldn't be
a deficit Commission but even if you
keep to this minor question of the deaf
very large majorities have a solution
tax the super-rich bring taxes back to
what they once wore were during our
period of rapid growth in fact so tax
the super rich and preserve benefits
even Tea Party supporters that takes
that position support protect the
benefits which are not great but are
crucial for people well they can the
Commission if it reaches a decision or
the automatic process if it doesn't
reach your decision are going to do just
the opposite they'll cut away at the
limited benefits incidently ignoring the
reason why they're in fiscal problem
Social Security is not a problem at all
that's just thrown in in order to try to
destroy it
Medicare is a problem because it works
through the privatized unregulated were
virtually unregulated insurance based
health care system is a complete
international scandal the US had a
health care system like other industrial
countries there wouldn't be any deficit
effect would be a sort of look but that
okay that can't even be discussed
because the financial institutions are
against it and this goes back to things
that Glen outlines very well in his book
the but that's coming right away
and it's possible it's a long shot but
if the Occupy movements get enough kind
of force and energy and influence they
might do something about this short-term
problem now that's very far from
revolutionizing the society when you
talk about deeper problems more
long-term ones it has to be understood
and I think is that you don't get these
things overnight take say the civil
rights movement and that really began in
a militant form in the 1930s the years
of struggle before it even you know
reached the possibility where you could
discuss it if finally thanks to very
courageous activities students sitting
at at lunch counters the Freedom Riders
all sorts of other things
it was possible to get to the point
where Martin Luther King a great figure
in modern life was able to give a talk I
have a dream talk and some games were
won they shouldn't be underestimated the
South is a different place from what it
was and in fact as long that's take
people right around here Boston as long
as civil rights movement was aimed at
racist alabama sheriffs a lot of support
for it as soon as King began to move on
to opposition of the Vietnam War and
class issues remember that when he was
killed he was on his way to organize a
port it was killed during a santa State
in supporting a sign as well it's
sporting sanitation strike soon as he
moved on to those he was dismissed when
you listen to the adulation on Martin
Luther King Day you hear about the
racist alabama sheriffs well gains were
one after many years of hard struggle
there's a long way to go the
criminalization that Glenn talked about
is basically kind of reinstituting what
was done in the write up not long after
the Civil War criminalizing black life
and pretty much restoring the conditions
that existed so there's a long way to go
and that's one of the successful
movements and it's true of other things
too there can be very significant gains
in the long term really revolutionary
games but they're not going to come
quickly
and the main task of the Occupy movement
in my opinion is to make use of the
quite remarkable network of associations
and linkages and mutual support and
building spontaneous building of
communities make use of all of that to
turn it into something that will be long
lasting and enduring and we'll face the
inevitable failures and go on to
overcome which is a hard long
the course to follow we have just two or
three more minutes and two more
questions to go so thanks I'd be
interested what both of you think about
this taboo subject the US Attorney
scandal the bogus acorn scandal the the
current read redistricting efforts
making photo ID requirements the making
the assault on unions and an early
voting and registration all seem part of
a concentrated war on the right to vote
so first of all given that these people
seem going to say to anything in pursuit
of their agenda what is the likelihood
that having highly hackable easily often
failing machines that they own and
operate with zero citizen oversight
would not be part of their strategy and
you have any advice for what I can do to
get this subject on the radar of my hero
Glenn Greenwald well I guess you just
forced on my radar because I'm about to
address it but you know I think just
conceptually and I will address the
specific question in a second but you
know it raises the question about
whether or not significant economic and
wealth inequality can coexist with rough
political equality or whether or not
once there's a small faction that can
gain so much power through its wealth
then political equality or democratic
institutions cannot possibly resist it
any longer or remain invulnerable to it
and there are ways and you know even the
founders talked about this the problem
that if you're going to all-out wealth
and income inequality that there's the
danger that it can become so
concentrated that it'll in fact
political and legal institutions as well
where it's not supposed to make a
difference and yet we've seen periods of
time in American history where there's
been lots of wealth and income
inequality and yet at the same time
political and democratic institutions
have been able to act fairly
meaningfully against the most powerful
oligarchs you know Standard Oil and and
and JP Morgan were broken up Franklin
Roosevelt was able to create lots of
redistributive and social programs
lots of
social progress of the kind that
Professor Chomsky was just describing so
you can it's been empirically proven
that you can have significant wealth and
income inequality at the same time
political equality that's contingent
upon subjecting those who are the most
wealthy the wealthiest and the most
politically powerful to the same rules
and limitations to which the rest of us
are bound in in which we democratically
impose on them and once that starts not
to happen that's when you get the kind
of corruption that seeps into all the
other institutions as far as control
over the voting machines and the like
you know the all political processes are
subjected to corruption and coercion and
the like I haven't seen evidence that
there's systematic fraud on the part of
in terms of our electoral process that
comes from voting machine control and at
the same time I'm not particularly
convinced that there's anyone who has
such an overwhelming interest since both
parties seem to serve the same interest
anyway I'm not really sure who would be
motivated to care enough about about
that other than the two parties
themselves but you know certainly
there's instances where there's
irregularities but I think the more
important danger is the one that you
talked about which is efforts to start
restricting the right to vote more to
make towards sort of return to the poll
tax era where people who have certain
political views or have huge impediments
thrown in the way and that to me is just
part and parcel of the generalized trend
of using what is supposed to be law and
political equality to achieve exactly
the opposite step last question here and
then we can
hi all the hassle and trying to get me
to ask this question is reflective of
how my civil rights and the civil rights
of all the people who can't be here with
BIA with disabilities are violated by
the elite of Cambridge who also exempt
themselves from the basic civil rights
of access for 20 years I've had the
right to fall free and front door access
every building in the country but the
elite of Cambridge and the good people
of Cambridge who support them exempt
this elite by using the term historic
which is an ideological term meaning
looks good and keeps property values up
and by that process there was a special
entrance for me that I got to go in in
which the elevator fell an inch and a
half when I got in when we got to the
top of the elevator we ran into a
handcart
and boxes blocking my way out and then
the door into the auditorium was locked
and then when I came in finally after
knocking to get in no one knew what to
do with me or where to put me so I I
called this bullying it's it's really a
constant ongoing humiliation now of
course the burden that would be placed
on the Brattle by making it fully
accessible through the front entrance
would cost a lot but maybe that money is
meanwhile being used to put the
torturing brick sidewalks on my way to
try to get to the front entrance which
everyone knows tortures people with
disabilities and anyone pushing any
wheels and yet they're all over this
area because the elite of exempted
themselves right in front of everyone
and unfortunately you end up
participating in a glen by coming to an
event where people can't get to were
bullied all the time i was in the street
most of the way on the way to get here
and i hope that in the future that you
would not
speak in a place that didn't have every
single person who could come in come in
the front door because coming in the
front door used to be something that was
seen as a civil right in itself thank
you very much
[Music]
yeah so I you know obviously I wasn't
aware of this building ever before
there's laws that require reasonable
steps to be taken to provide access to
people who are disabled I've litigated
those cases before on behalf of people
who are disabled whether there's issues
around historic designations and the
like is something I'm just not aware of
them I'm appreciative of your bringing
it to my attention though and and to the
attention of everyone here it's
something I'll certainly give some
thought to okay just add a word that I
think the complaint quite legitimate but
it also bears on the preceding question
of can we do anything about it and the
answer is yes we can it's very different
from what it was 40 years ago and those
changes which have are part of a part of
the general civilising of the country in
many ways that has traces back to many
things but in particular to the activism
of the 60s and it's aftermath a large
part of the civilizing effect of the 60s
actually began later so the feminist
movement for example has had a huge
change the support for access of
disabled people that's all pretty much
post 60s and it shows what can be
achieved by popular engagement a
recognition of serious issues pressure
do something about them and progress and
progress still has big gaps but we
shouldn't overlook the fact two facts
one that there has been progress and two
that that progress has not been a gift
from above but has been achieved through
popular engagement often struggle and
that's a lesson for the future
