for reaction to the WikiLeaks documents
we're joined now by world-renowned
political dissident and linguist noam
chomsky professor emeritus at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
author of over a hundred books including
his latest hopes and prospects well 40
years ago Noam and the late historian
Howard Zhen
helped government whistleblower Daniel
Ellsberg edit and released the Pentagon
Papers the top secret internal US
history of the Vietnam War Noam Chomsky
joins us now from Boston it's good to
have you back again Noam why don't we
start there before we talk about
WikiLeaks what was your involvement with
the Pentagon Papers I don't think most
people know about this dan and I were
friends
Tony Russo also who also prepared them
and helped leak them and I got advanced
copies from Dan and Tony and there were
several there were several people who
were releasing them to the press I was
one of them and then I along with Howard
goes in as you mentioned edited a volume
of essays and an index to the papers so
explain though how it worked and I
always think this is important to tell
the story especially for young people
Dan Ellsberg Pentagon official top
secret clearance gets this u.s.
involvement in Vietnam history out of
his safe he Xeroxes it and then how did
you get your hands on it he just
directly gave it to you from Dan and Dan
Ellsberg and Tony Russo who had done the
xeroxing and the preparation of the
material yes did you edit
well we didn't modify anything we the
the papers were not edited they're just
in their original form what Howard Zinn
and I did was they came out in four
volumes we prepared a fifth volume which
is critical essays by there
many scholars on the on the fake versus
what they mean their significance and so
on and an index which is almost
indispensable for using them seriously
the fifth volume and they beacon press
series you were then one of the first
people to see the Pentagon Papers
outside of Dan Ellsberg fraternity
Rousseau yes I mean there were some
journalists who may have seen them I'm
not sure so what are your thoughts today
as for example we just play this clip of
New York Republican Congress member
Peter King who says WikiLeaks should be
to declare it a foreign terrorist
organization I think that's outlandish
the materials we should understand and
the Pentagon Papers is another case in
point that one of the major reasons for
government secrecy is to protect the
government from its own population in
the Pentagon Papers for example there
was there was one volume the
negotiations volume which might have had
bearing on ongoing activities and
Ellsberg withheld that that came out a
little bit later but if you look at the
papers themselves there are things that
Americans should should have known that
the government didn't want them to know
and as far as I can tell from what I've
seen here are pretty much the same is
true in fact the paper the current leaks
are what I've seen at least primarily
interesting because of what they tell us
about how the diplomatic service works
the documents revelations about Iran
come just as the Iranian government has
agreed to a new round of nuclear talks
beginning next month on Monday Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
the cables vindicate the Israeli
position that Iran poses a nuclear
threat Netanyahu said quote our region
has been hostage to a narrative that as
a result of sixty years of propaganda
which paints Israel is the greatest
threat in reality leaders understand
that that view is bankrupt for the first
time in history there's agreement that
Iran is the threat if leaders starts
saying openly what they have long been
saying behind closed doors we can make a
real breakthrough on the road to peace
Netanyahu said Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton also discussed a run at
her news conference in Washington this
is what she said I think that it should
not be a surprise to anyone that Iran is
a source of great concern not only in
the United States that what comes
through in every meeting that I have
anywhere in the world is a concern about
Iranian actions and intentions so if
anything any of the the comments that
are being reported on allegedly from the
cables confirm the fact that Iran poses
a very serious threat in the eyes of
many of her neighbors and a serious
concern far beyond her region that is
why the international community came
together to pass the strongest possible
sanctions against Iran it did not happen
because the United States went out and
said please do this for us
it happened because countries once they
evaluated the evidence concerning Iran's
actions and intentions reached the same
conclusion that the United States
reached that we must do whatever we can
to muster the international community to
take action to prevent Iran from
becoming a nuclear weapons state so if
if anyone reading the stories about
these alleged cables thinks carefully
what they will conclude is that the
concern about Iran is well-founded
widely shared and will continue to be at
the source of the policy that we pursue
with
like-minded nations to try to prevent
Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons that
was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
yesterday at a news conference I wanted
to get your comment on hit on Clinton
Netanyahu's comment and the fact that
Abdullah of Saudi Arabia the king who's
now getting back surgery in New York
called for the u.s. to attack Iran Noam
Chomsky that essentially reinforces what
I said before that the main significance
of the cables that have been released so
far is what they tell us about a Western
leadership so Hillary Clinton and
Benjamin Netanyahu surely know of the
careful polls of Arab public opinion the
Brookings Institute just a few months
ago released extensive polls of what
Arabs think about Iran and the results
are rather striking they show that Arab
opinion does hold that the major threat
in the region is Israel that's 80
percent the second major threat is the
United States that's seventy seven
percent Iran is listed as a threat by 10
percent with regard to nuclear weapons
rather remarkably a majority in fact 57
percent say that the region will be it
would have a positive effect in the
region if Iran had nuclear weapons now
these are not small numbers 80 percent
74 77 percent say that the US and Israel
of the major threat 10 percent say that
Iran is a major threat now this may not
be reported in the newspapers here it is
in England but it's certainly familiar
to the Israeli and the US governments
and to the ambassadors but there isn't a
word about it anywhere what that reveals
is the profound hatred for democracy on
the part of
our political leadership and of course
the Israeli political leadership these
things aren't even to be mentioned and
this seeps its way all through the
diplomatic service so the the cables
don't have any indication of that when
they talk about Arabs they mean the Arab
dictators not the population which is
overwhelmingly opposed to the
conclusions that the case that the
analysts here Clinton and the media has
drawn there's also a minor prop that is
the major problem a minor problem is
that we don't know from the cables out
of what the Arab leaders think and say
we know what was selected from the range
of what they say so there's a filtering
process we don't know how much it
distorts the information but there's no
question that what is a radical
distortion is or not even a distortion a
reflection of the concern that the
dictators are what mattered the
population doesn't matter even if it's
overwhelmingly opposed to US policy this
shows up that there are similar things
elsewhere
so there's keeping to this region one of
the most interesting cables was a cable
from the US ambassador in Israel to
Hillary Clinton which described the as
attack on Gaza which should call a u.s.
Israeli attack on Gaza December 19 2008
it states that correctly that there had
been a truce it does not add that during
the truce which was really not observed
by Israel but during the truce Hamas
scrupulously observed it according to
the Israeli government not a single
rocket was filed
that's an omission but then comes a
straight lie it says that in December
2008 Hamas renewed rocket firing and
therefore Israel had
to attack and this self-defense now the
Ambassador surely is aware that there
must be somebody in the American Embassy
who reads the Israeli press the
mainstream Israeli press in which case
the embassy is surely aware that it's
exactly the opposite
Hamas was calling for a renewal of the
ceasefire Israel considered the offer
and rejected it preferring to bomb
rather than to have security also
omitted is that wallies will never
observe the ceasefire maintain the siege
in violation of the truce agreement on
November 4th the u.s. election 2008 the
Israeli army entered Gaza that killed
they together and killed half a dozen
Hamas militants which did lead to an
exchange of fire in which all the
casualties as usual Palestinian then in
December Hamas when they first
officially ended Hamas called for
renewing it Israel refused and the US
and Israel chose to launch the war what
the embassy reported is a gross
falsification and a very significant one
since it has to do with the
justification for this murderous attack
which means either the embassy hasn't a
clue what's going on or else they're
lying outright
