well with you I mean the the first thing
to do is overcome the misconceptions not
to explain what you mean by anarchism
now it's a pretty broad concept like in
general the concepts of political
discourse are very far from precise I
mean to try to explain what liberal
means or capitalism means or any term
you pick they're used in highly varied
and complex and often contradictory ways
and anarchism is no exception but I
think if you try to find a sort of core
themes running through anarchist thought
in action there are some basically it
seems to me one should think of
anarchism as not a specific set of
doctrines but just a kind of a tendency
in human thought and action which asks
whether which tries to end to detect and
discover structures of authority
domination and hierarchy when there
plenty of them and challenge them ask
them to demonstrate their legitimacy
recognizing that they are not self
justifying they have a burden of
justification that's true all across the
spectrum of human life from patriarchal
families to Imperial systems and
everything in between
wherever you find the structure of
domination hierarchy somebody giving
orders and what are you taking them
whatever it may be you have to ask is
that legitimate well you cannot assume
that it you shouldn't assume it's or it
is legitimate because it's been like
that that's not a justification you have
to ask is it legitimate when you do you
generally find that it can't be
justified there are cases you can think
of
cases where you can make up a
justification but it try it it's pretty
hard most of the time the justification
is the way power is distributed that's
not a justification and anarchism is the
effort to discover such systems when
they can't justify themselves to
dismantle them and to move towards
greater freedom justice opportunity
individual creativity cooperative
activity and so on it's just a tendency
in history and I don't think it's hard
to communicate to people I think they
take it for granted if it's brought to
their attention and you see it for
example take one of the major
achievements of the last 50 years in
many societies the United States many
others I'm sure here has been women's
expansion of women's rights it's changed
enormously and how did it happen well as
soon as this structures of oppression
were identified that kind of disappeared
life is a not instantly of course this
resistance still plenty of resistance
but the powers of is a nice it's it's a
general truth that power prefers
darkness if it's exposed to the light
it'll roads if people can see it it
arose and this happens all through
history where does it lead so what would
the final goal be I don't think anyone
is smart enough to say that to say what
it would be this is something that's a
constant ongoing effort to try to expand
the realm of justice freedom
independence breakdown of authority and
so on and I don't see a truth that
should have any limits you can think of
all kind of concrete
cases so for example just think of the
forms of authority and domination that
exists in our societies one of the
dominant ones is wage labor if you go
back to the early days of the Industrial
Revolution in England and the United
States other countries people who were
being driven into the industrial system
the bitterly condemned it in the United
States and the mid 19th century when the
Industrial Revolution was beginning
working people described wage labor as
equivalent to slavery these only
difference was that wage the wage
laborers supposed to be temporary for a
slavery's permanent actually that was
such a widespread idea that it was a
slogan of the Republican Party Abraham
Lincoln accepted it that's when northern
workers went to war in the Civil War
that was one of their slogans want to
eliminate chattel slavery in a literal
slavery and wage look what they called
wage slavery no influence of Marx or
European radicalism this just came
straight out of popular understanding
the popular understanding of free and
dependent people who felt the rights are
being taken away by being forced into a
system where they have to sell
themselves to survive I mean they
understood you read there they had their
own this is the period of the freest
press in American history maybe any
history the working class press the fact
what we're called factory girls young
women taken from the farms and forced
into the textile mills either own
journals a very rich literature they and
one of the themes was that if you if you
sell what you
for a price like an independent crafts
person you make something and you sell
it you're selling what you produced if
you work for a wage you're selling
yourself you're losing your freedom you
you're the only thing that you're
selling is yourself
you're losing your freedom your dignity
your independence your worth as a person
well you know over the century over the
your century and a half this has kind of
been instilled into people's heads and
the intuitive understanding of the
absolute injustice of this relationship
has been kind of suppressed but I think
it's right below the surface I don't
think it takes much for people to
recover the understanding that was
second nature a century and a half ago
maybe some work but that's the kind of
thing that organizers and activists
ought to be doing and that's a kind of
oppression and domination I think should
be eliminated that we know how to do it
should be eliminated by enterprises that
are managed and run by their
participants not not a particularly
obscure or even utopian concept that
happens in many cases for example
there's a the in Spain vast country
there's a huge conglomerate Mondragon
which is more or less run on these
principles not quite but something like
it it's owned it's owned by the
participants they select their own
managers then manage of themselves but
it's under under recallable and so on
and so forth that's a step towards
overcoming the deep oppression of the
wage labour system in the United States
in the old industrial regions of Rust
Belt where the factories have been
abandoned and so on
there's a spontaneous spread of
worker-owned and worker managed
enterprises not huge ones but it's
pretty substantial ones in fact they're
now one of the more progressive unions
the United Steelworkers is right now
involved in discussions with Mondragon
in the Basque Country to try to
integrate their activities these things
come very naturally to people it seems
perfectly perfectly obvious thing to do
and I don't think there's difficulty in
communicating it what's the point you
know once people are freed from the
oppression that comes from just
reflexively adopting the customs and
conventions in which you in which you
survive actually it's rather similar to
the women's movement in this respect so
for example if you ask my grandmother
whether she was oppressed she would not
understood what you're talking about
that's like asking does she breathe you
know if you asked my mother whether she
was oppressed she knew it
that she resented it which thought
there's nothing you can do about it that
my daughter is totally different than
won't even bother answering those are
changes those are changes that have
taken place just through exposing power
to the sunlight and seeing it evaporate
and I think this can happen in many
domains so what would an anarchist
society look like well you know the
final result that I don't expect the
final result human life is too
complicated but the you can see steps
towards more freedom or elimination of
illegitimate structures of authority and
where it goes is for people to make
their own decisions about
