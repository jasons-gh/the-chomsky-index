water that is a perfect example have
discussed it at length in our book in
fact anywhere it's a perfect example of
the way the press was subordinated to
power but this is without this brought
down in residence let me give you any
for just a minute let's take a look what
happens there but here it's kind of
interesting because you know you can't
do experiments in history
but here history was kind enough to set
one on set setup set one up for us the
Watergate exposures happen to take place
at exactly the same time as another set
of exposures namely the exposures of
COINTELPRO oh sorry objects ablaze it's
interesting that I have to explain it
because it's vastly more significant
than Watergate that already makes my
point COINTELPRO was a program of
subversion carried out not by a couple
of petty crooks but by the national
political police the FBI under four
administrations it began in the late
Eisenhower administration ran up till
this is the payment of the socialist
look as much that my socials work is
putting one tiny fragment of it it began
by the time it got through I went
through the whole story it was aimed at
the entire New Left that the woman
women's movement that the whole black
movement it was extremely broad its
actions went as far as political
assassination now what's the difference
between the two very clear in Watergate
Richard Nixon went after half of US
private power namely the Democratic
Party and and power can defend itself so
therefore that's a scandal he didn't do
any nothing happened like I was on
Nixon's enemies list I didn't know
nothing ever happened
no but but nonetheless you wouldn't say
it was an insignificant event no it was
a christened it was a case where half of
us power defended itself against a
person who had obviously stepped out of
line that's so and the fact that the
press thought that was important shows
that they think powerful people it'll be
able to defend themselves
now whether there was a question of
principle involved happens to be easily
checked in this case one tiny part of
the COINTELPRO program was itself far
more significant in terms of principle
than all of Watergate and if you look at
the whole program I mean it's not even a
discussion but you have to asked me what
COINTELPRO is
water Gators there couldn't be a more
dramatic example of the subordination of
the educated opinion to power here in
England as well as the United States
