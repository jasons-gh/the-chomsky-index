well now it's time for night waves with
Phillip daughter yesterday was a day of
strange meetings full of unexpected
moments two interviews one with noam
chomsky to some commentators the world's
most famous public intellectual the
other with Anthony Selden historian of
contemporary Britain and master of
Wellington College a college founded in
1859 two very different figures one
profoundly skeptical of Authority
another by dint of his title its
upholder both interviewees up ended my
expectations at moments I had presumed
an explosive Noam Chomsky here to give
the Edouard side lecture on the Middle
East
spitting ly anti-american capable of
Manichaean judgments of good and of evil
it turned out rather different Noam
Chomsky is now 84 and he came initially
to prominence over fifty years ago as a
major new voice in linguistics but from
the 1960s onwards he has become a
perhaps now the dissenting voice in the
u.s. damming his country for what he
sees as its crimes from Vietnam to its
support of Israel Noam Chomsky comes
from an activist American Jewish
immigrant family so no surprise how he
has developed but what is arresting is a
sentence in an early 1967 essay
resistance where he speaks of his innate
distaste for activism odd for an
American whose global reputation rests
exactly on his activist writings and
actions I said when we met in a small
bedroom in some Pancras Hotel in London
yesterday if the world would go away I'd
be happy to do work that's
intellectually challenging and exciting
but the world doesn't go away so you're
compelled to do things that wouldn't be
my choice I'm kind of
hermit basically was the Ramon when you
made the choice or do you think the
choice was made for you do you think
history gave you this role whether you
like it or not I thought about it I mean
I first of all I hadn't been a youth
activist so I do what was involved but
the period of the 1950's it was a kind
of a quiet period not much was happening
and I was mostly doing my work writing
and so on
by about 1960 or 61 were beginning to
ferment in various domains civil rights
vietnam war other issues and i did make
a very conscious choice i mean i was
aware that when you put your toe in it
pretty soon you're going to be immersed
so it's nothing that you could do a
little bit of if you serious about it
and i had a kind of a nice life you know
i young family i had a tenured
University position at a place that I
liked a lot fuels it was developing very
well and I understood very well that the
things I'd give up things do what I want
to do it well made a choice it was very
conscious choice
what was your instinctive distaste I'm
interested in that this is a kind of
psychological thing for you is it you
don't like the glare of the spotlight
it's the same distaste that keeps me
from going to parties I just don't feel
comfortable with big groups yeah
rather be alone or the library one or
two friends or something like that it
goes back all the way well I want to
talk about going back if we can in two
ways your linguistic work but also in
the way I think your political work
comes out of a loyalty to the
Enlightenment I know nobody more than
you who's committed yourself to the kind
of clear light of reason from this
sixties on what is that a fair
description would be happy to consider
myself a child of the Enlightenment if I
could go back to
some period in history and my next
existence it might be say in Berlin
during Scottish enlightenment be nice to
meet David Hume and Adam Smith what
would you say to them that's a good
question I would tell him that as I say
our national character was terrible
although for the time not too bad I'd
love to hear humors response to that I
suppose what I feel is you know in those
early 60s essays of those mid 60s essays
you you planted your flag about reason
you've kept going with reason and one
way of reading the last 40 years and
some of the times were new writeable
they've been all kinds of defeats you
know in the occupied book which was
published last year you say the
objective conditions may be worse than
they were in the 30s
how much has your belief in reason been
eroded by history not at all whatever
happens doesn't affect the question of
whether you should try to deal with the
world rationally or irrationally I don't
see that as a choice but you know there
is a there's a response to that says if
the world does not respond to reason and
I always think you wouldn't I think you
were about 40 in 1968 so you're not a
sixty-eight guy you're not at all the
eruption of the surrealist unconscious
into everyday life is it wasn't part of
it no in fact they didn't like the music
didn't like the noise I like the young
people they're good people but I
couldn't be part of what they were doing
reason overrides every moment in history
does it your loyalty to it just it has
to be if you care about human beings and
their fate and you want to do something
to help them or if you care about
discovering significant aspects of the
universe or human nature or whatever it
may be you have another choice
it's either be rational and maybe make
some progress or be irrational make
things worse okay they know what to ask
one of the reasons I like the collection
of essays on Occupy you bring in to a
back into American discourse the word
that sometimes hard to find which is
class and you say very clearly that
occupy is arguably the first major
eruption of class feeling the 1% of the
99% in 30 years you were a child of the
30s in certain kinds of ways now I
suppose I tell myself reason didn't in
the first instance
make him feel loyalty a class you don't
feel mile to a class the rationale be
treason the reason I feel a duty and
responsibility to people who are
suffering and you know needlessly whom
we can do something about now it happens
that that's a class related choice but
it need not be class can be indigenous
people and I've spent time working with
poor company knows in southern Colombia
whose lives are being destroyed by
mining fumigation terror I don't know
what class they are they're just
indigenous people that for Colombians
campesinos and the same elsewhere I go
to a refugee camp and say they root and
see the conditions under which people
live the effort to do something for them
is not a class related matter but it
happens that in industrial societies
like air is relatively rich ones there's
there are very sharp class
differentiations which are suppressed
totally brought out so it's not a matter
your politics of what I would call
identification of what Raymond Williams
might have called social conscience
this is an individual this is when you
sound to a European most American it's
it's much more an individual rational
response to injustice I think you're
right about the distinctions one of the
things I prefer about American culture I
want to ask you now about something else
that you mention in the the occupy book
which is a at one moment you say given
the decimation of American industry you
mentioned that Obama's sending its
Minister of State over to Spain to order
high-speed trains and you say this could
easily have been done in the Rust Belt
it was particularly striking because I
forget whether I said it there but this
was at the time when Obama had largely
nationalized the auto industry and there
were some choices one choice the one
that was taken was to reconstruct it
with public funds and support and hand
it back to pretty much the old owners
maybe different faces but the same class
and have it continue to do what had been
doing in the past there were other
choices that one choice for example
would have been to hand it over to the
workforce and the communities and help
them produce things that are needed in
the country and it's an absolute scandal
that you can go from say China to
Kazakhstan in a high-speed rail but you
can't go from Boston to New York and a
nice being real it's harmful to people
it's harmful to the economy it's maybe
good for car manufacturers and energy
industries and banks and so on but that
could have been done and that would have
also had in my tea of a kind of a
revolutionary impact and bringing about
changes in the nature of the society
healthy changes there is another
response to that and I'm gonna now
you're now gonna play European and North
American for the next however long it
lasts the defense there of American
workers which is entirely honorable
neglects of course that one of the
consequences of the outsourcing by
capitalism it's what Marx as you would
know would call a contradiction is the
raising of between three and four
hundred million Chinese peasants from
absolute poverty into some kind of
living standard and capitalism is very
complex I don't think it does that I'm
all in favor of raising the Chinese
workforce the decent standards but I'd
say that we should do it the way that
they want not the way the management of
Apple wants and it happens to be very
different so at Foxconn say there's
constant strike others labor actions
constantly huge number of strikes trying
to get decent working conditions and
they're getting them no the barely good
no no no twenty percent in the last year
has is basically going from virtually
from hearth to slightly less are so I'd
say yes that's what we should be engaged
and it's not capitalism that's doing it
it's the struggle against capitalism and
I think yes we should be part of that
but I suppose what I'm saying is to sent
us so much of your thoughts on the
American working class and I know you're
American I don't I'm just as I have
written about Chinese workers and their
struggles and what we should do about
them I mean I from where I'm sitting in
Boston I can't do much about the labor
actions and self self western China I
can write about them talk about them and
so on but I think we should support them
and it's nothing to do with exporting
jobs we can historically it has been you
and I may not like it all you may not
like it I'm dispassionate because in my
circumstances but that's what's happened
well look a lot of things have happened
for example genocide that doesn't mean
I'm in favor of it but signal did go to
knowledge he is a good analogy with
there are things there are things that
are happening all over I think we would
like to see them haven't ever
so we should therefore act in such a way
as to help them happen differently if
there are massive labor struggles in
China yeah we should help them and if it
turns out that rearranging the job
choices will help them okay but there is
a question who makes those decisions I
it's not up to me it's not up to the
management of Apple it's up to the
workforce and the communities those
communities now have to be global that's
where you and I fine that's why that
unions are called internationals or that
reason yes has to be global and
Wednesday the United Steelworkers begins
to make an arrangement with Mondragon
and the vast country I think that's a
good idea who's going to make the
decisions and for what purpose
those are the questions I think the
decisions will be made democratically
not autocratically
and they ought to be designed not for
profit but for need and for decent human
lives how do we get from its to Ault how
do we get from where we are because the
problem for the left of which were
distinguished plenty of ways I mean we
just mentioned one for example if there
had been a powerful Occupy type movement
of popular movement in the United States
at the time of the this nationalization
of the auto industry and going to Spain
if there had been such a movement it
could have pressed for quite a different
response that happens all the time
like I think I forget whether I
mentioned there but right about the same
time and the Occupy there's a talk they
were given in the Boston Occupy movement
and I brought up cases right in bought
near Boston towns where workers were
attempting to take control take over a
profitable enterprise that the
multinational davonne didn't wanted to
get rid of and the multinational
preferred to get rid of it not to allow
it to be worker managed and I said look
this is something we can get involved in
right now and I agree but you've just
used that most complex of tenses and I
now speak to a linguist which
the subjunctive okay if so the the big
question therefore let's construct the
movements which will be able to do it
and they are doing it you believe no I'm
Unitas that's really what I'm asking you
you know occupy is there but do you
really believe it's doing it one of the
things that keeps tolling through your
you're a good thirties man because you
believe in hard work
whenever you speak to people you always
say it's got to be hard work it's got to
be long it's difficult there are lots of
defeats on the way it's hard to think
from the time you began your activism
that we're getting nearer are we getting
further away mmm
history goes in many directions so in
many respects the United States England
other countries are a lot more civilized
than they were in the 1960s
that's because of activism in some ways
there's there's been a reaction to that
in some ways there's regression okay
that turns it backwards but it's not a
simple matter that's the way progress
was made the slow difficult professional
always if there's any other way I've
never heard so revolution isn't on the
agenda slow painful complex reform is
well you know revolution could be on the
agenda if the great mass of the
population that's subjunctive again well
you're asking when revolution could be
on the agenda and there's a condition
for it the condition is if it's going to
be a constructive revolution not a
revolution towards some kind of
dictatorship or autocracy it can happen
constructively when a large mass of the
population understands recognizes that
they cannot achieve just goals that they
want within the current framework of
institution that takes us very nicely
sometimes broadcast to say that takes us
very nicely to the Middle East which is
why you yeah here in London do you think
what is happening in the Middle East is
some kind of transformative moment
because you're over here we're in effect
you're still saying and
I want us to come onto that that the US
and its allies still play a very big
role or enormous and less than they did
I was going to say did they play now the
determining role one might argue that
they played thirty years ago no no in
fact a u.s. Power has been declining
since 1945 American power reached its
peak at the end of the Second World War
the US had half the world's wealth other
industrial societies were devastated
security was unimaginable and there were
plans to reconstruct the world under the
American Aegis a very detailed plans
they were then implemented Marshall Plan
was part of it that by 1949 I was
falling apart and you know the response
to that since American powers been
declining since 49 wise Noam Chomsky
spent the best parts of his life railing
against a declining power I'm not really
against the declining power I'm the
railing against the crimes that it
carries out buddy
not in faith not against the decent
things that it does and yes it's quite
still by far the most overwhelmingly the
most powerful country in the world and
they take the Middle East it's
interesting to compare it with what
happened in Latin America over the past
ten years you go back 20 years ago
Latin America was what was called the
backyard completely under control if
anything got out of control
it was invaded put in a dictatorship
familiar story the last roughly 10 or 15
years the Latin America has extricated
itself from the system of external
domination first European and American
to a remarkable extent actually there
was a striking illustration of that just
a couple of weeks ago you perhaps saw
the study by the Open Society Institute
of rendition called globalizing tortures
a globalized torture campaign the US
have been running well other countries
participate and there was a study of the
countries that
dissipated most of Europe Middle East
that's where the torture was going on
you send them to dictatorships Asia
Africa one region was totally out
nothing
Latin America which is remarkable
first because Latin America had been
just taken for granted as utterly
subordinate to the US but also during
this long period a Latin America was one
of the torture centers of the world but
now they won't participate that's an
uprising and the u.s. I'm sure of
British planners are deeply concerned
that the so-called main a country's
Middle East North Africa might move in
the same direction what I was going to
say when you say it's it is the most
important player it's not the most
important player in Egypt as it was once
under Mubarak after all Obama took a
long time to sign up to the ante a
little misleading I mean there's a
standard procedure when your favorite
dictators in trouble dozens of cases
Somoza Marcos so hard his long list what
you do is you support him as long as
possible when it becomes impossible
because say the army turns against him
you send him off somewhere you it
doesn't look at Barak he's being sent
anywhere soon he just as a person he's
gone and but the next thing that you do
of course the issue ringing declarations
about your love of democracy but the
next thing you do is try to restore the
old order as much as possible and that's
just what's happening I didn't think the
Muslim Brotherhood anytime soon are
going to become a puppet for American
imperialism and you don't either
well that's not really true they know
you do believe it's not a look my bark
wasn't a puppet for American imperialism
either he was carrying out the kind of
programs that the u.s. approved of for
example the neoliberal economic programs
and the Brotherhood's doing the same
thing so yes Mubarak for example was
punishing the people of Gaza
morsi's doing the same thing so it's
it's not a matter of the you know
somebody holding a puppet by a noose
support harsh regimes or any kind of
regime if they're doing the kind of
things you like but then it seems to me
you're still I liked what you said
earlier much better but that's my
privilege and yours to disagree which is
that American powers been declining it
Ranieri
and then denied power it's not different
it's just it's declining and it's still
overwhelming there's no what is he doing
or what can it do or what should they do
in Syria in Syria well I think it's
clear what it shouldn't what it actually
is doing and she's not doing in Syria
it's probably pretty much the right
stand and I could give you man Tyrion
aid like they've been a lot of pledges
of humanitarian aid and they simply
haven't gone through and there's no
justification for that it's desperately
needed on the other hand what Britain
and France are doing my view is likely
to make it worse for the reasons that
have been discussed by just about
everyone who knows very well Patrick
Coburn a couple days ago Charles glass
Jonathan Steele others what all this is
one of those few moments when America is
preferable to Britain and friends not
the only one
Britain and France have a horrible
records I want to ask you two last
questions if if I may and and they
relate to your stance more generally and
I want since you're here in London you
know you've made loyal the notion of
freedom of expression you've got into
all kinds of trouble because of freedom
of expression today the British
Parliament will vote on statutory
legislation for the media would you be
in favor of it
not really your I'm an American again I
do believe in freedom of expression
there it's got no bounds oh yeah
everything has bounds there are no
absolute moral principles but I think of
it carries any limitations on it carry a
very strong burden of proof and in
written in my view it's scandalous not
the Leveson Inquiry things like the
British libel laws or international
scandal in my opinion and they've been
used to shut down newspapers to silence
people I mean I can see myself when if I
have a book that's being published in
the United States and it's going to
appear in England since it's going to
appear in England has to go through a
battery of lawyers to see if it's going
to violate these crazy libelous so you
can change certain things but you
wouldn't have staked statutory
regulation for the media it defends your
Americanism isn't it you have to see
exactly what the regulation is I don't
as I say I don't think you can state an
absolute principle but there's some
things that that general shouldn't do
with just how that should be controlled
there's another question I quote I mean
because you you know you've got yourself
into a lot of trouble in the seventies
writing an essay in a book by someone
who denied the Holocaust and the reason
you argue tease you thought he had the
right to say well actually first of all
I didn't get into a lot of trouble I got
into no trouble secondly I mean got into
trouble with some of the French oh yeah
they didn't like it secondly I didn't
write anything for the book and thirdly
the book didn't deny the Holocaust so we
should first get the data correct okay
but for Esau was a Holocaust denier he
at that time it wasn't even raised in
fact he came to trial a couple of years
later and he was condemned so it was
outrageous but the issue of Holocaust
denial didn't even come up but you I
suppose the issue I'm asking you okay
let's make it subjunctive okay say
suppose someone else yes I do it all the
time right in the United States in the
United States in my view fortunately
there
the University professors with tenure I
could pay my fee like who write a big
hardcover books and widely published
denying the Holocaust and nobody pays
the slightest attention to them I think
that's correct and if there were any
attempt to suppress them an objective
this individual you can see it sticks in
the craw of the European this commitment
to a kind of individual position I
wonder why it's your last question if I
may which is the question of authority I
dug out from King Lear Leah's grave
quote when he's on the heath there thou
mounts behold the great image of
authority a dog's obeyed in office where
does Authority life.you is it purely in
the individual conscience determined by
rationally it's very much like freedom
of speech Authority hierarchy and
domination
have a burden of proof they have to
demonstrate their legitimacy they are
not self justifying if there is any
structure of hierarchy and domination
whether it's in a patriarchal family and
international society anywhere in
between it has to justify itself
sometimes it can so for example if I'm
walking down the street with my
granddaughter three-year-old
granddaughter and she starts to run into
the street and I grab her hand and pull
her back
that's coercive Authority but I think I
can give a justification for it most
times you can't give a justification and
when it can't it ought to be dismantled
one last question do we start by you
saying you had no choice in the sense
history determined that you took the
role you did you took a choice but
history kind of pushed you there one of
the things and this is the American in
you again
I always feel your great strength is
that sense that you can you can
volunteer for things I think there's
less much less in you which is the
European of how your volunteered for
things
how you're determined men make history
that's the first part of the sentence
which Americans understand but not in
the conditions of their own making is
the second part which Europeans
understand do you really think you can
your role is a voluntary one it's chosen
for all of us the same in Europe if ML
Zola wanted to defend Dreyfus that was a
choice he wasn't forced into it if
Bertrand Russell decided to oppose the
first world war and go to jail I was a
choice a lot of things happen I mean
take the American civil rights movement
1965 the voter rights day in Lyndon
Johnson lead the troops no did Martin
Luther King lead the troops no what
happened was there was things like young
a couple of black kids sitting at a
lunch counter the Freedom Riders young
Freedom Riders going through the South
Detroit registered voters or a brutal
and bitter mass demonstrations and then
that created that a situation in which
individuals could appear who would
articulate what was happening as Martin
Luther King did very effectively where
he's Noam Chomsky in the resistance you
see there towards the back is he at the
side is he at the front there was a
popular resistance movement going on I
participated in it the way I could I
couldn't do it the way I say an 18 year
old was I couldn't refuse to go to fight
in Vietnam because I wasn't the right
age but I could do other things and in
fact you know ended up pretty close to a
long prison sentence but not
participating the way the people in the
league were participating I didn't get
exiled for the rest of my life you know
as many young people did Chomsky thank
you very much
yeah noam chomsky and if you want to see
and here is Edward side lecture you can
find out details on the night waves
website the lecture took place last
night you're listening to night waves
with me Phillip Dodd in a special
edition where I consult authorities
about power reason and ethics
