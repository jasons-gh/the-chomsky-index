i first of all i want to thank you for
what you have said um in this half hour
talking to my friend mordecai
and i'm going to ask you some questions
on behalf of
my little online media humanity college
and i'm also doing something very
similar that mordecai is doing
is basically to create awareness and uh
talking to people about progressive
politics and the fact that people
are actually fighting back all over the
world and
you know like showing them the rays of
hope
so to speak uh yet at the same time
uh uh picking up on what you
just said about how people can come
together and
and basically assume power one of the
things that
um as an educator lifelong educator
following your footsteps that i am
experiencing myself
is people's uh lack
of reasoning and not just lack of
reasoning but
complete lack of desire to learn
something
new that is not you know like
in the box and that has become like
really a very formidable challenge
uh uh for example um this year's
class i've been teaching on two subjects
only and it's an
online class so basically i'm
concentrating on two subjects one is
corvid 19
and the other one is uh the
police brutality and murder of george
floyd
and the systemic racism and um
uh so on both fronts there is a very
strange
uh invisible resistance the resistance
about a kovit 19 is that when i tell
them that look
in five months in the richest country on
earth here in the united states we have
lost 175
000 people and cambodia
and vietnam did not lose anybody
up until two weeks ago and many other
countries have
really strongly taken measures to
control
the problem the immediate response is
that well these numbers are fake
so people who are suffering
the most even they are
trying to wish it all away
so my question is you
noam chomsky is there for us for such a
long time and you have
actually shaped our consciousness
so to speak but at the same time this
decline
of uh intelligence decline of reasoning
power
isn't that in the way of
bringing people together and seize power
against these corporations
and their money first of all they're not
making it up
they hear it they see it most of them
probably watching
fox news and listening to rush limbaugh
that's what they hear it's all fake
every
year rush limbaugh there are four
corners of deceit
science media government and academia
they live on deceit as there's tens of
millions of people who
listen to them and hear that they hear
the president say it
i hear the people around him say it so
they're here it's being drilled into
their heads
and the results are pretty startling
i'm sure you've heard this story about
how the kogit 19 was
created by bill gates and
shoros and couple of others hillary
clinton so they could
put chips in you to control you turns
out around 70
of americans have heard that and of
republicans
about two-thirds believe it
it's not just here incidentally
one of the things that happens on the
internet and it's going to happen more
and more
i'm sure it's people posting fake
articles and attributing it to somebody
that they want to discredit
and it's very easy to do and there's
nothing you can do about it
we're going to see a ton of it even
faked photographs and so on
well i've it's happened to me when the
pandemic broke things circulated on the
internet
about how the pandemic was created in a
us
government laboratory in order to
control the world
big story about that signed by me
all over the place i started getting
letters
from people in europe friends
sensible people educated people
saying thanks for finally telling the
truth about the world
it's not just here um this huge
propaganda not trying it's not the kind
that says believe in
me it says don't believe in anything
that ends up meaning believe in me if
you're in power and nobody believes
anything
you're safe okay so it's not
i'm your savior it's the whole world
this isn't
crap don't believe a thing everybody's
fooling you
and i stay in power okay that's
the current form dominant form of
propaganda trump's a master of it
yeah they play there's a funny game
going on
in which he spouts out as many lies as
you can think of
the fact checkers in the media
they go to work on it they publish an
article saying oh it's up to 20
000 wise and trump laughs and says you
know let's make more of them tomorrow
because everybody's going to forget
about your fact checking if they ever
looked at it
and then that effect is going to be who
cares everything's alive
it's perfect that's a wonderful
technique of
creating dictatorship exactly to deal
with it
by exposing exposure you don't check out
you don't
check out oh he got to 20 000 lies in
tears
talk about what he's doing what's the
talk to your students
about what's the point of creative
circulating
all of these and the effect of
circulating all these lunatic stories
there's an effect the effect is that
people like you
are not going to believe in anything and
you'll therefore leave power
in the hands of the tiny group that's
twisting you around their fingers
right that's right right and then this
is this is so
important for people to understand and i
really thank you
uh for expressing that in you know
the best possible way that we cannot
even think of um
and and and and this is so true if you
look at the countries like the united
states or brazil
and india these three countries come to
my mind because
you know i know about the united states
and india very well
i have lived all my life in these two
countries
uh and then i am seeing numbers coming
out of brazil
and these are the three countries where
basically
a new authoritarian rule is in place
and and the the trend is so alarming
because taking advantage
of this crisis the media
social media corporate media everybody
you know the right wing radio talk shows
uh
like rush limbaugh and all that they
have
created this strange
climate where de facto there is
a single leader in these countries in
india
you have modi in the united states you
have trump
and in brazil bolsonaro
and and basically you know like uh as if
there is no such thing as as an
opposition
i mean here in the united states is
probably just a little bit different
and right now the democratic convention
is going on so
many people actually know that there is
a democratic party
in place but in many other countries
taking advantage of this crisis there is
a huge
huge you know like uh uh
artificially pumping up you know
like a fascistic semi-fascistic regime
where people are not taking anybody else
for their leader anymore
how do you fight that same way it's
always been done
it's not new uh i'm old enough to
remember a much worse case
1930s yeah go back to germany and italy
overwhelming support for the dear leader
i mean nobody has exact statistics but
you look at the scholarly literature
they figure probably
over 90 percent of germans were
supporting hitler
until there started to be defeats as
long as they were triumphant
maybe virtually everybody this is the
most
and just think of germany for a minute
it's not a
third world country yeah in the 1920s
germany was the absolute peak of western
civilization
sciences the arts
weimar germany was regarded as the model
of democracy for the world political
sciences
thought of as the best democracy in the
world
way on top and everything 10 years later
it was
the worst country in history
yes but in germany uh even though
definitely it was
at the peak of civilization at that time
and after world war one there was a huge
economic
uh downturn and actually that many say
that that actually gave rise to
you know the power of nazis and and
fascists and
and and if if germany did not go through
such a huge
uh catastrophic economic turmoil then
probably
hitler wouldn't have risen i mean that
is many people
have that uh of course that is moot
right now and we all know what happened
but not it's not mechanical
the u.s went through the same crisis
what came out of it was the new dew
something like that could have happened
in germany
you took a look at the early 30s there
were
basically three mass parties
one was the nazis which wasn't that
strong
the 1928 election they think they got
three percent of the vote
uh it was before the depression hit
but the two huge parties were the
communist party and the socialist party
between the two of them they way
outnumbered the nazis
if they'd gotten together they would
have
won the elections there would have been
no hitler
they were fighting each other okay
communists were following the stalinist
line of
uh they're all social fascists
brings back memories to me today when i
listen to the neverwide knights
they're all corporate liberals who cares
i'm not gonna do anything
the that was the uh they're all
social fascist line in the 1920s social
democrats
also had a similar position not quite
that extreme
if they'd been able to get together in
the 1932 election the last
sort of legitimate one they would have
easily won there
wouldn't have been a nazis these are
and in fact the united states could have
gone down that path
could have or plenty of demagogues
around
it was actually a attempted coup to
get rid of roseville was blocked by
smedley butler and marines
uh if it hadn't been for labor
organizing
cio organizing other activism the united
states could have gone in that direction
well we have point is we have choices
these things don't just happen they're
always
our choices they are now we're moving
towards it
it's not fascism but it's kind of tin
pot dictatorship
that's what we're moving towards now
like some
small country that has uh
overthrow the government every couple of
years that's where moving towards
take a look at the new york times this
morning the
peak establishment columnist thomas
friedman
the voice of the establishment says will
2020 be the last
american election is this the end of
american democracy
i mean when you hear the voices there
you know that things are in bad trouble
you heard voices in more serious places
one before
he happened to notice but now it's
reached to that level
and it's real yeah it's well understood
that we've got a unique figure in
parliamentary history first time
hundreds of years of somebody who has
no interest in the democratic process at
all
he wants to end it he wants to become
the dictator
he'll do whatever he can to get it the
inspectors general
executive are starting to look into your
corruption
firearm right uh
some one republican dares to
say maybe you're not god go after her
with a ton of bricks
because no no defection everybody's got
to be a
psychophant worship me yeah
looks good and you're adoring crowds
stand in front of them
look to the sky and say i'm the chosen
one
you know okay that's uh
what we're facing it's clear that he
will do absolutely anything
to stay in power right could happen
doesn't have to that means it's going to
be necessary to have an
overwhelming vote not just a defeat
overwhelming defeat to try to stop
the shenanigans that they're planting
not just him but the whole gang around
william or pompeo and the rest of them
so so you know like that is really a
scenario that we
you know like shuddered to think um but
um on one hand you have that scenario
where you know there is like uh
four more years of trump and basically
that
is you know in all likelihood that is
the end of uh
a free democracy uh as we have known it
and then that is something that we all
have to
work against and we have to vote him out
of power uh
we have no problems with that we all
know that
but at the same time the people
who will be coming back to power the
the you know the new liberal democratic
party
you know what is
there for us other than the fact that
instead of dying tomorrow we are going
to die the day after tomorrow
if i can say that why
i mean when if biden gets elected
what people who involved in real
politics will do
is continue the activist pressure
that has pushed the party program this
far
don't say okay we won let's go home
no you say nothing's happened we've got
somebody in
office who offers us a little space now
i'll keep his feet to the fire we'll use
it
we'll force them to follow up in their
programs and go beyond
okay how far beyond as far as we can
manage
i mean take it's very striking to look
at the
even the coverage of the
conventions now take a look at this
morning's paper
okay both papers main papers they're all
about the
talks and things last night at the
convention
they're very interesting they're very
tell you a lot so the washington post
has
more liberal the two papers as a long
article about
the tone of the convention how the
moderates run out went out but the far
left has a strong voice far left
that phrase is repeated over and over
then it talks about what the far
left is advocating two things
universal health care pre-higher
education
can you think of any other country that
has universal health skills
can you think of one that doesn't
everybody has
everybody has it that's the far left
saying
let's try to rise to the level of the
world
uh free higher education rich countries
like germany
finland france poor countries like
mexico it's all over
that's far left from the point of view
of the liberal establishment right
right okay and you look at the times
it's
not all that different all kind of
excitement how wonderful
[Music]
for me it has been a wonderful privilege
uh
to you know get this chance to talk to
you for 20 years now
and and i cannot thank you enough for
that but
you and i have talked about the politics
you know mainstream media corporate
media
have played all these years you know
starting from
judith miller in new york times and and
wmd
uh stories that you know like actually
drove the country into a catastrophic
war
destroying an ancient civilization and
whatnot and now
you are basically you know saying things
that
have always resonated with me that on
one hand
these progressive people they are
actually bernie sanders and
and you know like uh alexandria
ocasio-cortez and and
you know that that group of people
pramila jaipal uh
whom i have known from my immigrant
rights days and all that
they are trying to change the course of
the discussion
but then they are actually being
sidelined
by new york times and washington post
and cnn
and and people are not really getting to
know their position because they are
being branded as far left i don't agree
the media are not saying what i would
like
but they're saying things they never
would have said 20 or 30 years ago
what they were saying then sounds
so outrageous you can't believe it i
mean
you know you see the coverage of the
vietnam war take the far
left of the mainstream
far left at the end of the war 1975.
1975 the war ended everybody had to make
a comment
way at the left end you had anthony
lewis of the new york times
what did he say he said the war began
with blundering efforts to do good
evidence who needs evidence the united
states did it it was efforts to do good
you don't ask any questions
wondering because it didn't work it says
by 1969 it became
clear that we could not bring democracy
to south vietnam
at a cost acceptable to ourselves so it
was a mistake
i mean it's kind of like somebody
writing in the communist party press
meanwhile the
public had an opinion which was not
reported
there were careful studies of public
opinion
chicago council foreign relations 75
70 of the public at that time said the
war was not a mistake
it was fundamentally wrong and immoral
and that lasted as long as they were
taking poll
nothing like that anywhere near the
media now you could say it
not enough but you could say it you
can't say
we're just overflowing with the
kindness and love and everything we do
the way was said then by people like
james reston they're leading left
column you can't say that
take a look at what you can say now take
say the
16-19 series and times
this history of african americans
had its flaws but it was a very strong
report of 400 years of violence and
repression and terror
a couple years ago you couldn't have
possibly had that
okay it's changing partly it's changing
because a lot of the journalists have
come out of the experiences of the 60s
and 70s
they see the world differently so you
change the culture you change the media
yeah yeah definitely uh one that that
brings me to another question that i
have asked you before and i'm going to
ask you one more time
because i am a first generation
immigrant from india and i have gone
through my
own struggles of you know fighting
against you know like explicit
and subtle racism all these years 35
years of our existence in this country
you know first as a poor foreign student
and then as
a permanent resident and then as an
american citizen
so i have had my share of uh racism and
all that
and then i have seen you know the
extreme brutality
and systemic racism on our black
brothers and sisters in george floyd
being
the one of the most recent examples but
at the same time
there is no uh bridge building
across the board you know blacks and
immigrants
and whites and even within the immigrant
community people do not refer to each
other that's not true
i just don't agree not take say the
brutal murder of
emmett till no reaction
george floyd nor near as bad as emmett
till
huge demonstrations black white
solidarity
all over the place more public support
than any social movement has ever
received in the united states
two-thirds with black white solidarity
it's not metal oh definitely black white
solidarity i see that all the time but
i'm i'm
actually talking about in particular the
solidarity between the two poorest
sections of the society the blacks and
the newer immigrants
you know latinos and indians and and
pakistanis and bangladeshis and
you know there is such a huge
like invisible wall between the two
poorest
and most vulnerable sections of this
world it wasn't in the streets
the wall was blacks and whites marching
together
okay and it wasn't just for a
one-day demonstration on the national
mall in washington
it was months and it's also working on
real issues together
okay not perfect you know but a big
change
so that's what you're after change make
things better
sometimes things get worse much worse
like
india india is going through one of the
worst moments in this history
right with uh you know a
racist ultra religious lunatic
with who's got about 70 support
that's scary that's kind of like germany
in the 30s and 40s
but that can end too has before
thank you one final question if i may
ask you how do you see
if i may ask you how do you see a word
post chomsky
same as it is now other people will be
raving ranting just like i am just as
they are already
i i can ask you that question because i
have known you for such a long time and
i consider you to be
my friend philosopher and guide so
forgive me if i have
asked it in an inappropriate way but
um i i cannot really
express uh my gratitude enough
for what you have taught me all these
years and you have really been
a living inspiration for me
and i really want to thank you
enormously for that
but the people we should be looking at
with
inspiration are the people in the
streets
they're the ones who are really doing
things it's always been like that
you want to look at the civil rights
movement
everybody thinks of martin luther king
not enough of us think of the snake
workers riding
freedom buses in alabama risking them
sometimes losing their lives to try to
get
intimidated black voters to vote they're
the ones we should be honoring
and that's true everywhere that's
uh so they're the people who matter for
tomorrow
we can respect them we can
use their work and sacrifices to
get an audience for their benefit and
respecting them they're the leaders
professor chomsky we've got two minutes
and i'm sure you've been asked this
question before
dr west always talks about the
difference between being a short-term
a long-distance runner and a sprinter
you've been a long-distance runner in
your career
how have you you know kept the march
going like what did you do to fortify
yourself and sustain yourself to be able
to be a freedom
fighter you know from when being the
first
vocal voice coming out against vietnam
to all the way to today
still being out here doing calls with
people that you don't even know like
what what keeps you going sir people
like you
people who are picking it up carrying it
forward
as long as they're around nothing you
don't need any more motivation
we're looking at the people in the
streets or the kids in sunrise movement
who managed to get the
green new deal on the legislative agenda
or take a look at uh
i've seen it all over the world i've
been in many parts of the world with
real intense poverty and tell terror
way beyond anything we're experiencing
so this
very poor village in southern colombia
miles from the highway can barely get to
it by the road
where when you get to the village you
pass a
a little place where there's
white crosses where people were murdered
by paramilitary
you finally get to the village you see
engaged
active people very poor
very little formal education working on
the means to try to save their the
mountain near them
their hydrological resources from a gold
company that wants to destroy a gold
mining company
you see people like that you don't need
any more inspiration
and it's all over i just uh i just
wanted to
thank you one more time on behalf of uh
humanity college and
uh if you have um any final message for
the younger people who are coming
together
writing in a new way reporting in a new
way doing citizen journalism
on the street that would be really
wonderful i would much appreciate
any message for them message for them is
to
look at the world around you at the
vast problems that exist with the
suffering the repression
the threats to survival and pick up
your pen these days it's your computer
start letting people know about it
investigate it
bring it to others in any way you can
that's your job as
journalists as intellectuals as
organizers as
activists
you very very much amen
[Music]
it was a pleasure sir thank you good to
talk to you
sorry i gotta get off but i got the next
one coming
see you later okay thank you
