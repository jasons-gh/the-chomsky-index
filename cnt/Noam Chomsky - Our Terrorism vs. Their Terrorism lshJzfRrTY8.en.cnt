if you're interested in terror you
should look at its causes now if for the
point of view of apologists for state
violence like the ones you're mentioning
you're not allowed to look at the causes
because that's considered
rationalization or justification so if
you try to look for the causes like
every sane person does
that's rationalization which supposed to
do is have tantrums and scream about
Islamic fascism blaming on the bad genes
of the Arabs or something but you're not
allowed to look at the causes and
there's a good reason for that soon as
you look at the causes you start looking
in the mirror and that you have to block
you know the main task of intellectuals
always but now too is to make sure that
people never look in the mirror we never
look at ourselves I only look at other
people you look through hundreds of
years of history the West has a virtual
monopoly of violence so massive terrors
kind of thing we do to them no they're
not supposed to do it to us September
11th was the first break first time in
hundreds of years that any Western
country has suffered on home soil the
kind of the thing they do routinely
everywhere else yeah and in Israel it's
sort of the same actually it was pretty
striking for me to see this I mean I had
after September 11th had a ton of
interviews everywhere except the United
States of course and often it was a
national radio and TV and often it
turned a couple of times it turned out
to be Irish and television and BBC
back-to-back and the difference in
reaction was startling yeah I mean and
you know things like things that said
this much on Irish TV okay discussion
over it really understands what I'm
talking about
try to say it on pbc have to go on for
like about an hour to explain to them
what you mean the Irish Sea is a chasm
you know and it just depends who's been
holding a whip for 800 years and has
been under it for 800 years and the same
is true or everywhere else in the world
you know but for the West the idea that
anybody should do to us a fraction of
what we regularly do to them
is just outrageous and the same is true
in Israel it's a 35-year occupation I
mean up until very recently they were
immune literally immune from retaliation
from within the territories and they
weren't acting very nicely there I was
brutal you know humiliating repressive
robbing the resources kicking the people
out and so on but there was no
retaliation okay last year through
there's some retaliation so it's
scandalous it's also considered a
scandal in the West right because we do
it we do it and it's okay but they do it
to us not okay so if Israel invades
Lebanon with us backing and kills 20,000
people no it's way the cookie crumbles
it's not a problem but if it goes the
other direction a couple feet and people
get killed yeah that's a horror story
September 11th it was immediately
predicted and now we can look back and
see that the prediction was correct that
every repressive force in the world
would take it as a window of opportunity
to extend what they were doing so for
example the Russians took it as an
opportunity to extend the attack in
Chechnya pretending that it's a war on
terror and now with the authorization of
Washington the Chinese did the same in
western China Indonesia did the same and
OJ Israel and the occupied territories
and so on down the list furthermore
every just about every government used
it as an opportunity to try to impose
greater discipline on their own
populations under again the pretext of a
war on terror so that's true of the more
dictatorial states like say Central Asia
and it's also true the more democratic
societies with the prevention of
terrorism ordinances and other devices
of one sort or another and mainly to try
to discipline their own populations
these are just continuations of
tendencies that are already in process
using this kind of opportunity to
escalate and that was predictable and of
course it's happened
