there was a concept of materialism right
through the early Scientific Revolution
right through Newton Newton still
accepted it in fact the great scientists
of the next century accepted it you know
lagron others kept trying to develop a
material mechanistic concept of the
universe that went right through the
19th century ether theories and so on it
was finally given up in the 20th century
you know finally recognized like we're
never going to get it and totally
different ways of looking at things were
developed which have no relation to
traditional materialism if readers
longest correct
so since and nobody's ever suggested
another notion it materialism just is
like anything we more or less understand
it includes thinking it includes
reasoning and so on and so forth Locke
suggestion so we can't leave it behind
unless someone tells it what it is but
there's no reason why we kind of we
can't study it and we can study what the
human capacity of understanding is in
fact we know some things about it we
know some negative things for example we
can't understand the way the world works
because our concept of understanding is
too limited to incorporate what Newton
described as an absurdity you know
people like Newton and Hume and Locke
were not idiots
I think I'm seriously they regarded it
as an absurdity for very good reasons
and modern cognitive science which
somehow tries to recapitulate some of
this finds pretty much that so as I
mentioned an infant presented with
presentations which indicate that
there's some kind of causality like you
know when the ball rolls this way light
turns red or something they will invent
a mechanical cause and they don't care
if it's not visible because infants
understand that most of what goes on is
invisible you know it's good but there's
got to be some mechanical cause
otherwise the way for it to influence
anything else so that does seem to be
the way our minds work and that tells us
something about the limits of our
understanding
the classical crucial case and it can go
on to other cases so and we can't study
it directly in principle we can study it
directly it's not simple and it's not
easy to understand why a rat can't
understand can't deal with the prime
number maze even that's hard and we have
good evidence that's true but why it's
true is unclear nothing known about the
brains of rats that explains why they
can't do that if I we can't explain why
say the tiniest organism that seriously
studied C elegans nematodes that eight
hundred cells three hundred neurons
entire wiring diagram known even years
of study trying to explain why this
thing it goes left instead of right
let's say it's just we don't know how to
explain that it's as an answer but that
these are hard scientific questions when
you talk about how human intelligence
works it's incomparably more difficult
so you can you can ask the questions you
can you know cut away at them but we
shouldn't we shouldn't exaggerate its
kind of striking that going back to what
philosophy owe to duel philosophers
often appear to intend to want to get
answers about humans that we can't get
about insects and that's too much you
know science sort of works at the edges
of understanding and it faces hard
questions all the way so we can sort of
talk about it but if you want to
seriously work on it you have to take a
look at what is understood and trust
even formulate questions which will
which are can be investigated and will
tell us more about what's understood
actually is interesting work going on on
this having to do with things like that
mark the human moral instinct in the
past twenty thirty years that's become
an experimental subject with interesting
experimental work on Universal probably
universal moral principles a very
important book just came out
a couple of weeks ago by John Mihiel
he's a philosophers not teaches law at
Georgetown University who gives a very
acute he more or less initiated this
modern study didn't publish much but
other people have drawn off his work
combination of reanalysis of traditional
moral philosophy may lead roles and his
antecedents and an analysis a lot of the
critique of rules and and then on to
developing experimental programs to
investigate some of these questions and
it's feasible maybe we can get some
insight into in a human and moral
concepts that are that are
cross-cultural like you're going to find
them at every culture and that you can
find with young children the pre any
serious cultural impact those are all
things that can be studied and there's
beginnings of studies
