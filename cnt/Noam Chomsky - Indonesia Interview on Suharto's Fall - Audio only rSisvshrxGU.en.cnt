hours after you set the BB address the
nation as we reported earlier thousands
of indonesian students occupying
parliament for the fifth straight day
demanded habibi stepped down the
students say they won't leave the
Parliament until habibi follows through
harto the students are also demanding
but the former dictator Suharto be put
on trial meanwhile supporters of habibi
stormed into the parliament and attacked
some of the pro-democracy students
Reuters reports that rocks and bottles
were thrown before a debate ensues well
right now we are joined by Professor
Noam Chomsky from Boston professor
Chomsky a professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology world renowned political
analyst in fact I think it's fair to say
that he has kept the issue of Indonesia
alive more than any other person in this
country letting us know about this
dictator Suharto and his 32 year brutal
reign not to mention the 22 year illegal
occupation of East Timor which was
resulted in a third of the population
being killed that's 200,000 people in
fact it was professors and Chomsky's
writings that alerted me to what was
going on in East Timor and led to my
going there in 1990 returning in 1991
where I witnessed the massacre of more
than 250 temari's
and returning again in 94 where I was
once again burned and barred by a
military this one the Indonesian
military but I want to thank you for
that professor Chomsky and welcome you
to Democracy Now well what is your
response to this historic maybe it's a
change maybe it's not in Indonesia but
where the dictator Suharto has been
forced out well it whatever the outcome
in the outcome it is highly unclear it
could be pretty grim it is undoubtedly a
historic achievement I mean there was a
popular movement with no resources
succeeded in at least formally
overthrowing we don't know if it's more
than that at least formally overthrowing
a one of the most brutal figures of the
20th century and in a relatively
peaceful manner there have been
plenty of people killed but by the
standards of overthrow of dictators it's
pretty small whether this will lead to
real changes in Indonesia that's hard to
say and I assist but I don't think that
the participants would even even have an
idea what they're going to do the main
participants who matter the military
who've been effective power in the
country for for a long time as certainly
ever since the mass slaughters of the
mid-1960s which accompanied Suharto's
rise to power which wiped out their main
opposition the main political parties
and in fact we're aimed at them so they
remain in control and where they
undoubtedly have splits within them the
the replacement first quarto probably is
a crony basically as know as everyone
correctly points out he has no base of
support or power other than what comes
from so high throw and the military as
long as the military stays behind him
and seems unlikely that he can hang on
very long unless there's a brutal
military repression so I think good word
there will be considerable turmoil and
conflict before this situation resolves
that you can imagine a very favorable
evolution towards dismantling not only
the tyrannical political system but also
the extraordinarily corrupt and vicious
economic system owning an Australian
specialist an Indonesia really recently
described Indonesia as a Stalinist state
on top of Dodge City basically a
family-owned monopoly a very rich
country there's a lot of talk about its
economic development under Suharto
that's not totally false but one has to
be rather skeptical about a lot of the
figures because
as the economic modelers themselves have
pointed out many of the Australians they
were forced to give those figures they
knew they weren't true and what exactly
has happened what exactly the economy is
is somewhat of a mystery I mean it's
it's based on a huge private there's a
youth there of the tech just say the
debt estimated it roughly eighty billion
dollars according to an Indonesian
economist that debt is held by maybe 50
people maybe 200 on the outside the
other 200 million Indonesians are the
ones who are paying the cost there is
where the money there are estimates that
Suharto has somewhere between 40 and 50
billion dollars it's personal well yeah
that's and yeah and of course that's
plus or minus a bit bit because who
knows but yeah those are normal figures
actually the CIA gives similar figures
and that's roughly the notice of that's
what just it's the same range as the IMF
bailout package which tells you
something pretty simple that there's a
very easy way to overcome that component
of the debt namely simply get the people
who borrowed the money and robbed the
country to pay off what they borrowed I
mean the 200 million Indonesians didn't
borrow the money it's not to me they're
dead the reason why they should starve
because of somebody else borrowed the
billions of dollars and now as them to
pay for it ask them to pay for it and
asks us to pay for it that's the
standard technique the people who borrow
and the banks and investors who made the
bad loans are not expected to pay the
cost the cost for primarily on the
victims that's 200 million people in
Indonesia and on Western taxpayers we
were to provide the bailout fund what's
called capitalism professor Noam Chomsky
why have you been so interested in
Indonesia over the 32 year reign of
Suharto well I wasn't I got interested
too late as usual I did I did of course
get interested in the mid sixties there
was a
worse slaughter since the Holocaust took
place in Indonesia it was praised with
utter euphoria in the West give the
press credit it did not conceal what was
happening so New York Times described it
as a staggering bloodbath Time magazine
had a big cover story 11 pages and the
boiling bloodbath in which you know
hundreds of thousands of people being
murdered
mostly landless peasants and destroyed
the one based political party in the
country and this was greeted with
absolute joy and the applause which was
totally onion unrestrained and it was a
remarkable moment to participate with
astonishing I can't remember anything
similar before or after I was pretty
hard not to pay attention at that point
there was the question then of what
exactly the level of US involvement was
it's become quite even today a lot of
this has been kept secret so for example
probably the major u.s. subversive act
action after the Second World War was
undertaken in Indonesia in 1958 in an
effort to separate the outer islands the
ones that have most of the resources the
oil so that they'd be remain part of the
West even if the inner islands remain
nationalist under suparna the story of
that has been dug out by researchers
primarily by Audrey and George kN
at Cornell George Keynes was the founder
of Southeast Asian Studies very
distinguished scholar and they haven't
worked on Indonesia for years and they
discovered a good great deal about what
happened and the scale of that
intervention that effort to create a
civil war which would tear out the outer
island was remarkable but it is even in
the declassified record it's not
reported Lots is being kept secret but
hence it was very hard to find out
exactly what has happened and remains
hard but enough is known to know
it was a huge huge and monstrous
slaughter orchestrated by the army the
massacres were army led that means those
army certainly backed by the United
States strongly and applauded by us
intellectual community the media across
the board it was presented even by
American liberals at the time as a proof
that we were doing the right thing in
Vietnam on the grounds that by sort of
holding the line in Vietnam we had
encouraged the Indonesian generals to
carry out this noble task of cleansing
their society after this display it was
a difficult not to pay attention and us
planners understood the importance years
later george bundy was a national
security adviser pointed out more or
less plausibly but it would have made
sense for from their point of view to
pull out of Vietnam right after the
Indonesian slaughter because by that
time Indochina had been sufficiently
devastated so that it wasn't going to be
any kind of a model for others to follow
and the region was being insulated so
that any effect of what they called the
virus of independent development would
be blocked of and especially Indonesia
it was most important professor Chomsky
in 1965 we know about Suharto rise to
power the slaughter of more than half a
million Indonesians as he rose to power
and took power from sukarno the founding
president of Indonesia and then 10 years
later in 1975 an issue that you have
continually written about and spoken
about Indonesia's illegal invasion of
East Timor which they illegally occupied
to this day with a third of the
population killed what about the u.s.
role and support of Indonesia in its
occupation of East Timor well that's not
even a question the u.s. provided was
providing 90 percent of the arms at the
time on a under treaty which required
Indonesia to use them only for
self-defense so
any use of American arms was illegal the
u.s. knew in advance effectively
authorized the invasion we know that
from leaked Australian diplomatic cables
the right after the invasion the United
Nations Security Council ordered the
Indonesian zout and the United States
actually voted for that but later well
as you know ambassador Monaghan Senator
in his memoirs described with great
pride how he had rendered at the orders
of the State Department he had rendered
the United Nations utterly ineffective
in anything it might do to terminate the
the occupation and the slaughtering knew
that there was slaughter and reported it
right after that the u.s. secretly
stepped up shipments of arms to
Indonesia while denying it it was
exposed by Dan Anderson another Cornell
University Scholar Professor McCadden
I want to interrupt because we just got
this report from Reuters that says the
Indonesian Army's most decorated soldier
who has a reputation for a firm grasp of
International Affairs took charge of the
country's Information Ministry today
Lieutenant General Yoon SEO saya stood
silently near president Yousefi BB when
he announced the veteran would take over
the post held mostly by civilians for
the past 15 years
but yes paya is sure to attract some
international controversy especially in
Australia for his command of the special
forces unit blamed for the deaths of the
five Australia based journalists in
Timor
an Australian government report on the
killings quoted witnesses as saying
captain units with in charge of the unit
responsible yes via has always refused
to comment this the killing of the five
journalists in 1975 as the Indonesian
military was moving into East Timor it's
a story I know very well the documentary
we did we reported we broadcast the last
report of Greg Shackleton of ABC
Australian Broadcasting Corporation
where he said to the world because
everyone heard this report the the Tim
Reeves are appealing for help they're
asking if they should turn to the United
Nations we are reporting from a city
where we are reporting from a town we
will never forget
you tied Timur Gregg Shackleton and it
was a report no one would forget because
he and his colleagues were executed the
next day I did a documentary on Timor
and got a call a letter from
Shackleton's wife and she said that I
got the execution right but I didn't
quite get the details of it right I had
said that they were all just shot in the
head she said that that her husband died
because the Indonesian military headed
by this man Yunus has just been
appointed now we understand to be head
of the Information Ministry that these
reporters have their genitals cut off
stuffed in their mouths and they
suffocated to death as they were killed
this the latest news out of Indonesia
now the man in charge of that execution
and that brutality has just been named
head of the Information Ministry of
Indonesia that's the kind of step that
unfortunately could be anticipated be
that it looked so far it looks as if no
changes taking place other than names
Suharto is adding right behind hubba
deal as the weather basis support and
this is very bad news indicating that
they're putting in even though they
certainly must have understood that this
would be extremely offensive even to the
Australian government which is meant
over backwards to support Indonesia and
nevertheless they're proceeding should
be mentioned the purity of said is in
the past that Timor has a kind of a
special meaning to Australians during
the Second World War
Australia invaded a East Timor that
brought the Japanese in they might well
have left Portuguese East Timor alone
otherwise the Australians left a couple
hundred commandos there the tribe this
was an effort to try to prevent the
Japanese from invading Australia and the
command has kept fighting and in the
course of that they were protected by
the T marie's and about 60,000 memories
were killed as a result of the
Australian invasion and in protection of
the Australian commandos so there's you
know when Australia now supports the
Indonesian atrocities and recognises the
occupation and steals Timor soil that
raises lots of
antagonism among ordinary Australians as
you can imagine you know I'm reading
further in this report and it says the
man who's just been made the press
minister of Indonesia this man who has
long ties to East Timor that unofficial
biography is published abroad allege he
killed Nicolau Lobato then leader of the
East Timorese resistance while of there
and Timor and that he has a chest of
full of medals and unlike some other
generals he got them from being quote in
harm's way and in Indonesia that
probably means in East Timor well that's
that's a sign that the military is
willing to take rather brazen steps
towards asserting authority permanent
professor Chomsky we just have a minute
and I wanted to bring this back to the
United States President Clinton has said
that they applaud a democratic
transition and encourage Indonesian
leaders in that democratic transition
and yet at the same time we see that the
US military has continued to support the
Indonesian military the Nation magazine
is just putting out a report today that
says that the u.s. trained special units
in Indonesia are responsible for the
latest set of disappearances of
activists and the nation put out just a
month ago in a report by Alan Aaron that
the Indonesian soldiers the most brutal
ones the Kopassus forces who are trained
by Green Berets right through to May 1st
well you know the United States has very
definitely had closest contacts with the
Indonesian military going back to the
1950s that was part of the this abortion
that I mentioned then was surely
involved in the 1960s atrocities and
continues to have infected McNamara
pointed out that he praised the training
of Indonesian military officers in the
United States and US universities as
having given them you know the right
understanding which enable them to carry
out their work and so on and so forth
and that just continues up until today
the Pentagon regards Indonesia is a very
significant ally the Indonesian military
it's strategically important aside from
its enormous wealth resources it happens
to be strategically important
huge amount of effective majority of the
international commerce desert is right
next to it it's got the border passage
for nuclear submarines and so on and
it's the most powerful country in the
region so sure there I'd have tied in
with it very tightly and when Clinton
talks about a democratic transition we
have to remember that we're listening to
a broken record every time a favorite
dictator loses control the United States
applauds the loss of control by its
old friend and tries to ease and out and
put in something equivalent this
happened recently with devalue a it
happened with Marcos at with Somoza on
that note sure this is just like a
broken record professor Chomsky I want
to thank you very much for being there
with us for all of these years professor
Noam Chomsky linguist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
well-known political analysts thanks for
being there
