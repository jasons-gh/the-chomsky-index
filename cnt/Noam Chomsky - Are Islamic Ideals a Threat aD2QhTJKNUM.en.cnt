Islamic ideas...?

Question about the Islamic ideals in practice?

I mean Islam is like
Christianity, Judaism,
Buddhism
There's no such thing as Islamic ideals
There are lots of different Islamic ideals
Now, just like..the real question
we should be asking, particularly here,
is what about Christianity?
That's something we could do about
so that's the highest priority. So what are
Christian ideals? Well,
They're very all over the place,
people in high places now
claim to be devout Christians,
and on the basis of Christian ideals, they're
saying "let's proceed to destroy the world",
and I don't know anybody in the Islamic world who is doing that.
Now, that's, of course, not all Christian ideals--
there are others too. Martin Luther King
expressed different Christian ideals, and it's the same
with the Islamic world--you can find lots of things,
but the idea that there are
fixed Islamic ideals which are
a problem for the world, that doesn't mean anything,
you have to look at..
take a look at individual cases, so take, say,
Iran in the United States. They're both
states in which the leadership
claims to be
deeply religious and committed to the faith,
and asking what the two of them are doing
with regard to the leading
issue that they're now in conflict over
It turns out that the Iranian leadership
is calling vociferously
for establishing a nuclear-weapons-free zone
in the region which would end any threat,
and the Christian United States with its
deeply Christian leadership is saying "sorry we can't
because we have to preserve Israeli nuclear weapons
from inspections".
Well,
is it a problem about the Islamic faith?
