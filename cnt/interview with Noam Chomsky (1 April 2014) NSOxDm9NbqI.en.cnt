hello hi this is professor Chomsky yeah
hi there um I just wanted to interview
you very quickly only a 15 minutes so we
have to talk fast okay my my point with
the this interview is that in order to
make it through the pivotal period ahead
we need many public intellectuals at
your level like many sort of Noam
Chomsky's right and I just wonder
suppose someone wants to achieve what
you've done in your political work what
does it take nothing special I don't
have any particular talents it's just
hard work anybody can do it and how many
hours do you read daily work I spend a
lot of time during the day working a lot
of time I spend just answering mail
maybe five or six hours a day a good bit
but you know nothing beyond what any
person can decide to do if they want to
and what's the breakdown for your
reading between you know newspapers
journals and books like how does it
break down roughly well and they in the
morning you know eating breakfast I read
a couple of dis papers I then turn to
other work whatever it may be usually in
the evening I set aside time to redo the
journals that are pouring at every day
books that I'm constantly in the middle
of and so on and it's important that
time okay and it's important to read
everything with a critical eye right
certainly is and also I think it's
important to read pretty broadly you
know not simply to keep to material that
reinforces your own beliefs it's useful
to read the cross a pretty broad
spectrum so do you read am so serious
you know it's junk no right um so do you
read you know right wing materials yeah
sure for example I read
many of the journals are considered
right-wing national interest american
conservative the international affairs
i'm in desert either mainstream or sort
of center-right journals I'm of the
far-right journal and if they're serious
and important sure you can learn a lot
from and you're confident that you don't
you're confident that your your views
are correct after reading everything
across the spectrum right oh you could
never be confident that your views are
correct even in the sciences one thing
you always have to do is keep it open
mind and a questioning mind about the
conclusion that you draw and in fact
it's useful to look for disconfirming
evidence and they try to evaluate it so
you hafta you live in the world and in
order to act you have to act with a
certain presumption of confidence but in
the back your mind you could keep open
the possibility that the confidence is
misplaced thanks and could you just list
the the newspapers that you read every
day like on a daily basis well I always
wherever am try to read the New York
Times I take a look at the Boston Globe
I look at the Wall Street Journal the
Financial Times selective international
pressors depending on what happened to
be looking at at them or thinking about
at the moment or working on or looking
for and these these are the best
newspapers in the world you just have to
read them with a critical eye to
compensate for the like phillotson New
York Times is the one newspaper that I
would do in the wherever I am Sam in
Europe in Asia I would try every day to
pick up the international edition of The
New York Times on the Internet is
nowhere else it's got plenty of flaws
but it also has more coverage than any
single newspaper you can find
so what are the journals that you read
regularly god they're too many to list
quite a few I'm in several here for
commit every day so what would they be
though like foreign of Foreign Affairs
or farm Affairs our policy international
affairs the British Journal the nation
that the Republic american conservative
of the American Prospect de left review
is e-magazine you know on and on and
then would you say mainly it's just
books though like just books of all
kinds that you read write the books it
depends what I'm thinking about working
on i'm usually in the middle of half a
dozen books on different topics yeah
every time i see an interview with you
on the internet there's always a huge
stack of books yeah and usually those
are books I'd love to get to but don't
have time for and down to come up I try
to plunge in when I can but there's not
no special techniques or methods this is
just you know what you have to do is you
try to keep up keep your finger in many
different areas occasionally um you do
cite pretty obscure sources for example
I think you cited proceedings like the
US Navy journal that was probably
something to do with the rowboat cruiser
and I think you cited Jane's Defence
weekly with regard to Clinton's
helicopter deal but those aren't sorted
out of your journal like jane's defence
weekly is in fact the major military
journal I don't read it regularly but if
I'm interested in some particular thing
then yes look it up but normally if
there's a fairly obscure source it's
that one wouldn't be but if there is
it's usually brought to your attention
by some journalists right well all kinds
of ways I mean sometimes for scholarly
literature sites things that suggest
some direction in which you might look
and when you pursue it do you find
something else there's no real there's
no method that you can prescribe her
research other than keeping your eyes
open a working hard
and pursuing things that seem as if they
might be interesting when you pursue
them you get to other sources and they
give you other sources ultimately a lot
of time it's a wild goose chase but
often you find important nuggets and you
said once that there were churches in
the Midwest that knew more about Central
America than the CIA because they had
really efficient information networks
that allowed them to compensate you know
these networks clip that was in the
1980s when there was a very significant
grassroots activist movement a lot of it
based in rural areas and churches and
even evangelical churches many others
which had maintained quite close
contacts with events in Central America
including direct participation the
people who went there and work the
Solidarity work did other things and
there were networks of the interaction
and communication that provided quite a
lot of information in many respects much
better than that that the intelligence
agencies would have it their disposal so
these information networks can do way
more than any one person could do right
you could never do it on your own right
oh sure network of people magnifies
enormously the what you can achieve so
do you have such a network that you rely
on in the formal network there people I
communicate with who have shared
interests doing research in similar
areas we of course communicate to
regularly interchange ideas and
suggestions critiques of often critiques
of one another's work and so on you know
that's so that's the way to develop your
own ideas and your own understanding
right for example like Charles glass is
someone you know and sometimes he'll
alert you to something important right
right he's a terrific journalist and
working mostly in the Middle East now
and discover us all kinds of things he's
also a good scholar he goes back to the
history
his books his articles or personal
communication has been extremely
valuable right so you you have lots of
journalists you know like that who tell
you about important things right yeah
and we kind of interchange there are
lots of people like that you know just
wondering that do you have any I ring
words for young people who want to be
the next Noam Chomsky well first of all
they shouldn't be have that aspiration
they should be the next person that they
are that they intend to be that is right
for them there's different they're
plenty of people who do work in my view
is extremely valuable and probably more
a lot more important when I do but they
don't write articles and give talks
maybe that's the right thing for them to
be or they should work in whatever area
that excites their interest in
imagination and appears to them to be
significant intellectually socially
humanly whatever the criteria are but
there's no person that you should aspire
to be do you think it would be a would
you be happy if there are a lot of young
people who actually went on to you know
surpass your achievements I think the
best it sorry better but a central given
the kinds of problems that lie ahead the
kind of challenges for young people to
become extensively and involved and
dedicated and facing them right so even
the best thing would be if one day there
are so many good intellectuals that you
were actually considered mediocre right
well not just intellectual activists of
all kinds I mean I don't even know what
intellectual means I mean there may be a
person who never graduated high school
has a has deep insights and
understanding about the nature of the
world fact I've known such people
they're usually not called intellectuals
but they're often more creative and
insightful and Laura called
intellectuals
so people should pursue their
capabilities and interests actively and
with an eye towards the great
significance of direct engagement by
intellectual I just meant someone who
who you know rights and and monitors the
media and does research that kind of
supports the activists I think that's a
valuable thing to do but there are many
other things that are valuable like
organizing you did mention that there
was a division of labor that happened a
long time ago when you realize that you
weren't so much so good at organizing
but you're better at you know doing the
you know the academic work not academic
but you know the research is kind of a
natural division of labor many of my
close friends what in other directions
and I think what they do is enormously
important right all I meant was that
someone on your side of the division of
labor that's just all i meant by public
intellectual you know someone who I mean
they may decide not to be public
intellectuals but to be activists
organizer other doing real the crucial
work in fact grassroots organizing okay
and lastly I just had one final question
I wanted to ask you about what you think
about the the Arctic permafrost I don't
know if you followed the climate science
but apparently there's a huge problem
with the melting permafrost the
permafrost yeah I could release math
nothing of the permafrost yeah that's
that's enormously dangerous that it
could lead to it an irreversible and
sharply escalating cycle I mean had not
I the Arctic but in Siberia as the ice
cover melt the permafrost will be
exposed to melting that's a huge amount
of fossil fuels incorporated there if
that gets into the atmosphere it might
have a sharmilee escalating effect which
will be on which will be irreversible
yeah there are scientists monitoring all
of this and they're extremely alarmed
about it aren't they oh you know they
have every reason to be artic Isis
receiving
very quickly in the same happening in
Siberia and elsewhere in Nordic do and
it's not clear whether the gas will be
released as co2 or methane and if its
methane it will be 60 to 70 times are
clear but the dangers are very severe
and what do you think can be done about
this before it's too late yeah a lot can
be done we have to get off fossil fuels
as quickly as possible and create
sustainable energy source and that means
a lot of a social reconstruction
rebuilding cities lots of things it has
to be done fast and it has to be done
with fee and dividend policy right do
you know what that is fee and dividend
you tax you tax the carbon and it goes
into a pool and then you send it back
out about one thing that it ought to be
cried how successful it could be we
don't know but that's one of many
directions that can be taken but if it's
not done the market will go with the
cheapest energy supply and wind and
solar won't have all we can't rely on
the market or we're doomed it's going to
require policy decision right so it
requires some kind of carbon tax to to
tilt the market differently right hip
will require policy decisions which will
shape and properly marginalize market
diversity okay and also I just wanted to
know what the situation is regarding the
other threat the nuclear situation is
the u.s. still block is the u.s. still
jury the US the yeah I'm sorry I have to
leave but just to finish the in the
nuclear that there's a constant threat
of nuclear war even by accident and
there's plenty of tensions in the world
which could lead to blow up if that
happens we've got it with the end so we
can stop talking about everything else
that can be stopped we can eliminate
nuclear weapons the environmental crisis
maybe we can deal with maybe not but in
the case of nuclear weapons we know how
to proceed and the US is blocked
basically the u.s. is blocking the
nuclear weapons calzones not just us no
clear States all together okay thanks so
much Yeah right talk again
