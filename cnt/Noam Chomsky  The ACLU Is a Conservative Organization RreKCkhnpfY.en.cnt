the ACLU is an important organization of
the ACLU in fact became the ACLU right
at the time of the Red Scare Wilson's
Red Scare and in response to that severe
repression and since then it has a
pretty admirable record of its
conservative rec it's a conservative
organization very conservative the term
conservative is another one of those
that's been distorted out of any
relation to its meaning but in the real
sense of the term conservative the ACLU
is a conservative organization which is
trying to preserve basically
conservative values 18th century values
and it does a pretty good job on it it's
had bad periods it went along with
McCarthyism for example and it doesn't
take the really hard cases those are
taken by more militant civil rights
organizations but it has done very good
things it's very striking fact that
about the political system you recall
what happened with the ACLU in the last
elections the Republicans attacked
Dukakis as a card-carrying member of the
ACLU that's a very interesting phrase
that means an organ card-carrying of
course means real really communist you
know that's what that's supposed to
imply so here's an organization that's
committed to the defense of the
Constitution and according to the
Republicans that's communists well you
know I think that characterizes modern
conservatism it's really a profoundly
reactionary movement which is deeply
opposed to the values that on which the
country was established and that's why
they would call a an organization
calling for the defense of the
Constitution a subversive organization
now what was the Democrats defense
against this charge that they were that
Dukakis supported the Constitution his
defense was to deny that he supported I
mean he didn't say yeah of course I'm a
member of the ACO you and proud of it
what he said is we gave it they
published a list of cases of the ACLU
that he disagreed with that was the
Republic r attic response well that
tells you something about a leet opinion
i know i don't think the ACLU is an
illusion I think it's an important
organization i'm proud to be a
card-carrying member and to speak at
their meetings and stuff
I also think there are more courageous
organizations to take harder cases
