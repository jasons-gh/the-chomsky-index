the indication that there's a problem of
free speech on campus is given by polls
of students which show that considerable
majority sometimes close to
three-quarters believe that hateful
ideas have no place on the campus racist
sexist xenophobic and so on and I think
that is a problem it's a problem because
though you the motives are
understandable admirable in many ways
and can be accommodated appropriately I
think nevertheless the principle is
mistaken we I'm sure we'll have ample
discussion of that and it's also a
tactical error for quite a number of
reasons one of them you've just seen if
you look at the history of such concepts
which is rich and ugly they had the
print such principles have almost
invariably
have been directed against vulnerable
groups groups that deviate from what
George Orwell once called the pervasive
orthodoxy and have been efforts to
sustain a power authority and domination
oh that goes right till the present in
fact and we can anticipate that if such
principles are established and expected
in a firm fashion that will continue to
be the way they're used and there's
another reason why it's tactically
mistaken if you have a festering sore
the cure is not to irritate it but to
find out what its roots are where it
comes from and to deal with those racist
another such speech is a festering storm
by silencing it you simply amplify its
appeal and even lend that a veneer of
respect
as in fact we've seen very clearly in
the last a couple of years a couple of
years and what has to be done plainly is
to confront it and to ask where it comes
from and to try to deal with the roots
of such ideas that's the way to
extirpate the ugliness and evil that
lies behind such phenomenon and as we
think about this I suggested reflecting
a little on something that's really not
the topic tonight but nevertheless is
worth keeping in the back of your mind
but when we ask about the state of free
speech on campus today we should be
asking ourselves in comparison to what
well the natural comparison is to the
period when student activism in the
modern period really began to take off
some of the pictures that you saw the
1960s so what was the situation like on
campus at that time well one of the
major recent books on free speech on
campus after the book that we had the
lead review in the New York Times Book
Review last Sunday it's called the
coddling of the American mind and it
discusses the danger of safe spaces
other devices which are leading it
claims with some justification to
citizenry which is unwilling to face
alternative ideas and stays within its
own cocoon and that's destructive of the
people of course destructive of
democracy I think there's fair amount of
validity of that now we can ask what it
was like in the 1960s
well when the student movements began to
develop what they were opposing was safe
spaces namely the university system and
the intellectual culture which was a
safe space for the prevailing orthodoxy
with remarkable effectiveness as Orwell
wrote speaking of England that's what
the University in the culture was like
and mines were indeed coddled they were
protected from what regarded as
dangerous ideas actually saw an example
of that in the comments about Russell
happened to be a little bit earlier but
that was very much the case in the
academic environment and in fact the
intellectual culture generally in the
nineteen fifties and early sixties
that's why when you look at the what the
student movement was doing it was not
only engaged in important tasks of
trying to gain the right of free speech
on campus but in discipline after
discipline students were creating
alternatives the major issue in the 60s
one of the major isms the Vietnam War
the committee of Concerned Asian
scholars initiated by students
flourished since still alive was a
critique of the prevailing orthodoxy in
political science and Asian Studies
Department which was extremely rigid
same happened in economics and political
science and history and so on
the Union of Concerned Scientists
scientists was critiquing the
unwillingness of the scientific
community to confront seriously of the
effects of the use of the technology and
scientific ideas that they were
developing this was prevalent throughout
and if you look back at the orthodoxy of
the 60s you can understand why we may
have forgotten but it's worth of
remembering so for example in the 1960s
the leading
study of American diplomatic history
by a distinguished liberal scholar
blandly described the task of the
colonists once they had attained
independence of their task he said it
was to turn to the job of felling trees
and Indians and expanding to the
national borders that's pervasive
orthodoxy felling trees and Indians and
expanding to the national borders not a
hint of protest actually if you look up
the phrase on Google you'll find the
nature of the protest a couple of dozen
quotes from things of mine and nothing
else because no one saw anything wrong
with it today I think it would be
inconceivable that you could have a
statement like that almost anywhere but
certainly not in the leading most
prestigious history of American
diplomacy and it continues the leading
anthropologists in the country we're
telling us that the
Indian population was a group of
scattered savages dedicated to vicious
warfare or no culture nothing the in the
Cold War which is of course raging at
the time the sole comic idea that could
be expressed was what's called the
Orthodox position the United States is
absolute sublimity our enemy is ultimate
evil nothing further to discuss
if you think about and this conveyed not
only coddled the minds of students but
coddled the general population so you
look at attitudes at the time about 5%
of the population thought that
interracial marriages were tolerable 50
years later it's about 90% and that's a
large reason for that
is the impact of student activism you
have to recall that in the 1960s the
United States still had
anti-miscegenation laws the laws so
severe that when the Nazis in the 1930s
were looking for models these were the
only ones they could find but they were
too harsh so the Nazis wouldn't accept
them because we had us had the one drop
of blood principle that was too much for
the Nazis same on issue after issue like
it's something that one should
definitely bear in mind so yes
the academic culture the intellectual
culture were safe spaces they were
coddling the American mind and the
student activism has played an enormous
role in the vanguard of demolishing much
of this there's plenty to be done still
we can say not this extreme but some of
our things today and that should be
recognized in fact it's happened right
here in Tucson as many of you know
better than I do there was an effort by
the legislature to kill a very effective
Mexican American Studies program in the
schools
it was confronted by students high
school students who demonstrated
protested effectively they didn't manage
the ban the law but they did create a
help create a mentality which led to
federal judge to impose an injunction so
that it can't be applied these are very
important things to keep in mind I think
in the background when we talk about the
problems of a campus of free speech on
campus today which are very significant
ones
