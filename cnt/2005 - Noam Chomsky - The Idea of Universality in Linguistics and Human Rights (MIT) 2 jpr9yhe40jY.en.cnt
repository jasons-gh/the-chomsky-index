tation of elementary properties that
could be easily detected in the
environment what quine and his highly
influential framework called a quality
space apart from that undifferentiated
the learning mechanisms of some kind
would account for what organisms know
and do that would include humans the bio
linguistic approach along with related
areas of the cognitive sciences adopted
a quite different stance it took the
object of inquiry to be not behavior but
or its products but rather the internal
systems that enter into behavior into
action and interpretation and at a
deeper level the basis in our biological
nature for the growth and development of
these internal systems the goal was to
discover what a 16th century innovator
one part they described as the essential
property of human intelligence the
capacity of them quoting him the
capacity of the human mind to engender
within itself by its own power the
principles on which knowledge risks
these are ideas which were developed in
quite important ways in the years that
followed to the early 19th century for
language the principles on which
knowledge rests are those of the
attained state of some internal faculty
the language faculty the knowledge that
rests on those principles covers a very
wide range from sound the structure to
meaning in even the most elementary
cases one can think of turns out that
what is known is quite intricate when
you look closely even the simplest words
for example so I'll just take one that
interested British empiricists just
consider the Charles River over there
wherever it is Thomas Hobbes was
interested in the idea of what a river
is and he suggested that rivers are
mentally individuated by their place of
origin so would be the same river if it
went somewhere else but originated in
the same place the concept river is what
he and others at the time called a
common notion that is part of innate
knowledge one of and this would be one
of its inherent properties well that's
part of the picture but it's not quite
accurate and it only scratches the
surface of the common notion as we can
quickly discover just by thinking about
it a little we all know that it would
remain the very same river under quite
extreme changes but it wouldn't be a
river at all under extremely slight
changes so it would still be the Charles
River contrary to Hobbes if the horse of
the course reversed it went the other
direction or if it was divided into
separate streams that converge in some
new place or if whatever h2o happens to
be a net assuming there is any is
replaced with chemicals from some
upstream faculty manufacturing plant and
many other changes still be the Charles
River on the other hand it wouldn't be a
river at all if it was directed within
fixed boundaries and was used for
shipping freight let's say then it would
be a canal not a river or if the surface
were hardened by some virtually
undetectable physical change line was
painted down the middle and it was used
to commute downtown at the Boston
highway as we we find much more
intricate properties so we investigate
commonplace facts like these completely
undermine a conventional almost
universal approach to reference that's
based on some
werd object relation which is completely
mystical insights about these matters
were explored from Aristotle up through
the British empiricist but they've been
mostly lost today I think the proper
conclusion is that even the most
elementary human concept appear to be
entirely different from anything found
so far at least an animal symbolic or
communicative behavior which is a
significant problem for evolutionary
biology one of one of several in this
connection and the problems mount very
rapidly when we move from simple words
two expressions form from them I won't
spend time on examples what is none
turns out to be extremely intricate and
subtle and almost divorced from any
evidence we have well that poses what an
essential task of inquiry namely to
determine the principles on which such
knowledge rests for the widest variety
of possible human languages and behind
it as a deeper problem to discover what
what they call the power to engender
these principles of internal language in
current terms that would mean the
virtually uniform biological endowment
that constitutes particular cognitive
faculty human language faculty the power
to engender an internal language that's
the topic of what's commonly now called
universal grammar that's adapting a
traditional term to a new context and
it's in this context that a coherent and
useful notion of universality and
language arises these with the
universals of language would be the
universal properties of the biological
endowment essentially the genetic
component of the language faculty one
significant insight of the first
cognitive revolution was that properties
of the world that are informally called
metal may involve unbounded capacities
of a finite organ the finite use
of infinite means and Bill home from
home bolts phrase and a rather similar
vein at hume before had recognized that
our moral judgments are unbounded in
scope and must be founded on general
principles finite general principles
that are part of our nature although
beyond what he called our original
instincts and that observation opposes
for this problem in a different domain
and in fact this one of the thin threads
that lead to topic that were announced
today by the mid 20th century when all
of this had been completely forgotten it
had become possible to reinvent and face
those problems in a more substantive way
than before by that time there was a
clear understanding of finite generative
systems with unbounded scope and that
could readily be adapted to reframing
and investigating some of the
traditional questions that had been
necessarily left quite obscure before
that understanding developed although
it's important to stress only some of
the traditional questions von Humboldt
and phrase quoted and elsewhere was
talking about infinite use which is
quite a different matter from unbounded
scope and the same is true of the
Cartesian science from which this float
another influential factor in the
renewal of the cognitive revolution was
the work of ethologists at that time
early 50s just coming to be easily
accessible with its concern for what was
called the innate working hypotheses
present and subhuman organisms and the
human a priori which would have much the
same character that's Tinbergen and
Lawrence that framework to could be
adapted to the study of human cognitive
organs and their genetically determined
nature and those few of us who were
interested in these topics were reading
them avidly at the time
meanwhile kind of in parallel efforts
pretty intensive efforts to sharpen and
refine the procedural approaches of
structural linguistics ran into serious
difficulties revealing what appeared to
be intrinsic inadequacies it as you
pursued it further it became
increasingly clear that even the
simplest elements don't have a kind of a
beads on a string character that's
required for procedures of segmentation
and classification to work rather they
relate much more indirectly to sound to
the phonetic form that they do have
properties and a nature but their nature
and properties are fixed by the role
they play within an internal
computational system that determines an
unbounded range of expressions and
closer study if the postulated
mechanisms of learning in the behavioral
sciences generally also revealed
fundamental inadequacies and pretty soon
questions were arising right within the
core disciplines as to whether their
concepts even their major concepts could
be sustained well a natural conclusion
from all of this was seemed to be that
the internal language that's attained
has roughly the character of a
scientific theory an idealized
scientific theory that is an integrated
system of rules and principles from
which the expressions of the language
can be derived and the child must
somehow select the internal language
from the flux of experience the problem
is similar to what charles sanders purse
founder of pragmatism had called
abduction in his consideration of
scientific discovery and just as in the
case of the sciences its task is
impossible without initial limitations
on admissible hypothesis purse put it
mishel limitations that permit only
certain theories even to be entered
tained but not infinitely many others
that would be compatible with any
