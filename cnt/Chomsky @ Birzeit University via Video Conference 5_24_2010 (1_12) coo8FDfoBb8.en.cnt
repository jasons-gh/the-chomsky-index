thank you very much for the gracious
grading on personally very sorry that I
cannot be with you in person today I was
looking forward very much to another
opportunity to visit there's a
university the first time I spoke at
bears aids that was during the First
Intifada and it had to be moved to East
Jerusalem the authorities had closed
down the university the second time was
about 10 years later when I was able to
visit the campus with my close friends
oz maybe Shara and amira hass and had
been hoping to come again today without
any further comment that's even more
disappointing form were disappointing
that government any government should
assume the right to determine who can be
invited to speak by a free and
independent university and i hope that
kind of boycott as you correctly called
it will soon come to an end well turning
to the topic which is about the united
states and its place in the world the
literature on u.s. foreign relations and
international affairs has a common theme
pretty much across the spectrum the
common theme is sometimes called
american exceptionalism that's the idea
that the United States has a unique
dedication to freedom democracy human
rights
all good things there are problems with
this common theme one is it's not
exceptional in fact it's close to
universal it's hard to find in the
records of any great power an absence of
the claim that there's a sort of a
unique benevolence and magnificence to
their role that's even true of the worst
monsters the second problem is that the
same the teeth of American
exceptionalism is the doctrine is
completely contradicted by the
historical record overwhelmingly from
the origins of the country and that
poses a task for the intellectual
community Langley to reconcile the gap
the chasm in fact between the doctrine
and reality and that's a task that
absorbs a great deal of energy and
attention in interesting ways well the
fact that the doctrine is completely
refuted by history that mean that there
are no that there is no truth to it
there are elements of American
exceptionalism some of them in fact are
attractive so the United States is
unusual I think you make a little since
the 1960s and its protection for freedom
of speech a core principle of human
rights a second commercial difference is
that for over a century the United
States has been by far the largest
economy in the world by moving to more
recent times by the end of the Second
World War
the United States had literally has to
help the wealth of the world an
unparalleled degree of concentration of
wealth that was reduced over the over
time as the industrial countries were
reconstituted after the war and
decolonization took place by 1970 the
world had become were diverse sometimes
called tri-polar with the three major
centers of economic strength North
America based in the United States or
primarily Germany and France and
Northeast Asia which already at that
time even before the rise of China was
becoming the most dynamic and growth
area in the world so when in the United
States had many maybe twenty-five
percent of the world's wealth which is a
figure that's my name is pretty constant
sense another crucial difference between
the United States and other great powers
in the past is that the United States is
a settler colonial society that's the
most extreme and brutal form of
imperialism and that aspect of US
history i think is given is not given
enough attention it's particularly
relevant in the present case I suspect
resume is one of the reasons for the
almost reflexive sympathy of Americans
for for for Israel which is in a sense
seeing as seen as reliving the history
of the United States as a settler
colonial society there are many ironies
in this the earliest settlers in the
united states the ones who settled long
england word i live they were mostly
religious extremists they perceive
themselves as the
of Israel waving the holy book as they
came to the promised land that killed
the Amalekites and drive them out and of
course they're doing it with the most
benevolent of reasons if you look at the
state of Massachusetts where I live
received its charter from the King of
England in 1629 and it established a
Great Seal of the state of Massachusetts
which you can find on the internet it
pictures an Indian with a scroll coming
out of his mouth saying come over and
help us so the Indians were pleading
with settlers to come and rescue them
from their state of paganism and the
result was that they were exterminated
which was puzzling too many commentators
because the US was following God's will
and the theme called providential ISM
runs right through American history from
the earliest settlers right up to george
w bush and we're pursuing god's will and
whatever we do and if it turns out that
some people seem to be harmed by it oh
that's the mystery of God's will not for
us mere humans clowder and sorry I
vanished okay tend to speak softly but I
don't have a big stick the another
unusual maybe unique feature of the
United States is that it's perhaps the
only society that was founded as an
empire so George Washington the father
of the country described the United
States as an infant Empire the colonies
were to expand and grow and his
colleagues greed the most libertarians
clowning Fathers Thomas Jefferson had a
very expensive the conception it was
view the colonies would of course drive
out the native population actually they
exterminated them for the most part and
it would expand it would end up being a
country as he put it without broth or
mixture going to red or black
