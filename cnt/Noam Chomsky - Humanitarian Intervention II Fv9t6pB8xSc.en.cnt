it's just that you take your question
and generalize it not to the United
States but to any great power okay so is
the are the politics of any great power
undertaken out of a and a an intention
to create benefit and you know help the
people of the world I think you know you
have to really look hard to find
examples great power actions don't take
place in a social and economic that a
vacuum they are carried out effectively
by the concentrations of power within
the society that differs in different
societies like in the old Soviet Union
it was the Kremlin you know party
apparatus in the United States the
corporate sector okay so if you want to
understand policies a good place to look
is the interests of those who formulate
them and it's very rare that they act in
the interests of others who would expect
that and of course the intellectual
classes have to write a story which says
they're always acting and in the
interests of others out of pure altruism
now but that's almost universal
throughout history so we discounted and
we ask what they're actually doing and
yeah sometimes it happens to be
beneficial to others that's that takes a
humanitarian intervention a use of force
in violation of international law well
if you take a look at the post-world War
two period you can find a few cases
where use of force
put an end to major atrocities now they
don't enter into the canon we don't talk
about them and the reason is because of
who carried him out and what the u.s.
reaction was they're the only two cases
I know of of any significance are the
Indian invasion of East Pakistan of
Bangladesh in 1971 which did stop huge
massacres and the Vietnamese invasion of
Cambodia in 1979 which put an end to
pulpitis atrocities just when they were
peaking so they had you know very humane
consequences were they humanitarian
interventions no because those weren't
the intentions those were the
consequences but why don't they enter
into the Canon well because it wasn't us
we didn't carry it out rather it was
them
and what they do can never be any good
furthermore even worse the United States
strongly opposed to both of those
interventions it threatened war with
India you sent aircraft carriers into
the Bay of Bengal to threaten them for
this crime in the case of Vietnam I mean
they were just bitterly denounced we're
putting Pol Pot's atrocities to an end
the u.s. supported a Chinese invasion to
punish them for the crime and the u.s.
immediately turned to supporting Pol Pot
well okay so therefore their
intervention can't count as humanitarian
but try to find some other examples it's
so yes there are cases where the use of
force happen to have benign effects but
not because it was carried out with a
humane intent and the cases don't count
unless we did them when we did them it
either succeeds in crushing resistance
in which case it's hailed as a great
achievement or it fails in which case we
say well it was a mistake you know our
benign intentions were couldn't be
realized
that's the Canon of intellectual history
may we see it right now for example so
it takes a iraq and take a roughly
comparable example Chechnya
in Chechnya first Yeltsin then Putin
responded to Chechen terror really
significant such and terror in Russia
with a vicious invasion which destroyed
the capital city Grozny you know killed
tens of thousands of people and then
according to us reporters have been
there it ended up very successful New
York Times reporters visiting say Grozny
is a booming City construction
everywhere everybody has electricity you
know no Russian troops around
it's run by Chechen security forces I
mean to some guerrillas often that Hill
somewhere we don't call that a success
we call it a crime yeah they succeeded
in pacifying and reconstructing the
country and now it's working pretty well
and we consider it a crime rightly all
right now let's take the US invasion of
Iraq well you know if General Petraeus
had been able to even minimally approach
what Putin achieved in Chechnya he'd
probably be crowned king he hasn't been
able to achieve that but so instead of
you know the country survives
I mean Baghdad for example is a gated
city which people can't go from one
place to another and there's been
massive ethnic cleansing so killing has
reduced because there's nobody to kill
anymore the militias have been armed
trained and funded so they control their
territory so violence is reduced a
little the place of total wreck is maybe
a million people killed you know a
couple of million displaced and refugees
but it's kind of you know vile somewhat
reduced so not as successful as Putin
and Chechnya but you know to some extent
that kind of reduced the level of
violence that we created in the first
place and that's praise to crawl across
the spectrum say okay the question of
the surge let's say is settled because
look how wonderful it was I mean nowhere
near as wonderful as Putin and Chechnya
but nevertheless we did it so it must be
right even if the places left total
wreck that may never come
well okay that's the way within our
doctrinal system we look at the use of
violence by ourselves and others and
this translates to others they do the
same thing now is the use of violence
ever permissible I'm not an absolute
passive an absolute passive which they
know I don't agree but I think there's a
very heavy burden of proof you want to
use violence whether it's a domestic
dispute or you know international
affairs you have a very heavy burden of
proof to me and I think if you look
carefully it's very hard to meet that
burden and the cases that are accepted
whether it's personal relations or
international affairs just don't stand
up almost without exception
