why you think we do these things of
course we get fed this idea that it's
for freedom and democracy but what is
the real goal is it power is it money is
it and who's making the decisions and
why well the decisions is - the
decisions in the 1940s which I discussed
were made in the government and other
planning you know private planning
circles related to the government and
the implementation of the policies is in
the state sector but remember that the
state sector is very closely linked to
concentrated private capital to the
corporate sector the industry in recent
years financial and others military you
know it's all energy corporations under
or closely linked Nexus and that's
essentially where the planning is
carried out and it's not very surprising
that the planning is carried out in
their interests that's the way it's
always been so you go back to say Adam
Smith when he talked about England he
pointed out correctly that the
architects of policy are the people who
basically own the country in his day
merchants and manufacturers and they
make policy to ensure that their own
interests are very well served that no
matter how Grievous the effect on others
including the people of England I'm
virtually quoting and that's a simple
truism holds for power systems generally
and it's not a great surprise that we're
like other power systems so let's think
Iraq is an example what who stands to
gain from our invasion of Iraq and is it
as simple as saying hey a defense
contractor will make money
Halliburton will make money and hence we
are going to Iraq because of that are
there other forces and one of those
there are very solid reasons for
invading Iraq Iraq has the second
largest oil reserves in the world it's
right at the heart of the Middle East
region which is the main energy reserve
of the world establishing a client
regime and a major military base in Iraq
and getting
preferential access to its resources
would be of great value to the people
who are the our counterparts to Adam
Smith's merchants and manufacturers the
energy corporations industrial
corporations you know banks and so on
they didn't achieve it it Iraq is an
interesting case because it was a defeat
u.s. goals were defeated in Iraq very
important fact at the beginning of
course there were all sorts of pretexts
you know we're going to with the weapon
they're tied up with al-qaeda you know
weapons of mass destruction when that
collapsed there was a new pretext we're
bringing democracy I'm in fact the u.s.
fought democracy every step of the way
it tried to prevent elections when
couldn't prevent them it tried to
manipulate them and kept going right
through to the end at the very end say
by nineteen by 2008 when it was pretty
clear that the US was not going to
achieve its goals the administration the
Bush administration started talking
pretty frankly about what they were so
November 2007 January 2008 there were
strong significant declarations by the
administration in which they said they
discussed what the outcome must be they
were not then talking about a Status of
Forces Agreement what it must include
and at that time they were demanding
that what it must include is you you the
US right to use military bases in Iraq
indefinitely as a base for combat and
other operations and privileged access
to us to Iraqi energy resources for US
corporations at that point it was said
very explicitly because they were
getting desperate well they didn't get
either of those the United States has
not been able to suppress Iraqi
nationalism the US could kill any number
of insurgents that wasn't a big problem
but what they couldn't deal with is the
mass popular nonviolent resistance and
the u.s. had to back down step
step that's why the you know the books
on Iraq by none of the leading the most
serious analysts people like Jonathan
Steele David Gardner of the Financial
Times and others these have titles like
defeat the US was defeated so but it's
clear what the war aims are and they
were sensible aims and of course they're
sensible because a lot of people get
confused they're accessible in future
look at it in terms of the companies
that are involved when you and that was
a realization I made far far too late I
never could understand why we wanted the
oil when we don't get the oil and of
course it doesn't matter right the
American people in the night in the
1950s the US was the major producer and
exporter I mean it but nevertheless the
US was dedicated the Eisenhower
administration was dedicated to
controlling the Middle East the Middle
East oil for the reasons I mentioned top
planners recognized that if we control
Middle East oil we can control the world
if you have your hand on the spigot you
can control what other people do whether
we use it or not in fact the Eisenhower
administration in order to for the
benefit of Texas oil producers insisted
on exhausting our domestic reserves
using up our domestic reserves and
instead of purchasing much cheaper
Middle East Saudi oil well these are
those were short term calculations of
profit but in general a policy is not
made for the benefit of the population
rarely I mean in the United States or
anywhere else
