and that would have been in the real
issue is what was the justification for
the u.s. Israeli invasion in the first
place and the answer is none there was
no justification it was was even a
pretext on the with technically a prefix
it always is the pretext was that Israel
that was being bombarded with Hamas
rockets but Israel knew perfectly well
and the United States knew perfectly
well how to stop the Hamas Rockets by
peaceful means the namely accept a
ceasefire and I would have worked almost
certainly another had in fact been at
each ceasefire in 2008 and during the
ceasefire Hamas didn't fire a single
rocket you can look up the Israeli
government official website that find to
find the recognition of that and that
was true even though Israel didn't live
up to the ceasefire it continued to
maintain the siege in violation of the
ceasefire agreement seizures an act of
war of course nevertheless Hamas didn't
fire any rockets on November forth under
the cover of the US and the elections
Israel invaded Gaza killed half a dozen
Hamas militants and then rocket fire
started and there was an exchange in
which everybody killed was Palestinian
as usual the Hamas called for a
reinstatement of the ceasefire the
Israeli kept this went right up to the
practically the day of the invasion the
Israeli cabinet considered it we know
from his weak internal Israeli sources
and decided not to do it they wanted to
attack of course the US is up to its
nakedness so the US and Israel knew
perfectly well that there were peaceful
means to stop the rocket fire which was
the alleged pretext but preferred not to
use them just as in other cases that I
mentioned there are peaceful means you
don't want to use them in that case you
have no justification for the use of
force I mean Bothan just you know normal
common sense and also in its straight
international law the
Resort the force is completely banned
it's the worst crime unless you have
exhausted peaceful means a couple of
other conditions and in this case the US
and Israel refused even the tribe
peaceful means because they knew they
were going to work so the justification
for the invasion is zero in fact if they
fired one pistol shot it was a crime and
hence looking into the difficult
question of disproportionality is a
straight gift Israel and Goldstone
himself wrote the mandate for the
investigation and he read it this way he
wrote it so as to exclude the crucial
issue was there any justification for
the use of force in the first place and
he's explained why he's explained that
in his opinion is realized every right
to use force no matter what so that
question didn't arise so as I say the
Goldstone report is a free free pass for
Israel it's a gift but their reaction to
it has been so irrational and hysterical
that exactly stirred up a lot of
opposition around the world well that's
it those who followed history of
apartheid will recognize similarities
just just can't be perceived
