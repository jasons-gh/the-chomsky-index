the New York Times is reporting
President Obama has just passed a little
notice milestone he's now been wore
longer than any president in US history
longer than George W Bush longer than
Franklin Delano Roosevelt longer than
Abraham Lincoln Obama's taken military
action in at least seven countries Iraq
Afghanistan Libya Syria Pakistan Yemen
and Somalia just last month President
Obama announced the deployment of 250
more Special Operations troops to Syria
and a move that nearly doubles the
official US presence in the country as
war spreads across the globe a record 60
million people were driven from their
homes last year experts warned the
refugee crisis may also worsen Duty
impacts of global warming over the
weekend NASA released data showing 2016
is on pace to be by far the hottest year
ever breaking the 2015 record April
became the seventh month in a row to
have broken global temperature records
meanwhile many fear a new nuclear arms
race has quietly begun as the United
States Russia and China race to build
Arsenal's of smaller nuclear weapons
these multiple crises come as voters in
the United States prepared to elect a
new president to make sense of the
challenges facing the globe and the
state of the US election we're joined
today by one of the world's pre-eminent
intellectuals Noam Chomsky Institute
professor emeritus at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he's
taught for more than half a century his
latest book is called
who rules the world known Chomsky
welcome back to Democracy Now it's great
to have you with us glad to be with you
again so know who rules the world that's
to a certain extent up to us it is
possible for populations to rule the
world but they have to struggle to
achieve that and if they don't the world
will be ruled by concentrations of power
economic power state power closely
linked
with consequences that are of the kind
that you describe but that's a choice
how does the United States set the terms
of the global discourse and overall
what's happening in the world well
that's basically an outcome of the
second world war at the end of the
Second World War the United States had a
level of power and comparative wealth
that never existed in history it had
literally half the world's wealth
it had an incomparable position of
security control the hemisphere
controlled both oceans controlled the
opposite sides of both notions in
military terms it was overwhelmingly
preeminent other industrial societies
had been devastated or severely weakened
the war had actually greatly benefited
the US economy and to the depression
industrial production virtually
quadrupled there was a debt which could
easily grow out of it by growth so the
United States was in fact in a position
to pretty much set the terms for
virtually the entire global system it
couldn't stay that way of course and it
began to erode pretty quickly though
with all the changes over the past years
the United States still is in a
preeminent physician with incomparable
advantages and maybe now a quarter of
the world's wealth in military terms on
that dimension the United States is
completely alone it's the only country
that has hundreds maybe a thousand
military bases around the world troops
all over the world US military spending
is almost as great as the rest of the
world combined technologically much more
advanced
and within that context of the past 70
years or so the United States has had
usually a pretty dominant role in world
affairs and setting the framework within
which others operate not without
conflict of course you talk about the
two major threats facing the world today
nuclear war and climate change talk
about each well I might start by
referring to the Doomsday Clock of The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists clock
that's since 1947 shortly after the
atomic bombing they established the
Doomsday Clock every year a panel of
specialists make an estimate of how
close we are to midnight midnight means
termination for the species it's moved
up and back over the years right now it
just last year it was moved to minutes
closer to midnight because of the two
threats that you mentioned stayed there
this year that's three minutes to
midnight closer that's closest it's been
since of the early 1980s when there was
a major war scare that was recognized
then to be serious now that Russian
archives have been opened we see that it
was far more serious than was assumed we
were at one point literally minutes away
several points in fact minutes away from
nuclear war that's where the Doomsday
Clock stands now the nuclear threat is
the threat of new on the on the Russian
border which happens to be the invasion
route through which Russia was virtually
destroyed twice last century by Germany
alone now on Germany as part of a
hostile military alliance
on the on that border both sides are
acting as if a war is thinkable the US
has just sharply increased quadrupled
the military expenses on its side the
Russians are doing something similar
there are constant near collisions Jets
coming close to colliding with one
another Russian jet a couple months ago
virtually hit a Danish commercial
airliner US troops are carrying out
maneuvers virtually on the Russian
border the net threat is escalating and
very serious William Perry this
respected nuclear specialist former
defense secretary recently estimated
that the threat is higher than it was
during the 1980s
there are also confrontations near the
Chinese around China South China Sea and
so on that's one major threat the other
is what you just described
the threat of global warming is very
serious
every time one reads a science journal
there's an even more alarming discovery
virtually all the ice masses are melting
the Arctic ice ice mass which was
assumed to be pretty stable is actually
melting very fast much more than was
thought the glaciers are melting there's
severe drought right now already about
300 million people in India are on the
edge of starvation from drought which
has been going on for years the
groundwater is depleted as the Himalayan
glaciers melt as they're doing it will
undermine the water supply for huge
areas in South Asia if people think
there's a migration crisis now they
haven't seen anything
the sea level is rising chances are it
could rise three to six feet maybe more
by the end of the century some estimate
even sooner devastating effect and not
just on coastal cities but on coastal
plains like say Bangladesh where
hundreds of millions of people be
severely threatened this is a we're
already killing other species at the
level of the so-called fifth extinction
65 million years ago when an asteroid
hit the earth devastating consequences
ended the age of the dinosaurs opened
the way for small mammals to develop
ultimately evolved finally evolved into
Homo sapiens which now is acting the
same way the asteroid did that's the
fifth extinctions going to get worse all
of these are at the rate of global
warming today is far faster maybe 100 or
more times as fast as any moderately
comparable period that can be estimated
in the geological record and this and to
make it worse of these two huge threats
we have a an electoral the quadrennial
electoral extravaganza is going on right
now of course and it's pretty remarkable
to see how the worst threats that the
human species has ever faced the most
important decisions it must make and
soon are virtually absent from the
discussions and debates on the
Democratic side there's a couple of
comments about it here and there not
much on the Republican side it's much
worse every single candidate either did
not denies global warming altogether or
in one
Kaycee admits that it's taking place but
says we shouldn't do anything about it
what even worse yeah 100%
no we're gonna go to a break when we
come back we'll play the last remaining
Republican in the race Donald Trump's
comment on climate change and also get
your take overall on the 2016
presidential election here in the United
States Noam Chomsky world-renowned
political dissident linguist author has
a new book out it's called who rules the
world stay with us
