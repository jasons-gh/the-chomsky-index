bail out if they get in trouble and the
private sector has a role make profits
and then turn to the public if you get
in the truck will you extend that to
health care well healthcare is a
dramatic case I mean for decades the
popular health care issue has been right
at the top of domestic concerns for very
good reasons the US has the most
dysfunctional health care system in the
industrial world has about twice the per
capita costs and some of the worst
outcomes it's also the only privatized
system and if you look closely those two
things are related I'm the privatized
system is highly inefficient a huge
amount of administration of bureaucracy
supervision you know all kinds of things
have been studied pretty carefully now
the public has had an opinion about this
for decades considerable majority want a
national health care system like other
industrial countries had they usually
say a canadian-style system not just
Canada's the best but at least you know
that Canada exists and nobody says an
australian style system which is much
better because who knows anything about
that but something like what sometimes
called Medicare plus like extend
Medicare to the population well up until
it's interesting up until the year 2000
for that idea was described for example
by the New York Times as politically
impossible and lacking political support
so maybe the public wants it but that's
not what counts as political support the
financial institutions are opposed the
pharmaceutical institutions are opposed
it's not no public of support well in
2008 for the first time the Democratic
candidates first Edwards than the others
they began to move in a direction of
what the public is wanted not there but
in that direction so what happened
between 2004 2008 well public opinion
didn't change it's been this way for
decades what changed is that
manufacturing industry big sector of the
economy has recognized that it's being
severely harmed by the highly
inefficient privatized health system
so general motors that have said that it
costs them over a thousand dollars more
to produce a car in Detroit then across
the border in Windsor Canada and you
know when manufacturing industry becomes
concerned then things become politically
possible and they begin to have
political support so yes in 2008 there's
some discussion of it now you know this
is a fair revealing insight into how
American democracy functions and what is
meant by the term political support than
politically possible again this should
be headlines well we'll a proposal come
that approaches what the public wants
well we're getting the backlash strong
backlash and what what private health
care systems are claiming is that this
is unfair the government is so much more
efficient that they'll be driven there's
no level playing field if the government
gets into it we have a public and a
private plan yes like Medicare for those
Medicare but if you wanted to go for
private plane you could yeah she could
but they're not they say well we can't
compete for good reasons I mean in every
country except an industrial country
except the United States the government
uses its massive purchasing power to
negotiate drug prices that's one of the
reasons prices are so much higher in the
United States than in other countries
well they could the Pentagon can use
purchasing power to negotiate prices for
you know paper clips or something but by
law the government is not permitted to
do that in the case of health care well
if you had Medicare plus they would and
that would drive down drug prices and
the private industries can't compete
fair fairness nickerson reporting did a
study of the week leading up to the
White House health care summit of the
networks and how they were covering a
single payor the issue of like Medicare
plus and I think they found that
absolutely that almost there was almost
no representation in the media of a
single payer advocate and you know
almost the only mention was someone
blasting single thing yeah that's
because it has no political support only
the majority of the public it's the same
as the media commentary in 2004
in fact it is take a look back at the
the end of the last election electoral
campaign Carrie Bush campaign in october
two thousand four right before the
election there was a debate on domestic
issues i think it was maybe october
twenty eighth or so just take a look
read the New York Times report of it the
next day it was very dramatic it said
Carrie never brought up the idea of any
government involvement in health care
not you know Medicare plus but any
government involvement because it is not
politically possible and lacks political
support just the population that what
studies show you the population wants
this there's been poll after poll so
what do you think is going to break
through what's it's a problem of the
general dysfunction of formal democracy
I mean there's a very substantial gap
between public opinion and public policy
on a host of major issues and on many of
these issues the both parties are well
to the right of the public international
and domestic incidentally that's one
reason why elections are run the way
they are elections are run as marketing
extravaganzas and that's not kept secret
so the advertising industry gives an
award every year for best marketing
campaign of the year for 2008 they gave
it to Obama he beat out I think Apple
computers and if you look at the
comments of financial of advertising
executives PR executives there were
euphoric in fact they said can read it
in the Financial Times business press
they said you know we've been marketing
candidates like commodities ever since
Reagan but this is the best we've ever
done it's going to change the atmosphere
in corporate boardrooms we have a new
style of selling things you know the
Obama style you know soaring rhetoric
hope of change and so on you know it's
true and if you look at the campaign's
themselves they're designed essentially
by the advertising industry to sell the
commodity
happens to be a candidate and they're
pretty carefully designed so that you
marginalize issues and you focus on what
are called qualities in Obama's case no
soaring rhetoric and so on in bushes
case nice guy like have a beer with them
and so on that's the kind of thing you
focus on where do they stand on issues
well public is mostly uninformed I've
seen current falls on 2008 but the 2004
election where the report Lee after
showed the public had almost no idea
what Bush's purposed and was in fact a
majority of Bush of voters thought that
he supported the kyoto protocol because
they support it and he's a nice guy so
he must support it an election is
designed that way and it makes good
sense I mean the people who run the
elections they read the polls very
carefully in fact in fact they mostly
design them for their own interest and
they know that the parties are to the
right of the public so you better on a
large number of issues including crucial
ones like you ran others so you better
keep issues off the table which is
what's done so what the health care is a
dramatic case of it but it's only one
instance on linguist Noam Chomsky
speaking to me in Boston last week we
will return to the last part of our
conversation after this break you can
get a copy of the full two parts by
