as we all know August six nineteen
forty-five opened a new era of human
history humans had demonstrated that
they have the intelligence to construct
the means to destroy life on earth that
opened a new question do they have the
intelligence to prevent themselves from
using the capacity that they had been
intelligent enough to develop and that
remains a very open question very much
alive shortly after that event The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
established their famous Doomsday Clock
this is gives a measure of how far we
are from catastrophe in the estimate of
eminent scientists it's never midnight
as the end it's never been very far from
midnight last January it moved two
minutes closer to midnight the three
minutes to midnight that's the closest
it's been in 30 years there was a
statement that accompanied the move
towards midnight it said there it
identified two threats nuclear weapons
and unchecked I'm quoting it unchecked
climate change the call condemned world
leaders who have failed to act with the
speed or on the scale required to
protect citizens from potential
catastrophe endangering every person on
earth by failing to perform their most
important duty ensuring and preserving
the health and vitality of human
civilization well on climate change
world leaders are
now meeting in Paris but it's not likely
that they will act with the speed and
the scale required to protect citizens
from potential catastrophe and even if
they do by some near miracle it's not
clear how much value that would be for
reasons that happened to line very close
to home so in all of the huge media
coverage of these Paris events perhaps
the most important sentences are these
two buried near the end of a long New
York Times analysis I'll read it
traditionally negotiators have sought to
forge a legally binding treaty that
needed ratification by the governments
of the participating countries to have
force there is no way to get that in
this case because of the United States a
treaty would be dead on arrival on
capitol hill without the required
two-thirds majority vote in the
republican-controlled senate so the
voluntary plans are taking the place of
mandatory top-down targets and voluntary
plans of course are a guarantee of
failure this is notice the New York
Times quite conservative newspaper
emphasizing the phrase because of the
United States more precisely because of
the Republican Party I which is by now a
real danger to decent human survival the
it's the Republican primaries may be a
good way to elicit some laughs as comedy
shows but the fact is it's not funny
it's not happening in and Laura both
parties
moved well to the right in the past
generation the neoliberal period
mainstream Democrats are now what used
to be called moderate Republicans
somebody like eisenhower would be way at
the left end of the spectrum today in
fact his views in many respects are not
different from Bernie Sanders meanwhile
the Republicans have just drifted off
the spectrum they're not a political
party in a traditional sense and this
has recognized the two scholars of
leading political analysts of the
American Enterprise Institute Thomas
Mann Norman Ornstein that recently
described the Republican Party or former
Republican Party as a radical insurgency
which has abandoned any concern for
participation in parliamentary politics
that's something not entirely new in
Western history but we think back to the
predecessors it's not very encouraging
the meanwhile immediately after Obama
spoke in Paris pledging that the United
States would be in the vanguard of
global action the republican-dominated
Congress voted to scuttle EPA rules to
cut carbon emissions here's the new york
times a provocative message to more than
a hundred world leaders in Paris that
the American president does not have the
full support of his government on
climate policy which is a bit of an
understatement and it's also unique to
the United States again that's critical
meanwhile Lamar Smith who's the
Republican head of the House Committee
on science
technology is carrying forward his jihad
to get to get scientists who dare to
report the facts to back off from this
from this heresy which all shows that
there is an enormous responsibility
right here in many ways that's a good
message means we can do something about
it nobody else can well there are
companion stories in the New York Times
which report on quote again that
two-thirds of Americans support the
United States joining a binding
international agreement to curb growth
of greenhouse gas emissions and by a
ratio of five to three they regard
climate issues as more important than
the economy but notice that that doesn't
matter the US will still block any
effort to move in this direction which
is again a pretty strong message to us
tells us something about our
responsibilities illustrates the extent
to which the fate of the world is
actually in our hands dramatically so
and not least because of error by now
almost click completely dysfunctional
political system barely resembles a
functioning democracy a system in which
popular opinion is a marginal factor
there are other reports on the Paris
talks that discuss the possibility
what's called a global carbon budget
limit on the total amount of carbon that
can be produced from Lee as a result of
a treaty to eliminate the limit
emissions
if you look at these sort of pie who
would who would produce a lunch it turns
out that the West and China it would
produce what they would consume the pie
they produce all of ever everything but
even that is described as politically
impossible can't be accepted in the
united states that's a very interesting
notion is it politically impossible
because of public opposition obviously
not polls indicate the opposite this is
a familiar concept and recent US
political discourse actually showed up
at the time when a couple years ago when
there was debate about a public doing
something with the scandalous health
system international scandal twice the
per capita costs of other countries
relatively poor outcomes highly
bureaucratized and efficient and there
have been concerns about doing something
about it actually the public has had
opinions on this for years the public
has been pretty strongly in favor of
some form of national health care in
fact not long ago polls are showed that
about a quarter of the public thought
that it ought to be a constitutional
guarantee actually majority of the
public thought it ought to be a
constitutional guarantee and about a
quarter of the public photo or it was in
the pub the Constitution because it's
just an obvious desideratum does it
matter no it doesn't if you look at the
political commentary on it when these
facts are discussed it's described as
politically impossible you cannot
institute what the majority the public
want a because of the preponderant
influence of
pharmaceutical corporations insurance
companies financial institutions that
determines what's politically possible
that when Obama put in his own proposals
you recall there was what was called a
public option you could opt for a
national health to participate in say
Medicare national health care it was
favored by about five to three but it
wasn't even discussed it was simply
dropped because it's assumed across the
political system that large majority of
the population is irrelevant it's
politically impossible the same with
climate change what is politically
impossible in fact is up to us and there
are another indication that there are
huge tasks ahead for those of us who
care about the fate of the species
fatagar own grandchildren well let's put
climate change aside and turn to nuclear
weapons a danger that is very much
underestimated actually it's we've lived
with it for 70 years and the fact that
we're here to talk about it is pretty
much a miracle if you look closely at
the record it is hair-raising the I
mentioned that the Doomsday Clock had
moved three minute to two minutes
forward up towards midnight reaching the
point where it was 30 years ago what was
happening 30 years ago 30 years ago the
Reagan administration was carrying out
highly provocative operations it was
simulating attacks on Russia air and
naval and ground attacks to try to
elicit information about Russian
defenses operation able Archer it was
called this was a very tense moment
pershing two missiles were being
installed in Western Europe they had
maybe a
flight-time to Moscow Reagan was
initiating the so called Star Wars
program which strategic analysts on all
sides understand to be a first strike
weapon and even if it might work who
knows but if it worked it would be a
would eliminate the deterrent and
therefore be a first strike weapon right
in the middle of that the able Archer
operations begin here's the way they are
described by Mel Goodman who was at the
time the CIA division chief and the
senior analyst at the office of Soviet
affairs he says in addition to the able
Archer the mobilization exercises which
I just described the exercises that
deeply alarmed the Kremlin the Reagan
administration authorized unusually
aggressive military exercises near the
Soviet border that in some cases
violated Soviet territorial sovereignty
the Pentagon's risky measures included
sending us strategic bombers over the
North Pole to test Soviet radar and
naval exercises in wartime approaches to
the USSR where US warships had
previously not entered additional secret
operations simulated surprise naval
attacks on Soviet targets and button and
warns that that situation is recurring
today with potential confrontations and
the rising tensions at the time it was
known that the Russians were concerned
now that Russian archives have come out
it becomes clear that they were deeply
concerned contemporary US intelligence
reports analyzing that period said
conclude quoting that the war scare was
real it was close three minutes to
midnight
was no joke could have been closer that
right in the middle of all of this the
Russian automated response systems
detected a US missile strike thought i
should say happens all the time but they
detected a strike there's a protocol
there's a human beings name happened to
me Stanislav Petrov who was supposed to
take the information and transmitted to
the High Command which then decides or
not to launch a retaliatory strike
Stanislav Petrov decided not to transmit
the information that's why we're here
literally and it's not the only time
that was 30 years ago now we're back
there let me give a couple of other
examples together the flavor of this
because it's happening all the time and
it was just reported a couple of weeks
ago that in 1979 the u.s. automated
systems detected a Russian missile
strike again goes to the national
security advisors big note Brzezinski
he's supposed to decide whether to call
the President and launch a strike he was
about a minute away from calling
President Carter to auth tell him to
authorize a strike which it certainly
would destroy so
ization and when news came in that it
was an error one of thousands of errors
so we were spared that one that Bruce
Blair who's a nuclear security that
specialist just revealed that that he
describes a couple of other cases he
says that in 1967 an aircraft carrier a
new with nuclear aircraft was sent an
actual attack order an actual attack
border saying go often below the world
of this was my mistake it was supposed
to be an exercise training nuclear order
again kind of thing that happens all the
time in the early 70s again Blair the
Strategic Air Command transmitted an
exercise launch order as an actual real
word world launch murder quoting Blair
again incidentally it has been known for
30 years that in a if a major nuclear
power were to carry out a first strike
that power itself would be destroyed
even with no retaliation simply because
of the effects of nuclear winter so a
first strike is suicide that's been
known for at least 30 years first Blair
made the comments I just quoted in
response to an interesting report that
was just cleared a couple of weeks ago
by the US Air Force it was a report by a
guy named John gordonii he's an air man
who served on the US military base in
Okinawa in 1962 at the time of the Cuban
Missile Crisis Cuban Missile Crisis been
to
pretty accurately as the most dangerous
moment in human history that's Arthur
Schlesinger Kennedy advisor historian at
that time the US nuclear alert had risen
to the second highest level what's
called DEFCON 2 if it goes up to DEFCON
1 you shoot the bombs but it was a
DEFCON 2 at that time this guy is at a
military base in Okinawa returned later
to what it was doing there this is the
peak of the he he at the peak of the
crisis this is October 28th his the
missile crews including his received
authorization to launch nuclear missiles
that would be at China at a very tense
period i might say china and india were
at war at the time well they decided not
to that's our petrov that time it
happens very frequently there's an
expert study that just came out
reviewing about three years of detection
by automated systems warning of a
nuclear attack they found dozens every
year they might go up to hundreds every
year and we don't have the last couple
of years but there's no reason to
believe it's any better it's not only
the u.s. systems are the most
sophisticated by far the u.s. radar
covers the world Russian radar and other
countries is the line of sight they
don't have much information also their
and their systems are surely not as
sophisticated as ours we have the
details from us systems which are
absolutely horrifying that you can
imagine what it's like elsewhere
especially in places like say Pakistan
where they have a huge nuclear weapon
system
but as Pakistani nuclear scientists
point out the system is the they have
20,000 soldiers to try to protect the
nuclear weapon system from jihadi
elements but the trouble is that those
military units are have infiltrated
constantly by jihadi elements we don't
know how far they are from having their
hands on a on the nuclear trigger again
we can thank Ronald Reagan in particular
for this he helped Pakistan develop its
nuclear weapon system pretending they
didn't know about it during the period
when Pakistan was being radically
Islamize by Sunni money Bob ization us
support that goes on like that well
that's there's a pretty good book by
Eric Schlosser American analyst who
reviews many of these cases but not none
of the ones i just described and that
the whole story is just literally
hair-raising and again the russian story
is no doubt worse well often these I've
just been describing accident but often
it's a matter of just straight
adventurism like able Archer asking for
trouble the worst case of course was
nineteen sixty-two when Hearst Jeff
placed missiles and Cuba most dangerous
moment in world history and it was an
extremely dangerous and adventurous move
we therefore would like to know why he
did it and it's worth thinking about it
there's no very careful scholarship on
this on
American side primarily looking at the
detailed record which we have available
and the conclusions are very straight
forward it's so why did he do it well
there were basically two reasons the one
was the military balance in the late
1950s the first chef recognized that
Russia was could not possibly compete
with the United States in military force
if it hoped to develop back much far far
less developed country of course so he
offered to cut back offensive military
forces on both sides he called for sharp
cut back on military forces the US
didn't respond but he implemented the
cut back anyway the Kennedy
administration considered this
recognized it and did decide to respond
namely by sharply escalating the US
military budget the US was already way
more advanced than the Russians and
quantity technology missiles everything
else but the biggest arms boost in
history came along and response to first
Jeff's offered to reduce offensive
military forces well that led to a real
military imbalance and that was
apparently one of the reasons why Chris
Jeff made this extremely dangerous move
to put missiles in Cuba there was a
second reason the Kennedy administration
was carrying out a major terrorist war
against Cuba the goal of the war was to
bring the terrors of the earth to Cuba
that's the phrase used by Arthur
Schlesinger again Kennedy's advisor
describing the program it was run by
Robert Kennedy took it as
is priority there was no joke when you
look at the record it's pretty shocking
this program operation Mongoose it was
called was it was designed to lead to a
US invasion of Cuba in October 1962 that
it's very likely that the Russians and
the Cubans who would bit about this that
was the second reason for placing the
missiles in Cuba our adventurers move
but not without some reasons for which
we share a good bit of responsibility
well all of this came to a peak and late
October many of you may recall on
october 26th we don't know the kennedy
was about inclined thinking seriously of
invading cuba the US did not know at the
time that Cuba had tactical nuclear
weapons there and that many more forces
than was expected so an invasion
probably would lead to a nuclear war
that day a message came from first Jeff
offering to settle the crisis how by a
joint agreement to publicly eliminate
Cuban vessels in Russian missiles in
Cuba and us missiles and turkey the US
had had offensive missiles aimed at
Russia and Turkey and in fact almost
everywhere Kennedy was surprised these
it was he didn't even know there were
missiles in Turkey these were obsolete
missiles which were at that time being
withdrawn because they were being
replaced with much more lethal
essentially invulnerable allow our
submarines so here was the offer will
withdraw the missiles from Cuba you
withdraw obsolete missiles which are
withdrawing anyway
you're replacing them with even more
lethal missiles the Kennedy refused
literally his own subjective probability
at the time was that there was a
probability of a third to a half of
nuclear war but wouldn't do it did
something secretly but wouldn't do it
publicly that's the kind of decision
that our leaders make and the most
frightening part of this is that in you
look at Western commentary Kennedy is
praised for his cool courage you know
judiciousness and so on and so forth
there's actually a kind of a reason for
that a lot of the evidence about this
comes from meetings of what was called
the excom committee there was a secret
committee set up which was debating all
of this through October and we have the
minutes the minutes are available they
were released and if you look at those
minutes Kennedy does come out as looking
kind of more balanced and saying than
some of the others which is not saying
much I should say but there's a small
footnote that's rarely mentioned Kennedy
was the only person who knew it was
being taped nobody else knew so he was
told him for history can draw your own
conclusions but even what history tells
us is pretty horrifying the US was very
close to war at the time I should
mention that right in the middle of this
there was another Petrov incident
Kennedy had established and him bought a
quarantine around Cuba and there were
Russian submarines there with
nuclear-tipped missiles and they were
being attacked with depth charges by us
destroyers and the submarine commanders
with their little
contact with the outside world assume
that a war had started also they were
ready to launch their missiles it took a
decision by three submarine commanders
to launch the missiles to decided to
launch a third decided not to fossil the
Aqua puff that's why we're here again
these things are happening constantly
the at going back to Okinawa six months
before the Cuban Missile Crisis a
Kennedy had sent advanced missiles
nuclear missiles to Okinawa US base
they're threatening China again at least
as serious as Russian missiles in Cuba
and nowhere near as serious as us
missiles in Turkey or the more lethal
ones elsewhere but that's the way the
world works the Russians have thankfully
back down time after time and how long
that can continue we don't know it's a
miracle literally a miracle that we
survived the with this as a background
that's useful to think about what
official US military planning is
remember it's known and been known for a
long time that a first strike destroys
the attacking power no question was
retaliation that's been known for at
least 30 years so take a look at the we
don't have the whole Declassified record
but we have some of it here's some in
1995 the strat comm Strategic Command
which is in charge of nuclear weapons
strategy did publish a study which was
partially released partially declare
declassified it's called it's very much
worth reading it's called essentials of
post Cold War deterrence
remember this is five years after the
Soviet Union collapsed we're now talking
about what do we do in the post-cold war
period conclusion I'll read it first the
US must maintain the right of first
strike even against non-nuclear States
we can't abandon that right furthermore
nuclear weapons must always be available
on quoting because they cast a shadow
over any crisis or conflict meaning
they're constantly used all the time
just as if you and I go into a store and
intending to rob it and I have a gun but
I don't shoot it we're still using the
gun at the point that the Dan Ellsberg
has repeatedly made so here's the
official doctrine yes we have to use
them constantly because they cast a
shadow over any crisis or conflict it
goes on it hurts to portray ourselves as
to fully rational and cool-headed that
the United States may become a rational
and vindictive if it's vital interests
are attacked should be part of the
national persona we project it's
beneficial to our strategic posture if
some elements may appear to be
potentially out of control opposing a
constant threat of nuclear attack that
way the world is intimidated and we can
do what we want the world doesn't read
these documents but people basically
know it there are international polls
run by US agencies Gallup asking among
other questions which country is the
greatest threat to world peace the US is
first by
huge margin nobody else is even close we
are protected from information like that
the Free Press refuses to publish it but
it's easy to find you can look up gallup
polls and this worth worth knowing
what's current doctor right now well
it's just to take a look at the MIT
journal international security it's the
major one of the major scholarly
journals on these issues current issue
it says the youth lead article talks
about the US and China says the u.s. is
committed to what's called strategic
primacy a strategic primacy means
immunity from any retaliatory strike so
not just you can deter others but you
can carry out a first strike and you're
immune to retaliation that's strategic
primacy that's us doctrine Obama goes on
as expanding developing a new triad the
triad means the three prongs of the
nuclear attack system land sea and air
so those are being expanded the missile
defense is expanding everyone
understands that to be a first strike
weapon and there is a concern the
articles about the concern China might
react so far China hasn't done anything
they have a reject first strike they've
rejected that doctrine they don't have
many missiles but with all of this
happening and they can figure it out
they might react well the two scholars
who write the article think they're
probably not going to react so maybe
we're lucky the but it clearly increases
the danger the same is happening around
Russia this goes back to immediately
after at the moment when the Soviet
Union collapsed there was discussion
between a Gorbachev and at that time
President Bush number one James Baker is
Secretary of State about how to deal
with it Gorbachev made an actual
remarkable concession he agreed to allow
a unified Germany to join NATO a hostile
military alliance you look back at the
history of the 20th century and you can
see what that means a Germany alone had
practically destroyed Russia several
times but he was saying okay a unified
Germany can join a hostile military
alliance with one condition that NATO
not moved to East Germany the phrase was
not one inch to the east he got a verbal
agreement that NATO wouldn't move one
inch to the east but NATO immediately
moved to East Germany on when there were
complaints Washington pointed out it was
not it was only a verbal agreement
implying if you're naive enough to
accept the gentleman's agreement with
the United States it's your problem so
NATO moved to East Germany Clinton moved
it further recession borders it's
continuing now the threat is and it's a
serious threat to incorporate Ukraine in
NATO
it's right at the core of Russian
geostrategic interests with long
historical reasons well one can imagine
how the US would react if the Warsaw
Pact were still alive and Latin America
home stole all of Latin America joined
the Warsaw Pact and now there were moves
to incorporate Mexico and Canada into
the Warsaw Pact how would we respond we
don't have to raise that question the
first step long before would have blown
up the world obviously but that's the
that's what our adversaries face it's
not they're nice people it can be
horrible people but you have to
understand how they can react to a
geostrategic situation that is of the
kind that I just described and is
familiar to everyone who pays attention
under Russians understand as well as
China that the u.s. is seeking strategic
primacy that the expansion of the
military system the actions near the
Russian border the missile defense or
serious threat to them the and they
react they react with dangerous actions
very dangerous and then NATO has to
react to defend its native territories
against potential Russian aggressiveness
there's one prominent the leading in
fact British scholar of Ukraine who
points out describes what he calls a
fateful geographical paradox NATO exists
today to manage the risks created by its
existence that's
it is pretty accurate if you look at and
the threats are very serious right now
you read a couple weeks about the
Russian plane military jet shot down
allegedly over Turkish territory take a
look at the map that is a piece of
Turkey that protrudes deeply into Syria
where the plane was bombing bombing
jihadi forces it passed through it
according to Turkish reports had passed
through a little corner of this
territory on a bombing mission for 17
seconds for a jet plane that's like that
passed through a corner of the territory
sticking out winded turkey was shot down
it was plainly aiming toward Syria
that's where it crashed when it landed
that's again I'm pretty provocative act
a few months ago the there orbited by
now there are stepped up military
maneuvers all right along the NATO the
Russian border so here's quoting The
Washington Post the US military combat
vehicles paraded through an Estonian
city the judson to Russia a symbolic act
that highlighted the stakes for both
sides amid the worst tensions between
west and Russia the western Russia since
the Cold War shortly before that a
Russian warplane had come within seconds
of hitting a Danish commercial airliner
the the major US military journal arms
control today reports that quoting it
both current issue November both sides
are practicing rapid mobilization
and redeployment of forces to the
Russian 80 border both sides believe a
war is no longer unthinkable if that's
true both sides are clinically insane
again it's been known for decades that a
first strike will destroy the attacking
country if that doesn't mean a war is
unthinkable words don't have meaning and
that's the current discussion and it's
not just today that's what we've been
living through for 70 years and the the
reasoning throughout is remarkable at
the end by just giving one illustration
of how high level reasoning works we get
this from the Declassified record but
not only is it striking in itself in my
view it's pretty striking that it's
never discussed at least you make your
own decisions to me and it's horrifying
this is a we go but this goes back to
the early post-war period the period
when the Doomsday Clock was established
at that time the United States had
overwhelming security and nothing like
it in history the US had literally half
the wealth of the world you the the US
economy had boomed during the Second
World War other industrial societies
were devastated or destroyed the u.s.
controlled the entire hemisphere
controlled both oceans controlled the
opposite sides of both oceans no
security threat anywhere but there was a
potential security threat it was
understood that sooner or later there
would be development of intercontinental
ballistic missiles ICBMs with Jupiter
hydrogen bomb warheads and that would be
a severe threat to the United States in
fact the threat of instant destruction
so what was the reaction actually we
know about this from the scholarly
histories of this period the main one
was written by McGeorge Bundy who was a
national security advisor for Kennedy
and Kennedy and Johnson head of the Ford
Foundation so on and so forth and he had
access to a high-level classified
material and here's what he writes he
says that developing ICBMs with nuclear
weapons was one of the best achievements
of the Eisenhower years yet it is well
to begin with a recognition that both
the United States and the Soviet Union
might be in much less nuclear danger
today if these missiles had never been
developed and then comes an instructive
comment I am aware of no serious
contemporary proposal at that time in or
out of either government that ballistic
missiles should somehow be banned by
agreement in short apparently nobody
thought of the possibility that maybe we
can proceed to ban the only threat to
our security which in fact is a lethal
threat on which they knew was coming he
couldn't find any comment on this in the
government literature you know drafts by
lower level officials anywhere what that
means is that security of the population
is of zero concern to planners literally
incidentally there are good reasons to
think that a treaty agreement with the
Russians could have been reached at that
time there's
no time to go into it but it's now
pretty clear well that's the way it goes
on these are illustrations of top-level
thinking and of the actions that are
taking place the and it happens to be
that that's the world we're living in
today both on the climate change issue
where we're standing in the way of
possible agreement that might save us
from real catastrophe not far away and
on the nuclear issue where we're playing
with fire at every minute the prospects
for long-term survival are not very high
as long as this persists unless there's
a significant change of course and a
large part of the responsibility is
right here and the opportunities as well
