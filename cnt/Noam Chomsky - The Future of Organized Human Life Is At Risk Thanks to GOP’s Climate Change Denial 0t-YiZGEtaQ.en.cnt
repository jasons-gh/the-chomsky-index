no we want to turn to an issue that you
have written about that so many are so
deeply concerned about that hardly gets
any play in this country even in this
critical midterm election it's the issue
of climate change Noam Chomsky a new
study has found that the world has
massively underestimated the amount of
heat absorbed by our oceans the paper
published in the journal Nature has
concluded that for the past quarter of a
century about a hundred fifty times the
amount of energy used to generate
electricity globally has been deposited
into the seas 60% more than previous
estimates this comes days after leading
meteorologist Eric Holt House issued a
dire warning following Jay Abelson
otto's election win in Brazil he tweeted
quote this is worth repeating over and
over the most horrific thing Brazil's
new president jarba scenario has planned
is privatization of the Amazon
rainforest with just 12 years remaining
to Romaic the global economy and prevent
catastrophic climate change
this is planetary suicide he wrote
meanwhile in a report issued earlier
this week the World Wildlife Fund found
that human beings have wiped out 60% of
all mammals birds fish and reptiles on
earth since 1970 this is WWF executive
director of science and conservation
Mike Barrett what's absolutely clear at
the moment looking at the declines of
nature that we recovered is saying is
that the planet does need to be put on
life support and frankly the solutions
for coming up with a moment and merely
sticking glasses so this is now at the
point where as people we've got to take
a choice are we going to let this
continue
so that's Mike Baron of the World
Wildlife Fund
gnome you are deeply concerned about
this issue and of course you're not
alone climate change the issue of
climate change we can add the list of
your dire warnings
were horrendous enough a few more
examples a couple of weeks ago the IPCC
the international group of scientists
monitoring climate change came out with
a very ominous report warning that the
world has maybe a decade or two to
basically end its reliance on fossil
fuels if we're to have any hope of
controlling a global warming below the
level of utter disaster
and that incidentally is a conservative
estimate
it's a consensus view there are
repeatedly over the years it has been
shown that the IPCC analyses are much
less alarmist than they should be now
comes this report in nature that you
mentioned a couple of days ago which
shows that there has been a serious
underestimate of the of the warming of
the oceans and they conclude that if
these results hold up the so-called
carbon budget the amount of carbon that
we can spew into the atmosphere and
still have a survivable environment has
to be reduced by about 25 percent that's
over and above the IPCC report and the
opening up of the Amazon to further
exploitation will be another serious
blow at the prospects of survival of
organized human society I should at the
same time the Trump administration right
now is opening up new areas of the West
for fracking for increasing the use of
fossil fuels the
macine maybe discuss the one of the most
amazing documents I have ever seen the
Trump of Department of highway the
standards whatever it's called just
issued long report hundred page report
urging that all regulations on
automotive emissions should be ended and
they had a very logical argument they
said if we extrapolate current trends by
the end of the century of the climate
will have warmed several degrees
centigrade meaning a huge rise in sea
level which they underestimate so
basically we're going over the cliff
anyway and automotive emissions don't
really add much to this so there's no
point cutting them back the assumption
of the the department is that everyone
in the world is as criminally insane as
we are and isn't going to do anything
about it
and since on that assumption yeah let's
let's just Rob while the planet firms
putting a euro into the shade he only
fiddled while Rome burned I can't think
of anything like this in human history
you just can't find words to describe it
and it's a minute the peak of the
monstrosity is in fact the Trump
administration we should recall that
Trump himself as I mentioned is a firm
believer in global warming
recently he applied to the government of
Ireland for permission to build a huge
wall one of his famous walls this one to
protect a golf course of his in Ireland
which has his plea in the case is
threatened by sea level rise as a result
of global warming you take a look at the
banks JPMorgan Chase and the others
they're increasing their investments in
fossil fuel development the energy
corporations are working all over the
world to try to find new resources that
destroy the environment the media are
focusing on a real outrage is like the
ludicrous military preparation for this
wave of mothers and children planning to
invade us and destroy us you know
they're concentrating on that but take a
look at their coverage of these things
so there was a big report long frontpage
report in The New York Times a couple of
days ago about the opening up of the
West to further fossil fuel extraction
discuss everything you can think of
didn't mention some of the negative
consequences like it might harm water
resources it might make things on armor
harder for Ranchers
not one phrase one phrase in this long
report on the effect on the environment
in the political campaign at going on
every all kinds of issues are not
discussed but not the two existential
threats that the human beings face
threats that have never arisen in human
history that we have to make decisions
now which will literally determine
whether organized human life can survive
in any decent form you can just imagine
what the world would be like if the sea
level rises a 10 or 20 feet or even
higher is within the range easily within
the range of predictions I mean the
consequences are unimaginable but it's
as if we're a kind of like the
proverbial lemmings just happily
marching off the cliff
led by leaders who
understand very well what they're doing
but are so dedicated to enriching
themselves and their friends in the near
future
that it simply doesn't matter what
happens to the human species there's
nothing like this in all of human
history
they've been plenty of monsters in the
past plenty of but you can't find one
who was dedicated with passion to
destroying the prospects for organized
human life
Hitler was horrible enough but not that
renowned linguist dissident author Noam
Chomsky you can visit our website for
port one of the interview where Chomsky
talks about u.s. foreign policy in Latin
America the migrant caravan the crisis
in Gaza and the white supremacist attack
