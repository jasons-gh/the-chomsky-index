special Israel is a state exclusively
for Jews that's the essence of the
controversial nation state bill passed
by the Knesset on Thursday after hours
of heated debate the measure became law
by a vote of 60 to 255 with two
abstentions
for years the language of the bill
divided political opinion between the
ruling parties and the opposition Arab
members of the Knesset say the law
legalizes discrimination this is a bill
from a government that is an enemy to
Palestinians it's the most dangerous
measure it's a law from a racist
government against Palestinian rights
and it creates an apartheid regime
it turns Israel into a fascist state why
is dangerous recognizing country as a
Muslim state or Buddhist state or a
Jewish state or a Christian state why
why is that dangerous why should people
if you believe in democracy states their
states of their citizens not of some
privileged sector of the citizens so if
the United States were called a white
state that would be outrageous similarly
so called the Christian State
similarly if Pakistan is
that's sane or of Israel's fault Jewish
state that's saying that our society
recognizes two categories of citizens a
privileged category and the others and
that while it's the most elementary
principles of democratic freedom we
thought I should say if these
designations are just symbolic maybe it
doesn't matter so for example in the
United States if the official day of
rest is Sunday instead of Thursday okay
no big deal
okay with revell conflicts and
separatist complex being waged in
various parts of the globe do
