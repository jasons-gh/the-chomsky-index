hi just want to thank you Ray ever
having professor Chomsky on it been a
big fan of his work for many years now I
have a question about the field of
mimetics I'm not sure if you're familiar
with it I assume you are professor Reed
not well it's it was in the term term
meme was coined by Richard Dawkins
Selfish Gene yeah I do know in which we
talk about you know evolution of the
competition among genes for places on
the DNA chain right and mimetics is a
way of looking at the evolution of ideas
in that same way ideas called means
they're the parallel to gene come
compete for spaces in our attention in a
sense and I think it complements your
work very well and what you call
intellectual self defense looking at how
we know what we know why we think what
we think you know the context in which
things are given to us and our
perceptions that are kind of handed down
from parents from peers etc well Dawkins
is an important scientist and his notion
of memes is it was intended as a
metaphor and metaphors are useful
insofar as they make you think in an
innovative and constructive way if you
find those metaphors useful great
personally I don't but it there's no
real right or wrong about it on
intellectual self-defense I think that's
an extremely important concept and I
would like to stress again that
individually it's virtually impossible
except for very rare and usually pretty
privileged people it's entirely possible
when people get together with solidarity
and sympathy and cooperation and
organization intellectual self defence
can can achieve a very high level
