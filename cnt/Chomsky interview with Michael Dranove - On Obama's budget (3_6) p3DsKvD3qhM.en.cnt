Obama has said it's going to have had of
the budget if you think it's a little
reminiscent of Clinton right before he
decided to institute welfare reform
basically destroying a lot of half of
the welfare system in this country think
Obama's going to take the same course
there's nothing much in his budget to
suggest otherwise I mean for example
there's he didn't really say much about
it you know about the welfare system but
he he did indicate that they're gonna
have to reconsider Social Security for
example well you know there's nothing
much about Social Security that meets
reconsideration it's in pretty good
financial shape probably as good as it's
been in its history it's pretty well
guaranteed for decades in advance if
they're ever it as long as any of the
famous baby baby boomers are around
social security will be completely
adequate so it's not for them contrary
to what's being said if there is a
long-term problem which there probably
is there are minor adjustments that
could take care of things so why bring
up Social Security at all if it's an
issue at all it's a very minor one I
suspect the reason for bringing it up is
that Social Security is regarded as a
real threat by power centers not because
of what it does you know it's very
efficient little administrative costs
but for two reasons that one reason is
that it helps the wrong people it helps
mostly poor people and disabled people
and so on so that's already wrong even
though it's as regressive tags but I
think a deeper reason is that Social
Security is based on an idea that power
centers find extremely threatening
namely solidarity concern for others
community and so on the fundamental idea
of Social Security is that we care about
whether say the disabled Widow across
town as food thee and that kind of idea
has to driven out of people's heads if
people have a commitment to solidarity
mutual aid support and so on that's
dangerous because that can lead to
concern for other things like they take
it's well known for example that markets
just don't provide lots of options and
options which today are crucial options
so for example the market system permits
you to decide whether to buy one brand
of car or another but the market doesn't
permit you to decide I don't want a car
I want a public transportation system
that's just not a choice made available
on the market and the same is true of a
wide range of other matters of social
significance like whether to help the
disabled widow across town ok that's
what social that's what communities
decide that's what democracy is about
that's what social solidarity is about
mutual aid and building institutions by
people for the benefit of people and all
of that threatens you know the system of
domination control reddit its heart so
there's a constant attack on social
security
the pretext sir worth paying attention
to and there are other questions in the
budget so for example this is slight I
mean the budget is called redistributed
I mean very marginally it is so but the
way it's redistributed to the extent
that it is is by slightly reducing the
slightly increasing the tax
responsibility extremely wealthy you
know a couple of percent you know and
it's the increases very marginal but
getting word near back to what it was
during the periods of high growth rate
and so on but you know that's so that is
slightly redistributed but there are
other ways to be redistributed which are
more effective for example allowing
workers to unionize that would it's
well-known that where workers are
allowed to unionize and most of them
wanted that does lead to better wages
better working conditions better
benefits and so on which is distributive
it also helps turn working people into
more of a political force instead of
being atomized and separated they're
together they can work together in
principle and not the unions function so
wonderfully but at least it's a move in
that direction and there is a potential
legislation on the table that would help
unionize the employer cream employee
free choice a which Obama has said he's
in favor of but it does nothing about it
in the budget in fact there's nothing in
the budget at all as far as I know about
improving opportunities to unionize
which is a effective redistributed
goal there are the questions too there's
a debate right now have the happens to
be in this morning's papers looking at
about whether Obama's being accused even
by Democrats in fact particularly find
them aggressive taking on too much
really I just take it on very much
because the stimulus package anybody we
try to work out maybe with one variation
or another and the same with the
bailouts which you can like or not but
some prison was going to do it but what
is claimed is that he's adding on to it
health care reform which will be very
expensive you know there are hundreds of
days of dollars and it's just not the
time to do that I mean why would health
care reform be more expensive what
defense which options you think if the
health care reforms maintain the
privatized system yeah it's going to be
very expensive because it's a hopelessly
inefficient system very costly its
incident Minister the costs are far
beyond Medicare the you know the
government system so what that means is
well he's going to maintain a system
which we know is inefficient expensive
has poor outcomes but it's very is a
great benefit to insurance companies
financial institutions and you know
pharmaceutical industry and so on so
yeah it's expensive it doesn't have to
be I mean it could save money it could
be a method of a health care reform can
be a method of divert deficit reduction
namely by moving to an efficient system
but for the murderer provides health
care everyone but that's although that's
talked about you know it's
partially one of the options it's on the
margins and the main advocates of it are
not even included in the the groups that
are discussing and if you look through
it case after case there are a lot of
questions like that I mean it takes take
unionization again this isn't a budget
but take an example Obama a couple of
months ago or weeks ago wanted to make a
gesture to show his solidarity with the
labor movement with workers it's
different with workers not with electric
and he went to visit a industrial plant
in Illinois the plant that he chose was
Kara pillar now there was some protest
over that by human rights groups and the
church groups and others because of
caterpillars a really brutal role in
destroying what's left of Palestine it's
these are real weapons of mass
destruction these things either used
that so there were purpose but he went
anyway however there's a deeper issue
which never even was raised which is
interesting and probably has been
forgotten which is an interesting
comment on the nature of our ideological
indoctrination on caterpillar was the
first industrial organization to resort
to scab strikebreakers to break a major
strike that was in the 1980s it was
Reagan had already open the doors with
the air-controllers but this is the
first manufacturing industry to do it
that hadn't been done in generations and
in fact it was illegal in every
industrial country except apartheid
South Africa
but that was caterpillars achievement
tell him to destroy the Union by calling
in scouts and if he caught scabs and
forget about strike zombies or any labor
action well that's the plant that Obama
went to visit not as possibly didn't
know because the level of indoctrination
in our society is so profound that most
people would even know that still I
think it's instructive if you're
interested in being doing something
redistributed you don't go to a plant
that made labor history by breaking the
principle that you can't break strikes
with with scabs
