and mother question then is for example
you Gaza the settlers have left and the
idea of left so then they screwed up but
no I know but this could happen to West
Bank is right and we we know that
Israelis tio people gather so what do
you do want the idea is left is like a
charger in Gaza Israel staged a totally
fraudulent national trauma for the
benefit of the goyim let's make it look
as if there's a national trauma so we
can then shout never again you know
Holocaust and so on they left for very
sensible reasons cherono is not an idiot
understood that there's no point now
that gas has been destroyed essentially
there's no point keeping 8,000 settlers
they're protected by half the IDF and
taking most of the resources land let's
get them out we don't want that and put
him in the West Bank which we care about
and if he'd wanted if he hadn't but and
let's do it in such a way that the
outside world will think we're suffering
and we're giving something up so let's
have the IDF take kids by force out of
the settlements so you can have a front
page picture in the newspaper about the
little boy pleading with the soldiers
not to destroy my home and so on all
show for the glam you know and and then
we'll be able to say never again so we
can hang on to the west bank what they
could have easily done is exactly what I
just described announced it on august
first two weeks before the withdrawal
announced the IDF is leaving Gaza okay
at that point the 8000 settlers would
have piled into the lorries provided
through them moved over to the west bank
to subsidize homes there no national
trauma in fact was so transparent which
is ridiculed by Israeli commentators
like bark Kimberly further what made it
even more ridiculous is it was a replay
point by point replay of what Israel did
in nineteen eighty-two in 1982
they were compelled to accept an offer
from sadat which in fact was from 1971
which made him withdraw from the Sinai
they staged the same kind of trauma in
fact it was so transparent then I
remember a headline I think arts called
national trauma 82 about the fakery of
taking the settlers out of young meat we
had no right to be in the first place of
course and pretending it was a great
national trauma so never again and so on
well it worked the international
propaganda the first time so they
figured they'd try it again and it
worked in Gaza but they never left guys
it you know this remains under
occupation remains understood the siege
became much more intense a couple months
later when hamas won the election and it
goes on from there there's nothing to do
with the West Bank no I've got two more
questions but anyway we had a Panama
it's been well let's go on see how far
we in here we go okay so there's a pre
question under the refugees because what
people that say you're Zionist forgery
state they say that's why you against
the right of the refugees and that
descended so the first of all i'm in
favor the right of the refugees to
return and always have been there's
nothing in the law about their
descendants people who appealed the
resolution 194 haven't read it
resolution 194 talks about the refugees
does not talk about the descendents
sooner or later Israel is going to say
okay we accept 194 because nobody's left
now linois and others have interpreted
to refer to the descendents which is
reasonable so we're now so let's accept
that interpret it's not in the wall but
let's accept the interpretation should
the refugees and the descendants have
the right to return yes should the
Wampanoag Indians have the right to
return here yes is it going to happen
know if you dangle before the eyes of
the Wampanoag Indians the
the the statement that i'm going to
support your right to return to boston
and kick out the population so therefore
you stay in rotten conditions and don't
do anything that is a deeply immoral act
deeply tomorrow if you care about the
refugees who are not going to return to
Israel that's a fact there's an
absolutely no international support for
zero and if there was any unimaginably
Israel would use its ultimate weapons to
prevent it the resort the nuclear war so
it's not just not going to happen so the
right can be affirmed and should be
affirmed as it should be for Native
Americans and for plenty of others there
should be efforts to ameliorate the very
ugly conditions of the refugees as Wally
Jumba just pushed through the lebanese
parliament it's a good step finally so
now they have at least a limited right
to work we should all be in favor of
that we should try to think of solutions
in which they're possibility of
returning to the former Palestine is
advanced and there are a couple of ways
to do then one is by a two-state
settlement which will at least give them
the opportunity to go back to a palette
to go not back but to go to a
Palestinian state once the further
conditions that I would anticipate are
realized and borders begin to erode yeah
there might be possibilities for them to
go right back but if anyone can think of
an alternative to that I'd like to hear
it the only alternative i here again is
a slogan which is about as reasonable
and as moral as the slogan saying the
wampanoag indians to come back to boston
ok so you think that Dad the right I
meaning they should have little doubt of
the right and they should have the right
on the right should be affirmed that
right and in fact if you look at the
there have been a couple of
approximations to a settlement the only
one with an interstate character was in
Taba in january two thousand one where
the two sides came pretty close to a
settlement and they dealt with this
issue
and the conclusion Palestinians and
Israelis was yes we should affirm the
right of return but we should recognize
that it's only going to be implemented
symbolically and the short term well if
somebody can think of an alternative to
that I'd like to hear it a real
alternative not us not a feel-good
slogan makes me feel good to say they
should come back but an alternative that
takes into account the suffering and
needs of the refugees that's why I mean
that real alternative if there is one
let's hear it and she said I'd like to
go up on one thing but other by national
and one stage for some people is very
not clear what he's a binational and
what he's a one today is it one person
one vote easy one stayed nice to people
was different at wonder you're opening
it I mean in multi-ethnic states you can
have one state it's a pretty homogeneous
society by international standards it's
homogeneous because the indigenous
population was eliminated and then it
was settled by no English colonists
scotch-irish other Europeans so it's by
international standards pretty
homogeneous you go from here to Los
Angeles it looks the same you know say
McDonald's the same language pretty much
same culture you know you can't do that
in Europe you go a couple of miles in
Europe you're in a different place okay
and in fact internally to Europe the
state system like everywhere else has
imposed been inputs by violence extreme
violence I mean the various Europe had a
complex structure they're being forced
into a state system by violence in fact
it's pretty recent just in the last
generation or two you know dozens of
languages and cultures are being wiped
out in Europe just by television and you
know national education systems and so
on so you can force people into the by
force and violence you can force them
into the rigid framework of a single
state and you can do it in an extreme
way as was done here by just wiping them
all out and then bringing in settlers
but most societies are much more complex
and the decent arrangement for them
would be to pay attention to
multi-ethnic variety that has to be done
in different ways in different parts of
the world and it's beginning to take
place in Europe so in Spain for example
there's for long under Franco the
dictatorship Catalonia with cattle and
was banned you know couldn't have a
Catalan flag couldn't talk it in the
streets and so as soon as it became more
or less democratic it began to move
towards a degree of cattle and autonomy
degree of basque autonomous degree of
probably it'll seems likely happen
Asturias and elsewhere in Britain there
have been similar developments I so
Wales and Scotland have a degree of
autonomy welsh's been revived the
Scottish Parliament and so on and I
think things like that makes sense in
real societies now it takes a
israel-palestine it's just beyond any
question that there are two quite
distinct societies cultures languages
and so on so any settlement other than
pure violence is going to be by national
okay if you want to react reenact the
history of Europe which was the most
savage place in the world for hundreds
of years because of efforts to try to
impose this arbitrary state system if
you want that fine you can talk about
one state if you're hoping for some
solute settlement that at least takes
into account the elementary rights of
people it's going to be a bi-national
state it could erode further because
there's plenty of other you know people
are not identified purely by their
ethnic nature they gotta talk on other
associations that's why the by
nationalism which I was involved in the
1940s was
socialist by nationalism appealing to
common interests among Jewish and Arab
workers you could argue that was an
illusion I don't really think so but
that was the basis for it so let's talk
about class interests and other
interests which divide people in other
ways the cultural interests artistic
interests whatever that can erode by
national system but to simply say well
let's have one state in one vote that's
just to say I don't care about the
people there I want to impose on them a
european-style one states an assistant
by force yeah still I'd 10 Christians of
you if I can come back at five I guess
yeah we do it for a WK okay
