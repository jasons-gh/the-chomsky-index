well you know old popular movements have
something in common but they're pretty
different the Paris Commune took over
the took over and brightened the city if
you want to find a kind of a parallel in
American history it would be I think
more like that what happened in western
Pennsylvania in the latter part of the
19th century when like in Homestead
where there were the the mills and the
mines and so on there's very powerful
workers movement at the time and they
essentially took them over
these were worker run communities and in
fact the state had they call in the
National Guard to destroy them it wasn't
easy another parallel to the Occupy
movement which I don't know I don't know
how well it's known is a resurrection
city I don't have anybody talks about
that but it's quite significant if you
look at you take the right history the
civil rights movement in the United
States say Martin Luther King no great
figure but look at what happened to King
I mean if you listen to the speeches on
Martin Luther King Day
they typically and the enthusiastic
rhetoric ends in 1963 with his I have a
dream speech well he gave another I have
a dream speech a very eloquent one it
was the evening he was assassinated in
Memphis Tennessee and he was there to
support a sanitation workers strike and
it was on his way to Washington to try
to organize it where people's movement
he the speech was you know how to cut
biblical overtones the kind of used and
it it's it was basically the theme was
I'm yeah I'm I can see the Promised Land
I'm like Moses I can see the Promised
Land I know I'm not going to get there
but you will get there and the Promised
Land that he was talking about was not
the right to vote
it was rights for poor people he was
concerned about life in the slums
you know the repression of the poor
generally I mean it's you know race
class or kind of correlated so it's
we're heavily black but not just lack by
any means and then he was killed and
then the poor people they were supposed
to be march from Memphis to Washington a
Coretta King his wife as Widow led the
March and they went through all the
embattled places in the South you know
Birmingham and Selma and so on they
ended up in Washington they set up a
tent city in Washington resurrection
city where it was going to be the base
for approaching Congress to try to get
some legislation which would deal with
the plight of poor people
well Congress which was most liberal
Congress in American history I called
the police and came in in the middle of
the night smashed up the camp and drove
him out of the city
that's resurrection city you know tent
city that because as far as northern
liberals were concerned if you wanted to
denounce racist alabama sheriffs that
was fine but don't come near us
