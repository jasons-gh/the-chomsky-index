hello hello hello hello hello hello
hello and welcome to st. Olaf enough of
course is an institution that is so bent
on reminding you of its Norwegian
heritage that you might be forgiven for
thinking that it's located in Norway as
opposed to the stolen Dakota land that
it actually is situated in so welcome to
colonialism 21st century it's so weird
because it's even and willing to do that
thing colonizers do where they brutalize
you for years and then they establish a
memorial in your name just so that you
can correct past deeds you know so you
can overlook all the cruelty of before
but I digress
my name is abdul lake and i'm the
coordinator of the political awareness
committee commonly referred to as pack
or the PA see I would like to start by
first thanking everyone who made this
event possible from Greg Manning and
facilities to Jeff O'Donnell in
broadcast media gingka and speak out to
our advisors and to all of you who
welcome this announcement with immense
enthusiasm and last but not least I
would like to also thank the political
committee members of the political
awareness committee for all your hard
work and all your diligence and you know
not just for tonight but for for all of
the year furthermore seeing as this is
the penultimate event of the year
on behalf of the PA see I would like to
thank all of the faculty staff and
students who through sustained and
supportive partnership as well as
enthusiastic interest in PAC sponsored
events made it possible for us to have a
successful year of dynamic programming
our intention with PAC this year was to
sort of facilitate the departure from
the dogmatic engagements with politics
which represents a very sensationalist
sort of commodified and superficial and
at times xenophobic engagement with
political with politics
presenting itself as genuine political
discourse and so to quote Franco's and
we live in really target times and
they're telling Boulder heavy lies
through the roof so our desire is to
stress the necessity for a critical
perspective built on engaging with
uncomfortable truths something that this
college and this country is very very
opposed to doing and search we did this
by offering a platform for public
critique of power that weaves
intergenerational wisdom by tracing at
genealogy put in place by those who've
committed their voices to persistently
speaking truth to power and so such has
been the task for the PSE commonly
referred to as back as I've said before
I'm usually at this point I would say
something about the presence of a pack
on this campus but our ability to
question critique the inner workings of
this institution has only resulted in
you know further repression of our
voices and the installation of punitive
policies that serve as a reminder of the
varying and dubious commitments that
institutions such as this hold dear
above and especially at the expense of
its most marginalized groups so instead
I will be reading from this this is a
book by Edwards I eat it's a collection
of lectures called beep read lectures
delivered each year and the topic of
this one is the role of the public
intellectual and the book is called
representations of the public
intellectual and so I'll be reading from
that I'm slightly nervous and not
because of because I'm meeting someone
who is a walking library so that sort of
takes it away from me
so to begin in the face of this quite
formidable onslaught to regress either
into handwriting impotence or
intramuscular II assertions of
traditional values as characterized by
the global neoconservative movement will
not do I think it is true to say that
the critique of objectivity and
authority did perform a positive service
by underlining how in the secular world
human beings construct their truths
and that for example the so-called
objective truth of the white man
superiority built and maintained by the
classical European colonial empires also
rested on a violent subjugation of
African and Asian peoples who it is
equally true fought that particular
imposed truth in order to provide an
independent order of their own and so
now everyone comes forward with new and
often violently opposed views of the
world with varying degrees of power when
here is endless talks about
judeo-christian values but Muslim
treason treats but Western treats each
providing a complete program for
excluding all the others there's no more
intolerance and strident assertiveness
abroad everywhere than any one system
can handle the result is almost an
almost a complete absence of universals
even though very often the rhetoric
suggests for instance that our values
whatever those may happen to be are in
fact universal one of the shabbiest of
all intellectual gambits is to
pontificate about abuses in someone
else's society and excuse exactly the
same practice in one's own for me the
classical example of this is provided by
the brilliant 19th century French as an
intellectual Alexis de Tocqueville who
to many of us educated educated to
believe in classical liberal and Western
democratic values exemplified those
values almost the letter having written
his assessment of democracy in America
and having criticized American and
mistreatment of Indians and black slaves
Tocqueville later had to deal with
French colonial policies in Algeria
during the late 1830s and 1840s over
under Marshall bridge oh the French Army
of Occupation undertook a savage war of
pacification against Algerian Muslims
all of a sudden as one reads Tocqueville
on Algeria the very norms with which he
had he mainly be mute at American mph
isms are suspect are suspended for
French actions not that he does not cite
reasons he does but they are lame
accelerations whose purpose is the
license French colonialism
in the name of what he calls national
pride massacres leave him and moved
Muslims he says belonged to an inferior
Legion and must be disciplined in short
the a pirate universalism of his
language for America is denied willfully
denied application to his own country
even his own country France pursues
similarly inhumane policies it must be
added however that Tocqueville and John
Stuart Mill for that matter whose
commendable ideas about democratic
freedoms in England he said did not
apply to India lived during a period
when the ideas of universal norm of
international behavior meant in effect
the right of European power and European
representations of other people to hold
sway
so negatory and second read the
non-white people of the world seem
besides according to 19th century
Western as there were no independent
African or Asian peoples of consequence
to challenge the draconian brutality of
laws that were applied unilaterally by
colonial armies to black or brown
skinned races their destiny was to be
ruled France for known Angela Davis a
Mesa and CLR James to mention a few
great endtime
peerless black intellectuals did not
live and write until the 20th century so
what they had so what they and the
liberation movements of which they were
a part of accomplished culturally and
politically in establishing the right of
colonized peoples to equal treatment was
not available to Tocqueville or tamil'
but these change perspectives are
available to contemporary intellectuals
who have not often drawn the inevitable
conclusions that if you wish to uphold
basic human justice you must do so for
everyone not just selectively for the
people that your side your culture and
your nation designates as okay the
fundamental problem is therefore how to
reconcile one's identity and the
actualities of one's own culture society
and history to the reality of other
identities and cultures and people's
this can never be done simply by
asserting one's preference for what is
already one's own thump thumping about
the glories of our culture or the
triumph of our history which is not
worthy of anyone's energy especially not
today
when so many societies are comprised of
different races and backgrounds as to
resist any reductive formulas dr.
Chomsky is this dynamic intellectual is
willing to engage in this ability to
look beyond his borders
professor Chomsky from linguistics to
philosophy from history to contemporary
issues from international affairs to
u.s. foreign policy Chomsky is clear
straightforward honesty is legendary
here in more than 100 books his most
recent being the requirement for the
American dream the temp principles of
concentration of wealth and power
considered the founder of modern
linguistics professor Chomsky is one of
the most cited scholars in modern
history each of his groundbreaking books
has made distinct contributions to the
development of the field he has received
numerous awards including the Kyoto
Prize in basic science the Helmholtz
medal and the Ben Franklin medal and
computer and cognitive science so
without further ado I would like to
welcome onto the stage Noam Chomsky
thanks very much
quite a number of interesting and
important topics were raised by the
students who invited me here and I wish
that were time to talk about all of them
I hope you'll feel free to bring them up
in discussion but I thought what I would
do rather than trying to review those
briefly is to focus on just one question
the most important question that's ever
been asked in human history a question
that should be uppermost in my every
one's mind it's been hanging over our
heads like a kind of sort of Damocles
for many years becoming more urgent
every year and it has now reached the
point that the question will be answered
in this generation it's your challenge
to answer it can't be delayed the
question is whether organized human life
will indeed survive and not in the
distant future
the question was raised clearly to
everyone with eyes open on August 6 1945
I was then
roughly your age happened to be at a
summer camp I was counselor in the
morning an announcement came over the
loudspeaker saying that the United
States had obliterated the city of
Hiroshima with a single bomb the atom
bomb people listened a few expressions
of relief and then everyone went on to
their next activity baseball game
swimming whatever it might be I was
horrified both by the news and also by
the casual reactions so utterly
horrified that I just took off and
went off into the woods for a couple of
hours to think about it it was perfectly
obvious if you thought for a second not
only about the horror of the events but
that humans in their glory had achieved
the capacity to destroy everything not
quite at that time but it was clear that
once the technology was established it
would only be developed further escalate
and would soon reached the point of
becoming what Dan Ellsberg in his recent
book central reading incidentally calls
the doomed a doomsday machine an
automatic system set up so that
everything becomes annihilated and as he
points out we have indeed constructed
such a machine and we're living with it
the coming forward until today leading
specialists on these topics echo much
the same double concern but now in more
struck stark and urgent terms than in
1945 at one of the leading US nuclear
specialists former defense secretary
William Perry has been touring the
country recently with the message that
he is as he puts it doubly terrified
terrified by the severe and mounting
threat of nuclear war and even more so
by the lack of concern about the
possible termination of organized human
life and he's not alone among others
General Lee Butler formerly head of the
US Strategic Command which controls
nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons
policy he recently reflected with deep
remorse on his many years of service
in implementing plans for what is
sometimes called omnis I'd cream crime
far surpassing genocide crime of wiping
out every living organism
he writes that we have so far survived
the nuclear age by some combination of
skill luck and divine intervention and I
suspect the latter in greatest
proportion and he adds a haunting
question by what authority do succeeding
generations of leaders in the nuclear
weapons States usurp the power to
dictate the odds of continued life on
our planet and most urgently why does
such breathtaking audacity persist at a
moment when we should stand trembling in
the face of our folly and united in our
commitment to abolish its most deadly
manifestations and Ellsberg in his
recent book again I urge that you read
it if you haven't describes the record
that he reviews mostly from inside the
government at the highest planning level
for many years he describes it as a
chronicle of human madness and that's
accurate enough repeatedly we have come
very close ominously close to terminal
disaster the record should really be
studied carefully
it's shocking sometimes it's due to the
reckless acts of leaders sometimes our
leaders very often through just sheer
accident so I'll give you a couple of
examples they're actually hundreds
literally take one in 1960 when it was
discovered that the Russians might have
missiles or soon might have missiles the
first early warning system was set up to
detect a missile attack
the first day it went into operation it
provided two high leaders the
information that the Russians had
launched the missile attack with 99.9%
certainty fortunately people didn't
react the way their its instructed to
react and it turned out that there had
been some miscalculations and radar hit
the moon and actually bounced back
wasn't expected to bounce back and
that's one case a couple of years later
1962 came what's been called rightly the
most dangerous moment in history Cuban
Missile Crisis the background is worth
studying I won't have time to go into it
but it is reckless acts of leaders
including our own leaders at the peak
moment of threat of the Cuban Missile
Crisis which came extremely close the
terminal disaster at that moment there
were Russian submarines outside the
quarantine area that Kennedy had
established and they were under attack
by US destroyers were dropping depth
bombs on them the conditions and the
submarines were such that the crew could
not really survive much longer they were
not designed for service in the
Caribbean they were designed for the far
north the they had us didn't know it at
the time but they had missiles with
nuclear warheads and the crew at some
point decided look since they're
dropping bombs on us they had no contact
with anyone there must be a nuclear war
we might as well send off the ultimate
weapon that would have been the end
there would have been a retaliation and
then we're finished to send off the
missiles that required the agreement of
three submarine commanders
- agreed one refused Diwali arkhipov one
of the reasons why we're still here
nineteen seven that many other cases
1979 a National Security Advisor speak
knave Brzezinski was literally on the
phone ready to call President Carter
saying that there was definite
information of a massive Russian missile
attack when he got a call saying it was
an error so he didn't call him a year
later Ronald Reagan came into office and
one of his first acts was to start a
program to probe Russian defenses the
objective was to determine what kind of
Defense's the Russians had against our
attack if we had one the official
wording was to practice command and
staff procedures with particular
emphasis on the transition from
conventional to non-conventional
operations use of nuclear menus of
nuclear weapons the idea was to simulate
air and naval attacks on Russia with the
all of this made as public as possible
to the Russians because they wanted to
see how they'd react including simulated
nuclear attacks at the time it was
thought the Russians would probably
figure out that it simulated wouldn't
react now that the Russian archives came
out took turns out they took it pretty
seriously just as we would certainly
have done in fact one of the leading US
intelligence analyses that recently
appeared concludes from the records
title is the war scare was for real they
took it extremely seriously right in the
midst of this the Russian detection
systems which are far more primitive
than ours
did detect an ongoing US missile attack
the protocol is for the human being who
received
his name had to happen to be Vladimir
Petrov he's supposed to take that
information send it up to the Russian
High Command and they decide whether to
release totally destructive missile
attack on us he just decided not to do
it he decided it probably wasn't serious
another reason why we're alive can add
him to the role of Honor this goes on
time after time there have been
literally hundreds of cases that came
very close The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists as you probably know
established what they call a Doomsday
Clock shortly after the atomic bombing
the first what they do is every year a
group of physicists nuclear specialists
political a strategic analysts get
together try to assess the state of the
world the threats to the world and set
the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock a
certain number of minutes before
midnight midnight means Saiga why were
finished the first setting 1947 was
seven minutes to midnight it reached the
most frightening setting just two
minutes to midnight in 1953 when what
was easy to anticipate in 1945 had
happened first the United States then
the Soviet Union carried out tests of
hydrogen bombs vastly more destructive
than atom bombs in fact an atom bomb is
just used as a trigger to set it off
it's a huge destructive capacity that
meant that human intelligence had
reached the point where we could easily
destroy all all life no problem
and the minute hand reached two minutes
then since then it's oscillated but in
recent years it's been approaching
midnight
in January 2017 right after Trump's
inauguration the minute-hand was
advanced to two and a half minutes to
midnight last January after a year Trump
in office it was advanced another half
minute to two minutes to midnight that's
a sign that we have now matched the
closest point the terminal disaster in
the nuclear age ominously close that was
January a couple months later president
Trump's Nuclear Posture review was
released it raises the dangers further I
presume if the clock was set now it
might move another half minute to
midnight well I'll return to current
crises which are very real and how
they're being handled and what we might
do about them to avoid disaster but
first something else since 1945 we have
been somehow surviving the nuclear age
actually miraculously and we can't count
on miracles going on forever but we
didn't know in 1945 was that humans were
entering into another epoch a new one
which is no less ominous it's what
geologists called the Anthropocene a new
geological epoch in which human activity
is destroying the environment there have
been debates among scientists about when
to date the onset of the Anthropocene
but last year the world geological
society determined that a proper time to
set it is right after World War two at
the same time as the nuclear age and the
reason is because of the sharp
escalation at that point in human
activities which were significantly
damaging and will soon
the environment for organized life
that's we might add that the
Anthropocene carries with it
automatically a third major epoch which
is called the sixth extinction you look
through millions of years of history
there have been periods when some event
caused the mass extinction of animal
life if the last one was 65 thousand
years ago when an asteroid hit the earth
destroyed about 75% of animal life and
at the age of the dinosaurs actually
opened a way for small mammals to
survive they ultimately became us we are
determined to become another asteroid
intent on destroying all most animal
life on earth and we will advanced in
that process so there are three major
epochs that we've been living with the
nuclear age the Anthropocene the sixth
extinction all accelerating so let's
just ask how dangerous is the
Anthropocene well give you a couple of
recent illustrations from some of the
leading scientific journals recent
articles start with nature british
journal the leading general scientific
article the title of the article is
global warming's worst case projections
look increasingly likely no reading it
a new study based on satellite
observations finds that temperatures
could reach could rise nearly five
degrees centigrade by the end of this
century the odds that temperatures will
increase more than four degrees by that
2100 in this in the current scenario
increased from 62% to 93% in other words
pretty near
now you go back to the Paris agreement
sparest negotiations December 2015
they hope was in the international
negotiations that the temperature could
be kept temperature rise could be kept
to 1.5 degrees centigrade rise and they
considered that maybe 2% would be
tolerable instead we're heading to four
to five percent with very high
confidence and here's one from the World
Meteorological Organization a recent one
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere surged at a record-breaking
speed in 2016 last figures they have to
the highest level in 800,000 years the
abrupt changes in atmosphere witnessed
in the past 70 years the Anthropocene
are without precedent in the geological
record globally averaged concentrations
of co2 reached over 400 parts per
million up from just 400 parts per
million in 2015 which has been sidered
the upper tolerable limit so we're now
beyond that the concentrations of co2
are now 150 percent above the
pre-industrial level rapidly increasing
atmospheric levels of co2 and other
greenhouse gases have the potential to
initiate unprecedented changes in
climate systems leading to severe
ecological and economic destruction as
the last time the earth experienced a
comparable concentration of co2 was
somewhere around three to five million
years ago at that point the temperature
was two to three degrees centigrade
above now and the sea level was thirty
to sixty feet higher than it is now that
what we're moving to in the near future
in fact we're going beyond because the
prediction is the four to five degrees
centigrade well I'll leave the effects
to your imagination here's a final
example Journal science of the leading
American science journals even slightly
warmer temperatures less than
anticipated in coming years could start
melting permafrost which in turn
threatens to trigger the release of huge
amounts of greenhouse gases trapped in
ice there's twice as much carbon and
permafrost as in the atmosphere the this
will release huge amounts of methane
which actually is far more lethal than
co2
even though shorter persistence and that
accelerates other processes know very
clearly underway
like the rapid melting of polar ice
polar ice as it melts it reduces the
reflective surface surface for sun's
rays and creates more absorbent surfaces
the dark seas so that accelerates
warming could lead to a nonlinear
process in which everything blows up
West and are its leading among other
things to the breaking up and the
melting of a huge Antarctic ice caps at
one of them West Antarctica contains
enough ice to raise sea level more than
10 feet we're pretty easy continued and
brief the prospects are extremely
serious in fact they're really awesome
which raises an obvious question what
are we doing about how are we reacting
well the world is actually taking some
steps inadequate but at least something
there's a commitment and states and
localities in the United States are also
taking steps which is quite important
but what is of prime importance of
course
the federal government the most powerful
institution in human history so what is
it doing
it's withdrawn from the international
efforts but beyond that it's committed
to increasing the use of the most
destructive fossil fuels so our federal
government for which we are responsible
is dramatically leading a race to
destruction while we sit and watch
that's pretty astounding that all be the
screaming headline and every day's
newspaper ought to be the main topic you
study in every class never been anything
like it and it is astounding as is the
lack of attention
another doubly terrifying phenomenon and
we should be asking among other things
what this tells us about our society and
about our culture what we are immersed
in and remember all of this is imminent
we're approaching this rapidly this
century it's your task to do something
about it
and we're ignoring it it's going on
we're racing towards that we're ignoring
it meanwhile our chief competitor and
destroying the planet and the Saudi
Arabian dictatorship has just announced
plans to spend 7 billion dollars this
year for 7 new solar plants and a big
wind farm it's part of an effort on its
part to move from oil which destroys
everything it's the solar renewable
energy and that how like hot this is
Saudi Arabia and that highlights how
lonely we are in our race to destruction
even the extreme reactionary
dictatorship Saudi Arabia which lives on
oil refuses to join us and
unique insanity which is dedicated to
destroying organized human life and it's
not just the current administration the
entire Republican Party leadership
agrees if you go back to the 2016
primaries every single candidate denied
that what is happening is happening with
the exception of those who were called
the sensible moderates like Jeb Bush who
said it's all kind of uncertain but we
don't have to do anything about it
because we're producing more natural gas
thanks to fracking in other words making
it worse the other sensible moderate the
adult in the womb as it was called was
John Kasich
the government governor of Ohio he's the
one person who agreed that anthropogenic
global warming is taking place but he
added that we're gonna burn coal in Ohio
and where I want to apologize for it
ethical grounds that's the worst of all
think about it well what about the media
they totally ignored this spectacle
every crazy thing um I can imagine was
discussed extensively in the massive
coverage coverage of the primacy
primaries but not the fact that the
entire leadership of the party was
saying let's quickly destroy ourselves
nothing go back and check almost no
comment about it
the denialism of the leadership is
having an effect on public opinion
so Republican voters have been climate
change skeptics for a long time way
beyond anything in the world but it's
gotten far more extreme since Trump took
office and the numbers are pretty
shocking so by now half of Republican
vote
deny that global warming is taking place
at all and only 30 percent think humans
may be contributing to govern the zoo
global warming I don't think you can
find anything like that among any
significant part of the population
anywhere in the world and it should tell
us something one thing it should tell us
is that there's a lot to do for those
who hope that maybe organized human life
will survive and we're not talking about
a remote future just think about the
numbers I gave you before we're talking
about something imminent well let's put
that aside for a moment and go back to
the growing threat of nuclear war are
these ominous developments inexorable so
should we just throw up our hands and
despair say ok we're finished have a
nice time goodbye that's not at all true
there are very plausible answers in
every single case that exists diplomatic
options are always open and there are
quite straightforward general principles
that can be quite effective one
principle is simple obey the law not a
particularly I dia almost unheard of but
it could have some consequences so what
is the law well there is something
called the US Constitution which people
are supposed to honor and revere
Constitution has parts as article 6 for
example article 6 of the Constitution
says that valid treaties are the supreme
law of the land
every elected official is required to
observe them what's the most important
treaty of the modern period
unquestionably it's the United Nations
Charter article 1 of the Charter
requires us to keep the peaceful means
to resolve international
tensions and disputes and to refrain
from the threat or use of force in
international affairs and I stress
threat because that's violated all the
time by every president and every high
political leader every time you hear the
phrase all options are open that's
violating the supreme law of the land if
anyone cares so let's take a couple of
examples and so take Iran it's a
important example there's a good deal of
talk about the possibility that Iran and
may be violating the joint comprehensive
agreement the jcpoa and the Iran deal
there's no evidence for that a US
intelligence says they're observing it
the International Atomic Energy Agency
carries out repeated expection say
they're observing it completely but
there's a lot of discussion about it
there's no talk about something else
is the u.s. violating the agreement try
to check and see if anybody's talked
about that well the answer is that's
pretty simple u.s. is radically
violating the agreement and has been all
along the error the agreement states
that all participants meaning us must us
cannot are not permitted to impede in
any way Iran's reintegration into the
global economy particularly the global
financial system which we pretty much
control because everything works through
New York we are not permitted to
interfere in any way with the
normalization I'm quoting it the
normalization of trade and economic
relations with Iran we're doing that all
the time
and in fact they're proud of it all
violations of the agreement but it's
ignored on a principle that's kind of
interesting the prevailing tacit
assumption that the United States just
stands above the law including its own
laws
so we don't have to observe our laws or
any other laws because we're just unique
we do what we like see if you can find
an exception to that in the discourse on
this topic well in a couple of days as
you know we were a president Trump will
probably withdraw from the treaty
possibly that's a gift to the hardliners
in Iran tells them then they should
maybe return to nuclear programs
that's an opening for the new national
security adviser John Bolton for
Benjamin Netanyahu both of whom have
called for bombing Iran right away even
while they fully respect the terms of
the agreement that we violated publicly
quite publicly there's no secret about
it and the consequences could be
horrendous but there happens to be a way
of blocking those consequences namely by
the very simple device of respecting our
own law in fact the supreme law of the
land again see if you can find the
suggestion to that effect
well are there peaceful options pretty
obviously in this case we could join the
rest of the world permit the agreement
to continue to function or better we
might turn to improvement of the
agreement that's one thing that Trump
has vociferous Lee demanded and there's
a good ways to do that but one obvious
proposal for improving the agreement
which is ignored entirely is to move
towards establishing a nuclear weapons
free zone in the region there are such
agreements in various parts of the world
Latin America for example and it's a
step towards mitigating the threat of
disaster so what about a nuclear weapons
free zone in the Middle East that were
established it would end any conceivable
Iranian threat that you could imagine so
is there a problem of establishing it
well actually there's one problem but
it's not the one that comes to mind
there's certainly no problem convincing
Iran because they've been calling for
this for years and vociferous Lee
certainly not any problem with the Arab
world
they're the ones who initiated the
proposals 25 years ago the rest of the
world agrees as well there's one
exception the United States the United
States refuses to allow it to proceed
this comes you don't read this but it
comes up every couple of years and the
annual review meetings of the
non-proliferation treaty countries where
it's continually brought up continually
vetoed by the United States most
recently by President Obama in 2015 and
the reasons are perfectly clear to
everyone the US will not permit Israeli
nuclear weapons to be even examined and
by the AI by the International Agency
let alone to be dismantled so therefore
we can't proceed with this very simple
way of eliminating any nuclear threat
from Iran or anyone else in the region
and also not discussed is that the
United States and Britain have a special
obligation a unique obligation to pursue
a nuclear weapons free zone in the
Middle East the reason is a United
Security United Nations Security Council
resolution 687 and look it up on the
internet which was initiated by the US
this was the resolution that was
initiated when the US and Britain were
this is back in 1991 it's a resolution
which called on Iraq to terminate any
nuclear weapons programs the US and
Britain relied on this resolution in
2003 when they were trying to conquer
some pretext for their planned invasion
of Iraq
so they appealed to this resolution and
says we think Iraq is violating it which
in fact they weren't and they knew they
weren't but if you read that resolution
at article 14 it commits the signers to
work for a nuclear weapons-free zone in
the Middle East so the US and Britain
are uniquely committed to working for
this by the Security Council resolution
that they initiated well again check to
see if it's ever discussed so in short
the u.s. willingness to observe US law
could bring this crisis to a very quick
end and could even move on to a better
solution for example if we were willing
to observe Security Council resolutions
that we ourselves instituted to end the
illegal threats of force by every recent
president and other high officials and
to end our constant violations of the
Iran nuclear agreement so the easy
answers to this crisis really simple
obey the law okay that would end the
crisis again I advise you to search to
see how often this is discussed and what
that implies about our educational
system our culture our media our
universities and so on well let's turn
to the other major threat North Korea
there has been a proposal on the table
for some years about how to reduce the
threat in Northeast Asia it's called a
double freeze it was initiated by China
supported by North Korea supported by
Russia general support throughout the
world
the idea is that North Korea should
freeze its weapons and nuclear programs
and in return the United States
should call off the threatening military
maneuvers that the us constantly carries
out on North Korea's border including
flights on the border by our most
advanced nuclear capable bombers warning
of the threat of total obliteration of
North Korea constantly happening and
it's no joke for the North Koreans they
have a little memory we may want to
forget it but at the end of the Korean
War when it was more or less settled a
u.s. bombing was so intensive that there
was nothing left the bomb literally so
the Air Force general macarthur started
destroying dams major dams and if you
read the airforce histories they exalt
about this happens to be a crime for
which people were hanged at Nuremberg
but again we're above the law but the
North Koreans can remember and when
these advanced nuclear capable bombing
bombers are flying there evokes a memory
so a double freezes Impa is one
possibility a double freeze could easily
open the way to further negotiations and
at this point the record becomes
important and you can find it in the
scholarly record not in the press but in
the scholarly record there have been
successes in negotiations the major one
was in 2005 the Bush administration was
pressured by international pressure to
return to negotiations and the
negotiations were extremely successful
North Korea agreed I'm quoting the final
document North Korea agreed to abandon
all nuclear weapons and existing weapons
programs and to allow international
inspections in return for that the u.s.
agreed to establish a consortium that
would provide North Korea with a light
water reactor for medical use
it would also us would also issue a
non-aggression pledge and an agreement
that the 2-ton quoting that the two
sides would respect each other's
sovereignty exist peacefully together
and take steps to normalize relations
instantly the Bush administration
renewed the threat of force froze North
Korean funds and foreign banks and
disbanded the consortium that was to
provide North Korea with a light water
reactor the leading u.s. Korea scholar
Bruce Cummings writes that the sanctions
were specifically designed to destroy
the September pledges and to head off an
accommodation between Washington and
Pyongyang that was 2005 well I've been
searching the press for some time to see
if these facts can even be reported
breaking the constant refrain that North
Korea has broken all agreements and so
can't be trusted
can't review it now but I urge you to
try you'll learn a lot well that path
could be pursued again but as we know
there are even better options and it's
worth taking a close look at them on
April 27th North and South Korea signed
a remarkable historic document
it's the Panmunjom declaration for peace
prosperity unification of the Korean
Peninsula and it's worth reading
carefully urge you to do it not the
commentary the actual words in this
declaration the two Koreas I'm quoting
it affirmed the principle of determining
the destiny of the Korean nation on
their own accord on their own accord to
completely continuing to completely
cease all hostile acts against each
other in every domain to actively
cooperate to establish a permanent and
solid peace regime
on the Korean Peninsula to carry out
disarmament on a phased level manner to
achieve the common goal of realizing
through complete denuclearization a
nuclear-free Korean Peninsula to
strengthen the positive momentum towards
continuous advancement of inter-korean
relations as well as peace prosperity
and unification of the Korean Peninsula
and they further agreed to actively seek
the support and cooperation of the
international community which means the
United States for the denuclearization
of the Korean Peninsula now it's
important to read those words their
import is very clear what they're saying
is the US should back off and allow the
two Koreas to achieve peace disarmament
unification and complete
denuclearization on their own on their
own accord in the words of the
Declaration so we the United States
should accept the call for support and
cooperation in this endeavor by the two
parts of the Korean nation to determine
their destiny on their own accord okay
to put it more simply the declaration is
a polite letter saying dear mr. Trump
declare a victory if you want to prance
around in public but please go away and
let us move towards peace disarmament
and unification without disrupting the
process now that plea could hardly be
more clear and the general
interpretation here is quite revealing
the general interpretation is that this
complicates Washington's strategy as the
New York Times explains mr. quoting it
mr. Trump will find it hard to threaten
military action against the
three that's extending an olive branch
okay
that's the liberal side it's entirely
true that threatening military action
which happens to be a criminal act is
hard when the target is extending an
olive branch so we have some problems
well case after case I won't go through
other cases we find that there are
peaceful diplomatic options can't ever
be certain that they'll work but we
should always be prioritized in
accordance with their international
obligations
in fact in accord with the supreme law
of the land well is it hopeless no it's
not hopeless far from it and we have
plenty of evidence for that so let's go
back to very important date in modern
history November November 8 1916 huge
coverage of that date and several events
happened that are significant the least
significant of them was the one that
gets most of the coverage the election
of Donald Trump it's a little bit
unusual but it's not that out of the
norm if a billionaire with a huge amount
of campaign spending and huge media
support wins the presidency that's kind
of within the norm but something really
surprising did happen the Sanders
campaign that broke with practically all
of American political history for well
over a century American elections have
been mainly bought literally you can
predict the outcome of an election with
almost complete certainty by just
looking at campaign funding there's
extensive detailed academic study of
this both the President and Congress
what happened on November 16th was
different for the first time a candidate
very close to winning the nomination and
would have won the nomination probably
if the Democratic Party managers hadn't
manipulated Affairs to keep him out thus
Bernie Sanders and he did it without any
campaign funding from any of the major
sources no corporate funding no wealth
no media support he was either ignored
or denigrated in the media that's a real
breakthrough what's more he ended up
becoming by far the most the most
popular political candidate in the
country take a look at the polls as you
can see on Fox News in fact well away
well above any other political figure
and popularity well you know in a
Democratic Society the most popular
political figure in the country who had
just carried off a remarkable break and
well over a century of political history
you'd hear him every once in a while
okay I urge you to take a look and
doesn't take your own decisions that's a
more important event that took place on
November November 2016 that is another
one which didn't get covered but should
at that time the world was carrying out
the successor negotiations to the Paris
negotiations the Paris negotiations on
climate change in December 2015
aimed at a Treaty of verifiable treaty
to do something about this ominous
threat they couldn't reach a treaty for
one reason the American the Republican
Party would not permit it so they
couldn't have a treaty it was a
voluntary agreement the following year
2016 they were meeting again to try to
put some teeth in the theory and the
treaty on November 8 the day
the American elections the World
Meteorological Organization this was
taking place in Morocco Marrakech
Morocco the World Meteorological
Organization released a study on the
very dire state of the climate kind of
thing I gave a couple of samples of
before then the election results came in
the meeting basically stopped the
question before the international world
is can the world survive when the most
powerful country in history is taken
over by a political party that not
already NIH's that what is happening is
happening but it's committed to
accelerate the race to destruction and
they kind of hope that maybe China would
save the world from disaster just think
about that for a moment maybe China will
save the world from the disaster that
the Republican Party is bringing to the
world I let you think about that but the
fact is there are plenty of things that
can be done and the success of the
Senators campaign and particularly the
aftermath lots of things are going on
that fed from it that could make a
difference but it doesn't happen on its
own and it takes serious engagement well
go back to the beginning
your generation that's you is facing the
most awesome question that has ever
arisen in human history the question is
will organize human life survive and
we're talking about the near future
can't escape it there are plenty of
opportunities like it or not it's up to
you to determine the fate of the human
species it's an awesome responsibility
it's one that cannot be evaded
okay I can't be
now it's your turn hello hello all right
good afternoon everyone just wanted to
give a quick thanks everyone for coming
out tonight and a great thanks to dr.
Thompson tonight for this great delivery
tonight we're going to open it up about
20 15 minutes for discussion questions
so if you'd like to come up here to give
you a questions that would be great
thank you
hi professor Chomsky first I just wanted
to say thank you so much for being able
to come here it's truly an honor to see
you in person and I really mean that
the question I have for you is in your
opinion do you see a link between Islam
as a set of ideas and Islamic
radicalization or is the latter solely
as a result of American foreign policy
in your opinion do you see a link
between Islam as a set of ideas and
Islamic radicalization or is the latter
solely as a result of American foreign
policy questions about Islamic ideas and
practice I mean Islam is like
Christianity Judaism Buddhism find all
there's no such thing as Islamic ideas
there are lots of different Islamic
ideas just like Christian the real
question we should be asking
particularly here is what about
Christianity that's something we can do
about okay so that's the highest
priority so what are Christian ideals
well they vary all over the place people
in high places now claim to be devout
Christians and on the basis of Christian
ideals they're saying let's proceed to
destroy the world I don't know anybody
in Islamic world is doing that now
that's of course not all Christian
ideals there are others too Martin
Luther King expressed different
Christian ideals and it's the same with
the Islamic world you can find lots of
things but the idea that there are
fixed Islamic ideals which are a problem
for the world that doesn't mean anything
you have to look at well take a look at
individual cases so take say Iran and
the United States both states in which
the leadership is led claims to be
deeply religious and committed to the
faith and asking what the two of them
are doing with regard to the leading
issue that they're now in conflict over
turns out that the Iranian leadership is
calling vociferously for establishing a
nuclear weapons-free zone in the region
which would end any threat on the
Christian United States with its deeply
Christian leadership is named sorry we
can't because we have to preserve
Israeli nuclear weapons from inspection
well is it a problem about the Islamic
faith thank you
would it help if I approached you so you
could hear my question better or you're
fine okay
I really loved the theme that was
present throughout your entire speech
where you talked about the necessity of
following the law and I feel like a big
problem that's playing into that
currently is that white-collar legal
practices are not really being
persecuted right now
so people empower people of wealth or
not submitting to the law and I was
wondering if you have any ideas on how
we could reform the judiciary system
that allows people to be persecuted if
they're in a place of power or in a
place of great wealth there are easy
ways for the people in power to be
prosecuted we have laws okay so we could
implement the laws I mean I agree that
it's kind of unthinkable but but that's
within our power right it is within our
power to compel the authorities who are
technically under our control in a
democratic society to do something
simple like obey our own laws the every
administration says no that's impossible
so it takes a torture under the Bush
administration that was a massive
torture going on there's no debate about
this when Obama came in he decided a
determined that there would be no
punishment for the torture I choose when
you look back at the torture it's kind
of interesting it's claimed that the
bush massive torture by the bush regime
on Guantanamo and all sorts of other
black sites around the world
that that was in violation of US law
it's not so clear the United States has
never signed the literalism never has
really never signed that the
International torture convention
under Reagan 1984 the US did sign it and
ratify it
but with reservations when the u.s.
signs international agreements almost
always with reservations and those are
important to look at the reservations
excluded the kind of torture that the
CIA has determined is the most effective
torture it's what's called mental
torture not electrodes on the genitals
but the kind of torture that doesn't
leave a sign on the body which is
miserable vicious torture that they've
the term they picked it up from the KGB
the Russian KGB that this is the kind of
torture that really works and that kind
of torture was excluded that when the
u.s. signed and ratified the torture
convention
it was then Clinton added further
endorsement of that something else we
might want to think about and we might
want to think about the fact that the
new head of the CIA is a woman who was
supervising this but that's only one
example the case of the constant threat
the constant threats of war the and it's
case after case like one thing that the
u.s. is very proud of talks about openly
under Obama was carrying out a cyber
attacks against Iranian nuclear systems
which severely severely harm them
another thing we're that happens to be
the Pentagon regards cyber attacks as an
act of war the new Nuclear Posture
review states that cyber attacks are a
legitimate nuclear war in response but
when we carry them out we're proud of it
okay the drone campaign
is a global assassination campaign we
assassinate anybody we think might be
planning to harm us
I suppose that some other country did
that say suppose that Iran started
assassinating every president John
Bolton the National Security Advisor who
writes in the Maine press that we should
bomb Iran no question about the threat
plenty of other people who they think is
or harming them half the leadership in
Israel how would we react and would we
think you know that's fine every right
to do it we have to reach a level of
civilization in which we are able to
think about ourselves and what we do
it's really easy to blame others right
but there's another question what about
ourselves can we reach a level of
culture in which we can ask ourselves
really simple questions like the kind
you're asking it's very hard you take a
look at the discussion and across the
spectrum in the intellectual culture the
questions just aren't raised and that
means a lot of work to do serious work
starting right here in universities
[Applause]
because of time restrictions we only
have time for four more questions so I
apologize for everyone who came up but
if you guys could please take your seats
first of all thank you for coming and
thank you for the great talk so the
political revolution that Bernie Sanders
promotes is a bottom-up movement and
historically bottom-up movements in the
u.s. that have succeeded have required
the presence of a sympathetic government
so in today's conditions when the
government is unresponsive and can be
quite threatening
how can a grassroots movement be
successful well just take a look at her
own history and it takes a let's go back
to the 1950s in the 1950s black people
were being lynched in the south with
celebrations black a black person
couldn't sit in a bus a black student
couldn't sit at a lunch counter I mean
there were laws in the United States up
until much later in fact against
miscegenation which says if anyone had
one drop of black blood which means any
remote black ancestor they couldn't
marry a white person that was the 1950s
actually the 60s is it true today no why
well one reason is a a couple of black
students in Greensboro North Carolina
decided to sit-in at a lunch counter
they were of course immediately arrested
and dragged away I can't do a thing like
that I could have ended it but it didn't
a couple more black students came in the
next day it was a bigger arrest now
pretty soon you had some white students
coming down to the south
yeah the formation of
snake Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee yet Freedom Riders going to
areas in the south which are really like
Nazi Germany oh you could just be
slaughtered and for trying to allow a
black person to vote in fact I should
say that when Germany Nazi Germany was
searching around for some legal
precedent for their racist laws the
Nuremberg Laws the precedent they hit on
was the United States the United States
is the only country they could find
which had laws like the miscegenation
law they didn't quite accept u.s. laws
cost us laws were too severe the Nazis
didn't accept the one drop of blood long
and they thought that was too harsh but
that's the United States
it's the problems aren't over by any
means and certainly not over but they're
not what they were
and that's grassroots movement same with
a woman's movement same with just about
any advanced and society that you can
think of these are not gifts from above
they come from activist movements often
students are in the lead there's a good
reason for that students not just in
this country other countries to students
say you are our stage of their lives
where they are uniquely free think about
it you're sort of out of parental
control you're not yet in a situation
where you have to put bread on the table
to survive they have a lot of freedom
they have a lot of free you can take you
can think you can talk to each other or
you can go into that you're in a
situation in a any reasonable University
I'm sure here where you can explore you
can acquire if you have the resources
it's a time when people can really think
about things not just about how to make
money tomorrow but about other more
important
things and one of the results says
students are often in the lead that's
why you had snick Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee Freedom Riders
and others and the same is true today
so aggressive movements can do in a in a
relatively free country like this almost
anything I mean for fairly privileged
people in the United States like anybody
here it's a pretty free country by
comparative standards not like other
places so a lot of opportunities that
question is do you want to take them
in both the doomsday machine and his
early memoir secrets Daniel Ellsberg
sort of describes a culture within
military leadership just a general
disregard and dismissal of sort of
civilian officials authority in the
general public so that leads to the
question of how are we able to effect
change upon systems of power that ignore
or reject our attempts as citizens to
limit it how do you challenge the
prevailing culture let's just take a
look at the ways it's been done in the
past I mean the prevailing culture in a
you know in my lifetime
in fact in recent years the lifetime of
all the faculty here has changed
attitudes towards lots of things have
changed enormous ly as I say this
country had miscegenation rules laws up
into the late 60s I mean there was
nowhere in the world where they had
anything like that
now even the Nazis didn't go that for
okay
it was changed the United States heads
anti sodomy laws into up until the 2000s
okay that's changed how you changed and
take women's rights I'm in until you go
back to America look take a look at
American history when the country was
founded women were not legally not
people literally the United States took
over British common law you read
Blackstone British common law women are
property not people a woman is the
property of her father and the property
is handed over to the husband okay
in fact you look back at the
Constitutional Convention some of the
arguments against allowing women the
where that would be unfair to unmarried
men because a married man would have two
votes his own vote and the vote of the
property okay that's American law
through almost all of American history
in fact it wasn't until 1975 it's not
that long ago that the Supreme Court
determined that women are peers they
have a legal right to serve on federal
juries other things have happened to
again problems aren't over but it's a
huge change and case after case these
are by no means the only ones you find
out that we know exactly how to proceed
exactly how to proceed it's been done
over and over lots of opportunities it's
just a matter of taking them thank you
thank you so much for coming I was
hoping you could talk about the
neoliberal ization
of Education where students such as
myself have incurred thousands of
dollars of debt where words such as
diversity and inclusion are offered as
hollow solutions to the effects of white
supremacy and USNO hegemony and where
student activists are punished more
severely than racists and rapists on
campuses
[Applause]
so how can we deal with the neoliberal
programs specifically within the
university is how that's being pushed
universities
well the neoliberal programs which
really took off under Reagan and
Thatcher they're few things before but
these are if we could go through exactly
what they were but their consequences
are very clear and they were designed to
have those consequences so during the
neoliberal period that's basically since
Reagan well wealth asked highly
concentrated in very few hands and for
working people it's been stagnation or
decline literally the real wages for
American workers are actually literally
lower than they were before the
neoliberal programs began productivity
per worker amount of output per worker
as about doubled but wages have
stagnated or declined that money is
going somewhere
it's going in there very few pockets a
lot of it's going into financial
institutions we just exploded during
this period and do nothing for the
economy they probably arm it goes on and
on like this now that's the this also
incidentally undermines democracy by
perfectly obvious means that once wealth
becomes concentrated and corporate power
becomes unleashed one of the things they
do is just take over the political
system by pretty obvious means funding
lobbying writing legislation and so on
so the net effect is to make democracy
much less functional and we see the
effect
snow in the United States but elsewhere
democratic institutions are under attack
the cover of the journal Foreign Affairs
the main establishment Journal this
month take a look at the cover it says
is democracy dying it's the wrong
question question is are we killing
democracy and the answer is yes we've
designed systems which are killing
democracy that's you see it in election
after election not just in the United
States but through most of the developed
world anger fear contempt for centrist
institutions they're collapsing the main
parties are collapsing and so the
democratic system is being undermined
along along with the rest now what's
going on in the universities well that's
very interesting
since essentially the 1970s kind of
neoliberal revolute number of very
important things have happened
remember that US higher personal from K
to 12 there's been radical defunding
just killing the system and there are
major efforts to destroy the public
education system Koch brothers Alec the
big lobbying organization for
corporations are carrying out programs
state-by-state systematically to try to
get state legislators to pass laws which
will essentially eliminate the public
education system defund it make it
private and you know part of the
neoliberal system mass public education
is one of the great contributions of the
United States that's one of the major
u.s. contributions to modern democracy
late nineteenth century
the you know us initiated mass public
education which is extremely important
established at the and now they're
trying to kill it what about
universities same thing the u.s. stopped
public universities which were unknown
in the world in Britain nearest analogy
they didn't really start public
universities until after the Second
World War were at Birth University so
cold it was elite universities so the
land-grant universities were extended
generally higher education is also under
attack students are under attack
students are now coming out of college
with huge debts is that an economic
necessity of course not just take a look
at other successful industrial countries
like say Germany most successful
industrial country education is free and
it takes a Finland which ranks highest
and all international tests education is
free the same in case after case and the
same is true in poorer countries so go
south of the border this country called
Mexico ok it's poor country quite a good
education system I mean that teachers
are underpaid it's poor country but Unum
major at University of lectured there
very high quality it's free ok take the
United States up internal liberal
programs higher education was pretty
much free it was a much poorer country
than remember we're wave richer than we
were then but the GI Bill gave free
education and subsidies to huge numbers
of people who were would never have gone
to college it was very good for them was
very good for the country
wasn't flawless it was racist remember
almost everything was officially racist
housing everything else the GI Bill
didn't reach blacks because of the
segregated army until too late you know
but it certainly was a major advance in
fact even the Ivy League colleges were
pretty much free actually I went to one
in 1945 University of Pennsylvania at
the wishin was $100
a year and you could easily get a
scholarship because they did okay so has
anything changed I mean then we were
much but we're still a rich country but
much poorer than today so is there any
economic reason for the explosion of
tuitions no is there any reason why
administration and universities has
exploded well
faculty decision making us declined yeah
there's a reason imposition of business
models when you impose business models
on universities you get massive
inefficiency that's what the business
world is administration controlled
testing time okay so yes these things
are happening I mean there are not laws
of nature their decisions and decisions
can be reversed but to reverse them you
have to understand what's going on in
the world have to find the sources and
use all the means that are available to
bring the understanding to people and
reverse what's going on that's not that
hard
Louis can be changed the Koch brothers
don't have to succeed in getting state
legislators to destroy the public
education system they will if there's no
resistance but they don't have to it's
kind of interesting to look right now
the teacher strikes at one of them is in
Arizona where my wife and I live this is
the state that has the lowest
practically the lowest pay for teachers
in the country teachers in the country
are paid very low as compared to their
skill levels and other occupations
roughly 75% Arizona it's about sixty
percent they're now all on strike okay
West Virginia on strike Oklahoma on
strike all the deep red states for good
reasons that's where the budgets are cut
in order to kill the educational system
and other benefits for people and the
teachers are not just striking for
higher pay that's important
therefore striking to improve the
funding of education so that teachers
don't have to teach overcrowded classes
so the class has chalk to draw on a
blackboard that teacher doesn't have to
bring it in so they're not just saying
give us higher pay they're saying revive
the educational system so children will
be able to have a decent education and
go on for better lives and to improve
the country they're in the forefront of
this and they can be helped
I'm sorry we gotta cut it off right now
so thank you everyone for coming that's
it with the questions please give us
special thanks to dr. chauncey for
coming out and talking to us today
[Applause]
