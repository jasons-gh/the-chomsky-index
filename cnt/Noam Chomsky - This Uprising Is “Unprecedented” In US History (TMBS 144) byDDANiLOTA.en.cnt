welcome back to the Michael Brooks show
joining us now very very honored and
happy to have him as Professor Noam
Chomsky who has been a public
intellectual linguist activist
for decades and his author of course
many books including manufacturing
consent co-author that book big
influence on me and the show most
recently he's author of internationalism
or extinction universalizing resistance
professor Chomsky thank you so much for
being here with you can you give us
first-year broad reaction to the
uprisings that we've seen across the
United States and in fact globally over
the past couple of weeks centered very
specifically and initially on the police
murders and George Floyd and Brianna
Taylor and then in encompassing race
policing capital and so on what what are
your thoughts as you look at these these
movements happening well the first thing
that comes to mind is the absolutely
unprecedented scope scale of
participation engagement than public
support I mean if you take a look at
polls its astonishment the public
support vote for black lives matter and
for the protesters that well beyond what
it was say for Martin Luther King that
the peak of his popularity at the time
of the I have a dream speech
[Music]
waving envoy and that's it's also far
beyond the level of reaction to earlier
events though there were public reaction
strong ones to many earlier these
killings but nothing like this now maybe
the most
it's similar was the reaction to the
beating of Rodney King for the beat of
almost to death movie after the
attackers were freed in the courts
without charge now there was a week of
protests sixteen people were killed we
had to call in federal troops to quell
the protests but it was in Los Angeles
where it happened something else where
nothing like this know it's everybody
and it's not just the police killing
it's background issues so it's beginning
to move into concern and enquiries and
protests about the facts that lead
through events like this occurring shows
enormous rise in consciousness related
otherwise and consciousness above 400
years of vicious repression unremitting
even a very bitter legacy deep issue the
whole source of economic cultural
recognition of that willingness what do
you think accounts for the unprecedented
nature unprecedented nature of this I
think it's the result of many years of
intensive activism that we seen it in
many other ways so for example years ago
the New York Times ran a important
series highlighting an important series
1691 the history of racism in the United
States 1619 because that was the year
when the when black slaves began coming
substantial numbers scattered of cases
for but it's from 1690 you couldn't have
imagined that a few years ago and that's
one of many signs of what I hope are
really significant changes they seem to
be in the way which was a tribute to the
groups like black lives matter others
bring musicians to public attention
making people think about them wearing
what happened as the reaction right now
because Trump's culture you're bringing
up the hideous record of that it's quite
important that when you go back to say
Ronald Reagan when he opened his
campaign in Philadelphia Mississippi in
town which is known for owning one from
the murder of civil rights was the
message was pretty plain it was very
there's much more reaction now and the
and the parallels are are quite stark
there it's very hard to get a grasp on
something like this in terms of you know
various types of reporting
misinformation and so on so we need to
approach it gingerly but as someone who
has a rooting in some respects in the
anarchist tradition to maybe in many
respects what is your thought on this
autonomous zone that's arisen arose in
Seattle it's one of the number of very
interesting development import reactions
to the endemic important reactions this
creating the structures of mutual
support and cooperation that extricate
themselves from the governmental
structures which have been shown to be
completely inadequate in dealing with
the particular problems like getting
water the people who need what
fundamental problems of why will the
waters of the desperately unprepared
food crisis no they thought of a song is
a interesting case in this also striking
to see the support the mayor of Seattle
sports there were plenty of popular
support nice driving Trump and Fox News
and Spain but that's a positive sign
something important is - again what we
need but I think it's an important
manifestation of the sense that we've
got to take our lives under control is
it is it important to reframe that a bit
that that something can arise and may
even result important quote failure but
if there's information in it and if it
expresses a certain impulse towards
justice or you know and so on that it
doesn't need to be kind of linearly
measured as a quote unquote success or
failure failure or complicated things
any serious struggle is going to have
moments of regression nothings don't
work out the way you expect so you pick
up you go on from there anyone you can
think of civil rights it's a process and
I take say the Sanders campaign a lot of
young people I get letters all the time
see things posted say tried lost so
it's not what happened what happened was
a tremendous success unparalleled
success nothing like this has happened
in US political history actually almost
ever since the real populist movement
the radical farmers movement was crushed
by force here's a the spectrum of
discussion has been substantially
shifted things that were not on the
agenda
not long ago are from center the
universal health care called amplified
by the pandemic disaster green New Deal
the result of that and serious activism
by a small group of young people who
occupied congressional offices and the
background was the sander success young
members of Congress who swept into power
able to support them now that's on the
agenda
issue after issue the Sanders has made
the tactical decision which some
criticized but I think he's correct
to join the Biden campaign and push it
to the left his associates are working
on Planning Commission's and in fact if
you look at the program that's merged
farther to the left than anything since
FDR offers lots of opportunities now
this didn't happen by magic happens kind
of like the green New Deal happened by
constant pressure and activism that's
the way the left aura conceived of
Elections pushing the button is not the
issue it's the constant activism that is
reshaping the array of choices issues
policies and you don't win by snapping
your fingers some things work some
things fail then you pick up and you go
on from there
and I think we've seen as
different changes over the years I think
the title of tonight's episode might be
you don't win by snapping your fingers
which is unfortunate if only it were so
