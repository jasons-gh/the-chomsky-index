the following program is a uwtv classic
from the University of Washington in
Seattle upon reflection with Al P our
guest is Professor Noam Chomsky from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and a guest lecturer at the University
of Washington what determines how
language in a particular country evolves
why is French for example so different
from German well first of all you're
assuming the French is different from
German and the French would probably say
so you know there's no simple measure of
how different languages are from one
another in fact if you look at the
languages structurally the way a
linguist would look at them French is
different from the other Romance
languages in a variety of ways which are
which make it more similar to German and
other Germanic languages there are a
number of features of French which are
sort of Germanic and character give us
some of those features well for us to
take a simple one in all the romance
languages except for French you can
delete the subject of a sentence you can
say the equivalent of walks to the store
meaning he walks to the store we can't
do that in English but you can do it in
Italian or Spanish and in fact it's
common romance goes right back to Latin
French is the only Romance language in
which you can't do that it's like a
Germanic language pretty much in that
respect in there they have what they
call clinics small pronouns that you
attach to verbs they say the equivalent
of I him saw that's common romance but
in the other Romance languages you can
do things like I him want to see you do
that an old meaning I want to see him
but not in French and the for a variety
of constructions actually there quite a
number of respects which French is
different from the other Romance
languages incidentally old French with
middle France a French in the medieval
period was not it was like the other
Romance languages so something happened
to it
made it less like the Romance languages
and more like the Germanic languages how
does language change over time how did
18th century French change compared to
12th century French well you know when
we talk about language change that's
very misleading I mean there is no such
thing as a language in France I mean up
until they the turn of the century you
could find people in nearby villages in
France who couldn't understand what
virtually could not understand one
another
the idea of a national language is a
pretty modern phenomenon it has to do
with the rise of nationalism and
communication and so on or take say
Italy today or Germany today I mean the
difference is among the things that we
call German are enormous so enormous is
to lead to non mutual intelligibility
you have to learn the national language
when you go to school it's a different
language than the one you spoke at home
and when we talk about language changing
what's actually happening is that
there's some kind of like species
changing there's a mixture of all sorts
of dialects and the the mix changes over
time either because of conquest or some
political change or boundaries are drawn
in a different place or you know some
kind of commercial interchange or
whatever the mixture of these things
changes over time and you know you take
a look at it a few centuries apart it
looks like there's a different language
but what's happened is what happens is
it between generations there are usually
small changes having to do with other
influences from the outside and so on
and these things are cumulative
sometimes they lead to pretty dramatic
changes nothing within a couple of
generations the language can have a
contained structurally in quite dramatic
ways and of course in say lexicon you
know the words of the language will
that's a different matter altogether so
when technology develops you get a whole
new vocabulary but if you were in France
in the 12th century and you understood
all the nuances of language could you
have predicted how these various
languages would have evolved over time
no it's totally impossible
I mean is it but is it is a partially
random it's not so much the Randa oh
it's not actually random I thought
might be completely deterministic
there's just too many factors involved
it's like you know it's like predicting
whether it's just too many things going
on the human life is a pretty
complicated affair and now culture
cultures at Tempe speakers of English
can be misled by this English is
relatively homogeneous you can go a long
way in the United States you know I mean
I just came from Boston and I understand
everybody in Portland and there Seattle
and so on but that's not true most of
the world most of the world language
areas language that you can get very
different language is pretty close by
and much of the world is what we would
call multilingual the closer I get to
the border between France and Germany
would the closer the language has become
yeah well in particular if you go from
say Paris to Rome as you go toward the
Italian border it starts to sound more
more like Italian and at some point it
becomes Italian and there's there isn't
in fact coming up by now there's you
know that there's enough national unity
and so on so you can really find the
border but if you go back a little ways
there was no border it was just I
wouldn't say continuum there's just
constant changes and fluctuations and
variations and then you started speaking
one thing in one place and another thing
in another place and they're not
mutually intelligible often but along
the way they're just all sorts of
changes now with the rise of national
States and especially national
communications and national education
systems and all of these things which is
a pretty modern phenomenon then you get
what we call national languages now as I
say English is unusual the reason if you
go to pre-colonial times there were just
hundreds of thousands probably of
different languages spoken and what's
now called United States well through
the destruction of the indigenous
population and it was real destruction
kind of genocidal and the conquest by
speakers of basically one group you
ended up having a large homogeneous
language but how can anybody have
predicted that I mean it had
with the invention of guns and you know
wholesale reticle quest and all sorts of
things and that's pretty much what human
history is are some French theorists for
example who argue that they must work
very hard to keep the French language
pure what does that mean doesn't mean
anything
I mean there's an old I mean it
virtually every national language every
national culture or at least the
European ones maybe others has a
mythology that that's the only real pure
language and all the others are corrupt
in France this is this position is kind
of extreme in fact you have active its
origins it's even a little bit comical I
don't know if any has actually studied
it but if you go back to say the 18th
century and you read say deed row he
explains deed row very seriously that he
says here's a prediction for you he says
France is going to be the language of
science and German and English will be
the language of literature and the
reason for this is that French is very
clear in France the words follow the
order of the thoughts whereas if you
look at he wasn't a German and English
the words don't quite follow the words
of the thought so France is good for
telling the French is good for telling
the truth because of its what the later
came to be called its Gallic lucidity
and clarity whereas a German and I think
his examples were German in English
maybe Italian or it's the their good
language for telling fantasies and
falsehood so they'll be the languages of
literature not you can it's a sort of
naive point of view but you see what was
going on in his head I mean for him the
words in French followed the order of
thoughts when you hear gentlemen it
seems all confused I mean thinking of
some other way speaker of German looks
the opposite of course and I suspect
that the mythology above the purity and
lucidity and
clarity of French goes back to ideas of
that kind after all French culture had a
certain dominance and appeal for a long
time so these attitudes get established
but what does it mean for the language
to be pure or when people say they want
English to be pure what are they talking
about it was Shakespeare pure I mean in
fact every stage of history languages
are there is for there is no such thing
as a language there are just lots of
different ways of speaking that
different people have which are more or
less similar to one another and some of
them may have may may have prestige
associated with them for example some of
them may be the speech of a conquering
group or a wealthy group or priestly
caste or one thing or another and we may
decide okay those are the good ones and
some other one is the bad one but if if
social and political relations reversed
we'd make the opposite conclusions right
they take black English today black
English is considered not quite proper
English on the other hand if blacks
happen to have all the power and owned
all the corporations and whites were
working for them it would be the other
way around
okay English would be the language of
culture and science and so on and the
stuff that you and I speak would be
considered a degenerate dialect which
you have to get people out of so that
they'll be able to think but that raises
an interesting question why does
language have rules why were we taught
these rules in grade school why is bad
grammar bad grammar well when you're
taught rules of your own language in
grade school the chances are very strong
that what you're being taught is false
otherwise you would have to be taught it
but I can see every grade school teacher
about to throw an orange at you on the
screen there's unfortunately this is
well we have to let might be a little
more nuanced one of the things you learn
in grade school is the literary language
now in English the literary standard is
not so radically different from what say
you and I grew up with but it's somewhat
different the literary standard is not
what I learned in the streets it's not
very different but it's
little different and when I went to
school I had I was taught the literary
standard now the literary standard has
some principles associated with it some
of which are those of a real language
some of which are completely artificial
they were made up by people who had
crazy ideas about language and they're
all given names you never heard of yeah
and in fact the reason you have to teach
them is because they are not the
person's language nobody that your
actual language already teaches your
language grows in your head you know you
can't stick a child in a young child in
an environment where people are speaking
language and that child can no more help
knowing that language then the child can
help growing it's just part of human
growth is for the some component of the
brain that pick up the language you
can't learn it and you don't learn it
anyone you learn to see now the fact is
that the the system that grows in the
brain is sometimes different from a
system which is regarded for whatever
reason as necessary or appropriate or
approved or something some pristy to
some prestige dialect and it may be
different from what grew in your brain
it typically is or may be a way of
trying to get us to have a common bond
through language well it possible I mean
I think that's see that's a problem in
places like say Italy in Italy when you
if somebody grows up in the Piedmont
area and somebody else grows up in
Naples area they think totally different
languages they can neither can
understand a word the others saying so
there are when you teach what they call
Italian which is the language roughly of
the area of Florence of Tuscany you're
teaching people what it amounts to a
second language and it's the national
language seems true in Germany and China
while China is even worse because what
we call Chinese is a set of languages
which are as different from one another
is
Romance languages they just happen to be
all yellow on the map or something and
they happen to be a unified political
area but there's no sense in which they
are the same length we call them Chinese
dialects but that would be like calling
French and Romanian two different
dialects of the same language Latin or
something I mean all these terms have no
linguistic meaning they have only
socio-political meaning of a very
complex sort and the way in which they
interact with authority structures is
crucial so what we call good English is
a system which is partly artificial I
should say which is taught to people
because it was legislated to be good
English not some of what it's taught it
breaks the rules of any conceivable
human language that's why it has to be
taught over and over again so I don't
know if people still do it in school but
when I was in school you had to learn
all sorts of complicated nonsense about
Shaolin will which nobody could ever
remember I mean I forget woodwork I
shall you will or something strangely
that violates there's no I mean there
are certain principles of human biology
which determine what a language can be
and though language can be like that so
that had to be that in fact we even
trace that back and you find out who
invented it you know some bishop from
the 17th century or something invented
it decided that's the way it's supposed
to be now that kind of thing of course
has to be taught because it's totally
artificial or you have to teach people
how to say he and I instead of him and
me well English sort of works the other
way I mean if nobody was bothering you
in English you'd probably say him and me
or here or something like that but you
taught in the standard language not to
do that there's some other invented
language which is called the literary
standard which you don't do it and you
ask the question why do you have to
teach people well you have to teach them
because it's artificial it's not their
language and often it's not just not
their language sometimes it's not even
any possible way why is pronunciation
and intonation so important to language
why aren't words themselves sufficient
to convey meaning well you have to
understand somebody else's words I mean
if you go to central London and
somebody's Brown speaking cockney and
the words happen the match airs at some
abstract level you still may not
understand the the pronunciation may be
different enough so that you're the part
of your knowledge of language is a way
of decoding noises that you hear and
converting them into a system that
matches your own representations
sometimes not in order for that decoding
system to work the systems have to be
close enough you and I can do it
actually if you listen to us closely
we're speaking different languages but
they're close enough so that we want to
mate I don't have problem decoding you
and you don't have a problem decoding me
but again that's a little artificial
that's because of the artificial unity
of the English language spoken in the
United States I happen to be in England
last week and I've confined myself in
places in England where I don't
understand what they're saying I mean if
I listen to them for a while we can
establish communication but you have to
kind of retune your system in some
manner that's not understood so that you
can begin to decode what you're hearing
what role does slang having a language
why does slang exist people are I don't
know but the fact is people are very
innovative that I can do things
differently and especially teenage
cultures of a white a teenagers wear
different clothes well you know whatever
the reason is they want to be different
they like to be innovative they're
creative and to the sabbatical fashions
in language oh sure and then in fact
there are styles of different groups of
a change some of them change very
rapidly the words that are in and one
era or archaic and another of the year
it can be three years or something like
that when people are playing with their
languages often again this is not too
common in our societies our societies
remember basically technological
societies our intelligence and
creativity and so on goes into other
things but if you go to say Central
Australia where you're simply finding
basically Stone Age tribes there's a lot
of innovation in language a lot of the
cultural wealth has to do with playing
games with languages and constructing
elaborate kinship systems and things
which probably have no or little
functional utility it's just the
creative mind of work you know so you
get very complex language game
a special language system taught as a
puberty right and only a particular
group of people speak it nobody else
understands it how does language differ
in the way that it's used in the arts
first of all there's a variety of
conventions are formal conventions that
are humanly created but undoubtedly
reflect our aesthetic capacities that's
at a framework within which they set a
framework of rule humanly imposed rule
within people within which people create
so if you find an extreme case if your
write a sonnet you have to come pretty
close to a fixed frame and while that's
an extreme case the same is true of
other literary conventions some of these
the part of human creative intervention
has been to create forms aesthetic forms
which are somehow either
appealing to us or challenge our
intelligence or whatever and it's a you
work within them I mean after all
painting a painting on a piece of canvas
that's but has a boundary that's pretty
recent in human history and that itself
imposes a framework which determines the
kind of art that you can produce and in
the literary use of language is just
everything from the structure of a novel
to the to the metric character of a
poetic form is one or another human
invention do you respond the poetry
right you have time to read it does it
does it make you think differently so
what goes on in your thought process
well you know that's an eye I don't feel
confident to say but it's a topic that
has been discussed quite intelligently
so for example if you read say not by me
I have nothing to say about it no one
pretend to but if you read this a
williamson's
seven types of ambiguity you get an
intriguing account of why poetry makes
you think in part because it's a
compressed and you only get hints so the
reader has to impose a lot of structure
you have to put your own self into and
then park because you're the strict the
formal structure itself input
is a challenge to the intelligence if
you just throwing paints around randomly
it's not a work of art you know but when
there when it's done within the
framework of a humanely constructed
system of rule it at least you've got
the prerequisites for a work of art
still may not be whatever it takes
whatever creativity is and that's not
understood that has to be there too but
I certainly I have nothing to say about
these topics I wouldn't pretend to we
bring up another area you can claim you
have no expertise in and that's the use
of humor we respond to people who use
humor and communication yet it's not
taught in grade school we don't we're
not taught how to be comedians but we
respond to it and that seems to be the
case in almost every language well see I
don't think that is to commit too much
to do with language we can be humorous
in other ways too
a clown can be humorous without using
the use of without using language and
nobody teaches a child how to laugh at a
clown now I think we're going here to
interesting topics but topics where
nothing is understood but there's no
doubt in my mind that there's something
about human nature the basic structure
of the human mind brain which makes
certain things comical and other things
not just as there are certain things
about the human brain that makes some
things come out to be human language and
others not although they could be a
Martian language or something and at its
root it's I don't think fundamentally
different from the fact that we grow
arms and not wings now we don't know why
we grow arms and not wings but you
assume that it's got something to do
with the human genetic endowment and I
think the comparable assumption is true
in all these cases one of the part of
the fascination of the study of language
is that it's one of the few examples
where you can really get some insight
into how it works these other topics
that you're mentioning say humor should
be subjected to the same kind of study
but so far it hasn't been clear how to
do it the words of endlessly fascinating
I think because it's amazing how
somebody can walk in a room hear a few
words and walk out crying or angry or
this whole series of emotions simply
with a few words that doesn't that
constantly amaze you it's not just words
again it could be a fleeting picture and
takes a caricature you see a few lines
and it brings to your mind a person in a
situation maybe a tragic situation or
comical situation or whatever I mean the
human mind is a very marvelous thing
it's it's got an extremely intricate and
complex structure which at least at a
scientific level we understand very
little about but what you're describing
too is central part of it little hints
here and there succeed in evoking in us
very rich experience and interpretation
and what's more it's done surprisingly
uniformly for different people which
mean and it's of course done within a
training or very minimal training that
we would know how to train people to do
this so is it somehow must be the only
logical possibility aside
angels are acts of God is it something
rooted in our nature
I mean qualitatively speaking these
phenomena are very much like physical
growth the the nutrition that's given to
an organism to an embryo is not what
determines that it's going to be a human
or a bird what determines that it's
going to be a human or a bird is
something about its internal structure
and what determines that we are going to
be the kind of creature that can speak
and that can interpret a sign or a line
about lines or something as evoking an
emotional experience or whatever that's
something in our nature but it's so far
beyond what we know how to study that
you can only weight your hands at it at
the moment how should parents react with
respect to exposing their children to
language should they expose them to all
aspects of language or should they
simply let them develop any way they
develop and suspect there's very little
that parents can do to change the course
of language development I mean you can
prime in you can we know from experience
a I'm not speaking about this from any
expertise I don't have any more
expertise than personal experience
there's nothing in linguistic theory
that gives answers to this question but
experience suffice is to indicate that
in no cases that you can create an
environment in which a five-year-old
will sound like a college professor and
comical but they'll use big words and
you know complicated sentences and so on
I suspect you probably harming the
five-year-old but it's possible to do
that children can be molded on the other
hand if you just leave them alone
they're going to pick up the language of
their culture typically they'll pick up
the language of their peers quite
typically there are exceptions but
typically children will learn the
language they heard in the streets so
take me my father spoke with a Ukrainian
accent and my
other spoke with a mixed New York with
Alain Ian's accent and I spoke up in
Philadelphia because that's what the
kids were talking in the streets and
undoubtedly if you really took my speech
patterns and so on a side you'd find
influences from the parents and the
uncles and so on but overwhelmingly it's
a you pick up the pure culture why this
happens nobody knows and how it but but
there's something about humans children
that's it that gets them to grow the
language that's roughly that of their
peers and it's it's a very rich system
that's an extremely rich system you they
don't try they can't prevent themselves
from doing it they can't make it happen
the parents can enrich the children
anyone who has a two-year-old knows that
the kid is running around all over the
place trying to find out what the name
of everything is you know what's that
what's that what's that and you can help
them and you can you know you can read
the children and show them pictures and
they're all fascinated with it they're
in a their periods a very rapid language
growth where you just can't say she ate
the curiosity fast enough amazingly it's
unbelievable in fact what actually
happens is is really astonishing I mean
there have been for example at the peak
periods of a forget the structure of
language which is complicated enough but
just take vocabulary acquisition the
simplest part at peak periods of
acquisition of vocabulary learning new
words children are picking them up at
maybe a rate of one an hour there's
nothing which means that they're
essentially learning a word on one
exposure and the adults go into adult
education and die trying to learn a new
language oh yeah but you know if you
think what it means to learn a word on
one exposure the way to understand how
amazing and achievement this is is to
try to define a word so suppose you had
an organism that wasn't equipped to
learn the words of human language and
you really had to teach it those words
by training what you'd first have to
define a word what is the meaning of
table for instance nobody can do that
you have to define the definition you're
using to define the word but you see
what we call definitions are not
definition
hints if you take the oxford english
dictionary another one you read with a
magnifying glass and they give you a
long detailed thing which they call the
definition of a word in fact it's very
far from the definition of a word it's a
few hints that a person who already
knows the concept can use to understand
what's going on but remember the child
is picking that up not from the Oxford
English Dictionary with its whole array
of hints the child is picking it up from
seeing and used once or twice now that
can only mean one thing it can only mean
that the concept itself and all of its
richness and complexity is somehow
sitting there waiting to have a sound
associated with it now that can't be
quite true but something very much like
that it's probably true that's why you
and I will have essentially the same
concept of table than the same concept
of person and of you know nation are all
sorts of things and not complicated
things I mean really simple things like
like person for instance or thing you
know will have that even though we all
have very limited experience because
basically we started with those concepts
we're getting down to the end of the
show do you ever see a time when the
study of language and linguistics will
not fascinate you well I suppose so it
must come some time when your mind
deteriorate to the point where you can't
do with hard questions I guess that will
happen professor Noam Chomsky from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

of Washington upon reflection
