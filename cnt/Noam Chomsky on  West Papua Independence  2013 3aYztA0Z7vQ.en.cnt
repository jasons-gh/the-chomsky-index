well the suppression of West poplin
independence and the atrocities carried
out we have to be right now at the 15th
anniversary of one of the massacres and
the support for it the robbery of
resources the support for by Australia
Western powers major scandal 60 years
didn't have much to do with the Cold War
I'm in the Cold War's always a pretext
for everything that happened but it
would have been pretty much the same as
Russia didn't exist
it was devastated demolished politics
really has yet to be covered in any
serious way so sure this West Berlin
East ignored the other cases that fall
right within that no Russians it's being
replayed over and over right now
well unfortunately but what will happen
to this is so big actual populations
their culture their society under this
very severe repression with corporate
support you know my name Western support
and so on
if prospects are very bright but you
really can't tell it takes eight East
Timor close close that along what
happened there what happened in the by
the late seventies it was virtual
genocide they may be killed quarter of
the population it looked totally
hopeless under the number of you could
cap you know you could fit into this
room the number of activists who were
working on it I can name them for you
practically in Australian here
it just looked hopeless well took a long
time finally in 1999 there was another
outburst of Indonesian violence and
repression
you know they practiced roid the capital
city 200 thousand people in the hills us
continued to support them continued the
National Security Adviser for Clinton
sandy Berger said you know it's not
interfere of people carry out massacres
from slaughter you know we can't do
anything about it
we got a continue to support Indonesia a
US military forces were carrying out
joint operations with the Indonesian
army after all of this happened finally
in September 11th Clinton was an
international conference
there was a lot of international
protests at that time there was also the
rising domestic protest partly it was
the activist movements that had been
working for decades partly it was
far-right Catholic groups and then East
Timor was Catholic
Indonesia is Muslim so that complicated
story it was possible to get influential
far-right Catholic groups put pressure
on the government that all of these
factors combined Clinton informed the
Indonesian generals the game is over a
couple of sentences next day they
withdrew could have happened for 25
years after they withdrew a UN
peacekeeping force Australian but
peacekeeping force editor which was a
good thing you take a look at how that's
handled in history let's handle is a
great case of humanitarian intervention
on what it really was was an
extraordinary scandal 25 years the u.s.
continued support the crimes atrocities
is in virtual genocide it could have
stopped it in one minute you'll also
invade anyone you don't need sanctions
even threats just stop supporting it
it's over that's what the record shows
and that's called humanitarian
intervention pretty striking story of
about intellectual culture but let's
turn to as powerful it could be the same
I think
West Papua and resistance with stands
with other cases of resistance to
massive terror and oppression as a
symbol of the inspiring symbol of what
humans can accomplish and it may yet
succeed if the West is willing to face
up to its own responsibilities
actions can succeed
