modern scientific revolution starting
with Galileo essentially was aimed to
construct a picture of the world that
was mechanical an idea that the world
was a machine big complicated machine
made out of things like levers and gears
and so on which essentially could be
construct could be constructed in
principle by a master artisan of course
nobody's smart enough to do it but it
had that character kind of thing you
could construct like a huge clock or
something like that and in fact it was
assumed it was constructed by a super
partisan you know better than any human
artisan but it was a mechanical device
that was called the mechanical
philosophy but remember philosophy
doesn't in science so it was essentially
the science of mechanics Descartes was a
major figure in advancing and developing
the mechanical philosophy the conception
of the world is machine the idea was
from roughly Galileo lawn to overcome
the mystical character of neo scholastic
science the reigning physics of the day
which held that the world was operated
in terms of mystical forces so if say a
flower grows from a seed that's because
it has a vegetative force and if
something falls to the ground that's
because that's its natural place and
where it wants to be and if two things
attract one of each other it's because
they have a sympathy and if they repel
one another they have an antipathy and
if I see a tube let's say rotating in
space it's because the physical cue the
form of the cube rotating in space
Flitz through the air in some fashion
and gets into my brain and in my brain
there's a cube rotating in space so
that's what I see that these are the ID
this kinds of conceptions of the physics
of the day physics and physiology of the
day and the goal of the mechanical
philosophy was try to get rid of all
that stuff an account forever
in terms of strictly mechanical
principles that could be understood
principles of the principles that we see
when we see a machine parts of machine
working and try to show that the whole
world works like that
well Descartes made they made a lot of
progress in this he extended the
mechanical philosophy to he thought he
extended it to the biological world to a
good part of human nature so for example
probably his most lasting scientific
contribution of saloons can really be
restated in somewhat different forms
today had to do with this theory of
vision so he and other scientists the
day mocked the idea that the form of a
object Flitz through the air and gets
into your mind that's pure mysticism
it's got to be a mechanical interchange
of some kind and he had a theory of
light which was mechanical and
recognized that the retinal image was on
your retina is not the cube rotating in
space or let's say if I look at the
audience I see people sitting around and
so on but that's not the retinal image
the retinal image is some complicated
two-dimensional display which could be
interpreted in all sorts of ways
Descartes recognized that what you see
must be a construction of the mind has
to come from the inside in the terms
that were used by later philosophers
working on this the sense the sensory
organs just provide the occasion for
experience which hits the sensory organs
provides the occasion for the mind to
construct experience using its own
internal resources some cognitive powers
and times of the day which were
understood to be innate they had to be
innate cut not agnostic ative hard to
say powers properties of the mind which
somehow use the occasion of sense to
create what you see a tube rotating in
space people
walking down the street people sitting
in front of me whatever it may be this
it was also understood as I say that
this was innate so for example Descartes
was struck by the fact he didn't do the
experiments but if he did the
experiments that would come out the way
he imagined even Galileo didn't do most
of the famous experiments he mostly
imagined they're flawed experiments some
some of them are physically impossible
in fact but the the Descartes did a
thought experiment which is undoubtedly
correct he asked how is it that if you
have an infant with who's never seen a
triangle let's say and you draw tres if
I were to draw a triangle on the
blackboard and the infant were to look
at it what the infant would perceive is
a triangle but in fact what I drew is
certainly not a triangle I mean there's
some physical thing which could possibly
be a triangle I mean maybe two of the
lines we didn't quite come together
would be curved or whatever so why is it
that the infant perceives a triangle
maybe a distorted triangle and not a
perfect image of exactly what it is why
is that the case and it into experiments
now you find that is the case
well his conclusion was that it must be
that the innate structure of the mind is
based on principles like those of
Euclidian geometry and on the occasion
of sense the mind simply constructs a
triangle and whatever the sensory object
is as seen as some distortion of what
the mind construct all of this is and
then he had theories of how the sensory
image gets into the mind which
constructs those things and so on
mechanical theories which we wouldn't
put in quite those terms today but can
be restated in in modern terms with that
very dramatic change apart from the
mechanisms a lot of it all of this is
quite plausible and in fact apparently
true in a
modern reformulation and modern
neurophysiology in perceptual psychology
is giving sharper accounts which are
roughly at that time they cart pursued
this as far as he could he wanted to see
how far you could go and giving a
hypothetical account of the way the
world could be machine up to things like
human sensation and perception and he
concluded that you could go quite a long
way but that some things were left out
what was left out primarily was acts of
human will which he said are our most
noblesse possession the only thing was
truly human so he there was a lot of
interest in those days in automata just
as there is today the automata and that
at that time were complicated devices
you know that were made by a master
artisans and did all sorts of amazing
things and the question naturally arose
what's the difference between a human an
automaton if there is any and they card
argued that this is precisely where the
difference would lie factor him it was
the difference between humans and
automata and also between humans and
animals which were automata the
difference lay in acts of will so in the
case of a machine an automaton if you
said it sparks in a certain arrangement
and you have some external input the
machine is compelled to act in a certain
fashion as a choice about the matter it
could be random it's because these are
going to be random or determinant on the
other hand if you take a human being and
use quarks or internal parts are
arranged in a certain way and it has a
certain sensory experience it may be as
they put it incited and inclined to act
in a certain manner but it might but
it's not compelled that there's a could
act in a different manner so if somebody
were to walk up here with you know
assault rifle or something and order
everyone to stand up and say you know
Hitler or something and if you took them
seriously not very probable that
everybody would do it
you'd be incited and inclined to do it
but we all know that there is a choice
you might decide to get killed let's say
because you want to do it and those
things are not determined
there's no mechanistic determination of
that if we know and we know that as well
as we know anything at all and that is
kind of irreducible phenomenal knowledge
experience and Descartes argue that
that's the crucial difference between
humans and animals insanely we have no
reason to doubt that at the moment but
anyhow that's the correct Asian argument
the most striking example that he
offered was in fact language use he
pointed out that ordinary use of
language and I mean writing poetry or
anything just you know telling your
friends at a bus stop or whatever
ordinary use of language has a kind of
creative aspect its unbounded people are
always saying the things that we're
never heard before and their experience
or maybe in human history they don't
know that they're knows there's no way
of knowing whether a sentence that you
just heard is one you've heard before
impossible so human ordinary human
interchange with language is constantly
innovative and productive and unbounded
in facts infinite and technical sense on
the other hand it's also undetermined so
you can't determine what a person's want
to say on the basis of the situation
that they're in or the arrangement of
their internal organs on the other hand
it's not random so it's not caused by
situations or internal states but it's
somehow appropriate to situations it's
coherent other people understand that it
evokes thoughts and other people which
they could have expressed that way
themselves say it has a thought and
maybe they do have the thought after
they hear the expression so these this
collection of properties of being
unbounded
undetermined uncaused but appropriate
The Situation's coherent evoking
thoughts and others and so on that's a
kind of creative aspect of language use
and the Descartes argued that that's the
striking difference between humans on a
conical there was a lot of interest in
those days and trying to train in asking
whether you could construct an automaton
or train an animal or whatever to act
the way a human does and they most most
with the the experiments turned on they
were their work again weren't actually
carried out that most experiments in
that period even in physics marked
carried out it was thought about the
experiments turned on this you know so
if people will list the kinds of
experimental techniques you might try to
see if another organ another object that
looks like you has a mind like yours and
they're mostly language tests based on
the creative aspect of language well in
order to deal with these apparent facts
and we have no reason to doubt that
they're facts in fact they seem to be
facts in order to deal with that
Descartes had a problem you couldn't
incorporate this within the mechanical
philosophy so it wasn't a matter of
gears and levers and so on so he was
forced to invent a new principle which
is standard science incidentally
something isn't explained by the
principles you have you construct the
new principle the new principle is what
he called the mind so alongside of the
body which works by mechanical
principles there's another principle a
kind of creative principle as other
properties - which is mine that's the
famous Cartesian dualism so there's the
world consists of body and special human
characteristic mind which distinguishes
humans from animals and automata and
turns on factors like these and others
but primarily these the what was the
fate of this doctrine here's where
misunderstanding and
the fate of this doctrine was should be
clearly understood it was overthrown
within a generation by Isaac Newton but
what Newton showed was that the theory
of body was wrong didn't have anything
to say about the theory of mind that
stayed unchanged Newton showed that the
world just isn't a machine it works by
mystical forces that was an appalling
discovery out they had Newton considered
it a total absurdity and to the end of
his life tried to overcome it but it was
apparently true then the force of
attraction is has nothing does not
involve contact so I can you know
unbelievable as it is move the moon by
lifting my arm and that's just the way
the world works
it has mystical forces as I say Newton
was regarded this is a total absurdity
who has sharply condemned by the
scientists of the day the leading
scientists of the day for returning to
neo scholastic mysticism with occult
forces as they were called that made the
world work so uncho that the world
couldn't possibly be a machine and these
were unintelligible forces we couldn't
understand they were mysterious I mean
common sense tells us that I can only
make something move by touching it being
in contact with it in some fashion but
Newtonian physics said no that's not
true there's a not called force that
allows you to make things move and that
accounts for the terrestrial motion and
planetary motion and the tides and so on
and so forth well as I say this is
considered a total absurdity but it was
apparently true and what it does is
demolish the conception of body it
demolishes the idea that the world is a
machine it isn't it has mystical forces
it's common these days to say to
ridicule the Cartesian idea would ghosts
in the machine
the minds
ghost inside the machine but that's
misunderstanding what was exercised was
the machine not the ghost ghost state or
what turned out the world was not a
machine there are no machines in the
sense of our common sense understanding
and the mechanical philosophy the
physics of the day so that goal was
undermine it turns out the world is in
Dean unintelligible to us we have to
accept the existence of mystical forces
we can try to construct develop an
understanding of the principles
doctrines about them and so on but
they're not intelligible to human
understanding and the mind stays where
it was this these ideas were moral and
this was like I said to say a hint of an
outrageous discovery Newton tried to
overcome it to the end of his days into
the well into the 20th century
physicists were still trying to
construct some kind of mechanical
conception of the universe by now that's
finally been abandoned totally and
people are accustomed to even more
mystical emotions like fuels which are
mathematical objects but still interact
with one another electromagnetic forces
a conception of space and time which
eliminates any notion of solidity or in
fact every fall of common sense is just
go on it's not even a not even it's not
even considered relevance at this point
yes the world is unintelligible to our
common sense but that's just the way it
is we do the best we can and trying to
construct doctrines about
