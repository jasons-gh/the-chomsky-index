welcome to on contact we're in Cambridge
Massachusetts to speak to Professor Noam
Chomsky has there ever been an
organization in history which has
dedicated itself to the destruction of
the possibility of organized human life
that's actually what we're facing
contact with Chris Hedges Noam Chomsky
is probably America's greatest
intellectual who has written on the
Palestine Israel conflict the nature of
the liberal class and a capitalist
democracy how imperialism works as well
as the reconfiguration of the American
economy into an oligarchic system that
makes war on the middle class this is
part one of our conversation with
Professor Chomsky in his office at MIT
with Chris Hedges so professor Chomsky I
wanted to ask you about the ten
principles that are laid out or have
been organized in the book requiem for
the American Dream which was based on a
documentary that you did the ten
principles of concentration of wealth
and power and the first one you talked
about is reducing democracy what do you
mean by that
I should first comment that the
construction of the ten principles is
really the contribution to the editors
it's they're quite effective
consolidation of hours and hours of
interviews and discussions which they
organize in this form reducing democracy
means the gradual marginalization of the
population the reduction of the role of
the general population in
decision-making in the public arena
which is unexpected
and predictable consequence of the
introduction of the transition to
neoliberal principles in the 70s and
onward others basically two general
phases
post-war u.s. socio-economic history the
first phase was sometimes called
regulated capitalism embedded liberalism
of late 50s and 60s a very high growth
period egalitarian growth some moves
toward social justice in the sixties
substantial increase in democratic
participation people became really
engaged in the public arena all of this
had various effects one effect was
reduction the falling rate of profit
which is critical second effect was
people becoming two and two inven gauged
in public affair this is what Samuel
Huntington called an excess of democracy
in excess of democracy and in fact two
very important publications came out in
the early seventies both directed to
this they're interesting because they
were opposite ends of the political
spectrum but they basically came to the
same conclusion with somewhat different
rhetorical styles one was the Powell
memoranda 1930 pal memorandum which
written by the late a corporate lawyer
working with tobacco corporation later
became Supreme Court justice under Nixon
he wrote a memorandum which was supposed
to be confidential but it leaked to the
US Chamber of Commerce business group
and in which he the rhetoric is quite
fascinating he expressed the view of
which is not uncommon among those who
really own the world
that their control is being very
slightly diminished and in the manner of
the spoiled three-year-old who doesn't
get a piece of candy that means the
world's coming to an end so you really
have to read the rhetoric to appreciate
it's the attack on the American free
enterprise system
he said the business world is under
severe attack
led by Ralph Nader and Herbert Markham
universities right we're practically
surviving you know attack on all of
everything insignificant in American
life and then he says well look after
all we businessmen basically own
everything we can we are the trustees of
the universities we don't let these
don't have to let these kids run wild
and become we can constrain the media
after all we have the power and calls
for mobilization of the business world
to defend ourselves because we came the
blueprint I mean for this corporate
money the Heritage Foundation it led to
had a big impact on the growth of
right-wing think tanks much of the
ideology the far-right so that's at the
right end of the spectrum then you go to
the other end of the spectrum a
basically carter administration
liberalism in fact that the people of
staffs the carter administration
trilateral commission that's industrial
democracies in Europe Japan the United
States basically liberal
internationalists and they have a
publication called the crisis of
democracy and the crisis of democracy is
there's too much democracy in the 1960s
too many people who are usually passive
and apathetic we people are supposed to
be started becoming engaged in the
political arena pressing for the demands
and so on some put are sometimes called
special interests meaning young people
old people farmers workers in other
words everybody except the corporate
sector which is not mentioned there the
national interest but these special
interests are putting too much pressure
on the state so we have to have more
moderation and democracy people have to
return to being passive and apathetic
the American reporter who you mentioned
Sam Huntington with some nostalgia
referred to the period when as he put it
was able to run the country with a
cooperation of a few Wall Street lawyers
and executives and then there was no
crisis of democracy that's kind of and
they very effectively of course
succeeded in rolling back I want to go
on to your next point about shaping
ideology but you talked about the
difference between Madison and Aristotle
in that Aristotle you know both of them
understood that if there was inequality
in the same way that John Locke and
Bentham and others did that there would
be tension between the rich and the poor
Madison calling for government to reduce
democracy Aristotle saying the solution
which you obviously support is to reduce
inequality your second point shaping the
ideology that we mentioned the Powell
memo we mentioned the trilateral
commission but specifically they
targeted various segments of the society
and doctrine ation of the young you talk
about the way they actually created
architectural plans for colleges so that
large demonstrations would not be
possible the use of student debt for
debt peonage the destruction of public
institutions talk about that process to
reconfigure the ideology into a form of
neoliberalism I don't want to suggest
that the Trilateral Commission led to
these developments it was more or less
an articulation of the liberal elite
consensus on these issues and for that
reason it's quite interesting
so the phrase indoctrination of the
young actually is their phrase their
consensus phrase they said the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young are failing
their duty well that's an interesting
way to describe educational institutions
kind of like the nostalgic comment on
Truman being able to run the country
with corporate a few corporate lawyers
and so on
but that's kind of the ideal there
should be indoctrination students should
not be
pritu think they don't put it this way
but what it means is they shouldn't be
free to inquire to think to challenge
just the kind of things that in a decent
educational system young people would be
encouraged to do and in the schools and
universities but it's dangerous because
they're questioning too many eternal
verities including that there has to be
elite domination and controlled baby
this is expressed all through the
history success all do you think looking
back they were how successful though
it's not as I say they were expressing
the their articulating consensus that
led to many developments and it's been
reasonably successful so for example
take the kind of a business model began
to be imposed on colleges and
universities there's been a tremendous
growth of bureaucracy tilting the
balance from faculty control to
bureaucratic control there's there's
been of course sharp raising tuition
which is has a very strong disciplinary
effect in the 1960s a young person could
say okay I'm gonna take off a year and
get involved in the anti-war movement
and for the feminist movement or
something that will come back and
continue in my life you can't through
that if you have a burden of debt over
your head if you come out of law school
thinking I'd love to be a public
interest lawyer but I have to pay off
two hundred thousand dollars in debt you
just have to go to a corporate law firm
and get absorbed into that culture and
in many different ways there are
disciplinary effects imposed cutback of
state funding for state colleges for
example has been very short you also
talk about how suddenly critics of
American Empire or American capitalism
got tarred with this anti-americanism
yeah an American isn't a very
interesting concept it's a concept that
only exists in
Dalton Aryan states so for example if
someone in Italy let's say is
criticizing the Berlusconi government
they're not accused of being a de
Italian in the Soviet Union old Soviet
Union
you could be condemned for being anti
Soviet in the Brazilian military
dictatorship you could be adding
Brazilian but aside from the United
States I don't know of any other non
totalitarian non authoritarian country
with the concept even exist it's a very
striking country concept if you're
critical of policy you're anti-american
actually this has an interesting
biblical origin the first use of this
concept is actually by King Ahab who was
a ultimate king of ultimate evil in the
Bible he called the prophet Isaiah
Elijah to him and asked him why he is a
hater of Israel meaning condemning the
acts of the evil king that's basic
concept authority if you challenge
authority you're opposed to the society
the culture you know the community and
so on and when we see that with Trump
and and we'll come back in a moment with
our conversation with Professor Noam
Chomsky on contact with Chris Hedges
welcome back to our conversation with
Professor Noam Chomsky so let's talk
about principle number three redesign
the economy I suppose this would have
taken off would you say in the 1970s
late night begun and then seven days you
see the first steps in the late Carter
Administration then Reagan and Seth and
what were they doing what did you see
well this is the so-called neoliberal
shift to try to shift decisions from the
public arena to what's called the market
the market how do you define
neoliberalism it's basically the ideas
privatized
reduce the role of the public
to shion's deregulate permit the in fact
encourage the growth of financial
institutions network of policies of this
kind the ideology claims its increasing
freedom it's actually increasing tyranny
it means that instead of decisions and
choices being made in the public arena
where the public and principle has some
kind of role in to the state to the
degree that the state is democratic
maybe an actual role shifting it to
private tyrannies corporate sector
mostly pretty highly monopolized
oligopoly and that's when you get this
imbalance between what you talked about
the manufacturing sector and the
financial sector you also have enormous
growth of the financial sector so if you
go to the 50s and 60s the regulated
capitalism period banks were basically
banks you know put your money in them
they let the people to start a business
something like that from the early
seventies it shifted dramatically to
speculate a huge increase in speculation
complex financial instruments by 2007
before the latest of the crashes for
which the financial sector was mostly
responsible they actually had 40% of
court man this is an economy where
essentially you make money by
manipulating money so in that degree
actually the in the 1990s is when the
decline of the manufacturing sector
really began it and this was specific
policy combination of trade policy and
fiscal policy going to the details but
that essentially was the high dollar
policy the way in which the so-called
free trade not free trade agreements
were structured led to these effects
this is all part of the same system and
it's had consequences one consequence is
for the majority of the population
stagnation or
decline the take a look at real wages
they should just talk that you speak
about this these free trade agreements
in essence push the plight of the
American worker downward you know
because they had to be competitive with
sweatshop workers and it was putting the
working people of the world in
competition right but not but allowing
freedom of capital and in fact high
protection for capital these are not
free trade agreements
so the what's called intellectual
property rights is just a huge tax on
the population it's massive increase in
the patent rights which had never
existed before so it means that
Microsoft monopolies can't be challenged
the mega corporations have extraordinary
rights and the effect of this is it's
like a extremely high tariffs as one of
them I know you talk about how workers
can't move but capital can you know and
that the whole capitalism itself if you
go back to Adam Smith is based on the
free circulation of labor that is the
foundation of every chasm Smith but
there's nothing like that quite the
opposite
let me ask about that this was this
created worker insecurity by design yes
in fact the phrase growing worker
insecurity is Alan Greenspan's the kind
of running managing the system as head
of the Fed but when he was testifying to
Congress on the success of the economy
he was running he attributed a large
part of it the what he called growing
worker insecurity saws a good thing
that's the implication because it keeps
wages down it keeps people workers for
asking for benefits it keeps inflation
low it breaks you know to keep the
profit side and it makes it very hard to
organize and he points out intelligently
that this growing worker insecurity is
books dream that even when unemployment
is down as it was in the late Clinton
years still the same conditions apply
workers just afraid unions are being
destroyed and this is part of the what
was called the Great Moderation the
succeed by economists the success of the
neoliberal programs which had the effect
that say by not in 2007 before the crash
the real wages were actually lower than
they had been in 1979 when the
neoliberal experiment began that's a
very sharp change actually one index of
the change which is interesting it's
just taking a look at minimum wage which
sets a kind of floor for wages during
the first period regulated capitalism a
minimum wage track productivity which
the expect it breaks in the 1970s
productivity and growth go up more
slowly but somewhat minimum wage stays
flat which means it actually reduces if
minimum wage had continued today it
would probably be something like twenty
dollars now and that's an indica select
the actual reduction in real wages
that's an indication of the nature of
these highly praised socio-economic
policies another effect was deregulation
starts with with started actually in
late Carter but picked up with Reagan
and extended under Clinton that for
financial and that meant the beginning
of crashes in the 50s and 60s were no
phonetic garages you had New Deal
regulation starting in the 80s you start
getting crash after crash each one worse
than the last public bails amount and
you know that's the nature of the system
and let me let me move on to shifting
the burden is another shifting the
burden so that the Paula garlic elites
having especially fortune 500 companies
are not paying taxes
and and more of the responsibility for
funding the nation falls on the backs of
the working poor actually there's been a
very sharp reduction in taxation of the
wealthy since the fifties in the 50s and
60s right through the neoliberal period
and all sorts of other devices have been
developed so that at Corp the corporate
sector can avoid taxes and they take the
biggest company in the world
Apple hugely profitable they have an
office somewhere in Ireland which is
allegedly where they're based of course
they're basically offshoring
it's the offshore base they were just
find I think something like 13 billion
dollars or something like that by the
European Union for tax evasion there but
it means they're not paying it here and
there's a lot of complaint from business
of course about the high corporate tax
if you look at the effective corporate
tax what actually paid far low this is
rise to what you call the precariat the
precariat is the growing worker in
securities the fact that you don't have
the security of a stable job which is
going to be continuing work which is
going to be a guaranteed pension chance
for your children to go to college
that's radically and you set at this
system the quote we're headed towards a
cliff it's headed towards a cliff in
many ways the worst cliff that we're
heading towards is due to market systems
there's a fundamental flaw in markets we
have a very limited market there's
massive state intervention but it's some
extent market principles prevail in the
market you don't pay attention to
externalities to the effect of your
transactions on others so if I sell you
a car we make a good deal for ourselves
but we don't pay attention to the fact
that there's another car on the street
there's more congestion more accidents
more pollutions others suffer now
there's one ex goldman sachs makes a
risky transaction if they're paying
attention they cover the risk to
themselves but they did with subprime
art but they don't pay attention to
what's called systemic risk right the
whole system may collapse that's the
Publix brought on climate changes
perhaps that now we have climate change
that's a externality which is going to
destroy us unless something's done and
the position of the savage wing of
American capitalism the Republican Party
is quite striking they are really racing
towards a precipice haven't you call it
the most dangerous organization in world
history without their I think that's as
I pointed out that's now greater
statement but the question is is it true
has there ever been an organization in
history which has dedicated itself to
destruction of the possibility of
organized human life that's actually
what we're facing and they're pretty
remarkable and the Trump administration
has accelerated they have accelerated it
but they're writing they're at the peak
of a Republican Party shift take a look
at last primaries every single candidate
in the Republican primary
either flatly denied that climate change
is happening or else said maybe it is
but we don't do anything about it
100% denialism the Paris negotiations in
this concluded in December 2015
we're intended to reach a verifiable
treaty they couldn't had to just keep
the promises because the Republican
Congress wouldn't permit it they were it
by now November 8 last November 8 the
u.s. just basically pulled out now
isolated in the world literally isolated
in racing toward the precipice while the
rest of the world is trying to do
something not enough but at least
something to deal with appropriate
thanks that was Professor Noam Chomsky
[Music]
thank you for watching join us next week
for part two with our conversation with
Professor Noam Chomsky you can find us
on Artie comm slash on context until
next week
