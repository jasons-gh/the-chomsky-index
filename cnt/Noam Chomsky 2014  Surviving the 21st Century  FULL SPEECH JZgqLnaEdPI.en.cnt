well welcome to you all welcome to those
here in the Great Hall to those in the
common center to those in Queens where
we are live streaming this evening
welcome to you all and particularly of
course welcome to Nome as we know him
Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky needs no
introduction so I'll be very very brief
he's of course probably the one academic
who is known throughout the world for
his scholarship and public engagement
currently immerses professor in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
at MIT known was born in Philadelphia in
1928 and has worked for nearly all his
career at one institution where he
started in 1955 there's loyalty mit
sometimes described as the father of
linguistics he's also a major figure in
the philosophy of mind language politics
and ethics he was named the world's top
public intellectual by one poll but we
hardly needed reminding gnome has
written over a hundred books and has
made massive contributions of course to
the fields in which he's engaged for
years he's been one of the most
prominently cited academics he is
lectured in many of the most prominent
lecture series of the world and now he
can add the durham castle lecture series
to his list his list of awards and
honors is extraordinary and one hardly
knows where to start I counted honorary
degrees from at least 38 of the most
distinguished universities in the world
in Germany this would be a nightmare
because of the tradition and convention
of introducing important speakers by all
of their degrees so it'd be welcome here
professor doctor doctor doctor doctor
till you get to 38 among his most
impressive honors at least impressive to
me that I could find was a newly
described species of be that has been
named after him
his talk surviving the 21st century will
be for about 3540 minutes or so and then
we will take questions from here and
also from the other lecture theatres
which will somehow arrive on my iPad
again to remind you hashtag Chomsky if
you wish to tweet it's an incredible
pleasure to have you here and please
join with me in giving Noam Chomsky a
better welcome than he's ever had before
when I think about the announced title
will we survive the 21st century there
is an irresistible image the image of
the proverbial lemmings marching towards
the cliff cheering their intrepid
leaders as we should all be aware for
the first time in history humans are now
poised to destroy the prospects for
decent existence and much of life the
rate of species destruction right now is
about at the level of 65 million years
ago when a huge asteroid hit the at the
earth entered ended the age of the
dinosaurs opened the way for the
proliferation of mammals the difference
is that today we're the asteroid and the
way may will be open to beetles and
bacteria when we've concluded our work
the geologists break the history of the
planet in the ears of relative stability
Pleistocene lasted several million years
followed by the Holocene about 10,000
years ago that coincided with the
introduction of agriculture and now
geologists are adding a new era new
epoch the Anthropocene beginning with
the Industrial Revolution roughly 200
years ago the and it has radically
changed the natural world and the light
of the pace of change one hates to think
about when the next epic will begin and
what it will be one effect of the
Anthropocene is the extraordinary rate
of species extinction another's the
threat to ourselves no literate person
can fail to be aware that we're facing a
prospect of severe environmental
disaster affects their already
detectable and that might become dire
within a few generations if current
tendencies are not reversed just to give
a few examples a couple of weeks ago two
leading scientific journals published a
new study of the West Antarctic Ice
Sheet it's long been understood that if
it collapses it will lead almost
inevitably to a rise in global sea level
of at least 10 feet within a few
generations wipes out civilization in
any recognizable form the reports the
new studies reported that it is
collapsing leading scientists who are
familiar with the study warned that
continued release of greenhouse gases
will almost certainly make the situation
worse destabilizing other parts of
Antarctica as well as the Greenland ice
sheet causing many of the world's
coastal cities to be abandoned with
horrifying consequences for the poor
inhabitants of coastal plains and
probably millions in Bangladesh alone
the leading done us scientific society
the triple-a s which is usually quite
conservative that did issue a study a
few days earlier reporting I'm quoting
it the overwhelming evidence of
human-caused climate change with both
current impacts and extraordinary future
risks to society and natural systems the
report expressed particular concern over
quoting again the disconnect between
scientific knowledge and public
perception they're talking about the
United States and that's not an accident
the leading sectors of the
world are quite openly running a major
propaganda campaigns to convince the
public that humans are not responsible
for global warming if it's occurring at
all some of the leading business
journals like The Wall Street Journal
Forbes responded to the latest IPCC
report with the article saying that the
real problem is global cooling and
there's some effect there are recent
studies the choke appalling studies that
show that concern about global warming
in the United States is well below the
global norm and it's stratified among
Republicans it's far below the global
norm among Democrats slightly below and
that's not on typical of the
contemporary Republican Party there
which is no longer a conventional
parliamentary party as a more accurate
description that was given by one of the
very few remaining genuine conservatives
the respected political analyst of the
right-wing american enterprise institute
Norman Ornstein he describes the former
Republican Party as a radical insurgency
which has pretty much abandoned the
domain of parliamentary politics and
although he didn't add this we can say
that the reason is that's in virtual
lockstep service to extreme wealth and
privilege and one aspect of this is
denial of climate change or at least the
human role in this terrifying
development the current issue of the
premier journal of media criticism the
columbia journalism review has an
interesting article about this topic it
atributes this outcome to a media
doctrine that's called fair and balanced
thus if a journal publishes an opinion
piece reflecting the opinion of
ninety-seven percent of science
it has to run alongside it a piece
counter piece expressing the claims of
the energy corporations so the publix
ends up confused and that is indeed what
happens but there's certainly no doctor
and a fair and balanced thus if a
journal say runs an opinion piece
denouncing Putin once again for the
criminal act of taking over Crimea it
surely does not have to run a piece
along sided and pointing out that while
this act is indeed criminal Russia has a
far stronger case than the u.s. does in
having taken over southeastern Cuba over
100 years ago including Cuba's major
port rejecting the demand of Cuba since
independence to have it returned with no
justification at all unlike the Russians
only the justification that this
contributes to the 50-year program of
terrorist warfare which was quite
extreme and the economic strangulation
of Cuba and there are quite a few other
current cases but they don't have to be
mentioned under the doctrine of fair and
balanced there is an actual media
doctrine has to be fair and balanced
when the concerns of concentrated
private power are involved surely not
elsewhere about although obvious enough
this cannot be perceived in the elite
culture so it appears there's now much
exuberance in the United States about
what's called a hundred years of energy
independence lying ahead as we become
the Saudi Arabia of the next century
President Obama overrated about the
matter with his usual eloquent two years
ago quote him he proclaimed with pride
to ample applause that now under my
administration America is producing more
oil
then at any time in the last eight years
that's important to know over the past
three years I've directed my
administration to open up millions of
acres for gas and oil exploration across
23 different states we're opening up
more than 75 percent of our potential
oil reserves resources offshore we've
quadrupled the number of operating rigs
to a record high we've added an enough
new oil and gas pipeline to encircle the
earth and then some uplifting the
applause that tells us something
important about our social and moral
malaise the president was speaking in
Cushing Oklahoma that's an oil town as
he announced in greeting his
appreciative audience in fact is the oil
town it's described as the most
significant trading hub for crude oil in
North America and industry profits are
sure to be secured in the short term as
producing more oil and gas here at home
and the president's words will continue
to be a critical part of energy strategy
that's the president promised let's go
to the media a couple of weeks ago the
New York Times published an energy
supplement eight pages mostly euphoria
about the bright future for the United
States the poised to be the greatest
producer of fossil fuels the missing in
the eight pages is any reflection on
what kind of world were exuberantly
creating that one might recall George
Orwell's observation in his unpublished
introduction Animal Farm about how in
free England ideas can be suppressed
without the use of force not least
because immersion in the elite culture
having a good education instills the
understanding
that there are certain things it
wouldn't do to say or we can add even to
think in the moral calculus of
contemporary anglo-american state
capitalism profits and bonuses in the
next quarter that greatly outweigh
concern for the welfare of one's
grandchildren well much remains
uncertain we can assure ourselves with
fair confidence that future generations
will not forgive us for our silence and
our apathy we might in fact wish to
consider a remarkable paradox of the
current Europe there are some who are
devoting themselves seriously to try to
avert impending disaster in the lead are
the most oppressed segments of the
global population those considered to be
the most backward and primitive the
indigenous societies of the world first
nations in Canada have originals in
Australia tribal tribal people in India
and others like them and in countries
with influential indigenous populations
like Bolivia and Ecuador there are by
now even legislative proposals
legislative recognition of rights of
nature the government of Ecuador
actually proposed to leave their
supplies of oil in the ground where they
should be if the European countries
would provide them development aid
amounting to a small fraction of what
they would sacrifice by not exploiting
their oil resources and of course the
European countries refused they didn't
bother asking the United States while
indigenous people are trying to avert
the disaster in sharp
rest the race to the cliff is led by the
most advanced educated wealthy
privileged societies in the world
notably North America others not far
behind few exceptions like Germany but
not many unless there's a significant
change of course and soon the prospect
for decent survival is quite slim and
that's not all for the past 70 years
we've been living under the threat of
instant and virtual virtually total
destruction at our own hands those
familiar with the shocking record and if
you're not familiar with it I urge
looking at it but those familiar with it
and the record continues to the present
would find it hard to contest the
conclusions of the General Lee Butler
he's the last commander of the Strategic
Air Command which has responsibility for
nuclear weapons he writes that we have
so far survived the nuclear age by some
combination of skill luck and divine
intervention and I suspect the latter in
the greatest proportion it's actually a
near miracle that we've escaped
destruction so far and the longer we
tempt fate the less likely it is that we
can hope for divine intervention to save
us from our folly in this context it's
worth taking a close look at the factors
that drive policy there is a receive
standard version it's common to academic
scholarly discourse public discourse
diplomatic commentary so I'll just quote
a few leading figures but it's almost
universal takes a George Kennan one of
the creators of the modern world
according to him government is created
to assure order and justice internally
and to provide for the common defense
coming to the present and the current
issue of the journal national interest
leading realist scholar at John
mearsheimer formulates the doctrine is
holding that the structure of the
international system forces countries
concerned about concerned about their
security to compete with each other for
power leading scholar of us Middle East
policy would implant also long
diplomatic experience writes that the
driving force of US policy is to ensure
security and well-being of the
population and so on pretty much
endlessly we couldn't put aside the
standard piatt ease about justice and
well-being of the population what is
emphasized throughout is concern for
security which sounds plausible enough
but there's a few unanswered questions
for example security for whom well one
answer is security for state power there
are many illustrations of that to take
current one from a couple of days ago
the United States agreed and this is
unusual to support a Security Council
resolution calling on the international
criminal court to investigate war crimes
in Syria but there was a proviso no
inquiry is will be tolerated into
possible war crimes by Israel or of
course by the United States that's the
explicit proviso and it's routine the
United States is uniquely self immunized
from the international legal system it's
a very interesting topic I don't have
time to pursue it but it does illustrate
the importance of protecting the
security of the state security of state
power
protect the security of state power from
whom will enemies of course but who are
the enemies it turns out that one prime
enemy is the domestic population that
fact is demonstrated over and over very
clearly recently very clearly quite
generally by government secrecy as it
very rarely has a genuine security
motivation that much should be familiar
to anyone who's plowed through
declassified documents almost never find
anything related to genuine security it
it but there is a fact the effect is to
keep the population in the dark the
enemy they have to make sure they don't
know what's going on and they're good
reasons some of these were explained by
the professor of the science of
government I was like that title the
professor of the signs of government at
harvard samuel huntington prominent the
rule scholar government adviser he
instructs us that the architects of
power in the United States must create a
force that can be felt but not seen
power remains strong when it remains in
the dark exposed to the sunlight it
begins to evaporate that was in 1981
when the Cold War was again heating up
and Huntington went on to explain that
you may have to sell intervention or
other military action in such a way as
to create the misimpression that it's
the Soviet Union that you're fighting
that's what the United States has been
doing ever since the Truman Doctrine of
1947 1981 was another critical year in
this regard it was the year when we
reagan declared the first war on terror
plague of the modern age returned the
barbarism in our time etc etc and ever
since then particularly after the
disappearance of the Russian threat or
temporary disappearance as a concocted
ogre terror you have to create the
misimpression that it's terror that
you're fighting there are other
candidates narco-traffickers crazed
mullahs number of others all of this is
rarely acknowledged but it's very
accurate and it's a good insight into
state power and policy has plenty of
reverberations right to the present
moment so state power surely has to be
secured from dangerous enemies like the
domestic population but in sharp
contrast the public is not secure from
state power for striking illustration of
that right now President Obama's current
radical attack on the Fourth Amendment
of the US Constitution which quoted
protect citizens from unreasonable
search and seizure that protects their
the privacy of their persons homes
papers and effects the defense of this
right in Boston helped spark the
American Revolution that's why it was
written into the Constitution into the
Bill of Rights at that time the tyrant
was the British government and now the
tyrant is the American government of
course referring to the extraordinary
surveillance campaign Obama's
surveillance campaign which seeks to
monitor everything without exception
that you say or do and anyone connected
in any way to the electronic culture
cell phone computer landline is
vulnerable to this inquiry and Britain
agrees the government remains tyrannical
the British government does perhaps you
know authorized the United States
National Security Agency actually
requested it in quotes to analyze and
retain any British citizens mobile phone
and tax numbers emails and IP addresses
that are swept up in the NSA dragnet
which is colossal picks up essentially
everything that you should also be happy
to know that the NSA routinely receives
or intercepts of router's servers
computers other computer network devices
that are being exported from the United
States so that it can implant
surveillance tools make sure that the
NSA knows every keystroke you're making
and presumably China does the same which
kind of exhausts the range all of this
is justified by security in accord with
the standard doctrine but it's worth
remembering that the claim to of
justification for security carries no
information whatsoever literally even
the technical sense it's completely
predictable for virtually all actions of
states when they're caught in some crime
or malfeasance and if something's
perfectly predictable that simply
carries no information in the case of
the Snowden revelations the first
reaction of the US government was the
reflexively security the president to
the head of the NSA informed the public
that numerous terrorist plots were
stopped by these surveillance methods
and the first the claim was 54 were
stopped that was later reduced to
a dozen there was later government
Commission established which
investigated exactly how many had been
stopped and it turned out that was one
somebody sent 8500 dollars to Somalia
that so far as the total yield of this
colossal effort to monitor and control
the population the domestic enemy there
is another concern security for private
power a major current illustration are
the huge trade agreements that are now
being negotiated during specific and
transatlantic their secret but not
completely they're not secret to the
hundreds of corporate lawyers and
lobbyists who are writing the detailed
regulations you can guess what they are
and why they're secret there are other
illustrations throughout the Snowden
documents one of the interesting parts
of them is that they reveal extensive
economic espionage in the interests of
us corporations actually when this is
brought to the attention of the
government they say well we don't choose
particular corporations which is correct
at just the general corporate sector
that has to be who's which security must
be protected by state intervention well
there are other examples they're
actually too numerous to mention and
they shouldn't be surprising because a
one a recent study just came out from
Princeton University two leading
political scientists Martin Guillen's
Benjamin Paige who studied hundreds of
policy decisions and conclude with very
careful analysis all quote economic
elites and organized groups representing
business interests have substantial
independent impact on US government
policy while average citizens
Mass based interest groups have little
or no independent influence these
results they say provide substantial
support for theories of economic elite
domination and for theories of biased
pluralism but not for theories of
majoritarian electoral democracy or
majoritarian pluralism at the put it
simply it's a pretense that we live in
democracies they're plutocracy other
work by these and other scholars
particularly Martin Guillen's has shown
pretty convincingly that in the United
States about seventy percent of the
population the lower seventy percent on
the income scale have no influence at
all on policy that's one of the reason
why muslim don't vote why bother doesn't
matter what they think as you move up
the scale you get a little more
influence and at the very top which
means a fraction of one percent
basically that's where policy is written
so it's not surprising that the security
of private interest is a major
commitment of the state and this goes
way back there's nothing new about it's
getting kind of grotesque by now but
both far back the closest most careful
inquiry into this is done by a very good
political scientist Thomas Ferguson
University of Massachusetts he studied
the effect of the relation between
campaign spending and policy choices
back into the 19th century and it turns
out it's an extremely good predictor
take a look at the distribution of
campaign spending you can pretty well
predict the policies that will be
enacted this runs right through the New
Deal has very few exceptions actually
there was a over a century ago the most
prominent in American history the most
prominent campaign manager mark Hanna
around the turn of the 19th century was
asked what are the most important things
they're necessary for running a campaign
and he said there are three the first
one's money the second one's money and I
forgotten what the third one is that was
well over a hundred years ago now it's
well beyond nevertheless it's useful to
have a new and very careful confirmation
by Guillen's and Paige a facts that are
so obvious that in a free society they'd
be taught in elementary school well the
United States is actually an unusually
free and open society in a number of
respects crucial ones and one of them
relevant here is the accessibility of
internal state records secret records
Declassified and they provide a very
revealing account of the actual motives
of state policy fortunately no time to
review the matter here but there are a
few persistent themes we find
consistently that one major driving
factor in policy choices is concern
about what Henry Kissinger called
viruses that spread contagion he was
referring specifically to I n days Chile
which threatened to spread the contagion
of a peaceful parliamentary path towards
independent development and social
welfare you know the outcome in that
case and it's duplicated in case after
case throughout Latin America in
Southeast Asia Africa and the Middle
East it's the most prominent theme of
Cold War history in general there's
ample evidence that security of state
power crucially security from the
population and security of constant
economic power private power that these
are driving forces in policy formation
furthermore that's entirely natural and
to be expected when you look into how
policy is formulated of course it's not
quite that simple there are some
interesting cases some quite current in
fact when these commitments conflict
it's interesting to see what happens in
those cases but this is an extremely
good first approximation and radically
opposed to the receive standard doctrine
what your thought and what you read well
let's turn to another question what
about security the population it's very
easy to demonstrate that this is at most
a marginal concern of policy planners so
take two very prominent examples who I
mentioned global warming and nuclear
weapons both dire threats to the
security of the population turned the
state policy in both cases it
systematically attempts to accelerate
the threat in the interests of its
primary concerns protection of state
power and protection of concentrated
private power of namely the power that
largely sets determine state policy in
the case of global warming the
conclusion is too obvious even the Terry
on so I'll drop it but it's quite
instructive to see that even instant
destruction by nuclear weapons has never
ranked high among the concerns of state
authorities the record reveals that
quite quite clearly let me run few
through a few examples start in the
early days of the Atomic Age around 1950
at that time the United States was
overwhelmingly powerful and enjoyed
remarkable security there was enough
like it in history it controlled the
Western Hemisphere control both oceans
controlled the opposite sides of both
oceans had half the world's wealth just
incomparable power and security actually
there was a potential threat ICBMs with
hydrogen bomb warheads they didn't exist
at the time but it was potential threat
there is a standard scholarly review of
nuclear policies that's undertaken
access to high-level sources
declassified documents by McGeorge Bundy
he was the national security advisor for
Kennedy and Johnson administration's
former Harvard Dean and he writes that
quote him the timely development of
ballistic missiles during the Eisenhower
administration the 50s is one of the
best achievements of those eight years
yet it is well to begin with a
recognition that both the United States
and the Soviet Union might be in much
less nuclear danger today if these
missiles had never been developed and he
that adds an instructive comment he says
I am aware of no serious contemporary
proposal in or out of government that
ballistic missiles should somehow be
banned by agreement so in short there
was apparently no thought of trying to
prevent the sole serious threat to the
United States the threat of instant
utter destruction and this striking fact
merits barely a phrase in this massive
standard comprehensive history and it's
also passed unnoticed well could it have
been prevented can't be sure of course
but there are some indications that it
might have been puzzle one suggestive
indication
is a remarkable proposal by Stalin in
1952 he offered to permit Germany to be
unified with free elections which of
course the Communists would lose but on
condition one condition that it not
joined a hostile military alliance
that's hardly an extreme condition if
you look at the history of the preceding
half-century Stalin's proposal was
ignored or ridiculed but recent
scholarship has begun to take a
different view especially with the
release of Russian archival records
there's a bitterly anti-communist
Harvard scholar Adam olam late a mu lung
specialist on the Bolshevik period he
takes the status of Stalin's proposal to
be an unresolved mystery he writes that
Washington wasted little effort in
flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative on
grounds that were embarrassingly
unconvincing leaving open the basic
question was Stalin genuinely ready to
sacrifice the newly created german
democratic republic east germany on the
altar of real democracy with
consequences for world peace and for
american security that would have been
enormous that remains an open question
that one of the most prominent Cold War
scholars of Melvin loeffler has reviewed
recent research and Soviet archives and
he writes that many scholars including
him were surprised to discover that the
Lavrenti bahria the sinister brutal head
of the secret police proposed that the
Kremlin offer the West a deal on
unification and neutralization of
Germany agreeing to sacrifice the East
German communist regime to reduce
east-west tensions and of course him for
them
proved internal political and economic
conditions opportunities that were
squandered in favors by the West in
favor of securing West German
participation in NATO under the
circumstances actual circumstances is
not the propaganda ones it's not
impossible that agreements might have
been reached that would have protected
the security of the population from the
gravest threat on the horizon instant
total destruction but the option the
possibility was apparently not
considered recognized but dismissed or
ridiculed it's another indication of how
slight a role authentic security plays
in state policy contrary to standard
doctrine actually that was revealed
again repeatedly in the years that
followed couple years later in Nikita
Khrushchev took office he understood
that Russia could not compete militarily
with the United States the richest most
powerful country in history incomparable
advantages if Russia hoped to escape its
economic backwardness and the
devastating effect of the Second World
War he concluded it would be necessary
to sharply reverse the arms race and he
in fact proposed sharp mutual reduction
in offensive nuclear weapons the
incoming Kennedy administration
considered the offer and rejected it it
turned instead to rapid military
expansion as a review of this by one of
the most respected I our international
relations scholars Kenneth waltz
recently died he wrote that the Kennedy
administration undertook of the largest
strategic and conventional peacetime
military buildup the world has ever seen
even as first chef was trying at one
to carry out a major reduction in the
conventional forces and to follow a
strategy of minimum deterrence and we
the United States did so even though the
balance of strategic weapons greatly
favored the United States again
decisions that harm national security
arm the security of the people and while
enhancing state power a major Kennedy as
you may recall barely squeaked to
victory in 1960 in the election mainly
by fraud but one of the ways he squeaked
to victory was his charge that the
opponent Eisenhower and Nixon had
permitted the Russians at the leap ahead
and offensive weaponry at creating what
was called a missile gap that severely
threatened us security and that
frightened the population the reality
was the United States was far in the
lead the Russians actually had four
operational ICBMs which were exposed to
attack tiny fraction of the u.s. arsenal
that was recognized by the Kennedy
administration McGeorge Bundy National
Security Advisor speaking for the
administration he explained that they
had nevertheless been right in
emphasizing a fake missile gap and the
reason he gave was that the phrase had a
useful shorthand effect of calling
attention to our basic military posture
namely the posture of rapidly expanding
the overwhelming us dominance and threat
while rejecting security and the
prospects for survival normal there was
a Soviet reaction it was to place
missiles in Cuba in October 1962 that
move was motivated as well by Kennedy's
quite immense a huge terrorist campaign
against Cuba was very serious and it was
scheduled to lead to invasion
in October 1962 as Russia and Cuba may
we'll have known that brought us to what
historian Arthur Schlesinger called the
most dangerous moment in history and it
was extremely dangerous the crisis
peaked in late October 1962 over 26th
27th Kennedy then received a letter or
secret letter from first rough offering
to end the crisis by simultaneous public
withdrawal of Russian missiles from Cuba
and us Jupiter missiles from Turkey
these were obsolete missiles for which
withdrawal order had already been given
because they were being replaced by much
more dangerous and time and vulnerable
pull our submarines so that was the
author offer Russia would remove the
missiles from Cuba the US would continue
to remove missiles which are already
being withdrawn because they're being
replaced by more dangerous ones
Kennedy's subjective estimate was that
if he refused the probability of nuclear
war would be a third to a half that's a
war that would have destroyed the
northern hemisphere according to
Eisenhower President Eisenhower's
warning Kennedy refused it's hard to
think of a more horrendous decision in
history and worse he's greatly praised
for it for his cool courage his
statesmanship 10 years later Henry
Kissinger called the nuclear alert it
was the last days of the 1973 Israel
Arab war and there was a purpose the
purpose was to warn the Russians not to
interfere with his delicate diplomacy
diploma he had was carrying out delicate
diplomatic maneuvers which were designed
to ensure an Israeli victory in the war
but a limited Victor
so that the United States would still
remain in total control of the region
unilaterally and the maneuvers were
delicate the United States and Russia
had jointly imposed a ceasefire but
Kissinger turns out had secretly
informed Israel that they could ignore
the ceasefire therefore there was a need
to call a nuclear alert to frighten the
Russians away the security of the
population had its usual status zero 10
years after that the Reagan
administration came in and they launched
operations to probe Russian air defenses
that meant simulating air and naval
attacks calling the highest level
nuclear alert into Russian waters and
territory and these were taken at a very
tense moment right at that time Pershing
to strategic missiles had were being
deployed in Europe few minutes flight
time the Moscow Reagan had announced the
Star Wars program SDI at which the
Russians understood to be effectively a
first strike weapon that's a standard
interpretation of so-called missile
defense on all sides and other tensions
were rising well naturally these actions
caused considerable alarm in Russia
unlike the United States Russia's quite
vulnerable repeatedly been invaded and
practically destroyed actually that led
to a major war scare in 1983 newly
released archives Russian archives
revealed that the danger was much more
severe even then historians of the
nuclear interactions had previously
assumed there's a recent CIA study which
is called the war scare was for real it
concluded that US intelligence had
underestimated Russian concerns and the
threat of
Russian reaction these exercises i'm
quoting almost became a prelude to a
preventive nuclear strike accountant the
recent issue of the journal of strategic
studies and it turns out it was even
more dangerous than that we learned that
last September the BBC reported that
right in the midst of these really
world-threatening developments that
Russia's early warning systems detected
an incoming missile strike from the
United States sending off the highest
level automated alert as a protocol for
Soviet military same with the US and
that is to retaliate at once with a
nuclear attack of its own can't wait any
longer there was an officer on duty miss
Donna Slav Petrov and he decided to
disobey the orders and not to report the
morning to his superiors he received an
official reprimand and thanks to his
dereliction of duty we're around to talk
about it security of the population was
no more a priority for Reagan planners
than for their predecessors and that
continues until the present that even
putting aside the numerous near
catastrophic accident which are really
quite shocking they're reviewed in a
chilling new book by Eric Schlosser
plans for the future are hardly
promising congressional US Congressional
Budget Office just reported that the US
nuclear arsenal will cost 350 billion
dollars over the next decade and that
costs of expanding and modernizing it
will quadruple from 1924 to 1930 there's
a detailed study by the center for
non-proliferation of the Monterey
Institute for
national studies estimated the US will
spend a trillion dollars on the nuclear
arsenal in the next 30 years as they put
it that's a percentage of the military
budget comparable to spending for
procurement of new strategic systems in
the 1980s under President Ronald Reagan
and of course the u.s. is not alone as
general Butler observed it's a near
miracle that we've escaped destruction
so far and the longer we tempt fate the
less likely it is that we can hope for
divine intervention to perpetuate the
miracle in the background is a legal
obligation that has determined by the
World Court that the nuclear powers
undertake good faith efforts to
eliminate nuclear weapons but that's far
in the background legal obligations are
not for the powerful this review only
scratches the surface there are numerous
other ways to evaluate the conventional
doctrines about the goals of policy the
forces that shape policy decisions I
think if you inquire into them and it's
quite worth doing you'll find that they
converge in the conclusions that I just
mentioned quote Guillen's and page again
policy is largely set by economic elites
and organized groups representing
business interests with little concerns
for public attitudes or public safety as
long as the public remains passive and
obedient frightened by concocted ogres
security is to be sure prime concern
security of power and profit not
security the population marginal concern
these have never
been small problems and that's
particularly true right now so let me
end by stressing again what we should
all know very well we now face the most
ominous decisions in human history there
are many problems of the world but to
our overwhelming and their significance
environmental destruction and nuclear
war for the first time in history we
face the prospects of destroying the
possibility for decent existence and not
in the distant future and for this
reason alone it's imperative to sweep
away the ideological clouds face
honestly and realistically the question
of how policy decisions are made in our
societies and what we can do to alter
them before it's too late
well now now to you all I'd like to take
questions in clusters of three so that
we can get a few remarks out I'll take
three from the Great Wall now before we
go to other lecture theatres and bring
them in so I do I see any hands that we
have a roaming Mike and you'll need it
so there's a gentleman at the back bar
hi mr. Chomsky re sketchiness on behalf
of the Greek editor journal and on
behalf of DX Greek BBC and I had many
questions to ask you can it really put
the mic just like you need to come
you're away from a story for the
feedback I can you hear me clearly yes
thank you I had many questions to ask
you 11 years one year one just one but I
chose one many people I told me to ask
you but I chose the question of a 55
year old doorman he works the doors here
in the clubs in Newcastle it's a very
simple question and I would like your
answer please sir and this gentleman
asked me why politicians lie okay well
that was that's a straightforward
question why politicians lie yes we'll
come back to that rather brutal question
let's just take from the back anyone
let's go right to the back thank you dr.
Tom see you talked quite a bit about how
governments seek to perpetuate their own
power even if it's directly against the
interests of their own people and you
listed a bunch of examples about how the
US government has done so through
expanding militarily how important do
you feel is a military-industrial
complex where by private corporations
seek to expand and provide military
equipment to the government how
important do you feel that is in causing
this problem do you have that question
it's yeah okay we'll move on it's all
men so far surely we can do better than
that you are
down here and I was wondering you talked
about the role of the media ins of
perpetuating a gap between public
knowledge and scientific knowledge and I
wondered if you thought that you know
the growing force of the Internet and
the power of any person to reach a
worldwide audience might do something to
negate that and to try and improve that
and sort of narrow that gap do you want
to put that into a short question gone I
wondered if you thought that through the
internet people might be able to narrow
the gap between scientific knowledge on
the internet narrow the gap between you
know ideology and knowledge as it were
all right let's take those three to
begin with I think that that relates to
the first question why politicians lie
the simple answer is because we let them
we have the power to prevent it but if
you don't use the power if you sit back
and say I don't care then they'll lie
and they have good reasons to I mean
would it make sense for Tony Blair say
to stand up now and say please set up a
war crimes tribunal to try me for for
the supreme international crime of
aggression would that make sense or for
him to say please throw me out of my
position as special representative for
the Middle East quartet because I'm
doing absolutely nothing for peace but
enriching myself or would it make sense
for and you can run down the line now
there's very good reasons either to lie
or just not to tell the truth if
politicians told the truth I think you
decide for yourselves I think they would
be saying what I was just talking about
they would be saying we don't care at
all about your security or your safety
or your survival we care about our power
and about power of the concentrated
concentrated domestic power which in our
societies means basically the corporate
sector it's not a hundred percent the
case of course
but it will be it'll the strong tendency
for it to be the case for the people who
reach the top that's how they reach the
top but the real answer is we let them
and that's our that's up we film about
ourselves now you put the look into the
mirror can the internet help it's one of
the ways in which the general population
that can try to counter the
extraordinary power of the concentrate
mostly concentrated economic power but
again only if you use it and you could
say this is it's true whether there's an
internet or not I'm the internet does
offer some new met new options it also
offers new options for controlling and
suppressing technology pretty much tends
to be neutral you can use it the
liberate you can use it to a press and
do the answer to which happens is in our
hands the military-industrial complex
that's of course Eisenhower's phrase
interestingly his phrase when he left
office after having created through his
eight years a huge military industrial
complex I can't honestly complain about
it that's one of the reasons I have a
job teach at MIT which is right at the
center of it 1950s and 60s it correctly
the whole academic budget was paid by
the Pentagon but that tells you
something there was almost no military
work in fact the only military work on
campus was in the political science
department political science department
had something called a Peace Research
Institute and anyone who read or will
knows exactly what that means it was an
institute working on counterinsurgency
and Vietnam and other such benign
actions but outside the political
science department there was no military
where
on campus but it was funded by the
Pentagon and that tells you something
about the Pentagon and the so-called
military industrial complex that is kept
quiet the Pentagon in the United States
and comparable systems here and
elsewhere are to a lot I'm they have a
military function but they also have
another function they create the economy
of the future they are systems by which
taxpayers are misled as Huntington says
you have to create misimpressions
taxpayers are misled to create the
profits of corporations for the future
you have most you have say iPhones or
something like that in your pocket take
a look at them they for example they
have in the GPS where the GPS come from
it's created by the US Navy the navistar
program that has micro electronics
software hardware created almost all
created for decades mostly in the state
sector under often in the u.s. Pentagon
funding here the counterpart taxpayers
pay for this because they think they're
protecting their security that's what
they're told but in fact the government
doesn't care about your security what it
cares of is about its own power and
security for corporate power and the way
the system works is the taxpayer takes
the risks carries out the investment for
decades literally decades finally
something may come out which is
profitable and then the profit goes to
the private sector if if we had anything
remotely like capitalist systems we
don't they would they would adhere to
the capitalist principle that if an
investor takes risks and you know
invests and weights and picks were
skiing steps and if something comes out
of it
it goes back to the investor that's not
the way it works here the profit goes to
people had nothing to do with it the
risks are taken by you often through the
Pentagon and comparable systems and if
anything comes out the profits code of
Microsoft and Apple they didn't create
it they bar they take it it's given to
them and it literally is decades so
computers were the first the computer
market personal computer market became
viable in 1977 I think it was Apple was
the first that was about 30 years after
the development of computers almost all
in the state sector like in the building
where I work and it's the said if you
buy pharmaceuticals let's say the
research the basic research and
development is pretty much done in the
state sector the place is like probably
the biology lab right here probably gets
government funding grants and that's all
across the board when you look back at
these I mentioned the trans-pacific
partnership one part of that was leaked
by WikiLeaks it's secret except for the
corporate lawyers and lobbyists but one
part was leaked it was under the part on
intellectual property intellectual
property is a polite term a kind of a
euphemism for government instituted
monopoly pricing rights that's what it
really means it means extraordinarily
high patent rights which have never
existed in history for the
pharmaceutical corporations and some
other corporations that's to keep the
price of drugs up and make profits
astronomical now there's a pretext the
pharmaceutical corporations say look we
need that for research and development
let's been investigated turns out that
it's probably at least half of the R&D
is not done by the pharmaceutical
corporations at all
it's done by the state sector and so on
and that's an under estimate because if
you take a close look the part that's
done by the pharmaceutical corporations
is towards the marketing end like you
know flip around a molecule to get a new
drug but the basic research the hard
crossley risky research that's done by
people like you you pay for it through
taxes and the pharmaceutical
corporations rip off the profit actually
there is a study by a one study by a
very good American economist Dean Baker
who suggested what would happen if are
indeed was a hundred percent funded by
the public and the pharmaceutical
corporations were compelled to go on the
market to sell what they produce it
turns out that be a colossal saving for
the public and of course a sharp
reduction in profits of the big
industries that's intellectual property
that's the part of the trans-pacific
partnership that was leaked but going
back to the military-industrial complex
it's a kind of misleading term it really
refers to most of the advanced economy
which in our societies is substantially
state-based and instantly that goes back
hundreds of years you take a look at
British economic development it wasn't
through the market it was through
powerful state intervention same with
the United States same with Germany
Japan France every developed society
asian tigers and so on well we have a
few questions already from elsewhere so
here I'll just edit them apologies to
those whose questions are not read out
um you'll get this quite quickly how
long before the chickens come home to
how long before the chickens come home
to roost is one question another one is
the late Robert
argued that we live in a polyarchy not a
democracy do you agree and the final
question I all mentioned here is that
the IPC IPCC wrote recently that climate
change mitigation is unachievable if
individual agents advanced own interests
independently do you agree well we know
the answer that question I'll say it
anyway is the first then the third
question are pretty similar according to
the IPCC the study the studies that are
followed it I quotes quoted a couple of
them the chickens are coming home to
roost already and they're going to it's
going to be pretty serious within a
generation or two very serious I mean it
just imagine what a ten-foot rising sea
level would be most cities would be gone
the real danger the past raphy would be
for the poor as always so Bangladesh for
example is a coastal plain is millions
tens of millions of people we wiped out
what kind of civilization could survive
a rise of ten feet and sea level just
ask yourselves and that's within sight
you know your grandchildren it's not
that far is a change but Shiva bowl
technically yes but is it feasible as
the question and whether it's feasible
or not goes back to your decisions will
people make decisions that will do what
ought to be done most of the fossil
fuels ought to stay in the ground just
as Ecuador proposed and efforts should
be made to develop alternatives that's
not inconceivable I mentioned Germany
the Germany's on a path to get to about
seventy percent sister
energy within a short term now that
might be impeded if you read the US
business press they're very excited now
about the fact that thanks to enormous
use of fossil fuels in the United States
energy prices are going down in the
United States and that will make a
European manufacturing uncompetitive and
therefore Europe will have to back off
on its conservation measures that's a
great thing because then we'll make more
profit and the steps that are taken
towards saving our grandchildren will be
dropped off that is the moral calculus
of anglo-american state capitalism we
should recognize that but it is
technically feasible there are all sorts
of other possibilities that can be
exploited but not without decisions and
if decisions are left in the hands of
state and private power there is no
reason to expect any emitter ation of
this it's just getting worse like the
quotes from Obama that are in polyarchy
Polly Ark is a young it's kind of a flip
I think he's valves basically right but
why not simply say it it's a plutocracy
the very rich make decisions in their
own interests and most of the population
is irrelevant actually it's worse in
Europe than in the United States Europe
what's happened in Europe in the past 10
or 20 years is just astonishing I mean
even the wall street journal is
astonished they pointed out recently in
an article that which is correct but in
europe no matter what government is
elected you know far left far right
anything else they follow exactly the
same policies because they have no role
in setting policy the policies are set
in the and by the bureaucrats and
brussels under the shadow of the bund
 so it doesn't matter what people
think in fact there are some dramatic
illustrations of that couple years ago
the Greek Prime Minister Papandreou
meekly suggested that maybe there should
be a referendum in Greece so that people
could say whether they wanted to accept
the policies that were being dictated
through them he was denounced across the
spectrum everybody denounced them is
totally crazy how can you dare ask the
population that what policies ought to
be in Europe we know that policies have
to be set by the bureaucrats and the
bankers polyarchy isn't really the right
term for that are you okay for one more
round of questions all right let's just
see what we can find ah it's very
difficult lady just that I'm afraid my
choices are going to be pretty arbitrary
thank you my questions about your final
statement you said something like we
have to face our two major problems and
consider what we can do to avoid
destruction think about what we can do
what would you advise we do when we
leave this room because I feel quite
free from what would you advise
practically as yes given given what you
have talked about and the imminence this
century as it were disaster would you
advise people to do all right let's
let's um let's go over there
you mentioned that the richest countries
in the world are amongst those who most
disregard the true security of their
people in places the interests of the
wealthy and the powerful however it
could be argued that the poorest
countries in the world are doing exactly
the same thing how can we explain the
explain these differences in protein
given that each seems to pursue similar
policy strategies and is it a question
of balance do you want to put that in a
slightly simpler way don't read it just
so the richest and the poorest countries
in the world each seem to disregard the
true security of their people and yet
they seem to experience completely
different fortunes how can we explain
this yeah is that clear good let's just
try and take a few more because this
will be the last cluster go on Richard
ate at random in you talk um talked
mainly about the US and about Europe but
like what do you think about the rise of
China in terms of like you know the
future you might see said refer all
right chill I think we'll have to we'll
just all I'll just take one last
question over there and then we have to
stop it rich just over here the corner
can I ask you a personal ethical
question how do you square having your
views with working in MIT oh that's easy
all right but as a PhD SI since I don't
got my PhD from MIT declare a conflict
of interest here I've got a last
question for you which is this how do
you imagine democracy the shape and form
of a democracy that would be open floor
lyst responsive it would have to be a
very different kind of democracies to
standard electoral short-term
competitive democracy but we also know
that forms of direct democracy produce
their own internal difficulties so the
question is when you imagine
a world beyond as it were state
capitalism and competitive elitist
democracy what do you imagine okay let
me run through them in order the first
question is as individuals what can we
do the answer is practically nothing
what what could be done and always has
been done in history is by people who
are organized organized groups the labor
movement civil rights movement women's
movement anti-war movement environmental
movement's these can do things but if
and that's one of the reasons why
powerful systems are so intent on
atomizing people it's very striking take
the a lot of propaganda about the
wonders of markets actually we only have
very limited markets but there are
markets markets are supposed to be
magnificent because they increase your
choices actually they restrict your
choices you think about it for a minute
suppose I want to get home from work at
night okay the market offers me a choice
I can have a four-door Toyota it does
not offer me the choice of a subway what
I want what's good for me what's good
for the environment what's good for my
children but that's not offered in the
market markets offer individual
consumption and the enormous stress on
the importance of markets is part of the
way to drive people towards looking for
yourself amassing as many commodities
you can forget everything else in fact
if you think about it for every one of
you is taking an economics course or
read about it then you know what markets
are supposed to be markets are supposed
to be systems in which informed
consumers make rational choices right
I'm sure every one of you is turned on a
television set what do you see when you
turn on a tell
Shin said you see that there's a huge
industry public relations industry which
began in the United States and Britain
incidentally huge industry which is
designed to undermine markets every ad
is an attempt to create an uninformed
consumer will make an irrational choice
right a huge effort on the part of the
business world the undermine markets but
to keep the aspect that's useful for
profit and power namely separating
people from one another it focusing on
individual choices not working with your
neighbor so to get back to what you can
do as an individual not a lot except
what's always worked in the past and can
work in the future the second question
pointed out that the rich and the
powerful of the state's act pretty much
the same way mostly that's true not
entirely I mentioned the case of Ecuador
which did make an effort to do with its
fossil fuels work ought to be ought to
be done but by and large it's doubtless
true that's why I didn't really talk
about states when I said that these
sectors of the world population that are
leading the effort to try to avert the
disaster are not States they're
organized groups they're the indigenous
populations the First Nations in Canada
let's say are not a state they're the
ones who are trying to stop the tar
sands development which is really lethal
in Australia the Aboriginal people are
very battered and beaten the those who
have survived the onslaught are in the
lead and trying to stop the uranium gold
the other mining in India there's a war
going on with the tribal people trying
to protect the
reserves from destruction by
developmental projects you know mining
and so on which will destroy them and
but it's worth going make keep keeping
just two countries it's true that you
can't expect states to behave very
differently from the way they in fact do
under our general kinds of organizations
and structures but of course with the
powerful states do is just a lot more
significant it doesn't matter that much
what Ecuador does matters a lot what
England in the u.s. do so that's that's
up to us and that gets to the next
question what about China China's in
it's an interesting case it's a complex
case china in the last China gained
independence in 1949 from 1949 the 1979
about that was the roughly the Maoist
period there's a lot of develop there
were a lot of horrors than real
atrocities took place a huge famine
killed maybe 30 40 million people but
there are some interesting things that
happen that aren't discussed very much
there are interesting studies of
comparing China and India it's an
interesting comparison that attained
independence same time two huge
countries that both very poor they were
pretty similar in 1949 late 40s and they
developed differently during during the
next 30 years than majors one of the
major studies of this is by a leading
economist Amartya Sen Nobel laureate in
economics and specialist on India he and
his associate genres economists didn't
bail a very good economist a good a
study of
the of mortality in China and India
between 1949 and 1979 when China shifted
course turned out in this period
according to their calculation a hundred
million people were killed in democratic
capitalist India as compared with China
because of what India didn't do it
didn't introduce rural reforms health
clinics barefoot back there is fected
almost nothing for the peasant
population and the difference in
mortality amounts to a hundred million
people that it's a pretty interesting in
itself it's pretty striking but it's
particularly striking because what was
happening in the propaganda system but
right at this time a book came out in
France first then translated in english
called the Black Book of communism which
is part of the huge propaganda onslaught
against how terrible communism wasn't it
was pretty terrible that's true the book
claimed that a hundred million people
had been killed by communism okay so
here we have two studies one of them
says a hundred million people were
killed by the communists most of it not
based on any date at a much just talk
but let's say it's true another careful
study saying that one democratic
capitalist country killed 100 million
people as compared with China that what
was the reaction to the to the Black
Book of communism front page reviews all
over articles everybody knows about it
tells us how horrible communism is the
send read study I wrote about it when I
marchesan got the Nobel Prize I had a
lot of interviews and I tried to
convince journalists to mention it one
did an Indian journalists actually
mention
that you're going to look pretty hard to
find any reference to it well that's one
fact about China since China began its
shift towards a kind of a whatever you
call at a state market system there has
been substantial growth mortality on
their land as level a health of the
population has not improved barely
improved it's a look at the rates it
went mortality improved very sharply up
till 79 kind of levels off but there's
been a lot of development China's raised
more people out of poverty than the rest
of the world combined by a long shot the
last generation or two and China is busy
destroying the environment they now
produce more that their emissions rates
are total emissions are now higher than
the u.s. they are making some efforts
cut it back like China is the world
leader in solar panel production and not
just the mass of it but even high
technology solar panels but it's a
pretty hard slog china is still a very
poor country and a lot of talk about
china taken over the world and so on but
if you look at the actual measures say
human development index and of the
United Nations China's i think around
90th or something it's extremely poor
country it has enormous internal
problems that the West doesn't have its
had some spectacular successes it many
much of what it's doing is harmful
that's but we can't do much about China
we can do something about ourselves but
I think we should be pretty cautious
about the speculations of China become
the great superpower of the future in
fact if you look closely at Chinese
Chinese exports and ask how much value
is added in China you get quite a
different picture of Chinese economic
success so like to say and I
if that's exported from China we call it
a Chinese export but actually the the
technology and the high technology and
the software on the design mostly come
from the peripheral industrial countries
that Japan South Korea and Taiwan and
China adds the assembly and the west of
course which invests in China it's the
thick I don't remember the numbers of a
fan but the figures are very high the
actual value added in China is pretty
slight well that's going to increase
over the years China's climbing a
technology ladder but it's not a simple
path and I think we should keep those
things in mind there's some good studies
of this working at MIT I don't find a
problem with it I don't have any
objection to the fact that people have
computers internet iphones and so on I
don't like the way it's done it's done
very undemocratically like people in the
1950s we're not asked do you want your
your taxes to go into a profits for
Apple 30 years from now and maybe an
iphone for your great grandchildren or
do you want your taxes to go into health
education mass transportation decent
society and so on people weren't offered
that choice the choice they were told is
do you want to be destroyed by the
Russians or not and if you don't want to
be destroyed by the Russians put the
money into the Pentagon it as Huntington
pointed out that was a misimpression but
it's one that did lead to the economy
however this has nothing to do with MIT
you know if I didn't work at MIT the
same thing of that I worked there
because I think it's a great University
I'd like it then never thought of going
anywhere else but I don't see a conflict
in fact it's kind of the other way
around
when being a place like MIT or being in
a country like England it gives you a
chance to influence policy what you
couldn't do if you were elsewhere that's
significant so if you have a choice of
what country to live in and you want to
try if you're interested making it a
better world the best country live in
the United States even it's if it's
maybe the most destructive country in
the world because that's where you can
change policy if you live in the North
unaware Ecuador let's say you can
complain about policy which can do much
about it so I don't see that as much of
a conflict what would it democracy look
like well my own feeling is that
thinking about the various kinds of
technical ways in which representation
can take place it don't really carry us
very far almost because what really
matters is what kind of socio-economic
arrangements are there now here we go
back to I think you have to start with
something more fundamental there plenty
of hierarchic relations in society all
kinds from family to international
affairs I think we should always ask the
question wherever there is such a
structure is it legitimate and there's a
burden of proof it has to prove its
legitimacy it's not automatically self
legitimating so wherever there's a
structure of authority domination
hierarchy patriarchal family the
International Affairs anything in
between the question of legitimacy of
the structure arises sometimes you can
justify a structure of dominance but
very rarely and wherever you can't it
ought to simply be dismantled and that's
across the spectrum and it
in many different ways so say the the
feminist revolution of the last roughly
generation had a big impact on certain
kinds of dominant structures that's
quite significant the work around
enterprises set the basis up for a
different kind of economic and political
structure and they exist as some of them
in fact are quite substantial that the
Mondragon unglamorous in Spain is first
of all economically quite successful one
of the few parts of the Spanish economy
that's going to survive this austerity
devastating austerity policies but it
also is democratic in a way which
doesn't show up in method of voting and
so on and I think those are kind of the
major factors that have to be looked at
the kinds you mentioned are important
and I don't you could debate exactly how
it could be done but I mean I don't see
how any complex system can avoid some
sort of representative democracy only
just can't have a vote on everything but
the representatives should be
accountable recallable subject to
constant surveillance and control and
interchangeable and that does have you
know there can be negative aspects to
that but I can't see that much can be
avoided well what is there to say now no
thank you you've made an extraordinary
contribution as an academic as a
litigation to linguistics to philosophy
to public life for a very very long time
and the fact that you were here today
aged 85 is an extraordinary testament to
your vitality and your energy and your
and the current and the number of people
that were excited about your visit is
really striking it was the Twitter
excitement the number of times we were
asked the tickets I've never seen so
much
arise when we declare that the tickets
are already all gone on that was fury of
the gates of the castle and that's the
cost everybody wanted to get in to hear
you and we know why so many many thanks
on behalf of everybody here
