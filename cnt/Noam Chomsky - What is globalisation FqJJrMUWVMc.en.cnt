what's globalization actually the best
definition of it I know of if I can
remember it is by a very well-known
development economist Canadian
development economist guy named Gerald a
liner who tried to summarize it in a
little bitty which went something like
this don't hold me to the exact word he
said that the poor complain they always
do but that's just idle chatter our
system brings rewards to all at least to
all who matter essentially captures it
okay I go home whenever I say
globalization I mean in quotes you know
what's called globalization is one
specific modality of international
integration there is nothing wrong with
international integration that's a great
thing that's nice to meet people from
other countries and all sorts of others
there but there are various forms of
possible international integration and
the one that's called globalization is
one particular like it's not the new
international economic order that the
South was calling for and it's not the
new global system that they're now
calling for its differently this new one
are the one that is called the official
one you know the one that Thomas
Friedman writes a lot of 30 books about
and so on among its other properties are
that a country have to open up their
their borders to free imports so they
have to accept imports from highly
subsidized to the US European and
Canadian agribusiness which of course
instantly wipes out domestic production
for domestic needs and that means that
where farmers are stuck one thing they
can do is flee to the cities which has
the nice effect that they create a
massive labor force which lowers wages
and means that the US and European
manufacturers are by now Japanese and
Korean manufacturers who are the pudding
say assembly plants or whatever abroad
can benefit from cheaper labor
consequently wages can go down and in
fact duo down well the economy booms
Mexico is a dramatic case but if farmers
don't move to the urban slums to become
an excess labor force again and try to
produce something it can't be
commodities for the domestic market for
food because there will be wiped out by
imported goods so once again they become
what's called a rational peasant in the
technical literature a rational peasant
as a peasant who understands that you
have to produce for export and you have
to seek the maximum profit ok so you
spell that out produce for export stable
markets maximum profit well you get the
same answer as before Coco you know
poppies and so on and that's what's
happening so the globalization and
particularly undermining of the attempts
of the South 30 years ago to create a
form of globalization directed toward
the interests of the developing world
that means you know on the almost the
entire world one of the major
consequences of this and it's now it's a
big secret like you can read it in
standard books of political economy and
so on was to greatly accelerate
production of what we call drugs I mean
they're not the most lethal drugs the
most lethal ones are produced in places
like North Carolina but what we call
lethal drugs here patents have been
driven to it they really have no choices
in part by the choice and it was a
choice it's not an economic law the
choice by the powerful states 30 years
ago to institute a particular form of
international economic integration
what's called globalization in
preference to another one one which
would have for example that is one of
its properties and there were many
others things like stabilization of
primary commodity prices and the burkle
of neoliberal programs like opening up
your orders to imports from subsidized
agro export from northern agribusiness
that has the same effect there's a lot
more like this I mean a lot of the of
the what happens to the rational
peasants incidentally after they've
learned
their lessons properly you know they
kind of like equivalent of going to
Harvard or MIT or Chicago graduate
school and getting a degree in economics
so they become rational peasant well
once they've learned the lesson they're
rewarded they're rewarded with
helicopter gunships that you and I pay
for with chemical and biological warfare
including new experimental biological
techniques they'll have who knows what
effect and by what's called here a drug
war no that's the reward for having
learned the lessons after having been
essentially forced into a particular
kind of production by the way
globalization works out that's one of
its less discussed featured going back
to the Declaration of the South that we
are complaining as they always do
they're calling for globalization for
international economic integration they
want this but are calling for a form
that will be based on the right of
development and in particular the right
of independent development
