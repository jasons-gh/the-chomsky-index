crees was carefully timed for two years
that means it's going to come up during
the next election ok that's the sunset
technique again then everybody knows
that during an election nobody's going
to call for an increase in the payroll
tax so therefore it will become
permanent and if it becomes permanent
that is a great consequence it helps
defund Social Security Social Security
is actually in very good shape and
despite what you read in the press it
contributes zero to the deficit and
furthermore it's well-funded for a long
time to come but if you defund it then
it'll be in trouble and there's a
standard technique of privatization used
all the time it's being used right now
in public education Maggie Thatcher used
it in England when she wanted to
privatize the railroads defund something
and then it stops working and then you
have a climber about making it work so
you have to privatize it absolutely
standard and routine I mean it takes
genius not to see it so the idea is
defund Social Security then it'll be in
trouble then we'll have to privatize it
that's a huge bonanza for Wall Street
now trillions of dollars of capital are
going to go into the hands of financial
managers to play games with make huge
profits and when they get in trouble as
they will get bailed out of course it
also substantially increases in security
but that doesn't affect the wealthy
certainly not the super-rich peter
peterson billionaire who's been heading
the campaign to destroy Social Security
for years that one of its standard lines
is I don't rely on Social Security
that's true if you're a billionaire but
for most people it's the means of
survival especially now that their
wealth has collapsed after the fake
wealth of the housing bubble burst
well but they're more reason apart from
the fact that social security helps the
middle class and the working people and
not the wealthy there's another reason
for trying to get rid of it it's based
on a very dangerous principle Social
Security it's based on a principle of
solidarity and sympathy the Social
Security is based on the principle that
you care if disabled widow across town
is starving and you're not supposed to
do that you're supposed to gain wealth
forgetting all but self you know the new
spirit of the age 150 years ago and not
care about other people and that that's
drilled into people's heads from
childhood and Social Security stands as
in opposition to that and so to public
schools the public schools are based on
the principle that even if you don't
have children in the school you care
whether kids go to school so therefore
there should be a good education for
them and that again is no good public
schools no mean a thing to wealthy
people but they do mean a lot to the
population and that spirit of solidarity
and sympathy that's quite dangerous that
could spread and lead the other
consequences well these are major
developments right now they're all part
of a systematic campaign of quite bitter
class war which has many aspects in fact
it's happening in many ways which aren't
visible actually the tax cuts for the
rich or also not very visible one of the
ways that it's being carried out is by
changing the rules of corporate
governance now those are established by
the government corporations are state
created artificial entities and the
government sets the rules of corporate
governance they've been changed
substantially in the United States not
not in other countries so for example
executives chief
negatives are now permitted under the
new rules to select the boards that
determine their salaries okay then take
a genius to figure out what's going to
happen from that those techniques have
been devised by the government to allow
executives to get stock options instead
of direct pay that's a way of concealing
the huge giveaway to the super-rich
there were efforts in the early 90s by
government agencies to try to at least
get some transparency into that but
Congress beat them down deregulation has
been going on since the late 70s and
that gives enormous benefits to
corporate management very harmful to the
population in fact we can see that
during the period when the New Deal
regulations were in force there weren't
any financial crises 50s and 60s since
deregulation began there's been a series
of regular financial crises right
through the Reagan years on the Clinton
year big tech level and on of course
right now is the worst of them they keep
getting worse each one's worse their
direct consequences of eliminating the
kind of regulation that would keep a
financial system functioning but it
doesn't really matter if they get worse
and worse because the rich make out fine
they get bailed out each time so the
trick is the public pays the costs and
the rich make the benefits in a
wonderful system one part of this you
know everyone knows them like everyone
knows about the bailouts they're visible
when they create a lot of anger but
they're the least of it much more
significant was that than that was the
Treasury and the Fed giving a very cheap
credit making cheap credit available
to collapsing the corporations and banks
and plenty of other devices they way far
outweigh the tarp subsidy there's also a
crucial government insurance policy the
government ensures big corporations and
banks against failure there's a name for
that it's called too big to fail that
means if you're a big bank or you know
your Goldman Sachs or Citigroup or
something like that you know you're not
going to fail because if you do the
taxpayers go to come in and bail you out
well that creates a very perverse
incentives it means you can you should
in fact take major risks and make a lot
of money and when they collapse as risky
transactions do don't worry about it
taxpayer will come in and fill your
pockets exactly what's happening the now
bigger than ever just take a look at the
bonuses well these developments are
sometimes call often in fact called just
inexorable processes you know the result
of globalization new technology and so
on that can't be true Europe lives in
the same economy that the United States
does but government policies there are
completely different in all the respects
i mentioned to take a look the european
countries taxes have the traditional
role they reduce inequality maybe not by
much but at least they target inequality
they're here is it used to be that way
here to now it's the opposite the tax
system increases inequality and is
carefully designed to do so and its
inequality at the very extreme end ceos
hit bank managers and so on that's a
pretty dramatic they these guys also
happen to be the main funders of
elections well as i mentioned the
elections have become PR extravaganzas
and campaign
Scherzer and not shy about it they say
quite openly that the campaign's must
feature have to focus on personalities
on rhetoric and not on issues and polls
show that recent elections the public is
unaware of the stand of the parties on
issues that's not because they're
ignorant or unconcerned it's because a
very careful effort is made to keep the
issues out of the picture supposed to
get the ignorant and meddlesome
outsiders out of politics after all and
there's a particular reason for that is
that policy there's a tremendous
disconnect between policies and public
opinion so that's another reason for
keeping issues and policies out of the
public eye actually it's more nuanced
than that now there have been some
careful studies of Senate votes and
Senate votes it turns out are responsive
to a part of the public namely the very
rich so the top third if you take a look
at the top third of the income
distribution a senatorial votes kind of
Carly reasonably well with opinion
overwhelmingly with the very top you
take the middle third there's no
correlation you take the bottom third
there is a correlation but it's negative
that means votes are counter to the
wishes of the constituency well again
you know makes sense within class war
campaign spending is now so extravagant
that elections are basically blocked by
private concentrations of capital as you
may know Obama in 2008 after the
election that won a prize from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of 2008 beat out
Apple Computer if you look at the if you
look at the business press which again
is not shy
executives were just euphoric they said
we've been selling candidates like
toothpaste ever since Reagan this is the
greatest achievement we've ever had it's
going to change the atmosphere in
corporate boardrooms you know new styles
and so on um yeah that makes good sense
the
I mentioned that the Republicans have
just given up being a traditional
political party I mean simply deep in
the pockets of the very rich in the
business sector there aren't the
moderate Republicans of the past or now
the Democrats and they're not far behind
so it takes a Obama again the main
source of his funding in the two
thousand eight election the concentrated
funding was financial institutions very
powerful in the economy now and they
preferred him to McCain and that sort of
carried him over if you look closely and
they expected to be rewarded it's the
way politics works and they were soon as
Obama picked a financial team economic
team to deal with the financial crisis
that the financial institutions had
created he picked their people right
across the board all the robert rubin
group straight out of citigroup Larry
Summers the high priest of deregulation
a Timothy Geithner of the New York Stock
Exchange who had been kind of
supervising the shenanigans of the of
the housing bubble in the rest and the
right along the line now there was
actually one exception Paul Volcker Paul
Volcker was Treasury secretary under
Reagan but the spectrum has shifted so
far to the right so that he's now the
liberal in the government he was the one
person there who was calling seriously
for financial regulation and I stress
was because he's just been kicked out
just a couple of days ago the fuller was
replaced by Jeffrey a melt the head of
General Electric Obama was praised for
that shows he's moving toward the center
meaning the far right and becoming more
business-friendly even more than the
were what was the reason for it was good
reason for getting rid of Folker
financial institutions in like it he was
calling for regulation limited but some
but why pick a melt well actually that's
discussed in the business press the
world's leading business daily the
London Financial Times points out that
mystery melts appointment was applauded
by the US Chamber of Commerce you know
the biggest lobbying group which has
been among the president's harshest
critics and funded many Republicans who
ran against Democrats in November
election well we don't want that to
happen again so we'll get them on our
side Thomas Ferguson who I mentioned
before the main specialist on campaign
funding he says it more straight out he
said what we actually have here is the
appear is the disappearance from the
scene of the best known and most visible
critic of the excesses of the financial
sector and his replacement by the
sitting CEO of a company that is heavily
dependent on government aid of all sorts
including diplomatic assistance to
invest more in China and in fact
straight bailouts this is not about jobs
he continues but political money the
White House knows that after the
Citizens United case year ago in the
Supreme Court
