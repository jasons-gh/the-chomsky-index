hello gnome it's really good to see you
it must be morning in Arizona it's
evening here in Islamabad
are you well okay excellent don't
there's a whole lot of things that I
want to talk to you about but let me
start with this it appears as if the
world is retry belies a
we're going back to our primal tribal
loyalties to religion to nationalism and
you see this just about everywhere you
see this with brexit with the rise of
the ultra-right in Europe with Donald
Trump in the United States and here in
Pakistan
you have just bloodletting with Sunnis
killing Shias and everybody after the
Hama DS and the christians and the
hindus
and in india that seems to be a country
that's just gone mad with their
protection of the cow what's going on
there was a time of the European
enlightenment and I know that you admire
John Stuart Mill very much have we given
up on the advances that humans had made
in those times what's going on for one
thing remember my age I was a child in
the 1930s and I from a child's point of
view nevertheless could observe what's
happening this country was totally
collapsing a huge unemployment
starvation and nothing working in Europe
Germany Italy had fallen under fascist
rule years before I was born the US was
in fact supporting Mussolini openly the
Germany had fallen to Nazism by the
early 30s by 1938 Austria had fallen
Czechoslovakia was taken
Spain was being conquered by fascist
government Franco as you may know the
first article I wrote was in that I can
remember was in February 1939 when
Barcelona fell and the article was about
the inexorable rise of fascism which
looks it's going to take over the world
with everything collapsing here without
going into detail that Japan was
carrying out horrendous atrocities in
East Asia it was just horrifying much
worse than though so it's not new we've
been through much worse periods much
worse in fact if the war had lasted
another year a Germany might have
actually won it's no joke
in the you take a look at us now that we
know about us planning in the early
years of the war thirty-nine to about
forty three octo Stalin drug the after
Stalin drug a u.s. planners were
planning on a future world which would
be partly us dominated and partly German
dominated that is half part large part
of the world most Eurasia
would be under Nazism are we facing that
I mean it's bad but it's not that so to
say that there couldn't have been a
harsher attack on the Enlightenment than
Nazism supported by leading figure like
Martin Heidegger who was writing in 1935
that Germany under the Nazis is the only
hope of saving the magnificence of
Greeks of the Greek heritage from the
barbarians of East and West I mean it's
bad now
I agree but not that so first of all I
think we should keep the sense of worry
second and there are other cases during
First World War was just horrifying
right after the first world war in the
United States Woodrow Wilson's
administration launched a repression
which is the worst repression in US
history
thousands of people were deported huge
numbers imprisoned the labor movement
destroyed independent thought was
destroyed was a deep harsh repression
we've never had anything like it since
so you look over history and look a
little back further in the 19th century
what was the United States doing it was
running the worst most hideous system of
slavery in human history
it was exterminating the indigenous
population step by step carrying out
well into the late 19th century attacks
that by now are understood even by
scholarship to be literally genocidal
not a pretty history and the British
were administering famines in India
which killed tens of millions of people
on while it was plenty of food around
but it was Imperial policy you went on
till 1943 when Churchill decided that
people in England needed white breads on
so a couple of million people in Bengal
had to die that was then it's bad now
but not what's happened before there's a
lot of it and what's happening now so
let's take know several things are
happening in the Western world the
United States and Europe we've had he
took a look at the post-war period post
Second World War basically two years now
there was a period of 50s in the 60s
which had the highest growth of American
history no financial collapses fairly
gala terian first opportunities since
reconstruction for African Americans to
somehow enter into the system some
progress and civil rights a lot of
things wrong with substantial progress
that lasted into the 70s seventies he
hit a switch significant switch and
social and economic policy and the
reasons for it when you look at
one of the main ones is that the rate of
profit was declining as a result of
militancy of labor and other activism
and there were clear statements about it
Powell memorandum a lot of Commission
report others about the excess of
democracy and you have to return things
to obedience authority that's all across
the spectrum to go into it and then come
the shift to the neoliberal policies
which have had the anticipated effect
they had restored the rate of crop there
has been there has been growth as in the
past but substantial wages and incomes
for the majority have stagnated or
declined in 2007 a period of euphoria
about the amazing new Great Moderation
the wonders of the neoclassical
economics that we problem solve 2007
right before the crash the real wages of
American workers were lower than they
had been in 1979 when the neoliberal
experiment began the that the stagnation
or declines of the population and the
heart sharp concentration of wealth is
part of a self-reinforcing cycle the
policies contribute to that the
concentration contributes to political
power which carries the policies further
that's there's been crash after crash
with deregulation we now have but the
outside of the Republican Party that we
have a recognition at least there's a
serious problem with the climate given
not ignoring hearing that's been done
about it in Europe in many ways even in
even work the dirty programs in Europe
and run by the Brico have significant
interests of all the whole European
system the way is
is simply undermining democracy
democratic decision-making is being
moved from the hands of people through
their national states to an unelected
bureaucracy of the European Commission
unelected the IMF and the central bank
that's that's it it's troika
the eeeh people have almost no say and
the policies of their governments that
are living with unimportant issues and
they know it are you getting a sense of
anger all through Europe and the United
States about the centrist the centrist
institutions you know they're called
central extradition order right but the
main establishment institutions like the
political parties that have been running
the countries forever contempt they're
solving the French elections they barely
participated the American elohim's the
striking fact about the American
election was the election of a kind of
an anti-establishment
Republican that's not so surprising but
the enormous successes the Sanders
campaign which broke with over a century
of US political history
no no contributions were mostly bought
elections no contributions from any of
the major sources media disregard or
contempt the most popular politician in
the country probably would have won the
Democratic Party nomination that binford
party managers as the center's
collapsing the reason I think is
traceable back to some social political
developments that are taking place
there's more the neoliberal form of
globalization that was instituted in the
nineties and since has magnified all
these problems the it's called free
trade but it's not free trade as a
little do with trade altogether highly
protectionist
investor rights systems which are
setting working people in competition
with one another all over the world well
thanks for putting things in perspective
and yes I'm happy that you see that
things are not as bleak as they are but
although what you say has a lot of
explanatory power for what's happening
in the United States or brexit and so
forth but it doesn't tell me very much
about why the Islamic world has exploded
in this rage rage against the United
States rage against its own self why you
have these Galera Chuck's in India who
are just tearing apart Muslims and then
such peaceful people as the Buddhists
they've gone after the rowing years I
just don't understand what's going on
now let's take Burma it was a fair a
democratic system through the great some
kind of parliamentary system the United
States at the time was being everything
could to attack China and one of the
things was setting up Chinese
nationalists and tribal forces in the
north of Burma
carry out attacks against China the and
that fed back of course led to chaos and
disruption finally a military
dictatorship took over okay that was the
end of Burmese parliamentary democracy
he was a horrible military dictatorship
finally in the last couple of years it
slightly relaxed someone but not totally
the but the Muslim attacks on the
Ibrahim got disgraceful monstrous
atrocities the government and including
[Music]
cookie who oughta know better are
supporting it India's a complicated
story there's not an in the histories
should be pretty ugly
I mean the caste system in India is just
i hideous disgrace last time I visited I
visited Indian I guess no and you
remember and going from Calcutta to
Lahore the difference was shocking I
don't have to go through it wasn't
pretty
there's a lot of wealth and in the
tremendous wealth a lot of enlightenment
and a lot of awful things it's the
mixture of the most extreme mixture of
wealth high culture enlightenment and
hideous poverty and disgraceful look
existent living standards that ever seen
maybe you see something like it in a
small sort of Central Africa but this is
a huge country so it's a very mixed
story right now there's a regression in
the Islamic world it's been under attack
for hundreds of years there's been the
Syria right now is the most awful place
the take a look at Syria years ago 100
years ago the Ottomans carried out a
horrendous attack against Syrians
Assyria probably lost more people during
the war unfortunately than any other
country a hundred thousands of people
were killed
well no no it's Syria we can go through
the rest it hasn't been a attractive
picture there was a parliamentary
government in Iran what happened to it
well made the mistake of trying to
control take control of its own
resources so the u.s. carried out and
instigated a coup which instituted the
rule of the Shah annually was receiving
the almost bitter condemnation
tremendous the international and others
this is a horrendous human rights record
then came the overthrow the code
1979 what did the u.s. do immediately
supported an Iraqi attack against Iran
David strong support even to the extent
of Reagan denying Saddam's
responsibility for the awful atrocities
against courage tried to blame it on
Iran the u.s. even permitted Saddam they
gave him a gift that's rarely allowed to
anyone now he was allowed to attack an
American ship the killing several
doesn't seamen and to get away with a
tap on the wrist real friend Israel and
the Liberty is the only analog I can
think of
finally the u.s. pretty much won the war
for Iraq hundreds of thousands of men
injured killed the chemical weapons used
we can go on in country after country
that's been the Middle East the that's
not best the u.s. the French the British
plenty of internal criminals you know
run through it so now right now
maybe the it's now the work for the next
couple of years the worst monstrosity
devices where'd that come from
was there Isis before the United States
invaded Iraq I mean the invasion of Iraq
among other crimes incited sectarian
conflict that barely existed before it's
now tearing nominate that country but
the whole region apart of one of the
outgrowths was Isis it's that these
things are not happening in a vacuum now
you take a look at them you can see the
sources for all of them the Moulton is
anything like these things has multiple
causes but among the causes and often
quite significant among the causes are
the actions of the most enlightened
States well thanks for that I pretty
much agree with all that you said but
the United States is a declining power
it's no
no no no longer close to anything of
what it was 50 years ago instead we are
seeing that China is coming up and is
coming very rapidly you see its effects
here in Pakistan very visibly there's
the Chinese Pakistan economic corridor
they're beginning to dominate industry
over here that building roads and you
see Chinese people all over the place
now so I want to ask you know if we have
a world that's dominated by China than
the United States is this going to be a
better world a more humane world one
that runs according to the rules one
that will be less imperialistic should
we expect a more humane outcome now that
the u.s. is in decline well first of all
I don't think it's a remote possibility
I mean it's true that the United States
is declining power it's been a declining
power since 1949 the peak of u.s. power
was in 1945 at that point the US had
maybe almost half the world's wealth
incredible security controlled the
hemisphere both oceans sides of both
oceans other industrial societies had
been either devastated or severely
weakened the US economy had boom during
the Second World War to the ended
depression industrial production almost
quadrupled they're just sitting on top
of the world in fact planning to run the
world well something happened in 1949
the first blow to this hegemony the
event that was called in the United
States the loss of China took many years
before people started noticing some
little odd event that fruit and by now
people will qualify it but for decades
it was the loss of China the under the
presupposition being wheel in the world
and we lost China so that's terrible
thing was a major fact in US domestic
policy
the basis for McCarthyism harsh
repression when John F Kennedy was
wondering whether to escalate in Vietnam
afraid that he'd be accused the loss of
Indochina and this huge attack on
American power and from then on declined
by the early 70s the world was
economically pretty much tri-polar with
a North American us-based center
European German based center and a North
East Asian at that point Japan that a
center not comparable in power but
economically independent fairly
comparable actors in fact you may recall
in the 1980s
Japan is number one fears japan's might
take over the world
well of the United States that has
somewhat declined since about that point
maybe us share of worth world wealth was
maybe 25 percent lower than it had been
after the Second World War
that's declined somewhat since up tilt
things are changing with Trump Trump may
in fact contribute to a rapid decline in
you guys power that's a special
phenomenon he's isolating the United
States even from its close allies but
putting that aside the long-term
tendency which I suspect is not going to
change much is the US will continue to
be militarily just beyond any comparison
only not to talk about
economically a very powerful state that
that's misleading because in the
contemporary globalized system the
system that's developed pretty much
since the 90s with complicated value
chains a corporation of an Apple
Computer the profit is mostly in the
United States but it's put together
assembled in China mostly under the
control of the Taiwanese company the
parts and components come from South
Korea to defend one small enterprises
all over the place or the making little
pieces of it the offices are in Ireland
don't pay taxes that's the biggest
company in the world you take a look at
the globalized economy that's developed
turns out the US company US corporations
owned about half the world economy
that's probably even more than us power
and 1950 and that's not a major that's
usually used but it's becoming a
significant measure national accounts
still mean a lot but not what they did
50 years ago now there and of course
these corporations are based in the
United States supported in the United
States both in subsidies and militarily
and diplomatically and so on but I think
pretty much on the world China's not
anywhere near you take a look at didn't
sector after sector and factoring
rebuild commerce wherever you look at US
corporations are one occasionally -
China's the word of its name China is a
growing developing power it has it's a
poor country take a look at rankings in
the UN you know Development Index it I
think it ranks around 90 is there
something has enormous internal problems
that the West doesn't have enormous
ecological problems of it as demographic
problems that there was a bump of
demographic bump for about 20 years of
people of working age of people work
males multiple females to a working age
is declining it's being it's it's it's
moving significantly in many directions
but has enormous problems what China is
doing and Pakistan is part of this is
expanding its system of social and
economic control to the west that's been
going on for some years with the
Shanghai Cooperation
raishin organization the New Silk Road
project goes into Pakistan building a
new port got our pork try to avoid the
the stranglehold that the US and its
allies have on the orchestrates oil went
to the west and it's this is going to
expand India's not part Pakistan Iran
sooner or later I'll be buried in Turkey
went to Europe and eastern Russia's
various part of it and that's it
built the Asian Development Bank
Shanghai there's gonna become more and
more important almost every country
outside the United States including US
allies dissipating the u.s. withdraws
from world affairs
very shortly under Trump but it's been
going slowly now the Chinese influence
will of course increase is it benign far
from it
a Chinese developments in Africa or no
they do build things which the African
use with the British in India too the
overall effect is pretty ugly and you
can expect it to be this name but I
don't think anywhere near our on
anywhere near the scale of the United
States or well once upon a time the
United States had the power to make and
break governments here in Pakistan and
the u.s. was all over the place they
they gave arms to the gay fighter jets
destroyers whatever to the Army Navy and
so forth and they had enormous power but
that's no longer true now it's a fading
presence over here instead you see that
it's the Chinese fighter jets which the
Pakistan Air Force has and China is
everywhere everywhere and it's a sweeter
the our friendship is sweeter than honey
and higher than the Himalayas and all
that sort of
staff should thinking Pakistanis be
worried about what's going on in terms
of our relationship with China mm-hmm
should be worried about any great power
China's one and in Pakistan and what you
described is quite true but in the world
that's still a very partial and small
part
I mean China's entity of China's
presence you see everywhere they go to
South America say Brazil Chinese goods
all over the place of the trading
relations and this is part of the
serious problem of South American a
feathered develop has been reliance on
their rich resources of primary products
and recent years being sucked up by
China in return China sends cheap
manufacturing goods which undermine
domestic manufacturing in industry so
yeah that's a real problem but it's not
on the order of overthrowing
government's instituting military
regimes invading economic massive
economic controls and so we're near the
power of the Western imperial powers the
u.s. obviously Britain and France as
well no here in Pakistan nobody seems to
be worrying about nuclear weapons very
much but we've entered an
extraordinarily dangerous phase where we
have exchanges of artillery fire across
the line of control practically every
day and then on the other hand Pakistan
has gone in for tactical nuclear weapons
which are relatively easy to use and
very hard to control
and similarly India's going in for
nuclear submarines and nuclear launched
ballistic missiles and so forth now
things seem to be getting very dangerous
here but it's even more dangerous in
North Korea where there's such a dense
nuclear standoff at the moment
with the North Korean regime developing
missiles and even a hydrogen bomb how do
you see this panning out are things in
our control anymore let's take each case
on its own not take Indian Pakistan as
you say India developed weapons Pakistan
then responded them as long as Pakistan
tries to match India militarily Pakistan
they just can't compete with India they
can't match no nuclear weapons program
which is a devastating threat not only
in the South Asia to the world so how
did Pakistan at first are you still
hearing me because I says you're
Internet yeah well at first the United
States opposed Indian nuclear weapons
development and at least formally it did
show up until the George Bush
administration which decided to support
it
various trickery which we wanted to go
through but it in and ended up
effectively giving us support for Indian
nuclear weapons and in the twisting the
arms of the international nuclear
control group to get them to kind of
authorizes and what about Pakistan in
the 1980s under 0 'clock Pakistan began
to develop nuclear weapons the Reagan
administration pretended that they
didn't know it's inconceivable that they
didn't know with all their intelligence
assets in Pakistan defies belief but
they pretended they didn't know they
wanted to keep funding Pakistan to carry
out their public is in Afghanistan
nothing to do with helping the Afghans
the CIA chief in Islamabad is you may
recall me that are very explicit he said
where
they're to help the Afghans we want to
harm the Russians when I make the
Russian lead so for that day just afraid
Afghanistan and watch silently well
ex-nun develop nuclear weapons
now the basic conflict for correct me if
you think this is wrong but it seems to
me the basic india-pakistan conflict is
probably over Kashmir and until that's
settled in some fashion or anything you
can imagine settlements a fiasco
sensible proposals for settlement I
think they could be pursued if they
could be pursued then maybe Indian
Pakistan could relaxed the military
confrontation and maybe move towards
what ought to happen all through the
world and as partially happened already
setting up of nuclear weapons free zones
could imagine moving to a South Asian
nuclear weapons free zone as has
happened in the Western Hemisphere apart
from the US and Canada the Pacific in
Africa almost Africa has a nuclear
weapons regional but it's never gone
into effect because of Diego Garcia the
u.s. insists on maintaining a huge
nuclear presence on the island of Murcia
which the Africans regarded as part of
Africa now Pacific has a nuclear weapons
free zone almost the you could first
France blocked it because they wanted to
carry out the tests in their islands
there more recently the US has blocked
it because it wants to store nuclear
weapons and have nuclear weapons passage
through its possessions there but it
almost works the most interesting is the
Middle East now right now we're facing a
major comeback to North Korea we're
facing a major potential crisis in the
case of Iran the administration as you
know has announced they're going to
decertify
right then comes the question whether
Congress will impose sanctions
if they do that kills the us-iranian
view might go on with Europe at the u.s.
Iranian portal drop the Iran may react
and if they do what happens next well
you can listen to the Republican
senators the leading ones on the right
Tom cotton says soon as we find there
doing anything will bomb
towards the other end the what's called
honor what you call it the adult end of
the Republican Party crazed all right
but the sort of sane in what you have
which is bob corker just retired because
he can't handle the craziness what he
said is our strategy is to try to derive
drive we ran into some kind of violation
and if they carry out a violation then
BOOM
that's the same side that's what we're
facing in Iran now what's the problem
with Iranian weapons the US intelligence
has made it very explicitly say yeah the
problem is it will be part of their
deterrent strategy and the rogue states
the United States and Israel can't
tolerate the deterrent he didn't say
that of course I'm adding it but that's
what it comes down to so look at part of
the nobody's saying things that I never
use nuclear weapons that could be a
deterrent and the states that like to
rampage freely in the region don't want
out the turns around so if in fact Iran
acts in a way which the administration
and Congress can claim as a violation
maybe Israel and the US will get in and
bomb too then what happens I mean half
the world goes up Norma Willa
is there a settle is there a possible
answer yeah it's very for the Europeans
know the answer in fact everybody in the
world knows the answer just continue
with the agreement the agreement my view
was too harsh on Iran it's another story
but they've accepted it there
living up to its who pursue it is there
a further possibility no further
possibility is to accept Iran's proposal
to advocacy of establishing a nuclear
weapons free zone in the Middle East
that would be very important
Iran's in favor of it the non-aligned
countries have been pushing it for years
the United States and Britain are
committed to it committed to it I will
say it but when they decided the bomb to
attack Iran not in 2003 as a pretext
they invoked a treaty that agreement
with Iran back after the Quade war and
if you read that agreement now take a
look at article 14 it says the US and
Britain will be committed to
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East
nobody can refer to that operation but
can find it so everybody in the world
least in theory is in favor of it it
never happens because the u.s. blocks it
that every a nuclear review session
every one periodic nuclear review
decisions last one in 2015 but is that
impossible
and of course everybody knows why
exactly one it would mean that Israel's
nuclear weapons would have to come and
earn under international inspection the
u.s. one except Minh was real of course
so that is there a long-term solution
there yeah possibly
we've covered most of the world except
for North Korea is there a possible
solution they're young and in fact
everybody knows what it is except the
Chinese proposal with Russian support
and North Korean acquiescence for end of
what's called a double freeze North
Korea freezes its nuclear weapons
programs the United States calls off
threatening military maneuvers on North
Korea's borders like know that nuclear
capable bombers flying right at the
border that sort of thing and the North
Koreans have some hammers going to go
into it but North Korea was absolutely
wiped out and a savage assault mostly
after the war had settled down at the
38th parallel just pure savagery
lootellan real crimes and who remembered
like bombing dams and so on and so forth
so that's a first step in a solution
what comes next
negotiations diplomacy could they
succeed they could in fact if you look
at the record time to go through it but
every time when there have been repeated
times when an agreement was reached
effect in 2005 even an agreement in
which North Korea agreed to dismantle
its program in return for some
concessions by the West like the United
States that means like an ending of the
threat of aggression providing a Loeb
uranium enrichment plant for research
and medical purposes not interfering
with financial actions and so on the
Bush administration immediately backed
off
so North Korea started building weapons
again and in fact there it's a horrible
place no doubt but it's been playing
kind of tit-for-tat diplomacy that could
continue so there are possible answers
there to the sunshine policy of South
Korea for a time was a move towards
relaxing tensions commercial cultural
other interactions might break into the
North Korean system which is hideous mow
down but it is the regime is committed
to survive its own survival not
surprisingly and there is also committed
economic development there has been some
economic development in the past years
that can be exploited as a move towards
a more peaceful relations maybe
denuclearization of that region so I
think everywhere you look in fact what
about the major nuclear powers well tell
you they are committed on
alliteration treaty - good-faith efforts
to eliminate and there's enough pressure
maybe that could happen so I think there
it's a horrible threat and danger but
it's not out of human control
it's all under human control every point
it's quite incredible know that you
wrote your first article in 1939 you've
had a lifetime of activism you've been
fighting against all the wrong things
that the United States has done but do
you see the world as being better today
as compared to let's say the end of the
second world war which we can leave out
as a as a period of major atrocities but
subsequent to that do you see any kind
of hope or improvement as time has gone
on you know there's Steven Pinker's book
the better angels of our nature and of
course you must be familiar with it he
says that over the last 5000 years or so
or since recorded human history we've
been steadily improving is that the case
if we look around it doesn't seem to be
so good what do you say about that well
let's put that biggest book aside I
think it has many peoples but now part
of it is correct since one major part is
that since 1945 the European countries
have recognized that they cannot play
their favorite game anymore
for centuries Europe was the most savage
place in the world
horrible Emily the 30 Years War in the
17th century probably killed a third of
the population of German that European
savagery then expanded over much of the
world with the consequences that normal
to describe that it was recognized and
and the last paroxysm was of course the
Second World War
and it was recognized by 1945 they can't
play
if there's a major war among European
powers world it ok that's finished no so
Europe has been at peace which is not a
small thing if you look at the past
centuries that's a huge thing another
document that's true I don't think it
ain't do it the better instance our
matrix
I think that's do with the worst devil
to our nature which created means of
destruction which will wipe us all out
and recognition of that is a major
factor and this is very significant
change I should say the scholarly
literature as a different explanation is
it's democracy skeptical about that
another thing is that since the
Enlightenment there has been among the
separate population a period of advance
of rationality moral commitment
recognition of human rights and so on
but we should remember that the period
of the Enlightenment and afterwards was
the worst period of Western imperialism
with horrible consequences all over the
world I mean the Western Hemisphere
you know populations may be in 80
million people went down hundreds of
thousands but in the northern part maybe
18 million down to maybe a million
nursing a huge floor for all kind of
reasons that was the period of in life
but for part of the world it is quite
true that there was significant moral
intellectual progress and it's extended
in in the last I think I think the
United States country I know best
obviously that's a much more civilized
country than it was 50 years ago in many
respects women's rights for example norm
change the civil-rights agree awful that
there's some accrued opposition to
aggression has increased substantially
when the u.s. invaded Vietnam those no
practiced who appears worst crimes in
the Second World War took years before
any purpose develop let's change there's
also the beginnings much too late at the
beginnings of serious concern about the
environmental catastrophe which is going
to do us in unless significant steps of
taking and finally there's growing
recognition of that don't means enough
for some I mean oh if this is progress
it's not total progress
there's also regression things go in all
directions but I think that general
tendency in the long run in stores
somewhat more humane and civilized
societies well thanks for that
it's been a long interview and I'm going
to let you go but there's a last
question you've had a very long life of
activism and academics and you've seen
things go downhill but you've never
given up what is it that keeps you going
what is it that keeps you giving hope
and keeps giving you that energy to just
go for it
lot of good things that's a tension then
there are a lot of bad things very
simple oh you're a terrific guy now it's
it was such a pleasure talking to you
take care bye good the top you
