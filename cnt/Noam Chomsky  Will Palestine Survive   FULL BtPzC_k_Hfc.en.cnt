well to say a couple of words because
I'd like to hear what you have to say at
first I'd like to say that it's a an
honor and a pleasure to be able to be
with you for over the while the courage
of the people of Gaza and struggling
against resisting a us-israeli
oppression and savagery has been an
inspiration to all over the world and I
stress us-israeli because Israel can go
just as far as the United States permits
it to and as far as the u.s. supports it
and no farther so they work in tandem
like I might say a couple of words just
about how US policy towards Israel
Palestine stands in the Obama your other
have been told a lot of expectations
might do a lot of illusions there's no
basis for them the Obama policies are
simply an extension of the traditional
policies in many ways harsher if Obama
has so far really made one speech about
Israel Palestine it was when he
introduced a George Mitchell his
negotiator and it's a good choice
Mitchell has a good record and has
achieved things and is dedicated but can
go only as far as the White House
permits him and Obama made that clear in
the speech at the State Department he
said usual nice phrases and rhetoric but
when he got to the point he said there
is the one constructive peace proposal
on the table
let's be an Arab League peace plan and
he urged the Arab states to live up to
their peace plan by proceeding to
normalize relations with Israel well
he's an intelligent person he's literate
he knows perfectly well if that's not
what the Arab League peace plan said
would it call for it in fact reiterated
a long-standing international consensus
that the US and Israel alone have
blocked for 35 years a calling for a
two-state settlement on the
international border maybe with some
adjustments and in that context it said
the arp states should even go further
and move towards normalization of
relations with israel now by focusing
solely on the normalization the
corollary and omitting the content Obama
was simply telling us that he doesn't he
intends to persist with us rejection is
immune of the overwhelming international
consensus which includes just about
everyone as it has been doing since
january nineteen seventy six when the
arab states introduced a resolution at
security council of elite main arab
states a calling for a settlement a
two-state settlement on the
international border and then
incorporating all the wording of you n 2
42 which everyone agrees to be the basic
document recognition of the rights of
every state in the region for peace and
security and recognized borders and so
on the u.s. vetoed it if he did a
similar resolution in nineteen eighty
none of that even gets mentioned in the
United States and so it continues there
have been a few breaks temporary breaks
but not much and there's no indication
of any break in this administration the
one comment that Obama made which was
considered very
critical and courageous was he called on
israel to stop expansion of settlements
in the West Bank that's nothing he was
simply repeating what George Bush said
in fact what he was doing was simply
quoting from the so-called road map of
the quartet which is supposed to be the
framework for proceeding further he
didn't bother mentioning that Israel
with us backing had immediately rejected
the roadmap rejected it by saying yell
we approve of it and then adding 14
reservations which completely eliminate
its content and he was supported them in
that Obama also made it very clear that
while he was repeating he didn't say
this but whoa he was repeating the
wording of the roadmap and george w bush
stopped expanding settlements he also
made clear to Prime Minister Netanyahu
they didn't mitt he said his
administration immediately said that
they would not do what the first
president Bush did bush number one who
gave added some very mild penalties if
Israel proceeded to expand the
settlements and Obama said we're not
going to do that this is completely
symbolic his administration said in
other words go ahead and do what you
want and aside from that all of this is
a marginal the issue isn't expanding the
settlements it's their existence that
were set up with us aid and support to
essentially partition the the West Bank
Israel takes over a nexus wherever is a
value as this takes over the Jordan
Valley so it's in prison that's a
there's a sad him going from greatly
greater Jerusalem greatly expanded
Jerusalem to would almost Jericho than
so this calendar tomorrow to maim which
was established that from 1974 in order
to break up the West Bank into two parts
there other said it's farther to the
north and they continue to be developed
and with us aid and support and
essentially canonized the region as far
as Gaza was concerned Obama's was had
been nominated at the time of in fact
his he was elected on the member force
confessin an eight on the day when that
Israel chose to violate the truce
partial truths that was established in
Israel concedes that during the period
of the truth there were no Hamas rockets
at Israel violated it under the cover of
the US election and November fourth
entered the Gaza Strip killed half a
dozen militants and then rocket fire
started and as you know Hamas offered
repeatedly to renew the ceasefire US and
Israel refused then came the attack when
the attack came Obama was asked of
course he was then had been elected
president to to comment on it he said he
couldn't comment because there's only
one president he was able to comment on
lots of other atrocities around the
world but not this and the only comment
that came from his advisors and his
administration the administration was
repeating what Obama had said on a trip
to Israel in the summer of two thousand
eight that if my daughters were under
rocket attack I'd do anything to protect
them he was referring to Israeli
children who were under rocket attack
not Palestinians were being devastated
by the US Israeli attack the attack was
carefully timed so that it ended almost
moments before Obama officially took
office when there was only one press
was him so he didn't have to say
anything about it I am the rest of what
he's said about the Middle East is quite
similar so for example on his famous
trip to Cairo which was supposed to be a
great opening to the Arab world he was
asked of course what he had to say about
President Mubarak one of the more brutal
and vicious dictators in the Arab world
and he said he said well I can't I
wouldn't agree to call him authoritarian
because I don't like to use names for
folks and he does good and he's stable
so he's really good men during the time
when the International Free Gaza
demonstrators were being beaten bloody
by the Egyptian security forces there
wasn't a phrase from the White House or
anyone else and that's where the
administration stands there should be no
illusions about it actually ahead of all
the Human Rights reports about the gas
attack which in my view world seriously
flawed I can talk about that but of all
of them the one I thought that was the
most significant was one of the MS the
International reports which reviewed the
weaponry that was used in the attack and
pointed out that it was all-american
almost all American weaponry and it
called for an arms embargo because that
weaponry in fact is being used in
violation of international law but even
in violation of US law and that is
something that should be taken up in the
United States I think was exactly the
point but it's just symbolic of the
whole relationship did he achieve
anything in making change in the world
Obama's campaign slogans mr. I
understand yep yep Obama's campaign
slogans as you know were hope and change
but he was he and his advisers were very
careful never to say what the hope was
for and what the change is going to be
and the fact that he campaigned on the
slogans hope and change it tells you
absolutely nothing I'm sorry McCain and
for a very good reason the elections in
the United States are essentially run by
the public relations industry they're
pretty much bought and any good public
relations official would look at polls
of course and the polls were saying that
about eighty percent of the country
thinks that the country is moving in the
wrong direction so of course the
campaign slogans are hope and change
both parties in fact Obama did it more
effectively he had more support from the
financial institutions who preferred him
over McCain so he was able to carry the
election but there was never any
indication of what the hope and change
were going to be except you know very
limited rhetorical moves and there's
been a little change so for example he's
been somewhat more open than Bush was
towards limited negotiations with Iran
he's expanded the war in Afghanistan and
Pakistan substantially he's following
the agreement that was forced own wishes
throat by the Iraqis much the annoyance
of the United States the status of
forces agreement which required the
United States to they ran up against
Iraqi the nationalist sentiment that
they couldn't handle an agreed least
formally to withdraw troops and Obama's
more or less living up to that time
table but with regard to Israel
Palestine it's no no change just
continuation and there was there any
indication that there would be in fact
they I actually wrote about this before
the before the primaries even just using
Obama's website it was completely clear
that he was about do anything I mean the
word Palestine has barely appears
Lebanon appears but only because he
introduced a Senate resolution he's very
proud of this insisting that nothing be
done to impede the Israeli attack on
Lebanon so that's where Lebanon appears
and it's just nothing there that
indicated any reason for having
illusions the pretty much seems true on
the domestic front he conveyed an image
of some sort of change and hope a new
energized a lot of people particularly
young people and that's good I mean if
they take that up and react to it could
make a difference actually this is
happened before John F Kennedy when he
was elected in 1960 also kind of
projected an image of youth and vigor
and change and hope and also the
wonderful things and of course nothing
much happened in fact what happens
pretty awful and the people who were
energized young people instead of giving
up in disillusionment became persisted
and that led in fact to the activism of
the 1960s which had a very significant
effect on the society and it could
happen again oh yeah one should never
allow the government to speak for you
you may know that two days ago an old
friend and a leading figure in the
activist movements in the united states
howard zinn died and his message in all
of his work which was a real inspiration
was that we should pay attention to what
he called the countless unknown people
whose small actions are provide the
roots for the major events that enter
history and if you just look at the
major events the way history's usually
taught at written and don't look at the
roots and not on
not understand what happened but you're
also disappearing people keeping them
from understanding that it's there many
small actions of these unknown people
who really create the changes so shorter
you shouldn't let the government speak
for you you should speak and change the
government yep well if you look at me
long story but if you look over the
history of us Israeli relations it was
particularly close in phila 1967 it was
in 1967 that the current intimate
relationship was established and was a
very good reason for that in 1967 Israel
performed an enormous service to the
United States it protected the US ally
the main US ally in the region Saudi
Arabia where will the oil is it
protected the radical Islam radical
Islamism which the US city
systematically supported protecting it
against secular nationalism which the US
is always opposed not just in the Middle
East Israel destroyed pretty much the
center of a secular Arab nationalism the
Nasser is Egypt at the time Egypt and
Saudi Arabia were actually a war and in
Yemen under that was tremendous service
for Saudi Arabian for the United States
and the US relations with Israel changed
radically at that point again in 19 and
as us port for Israel shot up not just
aid but also that in the general
intellectual culture the media academia
and so on Israel all of a sudden became
you know the most wonderful thing in the
world in fact if you look at the history
that's the moment when Holocaust Studies
began in the late 1940s when you can
really do something about Holocaust
victims survivors so there was not talk
about it
I'm here so nothing was done and through
the 50s and early 60s it wasn't much of
an issue but after 1967 all of a sudden
it became a huge issue there has to be a
holocaust museum in every town Holocaust
Studies in every school and so on this
is pretty cynical than I mean with the
Holocaust them there was more of an
issue in the 40s and 50s than it was in
the 70s and the 80s it had to do with
providing a justification for the u.s.
support for the Israeli occupation that
extended in 1970 1971 September the
Jordanian army was massacring actually
Palestinians in Jordan and looked for a
moment as the Syria might intervene to
protect Palestinians from the Jordanian
and security forces of the US was
bitterly opposed to that regarded as a
threat to the hashemite kingdom hence to
Saudi Arabia the US was tied up in
Indochina and couldn't do anything much
and so it asked Israel to react that
Israel mobilized its forces and Syria
backed off and that at that point US aid
to Israel quadrupled went way up and the
Nixon administration had a they had that
had something called the Nixon Doctrine
which was the US can't invade every
country in the world so we have to rely
on allies on surrogates the way they put
it we have to have cops on the beat the
cop on the beat cops on the beat in the
Middle East were Iran then under the
Shah at Turkey Israel joined in a non
arab states which are better killing
Arabs than Arabs are they would be the
cops on the beat police headquarters
would be in Washington of course and
there would be a branch office in London
which is kind of like a junior partner
in all of this and that was the basic
framework when I ran when the Shah fell
Israel's world simply became more
important by then Israel was also
performing secondary services to the
United States Congress was imposing
restrictions on us support for some of
the more murderers and brutal regimes of
South Africa Guatemala and so on so the
United States was able to use Israel as
a conduit to get around the
congressional restrictions and and of
course just and meanwhile Israel
developed to be a always was between
very rich industrial power height a vast
high-tech industry very closely
integrated with the United States
especially military industry but
integrated up and back us and high-tech
investors are very very much favored
Israel Intel for example the biggest
chip manufacturer in the world as has a
new chip factory which is going to
produce a new generation of chips that
they think over the industry standard
but they're building it in Israel it's
and it's understandable in high tech
industry you know it's a rich country
they have advanced education for sector
population and little flow up and back
from the US and Israel and it's a it's a
it's a strong military ally it's in fact
the military base of the United States
pre positions weapons there as you may
have noticed during the Gaza attack
right in the middle the gas attack the
US was shipping weapons to Israel there
were some questions but Washington
responded and probably accurately that
the weapons are not intended for the
attack on
I they're being pre-positioned for the
next us use of force in the region
there's very close intelligence contacts
the military industry contacts are so
close that Israel has actually shifted
some of its major production facilities
and material facilities for military
industry to the United States thus they
have more access to the American market
and so on so in general it's a very
advantageous relationship for the US
government and US high-tech industry
particularly military industry in
contrast the Palestinians offer nothing
to the United States they're weak there
are defenseless a very little support
and it just follows that they have no
rights that's the way International
Affairs works there's all kind of pious
rhetoric but something that works people
have rights to the extent that they
offer you something Israel offers the
United States quite a lot the
Palestinians are mostly innocence all
that they do is you know disrupt opinion
elsewhere in the Arab world and that
requires more force violence to repress
them so it follows almost automatically
that the US would support Israel in fact
the same policies hold everywhere else
in the world I mean can go through
details but there's nothing
fundamentally different about US policy
in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia
and Central America and so on but that's
not that's not true that's the way
things are portrayed but it isn't
accurate there are times when the US
would Israel does things that the US
doesn't like and his or the United
States tells them and no uncertain terms
you're going to stop and they stopped
because they have to that's you don't
argue with the Godfather it happens
regularly I'm just for example West
right in the middle of the electoral
campaign most sensitive period 2008
the Israeli Lobby in the United States
apec was trying to push through a
congressional resolution a calling for a
blockade of Iran which would be in
effect an act of war and they were
lining up we have hundreds of
congressmen senators to support them
when all of a sudden stopped and the
only reason why it stopped is because
the Bush administration told them look
we don't want to zero the drag us into a
war now so they disappeared a couple of
years before that in 2005 Israel has a
is a highly militarized economy and some
of its main exports are more high-tech
military experts and the big market of
course is China so they'd love to sell
high-tech military exports to China well
the United States doesn't warm to in
2005 they've repeatedly they've tried in
the United States just said no and at
the back down in 2005 this is the Bush
administration they wanted to Israel
wanted it was going to sell upgraded
antimissile components to China the Bush
administration told them you can't do it
Israel said we will do it anyway were
independent country the Bush
administration told him absolutely not
and furthermore they went ahead to
humiliate them purposely they forced his
rule to apologize for publicly for
planning to do this they barred entry to
high levels Israeli officials to the
United States and of course is real back
down and incidentally the lobby as usual
just ran into hiding they know better
than to confront us power now that's
happened repeatedly doesn't happen a lot
because by and large the US and Israel
have parallel concerns and interests now
the u.s. itself has no rule interest in
a pressing Palestinians in fact the US
could tolerate the international
consensus to state settlement so on but
it has no interest in it and they can
tolerate it can accept it nothing much
will change
but it has no real no real driving force
behind it so it kind of lets things go
and on on issues on which the u.s. power
interests don't aren't much concern is
really usually it's it's way but when us
power interests are concerned Israel of
course has to back down that's the
master-servant relationship if you look
at the relations of power it's of is why
and the lobby disappears because it
doesn't confront us power so how can
things change they can change because of
chain because of what we're talking
about before this question somebody
asked before about people making their
opinions clear if popular opinion in the
United States compels the US government
to shift policy little shift and that
has happened to that in fact even on
this issue it's beginning to happen a
group like this wouldn't have been here
ten years ago in fact a ten years ago
right where i am at MIT talks on the
middle east were being broken up
forcefully broken up at at police
protection I don't like tea on campus
just to talk about this issue and it was
worse elsewhere has changed
substantially and it reflects a big
change in public opinion after the Gaza
attacks for the substantial change in
itself and sooner or later that gets
organized and powerful enough it can
embellish the policy of course a lot
Palestinians can do a lot too and can is
really dissidents but most of it has to
happen here as in other cases as in the
case of the work went into China you
know the fate of Iraq everything else
that just has to change inside the
United States or inside Britain or
whatever great powers involved well I
think there's there's a strong tendency
especially in the Arab world to wildly
overestimate the influence and power of
the Jewish lobby and it's
powerful but mostly on issues where US
government doesn't care and us high-tech
industry doesn't care when there are
issues on which they do care they tell
Israel you can't do it and the lobby
disappears gave a couple of examples I
could give a lot more that's just not
the way American politics works young
impact is a significant lobby but it's
utterly dwarfed by other lobbies on the
business lobbies for example are
overwhelmingly more powerful minate back
and if they decided this isn't a good
policy okay they could put a back out of
business in five minutes but since they
basically support these policies they
don't do it so yeah the lobbies lobbies
have a significance even much smaller
lollies so for example let's keep they
are me and lobby for example is pretty
small now that they succeeded in getting
Congress almost succeeded very very
close to succeeding to getting Congress
to pass a resolution on the armenian
genocide which will severely harmed us
relations with Turkey which doesn't want
any talk about that in Turkey's the
major ally well okay the government
stepped in and sort of just made
disbanded the effort but it was very
close to succeeding and that's a tiny
lobby the great globby has had big
effects on us Turkish relations and you
know these the apex of bigger lobbying
and it's kinda like of the more or less
ethnic lobbies it's the biggest one but
again I stress it is utterly dwarfed by
the major lobbies the Chambers of
Commerce Business Roundtable they're the
ones who run the country not a small
ethnic lobbies can link nonviolent
movements like boycott BDS boycott
divestment sanctions another
Rodman's could they affect policy that
the question young well in yes in many
ways in fact the nonviolent resistance
in ilion and dylan and elsewhere in the
West Bank has is very frightening to
Israel in the United States Israel's
reacting very brutally because they're
afraid of it the United States is
reacting by suppressing it so you can't
read anything about it they're afraid
that if people know anything about it
you know want to do something so yeah
they're frightened by it and as it
expands and as more international
involvement takes place it can have a
big effect here as for the boycott BDS
movement BTS is a perfectly sensible
attack best tactic like all tactics you
have to judge it's not a principle it's
tactic you have to judge it in terms of
its consequences now it can be I mean
anybody has been involved in a con
activism knows that these are tricky
decisions to make I mean roughly
speaking tactics for the two categories
there's no good tactics tactics that
really help the victims and there's feel
good tactics the tactics that make you
feel good when you take part in them and
maybe I'll harm the victims so for
example when weathermen in the nineteen
seventy were say breaking windows and
the streets in opposition to the Vietnam
War Vietnamese didn't like it because
that was a few good fact it was harming
them was just building up support for
the war and you have to ask the same
kind of question about affect what the
Vietnamese wanted was a passive
nonviolent resistance you know people
standing quietly in protesting that's
what impressed them and you have to ask
the same kind of questions about BDS and
it's a blunt instrument it can be used
very effectively and has been
we use very harmfully there are two
consequences that you have to think
about when you carry out BDS tactics one
what's their effect on policy and second
do they help educate the public so that
there'll be more support for shifts and
policy well yeah something often I can
so for example take the example I
mentioned the amnesty international call
for an arms embargo now that's a very
powerful tactic an arms embargo would be
extremely significant it hits right at
the core of the major issues that's the
basis for Israeli power and policy
decisions and furthermore it sixth toe
tily defensible internally in the United
States it's in accord with US law the US
law bars the shipment of arms except
frooty frooty for defensive purposes or
for internal security and israeli arms
can't possibly be described in that
terms so it's in violent the US
government is in violation of US law and
a popular movement to try to end that
violation is a way of educating people
to understand what the u.s. role is the
decisive u.s. role is and can put
pressure through Congress and just
popular action to changing policy so
that makes sense boycotting say the
caterpillar corporation that makes
perfect sense because they are kind of
an instrument of destruction in the
occupied territories you know that
better 92 social boycotting that makes
perfect sense first of all can influence
policy and secondly it helps educating
Americans to the fact that we're the
ones who have primary responsibility for
this and many other actions like that
are make great sense on the other hand
there are actions that are pretty
dubious and their consequences
so suppose you say boycott an israeli
dance group royal raises immediately the
question why are you boycotting an
american dance group I minato is the
u.s. responsible for the crimes and the
dish was carrying out but as a long list
of others that are much worse services
immediately a charge of hypocrisy which
tends to undermine it and it also is
Miss educating not educating its focus
it's turning attention away from the
u.s. role of preserving American
innocence we serve our nice guys these
other people out there doing bad things
what can we do about it that's the
propaganda image that government and the
media like to portray you know we're
honest brokers crazy people out there
what can we do so you it's miss
educating and it has a tinge of
hypocrisy which tends to undermine it
and actually you know put the guns in
the hands of the hardliners so you just
have to think through the tactics and
ask what are their effects some of their
examples of both kinds given if we had
time but as whatever any kind of
tactical choice so there are a lot of
questions to ask about the consequence
of employment of the tactics so sure it
can be a very significant step and it
has been already it israel in the united
states are worried about it when it's
carried out properly and that's what it
it should be done yeah well yeah that's
maybe our kind of pushing an open door
i've been writing about that for 60
years sure i think a much better
solution for it what's now a zero
palestine is not really one state but
bi-national state i'm there are after
all to this pretty distinct groups they
want maintain their identity and have
every right to a better bi-national
state back in the 1940s i advocated that
and i still new to have written a lot
about it
but here we have to make a distinction
between let's say proposing and
advocating for example we can propose
that everybody should live in peace yeah
wonderful everybody should live in peace
I proposed if you want to advocate that
everyone should live in peace you have
to show a path from here to there okay
otherwise it's just empty talk and in
fact it undermines the empty talk
undermines efforts to get there by
saying okay let's just talk about this
wonderful solution if I want to propose
something what I would propose as a no
state solution which for the whole
region is much better than a one-state
solution I mean you have to go back to
say the Ottoman Empire I mean nobody
wants to restore the Ottoman Empire now
but if you sort of put aside its
oppression and cruelty and so on they
had more or less the right idea it lets
left people wrong partly because we're
so corrupt so you could go from Cairo to
Baghdad a stunt without crossing any
borders the Greek portion of a city
grand Greek Affairs Armenian portion ran
Armenian Affairs imposing state borders
has been is an act of violence that's
what the state system in Europe was
imposed by violence made Europe the most
savage place in the world for centuries
in the united states that wiped out the
indigenous population in concord and
xcode as the imperial powers imposed
state systems elsewhere in the world
including middle east it just created
the basis for the violence and tagging
ism hatred brutality it's the
consequence of imposing state systems so
surely they should be eroded you can
propose that but what about advocacy so
let's go back to a one state or by
national state solution if you want to
advocate it you have to say how we get
there now I know the motive corner
about how you get there and that's to
start with the two vivid stages the
first of them a two-state settlement
which is by no means impossible and then
if that succeeds as it should in
reducing the cycle of violence of the
level of repression and so on and the
relationships begin to develop among the
people as would happen I mean anyone who
knows no sis Jordan former Palestine
knows that drawing a line down it
anywhere doesn't make any sense to me
just from no point of view so those
borders would tend to erode the cultural
commercial other relations and you could
move on to closer integration maybe a
single state may be no state but those
are the only steps I've ever heard of
I've never seen any other form of
advocacy now people propose it and say
oh it's nice but it's like saying you
know why not live in peace and a
two-state settlements by no means out of
question or all it requires is that the
United States join the world and if the
United States does Israel will and we've
seen this happen it has to I mean Israel
has no choice but to follow us orders
seen that over and over in the case of
the two-state how come remember it came
quite close there's one time in the past
35 years in which a u.s. president has
been willing to tolerate support but
tolerate the international consensus
that was in january two thousand one
clinton's last month in office he
recognized in december that peak his
proposals the us-israeli proposals at
Camp David couldn't be accepted by
adding Palestinian and December he
proposed recalled his parameters they
were kind of the
a bit more forthcoming he then made a
speech in which he said both sides
israel-palestine had accepted his
parameters both sides had reservations
and and they met in Taba Egypt in the
month of January to try to iron out
their reservations the highest level
negotiators on both sides and they came
pretty close to a settlement and we know
a lot about the details because there
were international observers and this
rich Israeli literature on it and so on
much with Hubert but we know the details
they came very close to a settlement and
in fact they at their final press
conference both sides they said that if
they had a little bit longer they could
have reached the final settlement on to
state settlement with pretty much on the
international border with some equitable
land swaps equitable not just deserts on
well that was close it was called Israel
called it off the Prime Minister where I
called it off so it never continued
they've been changes since then but not
dramatic enough to open the situation as
far as the Palestinians are concerned I
should I should say a lot of a
commentary invite good people like Marin
benveniste and others i think is
extremely misleading i'm at what they
argue is that two-state solution is go
on Israel's destroyed it no hope for it
anymore so therefore we should have an
archbishop tutu said this that we should
have Israel should take over actually
sorry to say but I think said it recent
Israel should take over the whole region
and then will be a civil rights struggle
and a part in on anti-apartheid struggle
like South Africa that's just not going
to happen the United States and Israel
I'm never going to allow that to happen
and all those suggestions are only
in a very crucial fact there aren't two
choices there are three choices one
choice is a two-state settlement
international consensus another solution
is this one is really over everything
and we have a civil rights struggle the
third solution is what actually
happening was actually happening on the
ground so what they go dormant called
convergence Israel takes over what it
wants determines keeps Gaza just as a
prison and people can run it breaks up
Gaza from separates guys are from the
West Bank it's a crucial us Israeli
policy totally illegal but it's exactly
what they've been doing for years
sometimes called the Gaza Egypt the
proposal Gasol somehow you know Egypt's
problem is Egypt is not going to accept
as you know from it very well but just
get rid of Gaza and on the West Bank
Israel should take over everything
that's valuable now the so-called
separation wall is in fact an annexation
wall it a nexus to Israel valuable land
and crucial resources it takes over the
main aquifer the main source of water
and in the region Israel take over the
Jordan Valley in prison the rest drive
these sands through which break it up
into unviable sectors and no
Palestinians the Palestinians can be
often a hill somewhere in fact the
Israeli tourist agency you'll probably
like it it means when you ride down
there when the American visitors go down
the super highways from Tel Aviv to my
lab to me and they can look up in the
hills and see a kind of biblical
landscape no oh man leading a goat or
something like that it's kind of good
for tourism but and then they can just
kind of disappear in
amala you keep an economy going so that
the you know elite can go to the theater
that's sort of thing if that's the way
colossal systems work this is no use for
the fun of the populations of course
miserable but you need swig colonies are
generally there's always that may lead
to who for a benefit and pretty nicely
often better in their Western
counterparts most of the population rots
Israel takes no responsibility for the
Palestinians they don't deal with the
so-called demographic problem you know
too many non-jews in Jewish state was
there won't be any in fact his roommate
and go farther it's been already
proposed that's on the agenda and take
the areas of heavy AB population
concentration in Israel particularly
what they are up in the north and just
transform over to a you know barely
surviving Palestinian entity of some
kind of course the people they are
overwhelmingly opposed to it but you
know who cares about them this is now
mainstream policy it's even recommended
in the New York Times and so on is a
very forthright forthcoming step so
that's the policy that's these are the
policies that are actually being
implemented they don't lead to a civil
rights struggle they don't set up an
anti-apartheid struggle they give Israel
in the United States what they want and
they destroy the possibilities of
Palestinian existence it's what the
blade Israeli sociologist an old friend
bar timberland called for it aside you
wipe out the national existence it's
happened before these are traditional
colonial practices actually take a look
at the United States under millions of
people live in here before the colonists
came where are they some of our
reservation somewhere I'm barely
surviving that's the way colonialism
works and in fact settler colonialism is
by far the most vicious kind the kind of
took place in the United States or
Australia and
not taking place in Israel because that
has to eliminate the basically
Eliminator exterminate the indigenous
population United States they're just
exterminated mostly but that's the worst
kind of colonialism for then it's the
kind that's being implemented so these
commentaries like Archbishop Tutu and
merriment dynasty and many others the
same here in the United States to move
Stephen Walton others well let's go up
on the two-state settlement and have an
anti-apartheid struggle that's simply
not going to happen now what's going to
happen is exactly what the US and Israel
are now doing before your
