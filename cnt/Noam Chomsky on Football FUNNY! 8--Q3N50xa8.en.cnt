talking about and that's only a small
part of the system things have to be
done for the rest of the population -
they have to be marginalized but they're
not gonna be marginalized by telling
them lies about foreign policy because
because just as you say they don't
believe most of what they read there's
just a kind of a general populace
skepticism along with this sense that
the government is run by a few big
interests looking out for themselves is
the sense that the media are probably
lying to us so for most of the
population the media system is I think a
different one it's not just the case
that it tries to entertain them it tries
to entertain them through means which
will intensify attitudes that support
the interest of a leads so you want for
example let me give some cases take the
emphasis on professional sports not the
it sounds harmless but it really isn't
professional sports are a way of
building up Jinga list fanaticism you're
supposed to cheer for your own team I
just to mention something from personal
experience I remember very well myself
when I was I guess a high school student
sudden revelation you know when I asked
myself why am i cheering for my high
school football team I don't know
anybody on it if I met anybody on it I'd
probably hate each other you know why do
I care whether they win or some guy a
couple blocks away wins well you know
and then you can say the same thing
about you know the baseball team or
whatever else it is this idea of
cheering for your home team which you
mentioned before that's a way of
building into people irrational
submissiveness to power you know and
it's a very dangerous thing and I think
it's one of the reasons is such a big
it's it gets such a huge play
now there are other media to whom the
Spacek social war was quite different
its diversion there's the the real mass
media the kinds that are aimed at you
know the guys who Joe Sixpack that time
the purpose of those media is just to
dull people brains
this is an oversimplification but for
the 80% or whatever they are the main
thing for them is to divert them to get
them to watch national football and to
worry about you know and the thing that
you pick up on the supermarket stands
and so on or you know look at astrology
or get involved in fundamentalist or
something just get them away you know
get them away from things that matter
and for that it's important to reduce
their capacity to sink the sports
section is handled in another special
department the sports reporter must be a
specialist in his knowledge of sports
he gets his story right at the sporting
event and often sends it into his paper
play-by-play takes a sports
that's another crucial example of the
indoctrination system in my view for one
thing because it you know it offers
people something to pay attention to
that have no importance that keeps them
from worrying about it can keep them
from worrying about things that matter
to their lives that they might have some
idea about doing something of them and
in fact it's striking to see the
intelligence that's that's used by
ordinary people in sports and you listen
to radio stations where people call in
they have the most exotic information
understanding and the press undoubtedly
does a lot with this I remember in high
school whether it is pretty old
I suddenly asked myself at one point why
do I care if my high school team wins
the football game
I don't know anybody on the team you
know have nothing to do with me I mean
why am i cheering for my team it doesn't
mean it make any sense no and but the
point is it does make sense it's a way
of building up irrational attitudes of
submission to Authority and you know
group cohesion behind the you know
leadership elements in fact it's
training and irrational jingoism that's
also a feature of competitive sports I
think if you look closely at these
things I think they have typically they
do have functions and that's why energy
is devoted to supporting them creating a
basis for them and advertisers are
willing to pay for them
