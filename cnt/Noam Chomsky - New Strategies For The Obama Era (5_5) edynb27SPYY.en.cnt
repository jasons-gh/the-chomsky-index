of course insists that the US must not
deal with Hamas they committed a crime I
stew they want a democratic election and
that's not prepared in fact as soon as
is an only free election in the Arab
world really palestine january 2006 they
won the election they weren't supposed
to so instantly the US issue initiated
by a massive house tenants for voting
language not the first time this when
I'm right alongside the rhetoric about
our love for democracy that wishes
democracy prep agenda so on and so forth
the US and Israel of course initiate a
program to punish the Palestinians a
serious program for example us blocked
the European Union effort to send to
medical supplies and pencils and things
of the to Gaza because maybe they be
used by the monster notes like the
Israeli prohibitions today they don't
allow macaroni and toilet paper it
because bombs with so that even
solicited a brief comment from Hillary
Clinton but but it continued but
convinced with you so we can't deal with
them and of course as always there's
pretext the pretext is the COS doesn't
accept three conditions that we impose
one that recognize Israel to they have
to renounce violence and three they have
to accept previous agreements
particularly the name is roadmap I the
fact that he can say that anybody can
say that without the press corps
collapsing and ridicule is pretty
impressive I'm does the US except those
three conditions Aziz our exhibit at the
US and Israel renounce violence did they
recognize Palestine did they live live
up the past agreements like say the
roadmap in fact Israel immediately
announced when the roadmap
up here that wasn't one accepted the way
they did this by saying I would accept
that it's wonderful we had 14
reservations which completely
eviscerated actually one of the merits
of jimmy carter's book is that for the
first time he broke the silence on that
and it's the reviewer ever mentioned it
but that was the one novel contribution
within the mainstream look he actually
had an appendix in which he gave 14
reservations which the u.s. approved
though which ends at agreements and of
course varies as three settlements
another one so that's how we're going to
solve the israel-palestine problem
mainly shifted to put it to the side
continue our blocking of a political
settlement good morning the attacks had
mentioned in this connection over one of
the last thing that the political
settlement is accepted by the entire
world europe that online countries hamas
accessory for years as well carranza
they accept me just the US and Israel
locking again constable obama doesn't
carry the same immediate can't talk
about it maybe don't know
more work done well what about Iran
Terry is also a veteran he said we can't
take force the table of course we want
to negotiate friendly and so on but one
of the options is first it seems to
bother nobody that the threat of force
is explicitly in violation of the
foundations of international law
violation of UN Charter which bars the
threat or use of force international
affairs but we're above Obama is
supposed to have reached out his hand in
friendship Aaron couple days covered is
never a New Year's message what did he
say actually he said well happy to talk
to you but you have to meet some
responsibilities you have to give up
arms and violence again comment anybody
here that and not collapsing pretty too
I mean Iran has to give up arms violence
whose military budget equals that of the
rest of the world combined it's not over
the who carries out aggression rate of
the right on the boards of the rat in
fact when was around West guilty you
said well it doesn't matter if it passes
more work for us to do Joe Biden the
vice
amplified this he said that will be
willing to deal with Iran if it accepts
our conditions in advance of
negotiations they may not be picture
anniversary he said it enough stop its
illicit nuclear programs why and of
course in terror the weather it's
illicit nuclear programs I mean there
was a certainly productive attrition is
not a glistening that's the height of
India and something any sign of a
non-proliferation treaty so it must be
if they have a weapons program well
there was a national intelligence
estimate in november two thousand seven
which included after long deliberation
that they don't have the weapons program
and haven't had for years Obama
responded to that he said yes that was
what intelligence decided we reject he
also said you know they need 11 his
administration said we don't have any of
evidence that we don't like it so
rejected so therefore whatever they're
doing is delish as far as far as
terrorists concerned public regime about
there's plenty of terms of what the US
is pointing to is their efforts to
alleged efforts probably true to assist
Hezbollah and Hamas to defend themselves
against the US Israeli attack that's
terror in our lexicon nobody's allowed
the defendants
against efforts or the first our clients
so that's terror in exactly the what is
the world think about this what would
you read is that constantly it is that
the international community has demanded
that I rant and stuff uranium enrichment
who exactly is the international
community well what about the majority
of states in the world which are an
online movie where they forcefully
insistently support Iran's right to
enrich uranium as a signer of the
non-proliferation treaty so they're not
part of the international community what
about the American population a large
majority of them agree with an online
but probably 75% secured rent has this
right so the American populations are
part of the international community in
fact what the international community is
misery determines also always use is
Washington and whoever happens agree
with that moment episode young they
command the end stop any kind of uranium
enrichment because we say though it our
intelligence investments is the opposite
that they're doing it for weapons
production and the American pinion
this is kind of important for activists
quite interesting the other respects I'm
a large majority of Americans like
seventy five eighty percent the United
States are live up to the
non-proliferation treaty it means
eliminate its nuclear weapons and
corresponding majority roughly eighty
seventy five eighty percent advocate any
nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle
East that means Iran Israel any US vs
people it there okay whatever problem
there may be could be mitigated and
probably overcome by lose in that
direction but that's not electoral
options Tony the public would one say
well install stop all of this without
elaborating gives plenty of work for
activists who want to come in case these
issues like to say about domestic
financial issues like the bills talk
about that
