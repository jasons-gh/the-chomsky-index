good evening ladies and gentlemen please
will come in cinema metropol in all
modes it's our great pleasure to host
one of the most distinguished
intellectuals in the world professor
Noam Chomsky is
there are few people in the world were
as famous and as influential as
professor Chomsky who still teaches at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
tonight will host a debate with him and
I had to say that professor Chomsky is
not the first important figure in the
world of intellect in all modes we had
hope we have hosted here couple of other
very important figures like Robert Rosen
stoned film historic er Benjamin barber
Boudica scientist policeman philosopher
and others the strategy for tonight was
to open up the questions for broader
public and we have got many of them
through the internet and our Co speakers
today Martin Jacob raha and did jana
check were about to select some of the
most important in their views let me
tell you a few words about our
participants today I think I don't need
to introduce professor Chomsky everybody
in this whole read at least something
about professor Chomsky probably most of
you read some of his texts on
linguistics or his political
commentaries so please will come again
in a la mode it's really great honour
for us second participant is Martin
Cabrera who is philosopher teaching here
at pulaski university is also civic
activists and a member of a Green Party
second is V dianna check who is
filmmaker dramaturg East and his working
as associate professor at film and TV
school of academia of Performing Arts in
Prague my name is CG Lakhan I currently
serve as a Dean of Faculty of Arts now
let me pass a word to first speaker to
Martin's abraha
and margin can I ask you to give a first
question thank you and good evening
everybody I would like to begin with a
little doubt we surely will enjoy this
evening we will enjoy this discussion
but what is the effect in the end what
can philosophers or intellectuals do
against what is called the government of
1% by one person and for one person how
can philosophers and intellectuals
influence politics so in such a way that
it is more humanistic more democratic
especially in this situation when
politics is around by very powerful tiny
elite what can we do well I think first
of all we can do exactly the same thing
that carpenters and the chemists and
anyone else can do namely educate
ourselves others organize take part and
or initiate activist activism various
sorts all of that is open to us people
who are called intellectuals are a very
curious class if you think about them so
take where i teach MIT if there's a
Nobel laureate in physics who's working
70 hours a week in his laboratory on
problems of advanced physics that we
don't call them an intellectual if the
janitor who cleans his room happens to
have a great deal of knowledge about
world
errors and good deal of insight into
human life and understanding that maybe
more so than the people who write books
we don't call him an intellectual the
intellectuals are people who have a
certain degree of privileged enough to
be able to reach audiences and who
discuss issues of general public
interest so yes they have given the
privilege and the opportunities they of
course have greater responsibilities
privilege confers responsibilities so
they can do what the janitor can do or
what the carpenter can do or what the
chemist can do and have other
opportunities to if they use the phone
to use them I don't think there's any
shortage of opportunity I think they're
shortages of will in fact if you look at
the history of intellectuals it's not a
pretty one overwhelmingly intellectuals
have labored in the service of power to
the term intellectual entered modern
Western usage with the Dreyfus arts and
nowadays we respect and honor the
Dreyfus arts the defenders of Dreyfus
critics of the French state it certainly
wasn't true at the time they were
bitterly condemned the leading most
prominent intellectuals had denounced
them rated them for daring to criticize
state power and the holy army and what
right did these writers painters and so
on have to talk about things they knew
nothing about the respected
intellectuals the Immortals of the
academie francaise bitter were bitterly
hostile to the Dreyfus arts in fact
Emile Zola the leading one had to flee
French but that's typically the pattern
it
and it goes back in history as far as
you like I mean back to the earliest
recorded history there were people who
were approximately what we would call
intellectuals today so in classical
Greece one of them was forced to drink
the hemlock because he was corrupting
the youth of Ash and athens by asking
embarrassing questions and challenging
doctrine or dogma around the same time
in the biblical record there were that
people who were basically intellectuals
they're called prophets but that's just
a bad translation of a pretty obscure
Hebrew word there were people who
criticized the crimes of the king called
for mercy and compassion for the poor
and deprived gave presented geopolitical
analysis warned of the threats that the
evil Kings were bringing to the people
so that's intellectuals that what
happened to them they were imprisoned
they were driven into the desert they
were condemned there later centuries
later they were honored not at the time
there were people intellectuals were
honor the flatterers of the court
centuries later they were called false
prophets that's pretty much the pattern
so for example in the West check in
check dissidents were honor not at home
not by the ruling authorities and
conversely intellectuals in the American
domains were but not only not honor they
were murdered straight out so for
example in a week after the fall of the
Berlin Wall the in the country that was
the leading recipient of US military aid
aside from Israel in Egypt that separate
category and had the worst human rights
record that's a standard correlation El
Salvador the high command which is in
close contact with the American Embassy
ordered a battalion of troops to invade
the University and murder six leading
Latin American intellectuals because we
priests blow the brains and kill any
witnesses who happened to be around so
they also killed their housekeeper and
daughter I doubt if any of you can know
their names even but if anything like
that it happened in Czechoslovakia say
probably had a nuclear war certainly of
bull herring headlines about it and
you'd know their names but that's the
difference your own crimes you ignore
the crimes of your enemies you love and
you admire and you praise the presence
to the skies that's the pattern right
through history intellectuals don't have
to do that as the fringe of dissidents
illustrates but that's typically what
they do but apart from that they have
what they can do is what anyone else can
do and more given the relative privilege
they have thank you I picked several
questions more or less associated with
education and Walt of what's a
university as a general environment for
keeping certain knowledge and keeping
valuable things from the history till
today the memory MOOC role of memory was
always crucial in all intellectual
activities and in the knowledge and
memory the value of memory was always
quite high it was difficult to
the books were expensive etc I mean also
physical memory we live in the age where
the memory gets widely accessible where
basically everything can be stored and
put into memory somehow and it has also
large impact for university education
starting with I don't know internet copy
paste system to let's say white
exposition of text which people can be
exposed with the text the question is
what is your point how how what should
we keep and replicate and what should we
somehow refuse and forget within this
context where the memory is so widely
accessible well first of all it's not
going to get what you say is correct
that mainly access to information is
much easier than it used to be I use the
internet like everyone else and it's
easier to type something into my
computer and get an answer back in 30
seconds then it is to go across the
street to the library and look it up but
the change from libraries to the
Internet is much less of a change than
the change from no libraries to
libraries that was a huge change so the
internet is a slight addition and a not
insignificant one as far as information
is concerned we've always been swamped
by overwhelming amounts of information I
mean my own personal education was
mostly in the when I had a stack in the
Harvard library and this huge resource
was right there he walk around the
library find all kinds of things he
never heard of
huge mess of information far beyond
anything that anyone could assimilate
wouldn't dream of it and the internet
expands that but not not in a
fundamentally different way so I think
the question is always arisen at least
since the invention of the printing
press which made information at least in
principle available to large numbers of
people it's always the same question you
keep what's valuable and you put aside
temporarily what you think may not be
valuable and it's often mistaken and you
go back and you find you made the wrong
decisions but I don't know any way out
of that that's what's done in the
sciences that's a lot of my own work for
example has been involved and happened
to be interested in seventeenth and
eighteenth century philosophy and
science and going back and found lots of
things that were understood very well
understood are now being rediscovered if
they had not been forgotten we'd be
better off if they were understood today
we'd be better off and you never know
you can't know you can just do your best
try but still methods where's always
been swamped by information we always
have to make these difficult decisions
Thank You Martin okay let's let's
develop this topic new information or
communication technologies are great
opportunity but they are very dangerous
at the same time because they sort of
multiply I and ears that our governments
have and they can spy on us more than
ever is it ok oh is it it's ok so
own as I say that there is also a very
dangerous aspect to do these new
technologies my question is how can we
avoid this dis danger or how can we we
fight against this because this kind of
control is almost invisible isn't it so
what can what can be done and done
against this danger I presume you're
referring specifically to Edward
Snowden's revelations about the National
Security Agency efforts I mean the fact
that government spying on their on their
enemies is not new and nor is it knew
that the domestic population is one of
the main enemies of just about every
government and every power system so
sure they're always going to try to spy
and control their domestic enemy that
goes back as far as history does people
who've been involved in activism always
been conscious of this I mean I was very
much involved in resistance against the
Vietnam War but we never gives the
telephone recent it's tapped we never
talked about things sensitive things in
open meetings probably infiltrators sure
that goes on a lot of time but the scale
of Obama's that President Obama's
efforts is just is it was really a shock
there's never been anything remotely
like that I mean if any of you anyone
who is connected in any way to the
electronic culture is being spied on or
can be if you have a cell phone the
National Security Agency has in they may
not bother but in principle they have
access to where you are who you're
talking to what you say it's even true
if your cell phones off if you have a
computer the same thing is true the
Snowden revelations
shins demonstrate that if computers any
electronic equipment that's made in the
United States computers routers Network
materials that go to the National
Security Agency so they can install the
equipment into them which provides
access to every keystroke that you make
everything you're doing that presumably
China does the same thing to the extent
that they can that's doubtless they
can't do it on the scale of the United
States which is enormous capacity this
is a system of surveillance and control
which is beyond anything that anyone has
ever cramped of either anything that was
actually realized like say the East
German Stasi or anything that was dreamt
up by dystopian novelists like George
Orwell and others it's pretty phenomenal
how do you defend yourself against it by
eliminating have to eliminate it if it's
going on there's no way to defend
yourself against it and that's not an
impossibility of the in the US Congress
they came very close to a vote to ban to
end all funding for the National
Security Agency they lost the vote it's
expanded but that's not impossible it
depends on the amount of popular
opposition that's true in Europe that's
driven the United States that's true in
countries with less influence in the
world but it's not going to happen by
itself like anything else if you just
decided to say I don't like it nothing's
going to stop but we have plenty of
opportunities for overcoming this real
crimes major crime actually it is
technically
right in the United States it's an
explicit violation of the Constitution
explicit you take a look at the use your
internet get back to the first question
and take a look at the Fourth Amendment
to the Constitution it's one of the
initial parts of the Constitution it's
bands what's called unreasonable search
and seizure guarantees the privacy of
persons their homes their papers and
their effects anything they own that the
reason that that was put in was because
this is right after the American
Revolution and one of the things that
sparked the revolution was the
insistence of the British imperial
masters that they had a right to
interfere with individual privacy that
led to confrontations and armed
confrontations in fact health set the
revolution off and this principle was
instantly introduced into the
constipated Constitution at that time
the tyrant were the British rulers today
the tyrant is President Obama and the
American government so the government
lawyers of course will try to argue that
it's not illegal that's the job of
lawyers whatever whatever crime is being
committed but there is no way to make
these surveillance activities consistent
with the clear and explicit wording the
Constitution so it's technically
criminal the whole government should be
if laws really applied they'd all be
brought to justice for this of course
laws don't apply to the powerful some
others too but they should and the
public can make it happen but only by
direct activism no other way
let me let me follow up this question
because it's great what you say about
the rule of law in the United States but
do you think can the world power today
allowed itself Alex's of banning the
Espionage intelligence following the
citizens of its own country and in
foreign countries because if the USA
stop this I'm quite sure that other
powers in the world will not do that so
isn't that isn't it a security risk for
the u.s. to stop this not that I agree
with these practices but on realistic
tone Russia China and other countries
will never do that the notion security
is used as if we understand it here's a
contribution that philosophers could
make there's a standard line in a belief
in international relations theory in
public commentary and so on that the
main goal of governments is to achieve
security but tooth questions are never
asked security for whom and security
against whom okay that's worth thinking
about those things one thing you can if
you look at the record it shows quite
clearly that governments any system of
power whether it's a government or
corporation or whatever it may be is
interested in security for itself your
renter third student security for state
power and they're interested in security
against their enemies but a primary
enemy is always the domestic population
that's shown over and over so I don't
know just take take one recent event the
United States recently joined in a
request to the International Criminal
Court to try Syrian leaders
for the crimes of their committee but
there was a proviso they cannot inquire
into crimes of Israel and they cannot
inquire into crimes of the United States
actually the second condition is
redundant because there's legislation in
the United States which grants to the
president the right to use force to
rescue that's the term any American
who's brought to the Hague for trial
sometimes called the Netherlands
invasion Act the US government is self
immunized against international law this
is one of many examples well that's an
illustration of an interesting topic
time to go into it but an interesting
one that's an illustration of how one of
many of how the states are interested in
their own security and what about the
enemies like the domestic population
well yeah they don't not concerned with
air security fact if you want to
investigate how stated is quite an
interesting record but if you look at
the actual record of state policy it
constantly subjects the general
population to extreme dangers in the
interest of protecting state security
the whole history of nuclear weapons
illustrates this quite dramatically take
an even more of this example right now
there's a major threat to the security
of populations environmental catastrophe
huge threat how are powerful states
reacting by increasing the threat give
you the details if you like you're
probably familiar with them security of
their own population is a very marginal
concern for States security for
themselves is a concern security for
concentrations of private power is a
concern
plenty of illustrations of that right
now for example there's two huge trade
agreements being negotiated a
trans-pacific and transatlantic enormous
efforts and international economic
arrangements notice that these are being
conducted in secret the domestic
population which is an enemy is not
allowed to know about it it's not
completely in secret it's not secret
from the hundreds of corporate lobbyists
and lawyers who are actually writing the
legislative ease these agreements they
know about it but it's and if you look
at the agreements they have almost
nothing to do with trade they certainly
have nothing at all to do with free
trade they have to do with investor
rights that's an example of the one of
many of the ways in which states
preserve the security of the one percent
you were talking about concentrations of
private economic power it's not a big
surprise because it's those
concentrations that mostly make the laws
and determine policy so naturally
they're concerned with their own
security but not security of populations
now let's go back to the question of
whether suppose that in the United
States we were capable of preventing the
National Security Agency from following
you around with your because your cell
phone SE and the storing the information
about who you talk to where you are and
so on how would your security be harmed
if that was stopped I mean it doesn't
have a new with the Russians and Chinese
of course we don't want them to do it
either but they're probably incapable of
it we don't want anyone to do it we
don't want the Czech government to do it
but no person security is harmed if the
United States you know the dinosaur in
the room stops doing its
there just isn't an issue there there's
another question should government's
conduct intelligence about other states
well that's a separate question so
should Russia for should Iran let's say
try to figure out what the United States
and Israel are trying to do yeah they
have every reason to do that after all
the United States and Israel are but
violating international law every day by
by stating that all options are open
with regard to Iran that is a meaning
that means that their daily threatening
Iran with war and in fact even nuclear
war that's what all options or pokin
means it take a look at the United
Nations Charter which is the foundation
of modern international law article 2
bands the threat or use of force and
international affairs so they are
violating it daily and therefore Iran
certainly has a right to try to figure
out what they're doing and you can think
of other cases where states that are
under a taxi or threat of attack have a
right to carry out intelligence efforts
is one striking case that this is it's
quite real in fact right now as you may
know or should know for 50 years the
United States has been attacking Cuba
large-scale terrorist war not small
large-scale terrorist war economic
embargo economic strangulation just a
couple of days ago the US Justice
Department slammed a French bank with a
huge fine maybe ten billion dollars
because they claim that the French bank
is violating US sanctions against Cuba
it's one of the charges what's the just
education for those sanctions none just
part of an effort to undermine and
destroy Cuba the Cubans have this also
involves terror attacks direct terror
attacks couple years ago the Cuban Cuban
intelligence infiltrated Florida these
come from Florida the terror attacks
they infiltrated the Florida exile
community to try to determine when
terror what kind of terror attacks were
being planned and they got a lot of
information they managed to infiltrate
it they invited the Cuban government
invited the FBI US national political
police de Vanna to present them with the
information about terror attacks being
planned against Cuba on u.s. territory
which is of course a crime in the United
States how did the u.s. government react
by arresting the people who infiltrated
and presented them with the information
some of them are in jail maybe for life
long jail sentences you probably don't
know about this because the Western
propaganda system carefully protects
people from knowing about your own
crimes you got to know about the crimes
of enemies but your own best not to know
about it's part of the protection of
state power from the domestic population
this isn't not making this enough this
is not a hypothetical case this is an
actual war so sure there are k and i
think it was quite legitimate for the
cuban government to try to detect and
discover terrorist activities on US soil
and to present the information to the
american government I think that's quite
legitimate so there are cases I thinking
sure you think of others where
intelligence activities could be
legitimate but activities like a
violation of the US Constitution and
it's generalizing it globally say to
determining what you are doing every
time you walk across the street with
yourself I don't think that's a jitter
and doesn't and if it was stopped nobody
would be harmed thank you maybe I will
try to fool with the question which also
is associated with technology and
warmness of all these things you are a
possibility of oneness of all these
things you are talking about the
conception of literacy has something
which gives one to connect with society
to read and write to see like below
below the lights also to interpret was
for a long time connected mainly with
writing and reading technology brings
complexity which needs much higher kind
of passau complexity on in terms of in
terms of literacy to be able to be
competent to understand all the layers
which which technology like brings and
to be aware of all the options for
example also these kind of examples that
the mobile phone is not only the mobile
phone but it's part of some network
which have many many other functions do
you see do you see some special role of
Education in getting this kind of new
literacy for for this kind of world
because in education there is a high
value of let's say critical thought that
derives from critical sort of past ages
but maybe there is something new coming
well first of all I think we will be
clear clear about the fact most of you
judging by your ages you know a lot more
about this that I do but my impression
is that the new technology is bringing
about illiteracy not literacy I can
see it directly with I'm gonna get a ton
of email constant flow of email I
noticed a couple of years ago that this
change in the character of the email a
lot of it is very short some of it is so
short it actually fits in the subject
line and somebody pointed out to me it's
probably Twitter things these are what
this illustrates is something much more
general that's going on among especially
younger people the younger means a lot
of people for my pet food that said it's
there's a tendency towards abbreviation
like my grandchildren when they write a
letter it's it's texting you know just
get a couple of symbols on the I noticed
my own students they don't read as much
as they used to I mean I used two years
ago if I made say literary references in
class students usually know what it is
now much less actually one of the Guru's
of the new technology I've forgotten his
name said recently that with
contemporary advances we don't need
things like war and peace or improved
any longer we can do it very briefly you
know this is something that I think is
it's already happening it's even being
studied there are some studies of
literacy among college students over a
longer period and it is reducing there's
much less reading of independent reading
of say literature much more focus on
things you can do very quickly and
briefly and so on there's even some
studies preliminary studies by
neuroscience cognitive neuroscientists
which may indicate that there are
neurological changes taking place as an
effect
the reduction of the rapid stimulation
and the kind of stimulus hunger that
comes with it and the restriction on
attention spans that come from the
technology I think it's a double-edged
sword in other words part it does the
new technology does offer the
possibility of achieving greater a
thought and understanding but it also
can reduce it I don't know about you but
if I read something on say kindle that's
very different from reading of the book
you read it in the book you think about
it you go back to the earlier page you
know pay attention to it if you're
reading it on kindle you're just trying
to get it it goes through your head so
fast you don't remember what was in
there you know I think that's a kind of
a dangerous phenomenon as far as what
education can do I think it should try
to cultivate the values of thought and
reflection doesn't matter how fast you
read this is no advantage to reading
fast you have to read thoughtfully and
carefully and that's the way students
should be induced to look at the
intellectual artistic other treasures of
the world but that's a bit but I think
they may have to combat the new
technology
Martin your turn let's go to the big
issue and that is anarchism you you call
yourself an anarchist or
anarcho-syndicalist to be precise and so
my question or actually I would like to
post more questions on this topic but
the first question is very simple but I
guess the answer should be very complex
how would an arc is society would would
look like houghton are his society would
look like sorry and second question how
to communicate anarchist ideas because
my experience is and I'm not an artist
myself but kind of sympathizer my
experience is that people when you say
the word on our key people imagine a
lack of order people imagine lack of
security something like the Hobbesian
state of nature the war of all against
all and so on and I think that the
general idea of anarchism in in the
general public is it's very much
influenced by this misconception so how
to communicate anarchist ideas and well
with you I mean the the first thing to
do is overcome the misconceptions to
explain what you mean by anarchism now
it's a pretty broad concept like them in
general the concepts of political
discourse are very far from precise I
mean to try to explain what liberal
means our capitalism means which will
any term you pick
they're used highly varied and complex
and often contradictory ways and
anarchism is no exception but I think if
you try to find a sort of core themes
running through anarchist thought in
action there are some Oh basically it
seems to me one should think of
anarchism as not a specific set of
doctrines but just a kind of a tendency
in human thought and action which asks
whether which tries to detect and
discover structures of authority
domination and hierarchy when there are
plenty of them and to challenge them ask
them to demonstrate their legitimacy
recognizing that they are not
self-justifying they have a burden of
justification that's true all across the
spectrum of human life from patriarchal
families to imperial systems and
everything in between wherever you find
the structure of domination hierarchy
somebody giving orders and what he
taking them whatever maybe you have to
ask is that legitimate well you cannot
assume that it you shouldn't assume so
it is legitimate because it's been like
that that's not a justification you have
to ask is it legitimate when you do you
generally find that it can't be
justified there are cases you can think
of cases where you can make up a
justification but it try it it's pretty
hard most of the time the justification
is the way power is distributed that's
not a justification and anarchism is the
effort to discover such systems when
they can't justify themselves to
dismantle them and to move towards
greater freedom justice opportunity in
the
creativity cooperative activity and so
on it's just a tendency in in history
and I don't think it's hard to
communicate to people I think they take
it for granted if it's brought to their
attention and you see it for example
take one of the major achievements of
the last 50 years in many societies the
United States many others I'm sure here
has been women's expansion of women's
rights exchanged enormously and how did
it happen well as soon as this
structures of oppression were identified
that kind of disappeared which is a not
instantly of course this resistance
still plenty of resistance but the
powers of this is nice it's as a general
truth that power prefers darkness if
it's exposed to the light little rose if
people can see it it arose and this
happens all through history where does
it lead so what would the final goal be
I don't think anyone is smart enough to
say that to say what it would be this is
something that's a constant ongoing
effort to try to expand the realm of
justice freedom independence breakdown
of authority and so on and I don't see
at you that should have any limits that
you can think of all kind of concrete
cases so for example just think of the
forms of authority and domination that
exists in our societies one of the
dominant ones is wage labor if you go
back to the early days of the Industrial
Revolution in England and the United
States other countries people who were
being driven
into the industrial system the bitterly
condemned it in the United States and
the mid 19th century when the Industrial
Revolution was beginning working people
described wage labor as equivalent to
slavery these only difference was that
wage wage laborers must be temporary
we're slavery's permanent actually that
was such a widespread idea that it was a
slogan of the Republican Party Abraham
Lincoln accepted it that's when northern
workers went to war in the civil war
that was one of their slogans want to
eliminate chattel slavery literal
slavery and weights that what they
called wage slavery no influence of
marks or European radicalism this just
came straight out of popular
understanding the popular understanding
of free independent people who felt the
rights are being taken away by being
forced into a system where they have to
sell themselves to survive I mean they
understood you read their they had their
own this is the period of the freest
press in American history may be any
history of the working class press the
fact what were called factory girls
young women taken from the farms and
forced into the textile mills at their
own journals a very rich literature they
and one of the themes was that if you if
you sell what you produce for a price
like you're an independent crafts person
you make something and you sell it
you're selling what you produced if you
work for a wage you're selling yourself
you're losing your freedom you you're
the only thing that you're selling is
yourself you're losing your freedom your
dignity your independence your worth as
a person well you know over the century
of the
your Center and a half this has kind of
been instilled in the people's heads and
the intuitive understanding of the
absolute injustice of this relationship
has been kind of suppressed but I think
it's right below the surface I don't
think it takes much for people to
recover the understanding that was
second nature a century and a half ago
maybe some work but that's the kind of
thing that organizers and activists
ought to be doing and that's a kind of
oppression and domination I think should
be eliminated and we know how to do it
should be eliminated by enterprises that
are managed and run by their
participants not you know not a
particularly obscure or even utopian
concept that happens in many cases for
example there's a in Spain vast country
there's a huge conglomerate Mondragon
which is more or less run on these
principles not quite but something like
it it's owned it's owned by the
participants they select their own
managers then manage themselves but it's
under under recallable and so on and so
forth that's a step towards overcoming
the deep oppression of the wage labor
system in the United States in the old
industrial regions of rust belt where
the factories have been abandoned and so
on there's a spontaneous spread of
worker owned and worker managed
enterprises not huge ones but it's
pretty substantial ones fact there now
one of the more progressive unions the
United Steelworkers is right now
involved in discussions with Mondragon
and
the vast country to try to integrate
their activities these things come very
naturally to people it seems perfectly
perfectly obvious thing to do and don't
think there's difficulty in
communicating it what's the point you
know once people are freed from the
oppression that comes from just
reflexively adopting the customs and
conventions in which you in which you
survive actually it's rather similar to
the women's movement in this respect so
for example if you'd ask my grandmother
whether she was oppressed she wouldn't
understood what you're talking about
that's like asking does she breathe you
know if he asked my mother whether she
was oppressed she knew it and she
resented it which thought there's
nothing you can do about it my daughter
is totally different they won't even
bother answering those are changes those
are changes that have taken place just
through exposing power of the sunlight
and seeing it evaporate and I think this
can happen in many domains so what would
an anarchist society look like well you
know the final result that I don't
expect the final result human life is
too complicated but the you can see
steps towards more freedom or
elimination of illegitimate structures
of authority and where it goes is for
people to make their own decisions
hopefully it would be like you describe
it but I still have a little doubt and
that is isn't it too demanding you know
it's easier to to be led by authority by
an authority I'm myself sort of
activists and sometimes I read it all
all the time but it's a terribly time
consuming it costs me a lot of energy
the outcome is very uncertain it's not a
very rewarding or not not all the time
it's it's easier to be led by
authorities so it isn't the idea too
much demanding that's basically an
argument for slavery the optimal the
ultimate position which in order to make
any decisions at all as if the master
just tells you what to do in the morning
you go do it wage labor is somewhere in
between it's say my grandmother's
oppression with somewhere in between
it's true that freedom creates burdens
you have to make choices and decisions
that burden isn't really the right word
that makes you a more happier person's
moral lives can has greater
opportunities for use of their own
independent faculty develop your
faculties you can apply them it does
require choices and takes time but if
it's all to the good and I don't your
you teach in a university right well
universities our baddest closest exists
in the modern world to self-manage just
societies like in it I'm there isn't it
structure there's the people who run it
you know the state authorities and so on
but the team's gotta get rid of them but
but he go to a university faculty you
know the actual faculty say the
philosophy department or the chemistry
department pretty much they make their
own decisions about what they're going
to do what they're going to work on when
you're going to work when you're not
going to work who you work with what
courses you teach and so on and so forth
I'm not it's not an anarchist society
but it comes about as close as anything
in the modern world and people choose it
then prefer it it just gives you lots of
freedom that you don't have in other
professions that's one of the reasons
why people quite commonly will take a
academic position instead of working in
the business world at a much higher
salary but much less freedom freedom
itself is a remarkable value this more
remark there were plenty of doctrines I
ologies and the regimes which were
promising an article society or a
society where the oppressors are gone
well actually they brought more
oppression and more suffering and you
can go far back in the history so which
do you have in mind Oh French Revolution
for instance or the French Revolution
didn't promise anarchy well that's true
they didn't promise honoree but they
draw the society in our are key for a
while a number of being Asafa anarchy
they brought a I'm they did overthrow a
system of oppression like the the the
king the nobility the church a lot of
that was permanent but it quickly
instituted a system of extreme
aggression very quickly nevertheless
there were games and the gains are
permanent you know they threw the rest
of French and in fact
the world history that a lot was built
on the basis of the achievements that
were made even though they were beaten
back well we have some uglier examples
like the Soviet regime which was a
promise I'm not saying that it was an
arrow key but it was promising something
better I think that's a mistake the you
take a look back the early part of the
20th century early 1900s the the Marxist
left was bitterly condemning Lenin
because of his authoritarian tendencies
effect even people I Trotsky later
cooperated with them were pointing out
that Lenin's conception this is before
the 19 5 or evolution even Lenin's
conception was that the Communist Party
should rule over the proletariat the
Central Committee should rule over the
Communist Party and the maximal leader
Lenin should rule over the Central
Committee and in fact about as soon as
the vulture takeover took place in
October 1917 that's exactly what
happened that if take a look at the I
think the history is my view
misunderstood there was a period from
dr. from april nineteen seventeen until
october 1917 right in that fury it to
read Lenin's writings there they do have
a kind of a libertarian anarchist flavor
but it was not true before and it
certainly wasn't true after and I think
a kind of cynical but probably accurate
interpretation of this is that he was a
politician he was trying to appeal to
the revolutionary fervor of the 1917
revolution so he was taking their the
physician
the attitudes of the general public and
was trying to present himself as the
spokesman for them once he took power
was back to the earlier positions highly
authoritarian and in fact Lennon you
know today's in his justification he had
a reason Yetta you know it was there was
a justification for it wasn't just
personal power I mean he was an orthodox
Marxist and there was a kind of a
Marxist orthodoxy which marks didn't
believe it but marks and Marxism were
two different things there was a Marxist
orthodoxy which held that the
proletariat has to be the leading force
in bringing about a communist revolution
now Lenin understood that in Russia
Russia was a backward mostly peasant
society there wasn't a proletariat which
could be a leading force and if you look
at Lenin's view at the time it was that
the revolution would take place in
Germany the most advanced industrial
society and Russia would be a kind of a
backwater and it would sort of have to
be drawn along in the world revolution
well there was a kind of effort the
smartest uprising in 1919 which quickly
crushed and that was the end of Germany
as the leading force and global
revolution he was thinking about and
linen immediately undertook kind of
state capitalist policies no economic
policy and the idea was to drive Russia
from his point of view is a backward
peasant society to drive it to
industrialization and then when you get
an industrial proletariat you know I
earned laws of history and all that
they'll carry out the revolution marks
instantly didn't believe that the Marx
himself was quite impressed by the
revolutionary potential of the Russian
peasantry he was in his last year's he
look at his manuscripts he was spending
a lot of time on the detailed analyses
that were presented by the neuronics of
the russian peasantry and he was pretty
impressed by them and felt that there
was a real revolutionary potential there
but that was not the view of the urban
marxists either the Bolsheviks of the
Social Democrats and they kind of
suppressed that work of his wasn't
really discovered until considerably
later but I think that was kind of the
logic so there was never an effort my
view in the part of the sofa the-- it's
not the Soviet Union this is Russia to
have it lead a social communist little
even socialist revolution I think that's
a misunderstanding of course that was
that the world's to propaganda systems
insist that the Soviet Union was
socialist the West insists on it in
order to undermine socialism the East
insisted on it to try to gain what they
could from the moral appeal of socialism
and when the world's to propaganda
systems of the huge one in the West and
small one and East when they agree on
something it tends to be kind of
persuasive but i think it's just flat
wrong on both cases and kind of
opportunistic in both side your
questions also in interaction for just
to turn over the
turn your attention to mechanisms how
how it happens that the freedom is
getting lost for example 24 five years
ago here we had the revolution where the
general egg toss and energy of the
revolution was driven by the idea of
freedom and then there was a response or
several responses how to how to achieve
it how to how to make the freedom
working like every day on everyday basis
which are you I want to specifically
written engine at the end one of the
responses was the free market for
example free market and from free market
you go to a modification of many human
activities we see for example
commodification of media communication
of education and it has big impact for
society however it looks in the third
like in the on the ground not so serious
as it as it is let's take the concept of
the free market the free market is a
system that does exist it's imposed on
the week the strong never permitted the
United States Britain Germany they don't
have free markets take your cell phone
again and have a look at it and ask
yourself where the technology that's
built into that cell phone came from
it's interesting exercise overwhelmingly
it came from the state sector places
like where I work MIT which is
technically a private institution but
totally almost totally state-funded
that's where computers the internet
micro electronics lasers pharmaceuticals
that's what's all developed the entire
promised the entire IT revolution the
information technology revolution
overwhelmingly it comes out of the state
sector for four decades I mean take
computers
the first they entered the market you
know they you could sell personal
computers Apple was the first one to be
able to sell computers i was nineteen
seventy-seven that's about 30 years
after the major research and development
and investment had been done mostly in
the state sector the internet was being
developed from around nineteen sixty was
finally handed over to private
enterprise in 1995 35 years later and
that's true across the board like if you
have a GPS in your hand device whatever
it is that's an application of the US
Navy navistar system that was developed
decades earlier and that goes way back
in history of the American mass
production system which kind of amazed
the world in the mid 19th century was
mostly developed in government armors
and there's a reason for this when
things are done in the state sector cost
and risk don't matter because the
population is paying for taxpayers
paying for it so you can undertake risky
costly efforts finally if anything comes
out of them they're handed over to the
private sector for profit this is an
exaggeration it's like it's not a
hundred percent like this but that's
that's the core way in which the economy
works goes way back to the early days of
British industrialization in the 18th
century the record very clearly shows
that states that have violated what are
called sound economic principles are the
ones that are prospered I'll just give
you an illustration when the American
colonies were liberated from England
they got advice from the best British
economist Adam Smith for example
advise the colonies on the policies that
they should follow and his advice was
almost the same as what the IMF told
Eastern Europe in 1990 and what the West
tells the third world almost the same
you should have market principles you
should told the colonies you should
concentrate on what you're good at what
would later be later was called your
comparative advantage you should produce
the cotton and the primary products and
fish and four don't produce
manufacturing goods because the British
manufacturing goods are much better so
important British manufacturers produce
primary products certainly don't try to
monopolize your primary products
remember the main primary product then
was cotton cotton was like the oil of
the early industrial revolution so he
said don't try to monopolize cotton just
keep the market principles that produce
primary products import superior British
goods and then everyone will be better
off that's what's called sound economics
right up to the present moment well the
colonies were liberated they didn't have
to follow a sound economics so they
violated every principle they
immediately turned the very high
protective tariffs to block superior
British manufacturers a lot of state
initiative was put into developing
industry at first textiles of later
steel up till today with computers in
the internet I became a rich powerful
country incidentally that's just what
Britain had done before that's what
Germany did later that's what France did
that's what Japan did these are the
countries that prospered not by a free
market now the free market is info does
exist in the colonies like the British
imposed the free market system on India
was Colin
they ran it India was one of the mate
was along with China was the most
advanced commercial and industrial
center of the world in the 17th century
now after a couple of years of British
imperialism and the market system was a
wreck that's exactly what happened in
Eastern Europe the imposition of market
systems in Eastern Europe destroyed the
economies I'm Ukraine for example i
think was maybe the richest part of
Eastern Europe back in nineteen ninety
and now it's a basket case russia in
russia in the 1990s the economy was
reduced by i think about fifty percent
but the number of people who died in
russia in the 1990s nobody does the
exact numbers but was certainly in the
millions in fact it was almost on a par
with Stalin's purges that's the
imposition of market principles that you
see it all over the world so I think we
should you know the rich and the
powerful protect themselves from markets
dramatically okay the most dramatic
example from today's economy today's
economy Western economies are largely
financialized they're based on financial
institutions so in the United States and
I think maybe forty percent of corporate
profits are you know banks and other
financial institutions that was recently
a study by the International Monetary
Fund of the six major American banks the
biggest banks JPMorgan Chase Goldman
Sachs and so on and asked a simple
question where do their profits come
from turns out their profits come almost
entirely from a government insurance
policy there's a policy which is called
too big to fail that amounts to a
government insurance policy that tells
the CEO of JPMorgan Chase that you can
make risky investments and transactions
which will be profitable and if it
just don't worry about it was taxpayer
bail you out and it's not just the
bailouts that's a small part of it it's
access to cheap credit better credit
ratings all sorts of devices I mean the
business press estimated the taxpayer
gift the big banks of over eighty
billion dollars a year that's called a
market it's got nothing to do with
markets that's class warfare that's
powerful systems using their power to
extort wealth out of the public so they
can prosper and that's pretty much too
it's the same with these trade
agreements like the transit we don't
know the details because their secret
but the parts that have leaked out our
highly protectionist and designed to
increase to monopoly pricing rights know
like excessive profits for
pharmaceuticals so I think we should be
very cautious about here is thinking
about terms like free market I mean
there are in fact you know it would if
you just think about it for the things
that we are not taught not to think
about are pretty remarkable like there's
a huge industry in the West here too
huge industry though is devoted to
undermining markets it's called the
public the advertising industry if
you've ever taken economics course you
learn that markets are based on informed
consumers making rational choices all of
economic theories based on that turn on
the television set take a look at an ad
is it trying to create an informed
consumer making a rational choice of
course not it's trying to undermine
markets course business doesn't want
markets they want power another
principle of markets is that say if you
make an investment you decide to invest
some small company that's trying some
risky thing and you keep investing in it
for decades and finally something comes
out in a market system you'd get the
profit not in our society the way it
works in our society is that the
taxpayer makes the investment for
decades like computers internet etc and
when something profitable comes out
doesn't go back to the taxpayer it goes
to Steve Jobs or Bill Gates or somebody
like that it's got nothing to do with
markets no has to do with power and
again there are places where market
systems are imposed like the third world
were like Eastern Europe after nineteen
ninety but that has nothing do with
freedom
professor Chomsky have touched the topic
of Russia and mask you about your
current view on the situation in Ukraine
Russia Crimea and reaction on the US
government or EU towards the situation
there well the invasion and annexation
of Crimea is in violation of
international law it's and violation of
explicit treaties to to which Russia was
a party to observe the borders of
Ukraine no doubt about that it's not the
only such case in the world there are
much worse cases that we don't talk
about them because they're our crimes
but they exist so think about them take
for example the just to take the most
obvious which would be on the front
pages if there was anything like a free
press that takes a the u.s. takeover of
eastern Cuba okay it was taken a point
of a gun was there's a treaty but it was
under military occupation so cube was
forced to hand over eastern Cuba to the
United States is what we call cuanto
nomo big part of eastern south eastern
Cuba includes Cuba's major port and any
real hope they have for trade and
development the US has held it for over
a century when Cuba got its independence
in 1959 they asked to have it back u.s.
refuses for over 50 years now the US has
refused Cuban efforts to get that part
of their territory back the US has no
justification for this no strategic
interest no historical connections
nothing except one thing it helps unto
thee it contributes to the US policy of
undermining Cuba's hope for independent
development that's it it's part of the
policy of economics a economic warfare
of terrorist activity and so on
otherwise nothing I mean the Russian
actions in Crimea are criminal but they
have a much stronger case than the US
has in eastern Cuba and there's other
cases that takes a Israel Israel has
annexed the Syrian Golan Heights that's
in explicit violation of security
council orders not only in violation of
international law but in violation of
explicit orders of the Security Council
ordering them not to do it take what's
called Jerusalem Jerusalem today has
almost nothing to do with anything that
was ever Jerusalem it's about five times
as big as historic Jerusalem Israel's
our next it in violation of explicit
security council orders take what
Israel's doing in the West Bank ever
called the settlement and infrastructure
development all in violation of
international law it's not yes it's not
debatable I'm in Security Council the
International Court of Justice of all
rolled on and they can do it because the
United States backs it and that's the
way power works in the world so there's
that then we can continue the Turkish
occupation of Northern Cyprus there's
many other cases assure its criminal act
should should should be condemned in the
context of recognition of what's going
on the first of all in comparison with
others that we were responsible for and
also because Russia does have claims
unlike the USA in eastern Cuba I'm sure
you know the background first Jeff just
handed Crimea over Ukraine in 1954 never
asked population and the population was
not in favor of there were referenda
much earlier early 90s which came out
about the same as
referendum russia's only warm water port
is in Crimea it's their main naval base
it's got a long historic connections and
so on so it's criminal act but I'm there
are just there are arguments for unlike
say the u.s. and Cuba furthermore this
history if you take a look at what's the
EU us and Russian actions now there's if
you read the press that or you listen to
government pronouncements there's a lot
of condemnation of the fact that Russia
is carrying out military maneuvers near
the border of Ukraine but inside Russia
at the same time the u.s. is carrying
out military maneuvers and Poland and
the Baltic States right that would be
analogous to Russia carrying out
military maneuvers in Mexico and Canada
okay but we don't condemn that and
there's a principle the principle is we
own the world and if any country is
doing something even in its own
territory that we don't like that's
illegitimate but if we're doing
something anywhere in the world it's
legitimate that's kind of a fundamental
Imperial principle accepted in much of
the West without any question there's
also a history that's not obscure in
right after the Berlin Wall fell 1990
Gorbachev my fellow Gorbachev made a
pretty astonishing offer he offered to
allow Germany to be unified and to join
a hostile military alliance NATO you
should take a look at the history of the
preceding century and you can see what
that was I mean off the tell you it's
obvious there was a quid pro quo this is
the US government that's President Bush
in his Secretary of State James Baker
Mayday they agreed not to let me
move the phrase was one inch to the east
meaning to East Germany they pledged
that NATO would not move to East Germany
that was the quid pro quo immediately
NATO moved the East Germany the
Gorbachev was outraged and the US
government simply informed him it's not
on paper it was only a gentleman's
agreement and if you're dumb enough to
accept our word for something as your
problem so then Clinton came in right
afterwards and extended NATO further to
the east all around the border of Russia
it's a military alliance hostile
military alliance it's analogous to the
Warsaw Pact taking taking over but
Mexico and Canada this kind of would be
an analog unthinkable we'd have a
nuclear war tomorrow you know before it
instantly but this is considered and the
Ukraine issue is related to that if NATO
were to extend further into Ukraine that
would be an enormous security thrumming
Russia is already very vulnerable and
unlike the United States and surrounded
by hostile powers in fact on all sides
and this would be a real serious
security threat so there are issues
going way back so going back to your
point yes Crimea is a criminal act but
it's a lot more complex than that
one and last two questions so first
Martin thanks up to this point we were
talking about humans but I think we
could utter few words also about other
beings toes without universal grammar
and I would like to know your opinion on
animal rights and then your opinion on
veganism would you think about that you
know over the past centuries the kind of
domain of Rights has been expanded so
like if you go back eight hundred years
to Magna Carta the kind of foundation of
anglo-american no Western law it granted
something called presumption of
innocence you're innocent unless proven
guilty in a fair trial with by a jury of
peers now that incidentally that right
has completely disappeared today guilty
means that Tuesday morning Obama decided
to kill you that's what guilty means
today that's the drone terror campaign
but there was such a principle
presumption of innocence but it was for
free privileged men in fact barons you
know over the centuries had expanded not
totally but it did expand considerably
okay he takes a the United States in the
United States Constitution it's there
but it meant free men with certain
amount of property obviously didn't mean
slaves didn't mean native-americans it
didn't mean women they were not in fact
women under the US took over British
common law under which women were
property they weren't persons so a woman
is the property of her father that's
properties handed over her husband in
fact that lasted until 1975 not that
long ago 1975 the US Supreme Court ruled
that women have a right to serve on
federal juries that means to be peers to
be a pure means to be a person so it
took a long time but expand it it's not
perfect but it expended and rights have
extended in other ways like the slavery
is outlawed and so on and that's also
true of animal rights there's been a
expansion of the concern for animal
rights so it takes a Cambridge
Massachusetts where I live two major
universities Harvard MIT fifty years ago
the labs were carrying out experiments
with animals that you cannot carry out
today they violate federal law local law
and even university laws alright that's
an expansion of the domain of animal
rights at the same time the severe
regression huge regression you take a
look at species extinction today species
extinction today is at the level of 65
million years ago when an asteroid hit
the earth and ended the age of the
dinosaurs massive extinction took place
that kind of opened the way for mammals
ultimately us species extinction now is
at the same level except we're the
asteroid that's an attack on animal
rights which is just colossal you know
we're wiping out species at the rate of
65 million years ago when an asteroid
hit you can't imagine a more extreme
violation of the rights of animals of
species and we don't even know if that's
not enough is known to know if that's
the actual number could be much higher
because we're gone I can identify lots
of species so it goes both ways it's
definitely a serious issue and we ought
to think about it part of
the geologists is a lot of you probably
know break up the history into epochs
now there was the Pleistocene which
lasted a couple of million years up
until 10,000 years ago and then comes
the Holocene that is connected with the
human invention of agriculture which
made a big change in the general
environment 250 years ago starts a new
epoch it's called the Anthropocene
that's the industrial revolution with
really rapid effects on the general
environment you take a look at these
numbers and project and it's not pretty
to ask what comes next but that's what
we're doing and we're racing forward to
make it worse let's say in the United
States now there's a lot of enthusiasm
about becoming the Saudi Arabia of the
21st century hundred years of energy
independence and so on what's the world
going to look like after another century
of exploiting fossil fuels well don't
leave it to your imagination but it's
it's not something projected for the
future it's something underway right now
with a massive attack on attack on
animal right in fact massacres and we're
next not far
sorry what what about veganism is your
think about this attitude is it
effective for can it help you know I
think you can give an argument for it
but there's costs associated with it I
mean it takes time effort planning so
their costs and you could say the same
about turning the lights on in the
evening I mean we all do it but their
costs in fact that's one of the things
that's contributing to the massacre of
animals so we live in a world in which
we make choices and they have costs and
you have to do make decisions about
which ones are the right ones for you
what's the opportunity cost for doing
something so should you live in the dark
say should you walk instead of taking a
bus questions arise all the time
veganism think is like they're so thank
you one last question if i may ask you
okay well thank the question coming from
from universities are named after the
word universe universal ative what is
the situation today can you see it this
is a universality is it still applicable
universality yes well I think there are
some simple universal principles which
we all sort of which are kind of
interesting if you think about them
there w the most interesting ones are
the ones there ee universal their
Universal in that we all accept them and
their universal that we all violate them
so we accept them in principle but we
violate them in practice so take the
most elementary won the Golden Rule you
know applied yourself the same standards
you by two others version of it if you
ask do we accept it verbally yeah do we
live by it not for a minute take a look
at the way we all the things we've been
to
about do we apply to ourselves the
standards we apply to our enemies save
Russia today or Iran or whatever we
don't have to go into we don't begin to
apply these standards to ourselves we're
immune to the standards we apply to
enemies so we preach the we preach the
universal principles but we universally
violate them not everybody of course but
the systems that actually function in
the world do that's we can go on with
that I think there's plenty of examples
like that I know once a there was once a
collection of essays by a bunch of
philosophy good philosophers on work of
mine and one of the contributors
complained that the only ism I seem to
believe in is truism and he was
basically right I think truisms have a
lot of value you should pay attention
I'm sure there are plenty more questions
which we have in mind an audience has we
are running out of time professor
Chomsky I wanted to thank you very much
for being with us tonight thank you very
much it's great honor for polotsk
University and I think for a halt to
Republic we appreciate your highly
controversial issues and views on some
problems like politics and I hope you
will enjoy your rest of your stay in
wonderful city of almost thank you very
much again thank you
you
