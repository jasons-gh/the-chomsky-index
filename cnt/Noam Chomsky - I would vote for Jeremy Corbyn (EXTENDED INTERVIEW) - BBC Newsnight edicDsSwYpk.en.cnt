there's a lot of anger in the world
today under are you sympathetic to that
anger or are you feeling this anger is
the wrong kind of anger I am sympathetic
to the roots of the anger I think anger
is not a constructive response to
problems that are quite real and they
are quite real
so take say the United States which has
suffered less from the policies of the
last generation than other Western
countries but nevertheless in the United
States median income for example is
lower in real terms than it was 30 years
ago
right at the moment before the great
crash the peak of euphoria about the
wonderful economy real wages for
American workers were lower than they
had been in 1979 before the neoliberal
period began and this is duplicated over
much of the world this has been a
massive assault on large parts of the
population it's been an assault on
democracy on a sense of participating
the results is not just anger but
contempt for institutions decline of
centrist institutions which a large part
of the population feels are just not
responsive to them directly and trumpet
being a result of that really Trump is
one result of that hyper exit as a
result of that lepen as a result and and
why why do you think the response to the
problem you've talked about and low
incomes why do people then jump to a
lepen or a Trump rather than really
Bernie Sanders the Ottawa usually they
jump to Bernie Sanders the most
remarkable thing about the last election
was actually Bernie Sanders not from
Bernie Sanders broke with a century of
American political
history in American elections for back
to the late 19th century elections are
basically bought literally you don't you
can predict with remarkable accuracy
electability simply on the basis of
campaign funding and also policies is
very substantial political science
research on this Sanders came along no
no support from it from the corporate
sector no support from the wealthy the
media simply dismissed them as
ridiculous he was basically unknown he
even used a scare word socialist and he
would have won the Democratic nomination
if it hadn't been for the shenanigans of
the party managers if you take a look at
popularity today he is far and away the
most popular figure in the American
political system right but the truth is
Trump won the election fair or not fair
what was the appeal of truck why does so
many people particularly blue-collar
Rust Belt populations why do they have
to like him I've just given you the
answer take a look at what's happened to
them during but while you're running but
what is the alternative the Democrats
gave up on the working-class forty years
ago they do this to them that the
working class is not their constituency
no one is there no no one in the
political system is the Republicans
claim to be but they're basically their
class enemy however they can appeal to
people on the basis of non-economic
claims about we're going to help you
economically even when we kick you in
the face but claims about religion white
supremacy a range of kind of what's
called sometimes identity politics which
does there were a lot of you take a look
at the Trump voters summer working class
and incidentally many of them
voted for Obama in 2008 they believed
Obama's rhetoric about hope and change
they were quickly disillusioned there
was no hope and there was no change and
in response they've turned the this
group has turned to basically their
class enemy because no one else is there
to offer them anything then there's
another sector which is white supremacy
is very deeply rooted in the United
States if you look at comparative study
there are comparative studies of white
supremacy around the world the United
States ranks higher than even South
Africa do you think there was quite a
racist but your lecture is on a doubt
about that well are we talking 3%
innovative without you the fence or
scent you can argue about embrace it
like as a substantial streak
fundamentalist religion as a substantial
streak Trump took an enormous quantity
of the Christian fundamentalists who
were a big segment of the US population
I remember in the United States about
maybe 40% of the population
I think the second coming is going to be
in their lifetimes two-thirds think it's
coming sooner or later this is United
States is off the spectrum in this
respect so here's a big segment of
voters that Trump was able to appeal to
not on the basis of his own positions
but because he's going to serve their
interests and they know it and among
white males he was way ahead of Clinton
others so there's many factors but one
interesting factor is in fact the white
working-class was much of which went to
Obama and then that didn't work for them
well enough so they went to the next
thing that was different little America
the same claim Obama claimed we're going
to have hope and change no hope and
change bankers and so on you can Trump
will do much damage
is that I'm going to be permanent damage
to the institutions in the US or do you
think I think the temporary damage will
do is to the world and it's already
happening the most significant aspect of
the Trump election that's not just Trump
it's the whole Republican Party is
they're departing from the rest of the
world on climate change it's a crucial
issue it's an existential threat and now
the United States we have this
astonishing spectacle of the United
States alone in the world not only
refusing to participate in efforts to
deal with climate change but trying
dedicated to undermining them and it's
not just Trump every single Republican
leader is the same goes down to the
local levels
take a look at the primaries in the
Republican primaries every single
candidate either denied that climate
change is happening or when you get to
the so-called moderates like Jeb Bush
and Kay search they said well maybe it's
happening but we shouldn't do anything
about it that's a hundred percent
refusal and this goes down to lower
levels incidentally roughly forty
percent of the population think it can't
be a problem because Jesus is coming in
another couple of things I mean you
called the Republican Party a nice
dangerous organization on earth in human
history there has never it's an
outrageous statement and I when I said
it I said look this is a very outrageous
statement but is it true as they could
go ranking them worse than the Kim
jong-un North Korea or I had a very is
Isis dedicated to trying to destroy the
prospects for organized human existence
is that bad public what does it mean to
say not only we're not doing anything
about climate change
we're trying to accelerate the race to
the Ferengi you don't entertain the
possibility that they may be genuine in
their belief that this it doesn't matter
whether they genuinely believe it or not
the people who genuinely believe that
Christ is coming and their lifetimes do
genuinely believe it but if that if the
consequence of that is let's use more
fossil fuels let's refuse to subsidize
developing countries let's eliminate
regulations that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions if that's the consequence
that's extremely dangerous
unless you're living under a rock you
have to recognize the seriousness of
this threat and of the other threat is
nuclear weapons and they're they're very
dangerous as well just thinking about
the cause of the divisions in society
what is creating these divisions do you
think the traditional classes working
class the capitalist class the owners
and the workers is that the most
interesting division is that a good way
of thinking about it these days do you
think or is it out of Staters
well first of all either you're either
you give orders or you take orders and
that's a big difference
that's always a difference either you
own large parts of the world or you rent
or you look or you rent yourself to the
owner maybe you wrote a little bit
because you have a pension fund or you
you don't own you don't own anything
what you known as it's a it is a
minuscule fraction of the ownership of
corporation stock ownership is very
highly concentrated and not only
concentrated but interlocked so big
banks owned big pieces of different
corporations and so on furthermore if
you look at ownership ownership of the
world of the world economy is now
in many ways a more dramatic index of
country's power than the traditional
ones like GDP per capita so for example
there's a few studies that have just
begun of the the extent to which say
ownership of the world economy is
concentrated in particular countries
turns out that US corporations own about
half the world economy if someone
whoever the US corporations I mean it's
institutions who have multiple owners
they don't have that again there's a
very high concentration of ownership and
the institutions are and if you go back
to the the act that enough ownership to
actually control the corporation it's
often a group of big financial
institutions insurance some have said
that the divide now is a more cultural
one between metropolitan
internationalists comfortable with
immigration they're called people who
are happy anywhere and people who are
rooted in local communities and to who
has lot of some where is that another
family divides there's divides on
religion for example this divides on all
sorts of things but a fundamental divide
is the class divide and one of the
reasons for the anger that you began
with is because none of the institutions
and none of the political parties are
really representing the class interests
of the large part of the workforce and
that does lead to great anger there are
other sources too and I think in many
ways the derivative from it so for
example the anti-immigrant hysteria in
the United States in England elsewhere
is in part a reflection of the decline
in opportunity that is the result of
video liberal
when you have a large part of the
population who have been either stagnant
or declining in fact the majority for a
generation that's quite serious it shows
up even in mortality so for example in
in the United States as you may have
seen recently the in the working in the
main working years 25 to 50 roughly
those years there's actually an increase
in mortality increase in mortality among
white working people that hasn't
happened in industrial societies and
ever you know except for famine or Wars
what do you think of people call it the
urban economy it's called the gig
economy here an economy where you have
very many self-employed people there
kind of working themselves they're sort
of working for a big company much more
armed length relationships not insecure
work that's critical and it's understood
and if you go back to the planners and
the managers of the neoliberal economy
people like I'll take Alan Greenspan who
in the Fed chair had read it in the
United States subtly you know up
correctly up till the crash he testified
to Congress the Senate Banking Committee
on the success of the economy that he
was managing and he attributed a good
part of the success to what he called
growing worker insecurity he said
growing worker insecurity has the effect
that workers are too intimidated to ask
for better wages to go on strike to ask
for benefits and the result is we can
maintain what was called the Great
Moderation low inflation high profits
and so on yeah that's part of it and the
gig economy is an aspect of that as you
say there it's a precarious life it's
not a life of secure
and therefore it's a life in which you
don't organize together to defend and
extend your rights you just try to
survive now there's a group that doesn't
namely the owners they organize they
struggle they control the political
system and what you see is the
developments we've seen in the last
generation extremely high concentration
of wealth stagnation or decline for a
large part of the population undermining
of democratic institutions anger your
first word is correct anger at the fact
that the institutions are not
representative they don't deal with me a
sense in large parts of the population
that for the first time we're not moving
forward the the image that's often used
is that people see themselves as the the
Trump supporters they that group see
themselves as standing in a line where
they were supposed to be moving forward
their parents worked hard they did all
the right things they the children were
better and better often their parents
all of a sudden the line is stopped the
people ahead of them are shooting up to
the stratosphere and then comes the
scapegoating the picture is that the
government is working for those
undeserving people behind us and trying
to put them ahead of us
affirmative action food stamps
immigrants and so on
and that's where the Trump's of the
world come in yeah we can we can we can
blame those that undeserving people for
your plight not the people ahead of you
in line who are really responsible for
it we've seen things like this in
history I don't go along with those who
say that we have incipient fashion
but there is a recollection of somebody
who did the same thing why don't you go
wrong with those because there are
plenty people who say the 1930s at the
parallel that by I don't I mean they're
no stormtroopers
there's no ideology Trump's only
ideology is me that's quite different
from the Hitler and Mussolini the
there's no organization there's no
fascist organization it's a very
different situation it's deeply
authoritarian and very dangerous but not
version Mackrell won the French election
Emmanuel macron an internationalist
liberal loves the EU all the things in a
way that the Trump voters have when
tried to reject you can succeed as at
the end of populism in Europe by no
means in fact macaw is a good example of
how the fund of the core institutions
have collapsed he came from the outside
yeah okay and the vote for him was
substantially a vote against lepen who
is recognized correctly I think to be a
serious danger in fact many people who
voted for Michel were holding their nose
you know not their choice what about the
British election Jeremy Corbyn has been
leading the Labour Party they have an
uphill task according to the opinion
polls have you any advice any thoughts
about how Labour refines its pitch and
makes it to government in the UK they
should ask me to vote I would vote for
him I mean you know they had they have a
problem I think he's a very decent good
person I've followed his career for some
years he's not evidently not inspiring
the population how labour could
liber has not come out with its program
so we don't really know what it will be
but in a sense of a lack of clarity
about quite what he stands for that's
right which is odd because he was
someone who was more clear about what is
authentically what's happened to the
Labour Party over the list through the
neoliberal years it became as many call
it saturate especially under Blair it
did not represent the working-class they
did not have to split after the election
on your analysis it's two parties a
neoliberal like party estatua like party
and a corbin party they're not the same
party no they're not and the Labour and
in fact it's split between the
constituency in the parliamentary party
so the Labour Party has internal
problems that has to deal with but it
also has the problem of demonstrating to
the electorate that it does represent
their interests the Democrats in the
United States have the same problem so
for example if it hadn't been for the
shenanigans of the party managers the
obama-clinton party managers Sanders
probably would have won the election and
might very well have won the election I
want to finish it these are internal
problems to these decaying centrist
institutions and the anger that you
talked about it first is a reflection of
them yeah I want to talk to you about
Julian Assange just just to finish
because you've been a big supporter of
Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and many
progressive people have looked at
WikiLeaks and said this organisation in
on the wrong side of history I just
wonder whether you still believe in
Julian Assange despite the fact they
published so we now the sentence that I
believe that he should that the
persecution of him was completely wrong
the threats against him are completely
wrong they should be withdrawn he should
be freed he shouldn't have to be
imprisoned
judicial process theory I mean there's
neatly requested laterals of the
yesterday pretty much a fraud
I think so there's no reason why Swedish
prosecutors can't interrogate him on the
charge that they think they have in fact
they've already begun to do so what's
keeping him in prison and in habit is in
prison if I go in there is that
everything the threat that the United
States will go after him same thing
that's keeping Snowden in Russia and is
that if he right to worry about that
reverses right to worry about it and
it's the threat that's wrong as to what
WikiLeaks is deciding to release you can
have various opinions by owners what's
your opinion a monkey stolen emails
perfectly legitimate emails I stole and
then put in the pocket tonight if it
asked me I would have not been in favor
of that so I don't know how they decide
what the leaked and not but leaking in
from the general idea of informing the
public informing citizens of what their
representatives are doing and keeping
from them that's a good idea
nom Chomsky thank you very much indeed
