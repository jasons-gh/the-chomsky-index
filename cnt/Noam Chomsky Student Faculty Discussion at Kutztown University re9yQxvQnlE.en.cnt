there is implemented chomsky's here and
you are going to start asking questions
any area that you are interested thank
you dr. Chauncey I like that you know
I've seen present reviews as I know you
have some using the occupation of the
house of the West Bank things I want to
ask one of them was we hear today about
wall they just sit down negotiate maybe
they get someone and my view is there's
there's nobody at how cynical enables
anybody gentlemen who actually speaks
for all I'm not sure this varies between
you see anything possible positive
outcome and retrieve it yeah if they
will negotiate well they standard line
here
in Palestinians are refusing medication
negotiate without preconditions but
facts are very clearly exactly the
opposite Israel imposes crucial
preconditions one precondition is that
central one is Israel United States were
together they impose the condition that
the negotiations have to be under the US
Aegis that's already eliminates the
possibility of negotiations for the last
35 years the United States has
unilaterally block political Civil
whelming consensus about every in favor
international order
her it came to the United Nations
Security Council 1976 broke by the Arab
states USB dude came again in 1980 us
the because it doesn't defeat
constant but support so for the u.s. to
if the were legitimate negotiations they
would be organized by some respected
neutral party maybe Brazil and on one
side to get the US and Israel
I to have the world then you could have
negotiations that's the first
precondition geography to ensure that
nothing happens secondary condition is
that the settlements must compete the
settlement expansion must continue
that's Israel positioned us endorsing
the settlements are hold there is no
question about that every relevant
international Authority has declared
them to be in violation of core
principles
justice Security Council repeatedly
but this didn't go on us backs so the
second precondition is they must be able
to continue third precondition
is really very explicit if it's a lot of
the areas where is building plans to
annex well that's of course multiple
thats another provision and if you have
the negotiations under those
Israel in the United States would like
them to continue they'd like them to
continue because they're guaranteed to
get nowhere doesn't
but in this framework that meanwhile at
Israel with us port can systematically
take over the parts of the West Bank
that warrants leading the risk and can
maintain
that's fine
on the picture this presented here is
almost there is no problem for
Palestinians
98
this they have the power
so it for your first the first
recognition say the Palestinians in the
world set it down I guess where I wonder
is that it seems to be the Palestinian
don't get along with each other Hamas
versus that's a great all-mountain
result right now there's the community
agreement we're going to eat you the
United States they don't want for one
thing that would
education and for another
early 90s the United States and is
been dedicated to separating
in the West Bank that happens to be in
direct violation of the US
sign this time which declared visitor
the us-israel them systematically trying
to separate
a reason for that it means that if any
kind of Palestinians
ever set up somewhere in West Bank
scattered ever will be imprisoned
because the only access to the outside
is through jasmine is sector to the west
bank alone their interest
here so sure they want to us his room or
separate
why he has split between Hamas and the
West Bank is near as different reason
pizzaz mistakes the first free elections
in the Arab world took place three
elections in Palestine carefully
monitored recognized me free and fair
the day after the election the US and
Israel departure sanction punish the
Palestinians why they would
sure and you know what to do that our
concept of democracy as you do
so they go to the wrong way in the world
in the first free elections and the US
us immediately the standard procedure
questions come out of the wrong way
organizing military coup so these
immediately began to organize military
fuck our strong upon to try to overthrow
the election a mosque preemptively food
bad enough to runway three
block the military coup restored what we
want and that's environment so they see
the attacks
most of the Palestinian
the United States
dismantle the legislature
that's the first freely-elected
u.s.
not just
we've got our 30
you think things hidden nobody gave me a
dirty look do you think things could
have been different live in the early
70s after a preoccupation Center his
maybe he's treated that tree open
society over talking to their will they
don't get recorded in preps but they're
there so in 1971 president Sadat of
Egypt offered Israel of old pastry full
history nothing for the Palestinians
this is before the Palestine
so the only reference to the
Palestinians was so a full peace treaty
in return for drilling withdrawal from
now the only part that's about care
about the teacher
it was driving out thousands of farmers
better winds driving desert destroying
towns
was edition
city me big city
was beginning these programs that they
had a choice
should they security
should they accept security assistant
expansion was a choice security or
expansion
so that's all
the United States with you well there
was an internal debate in the US
government the Nixon administration the
Secretary of State William Rogers who
was in favor of this book
so he was in favor of the Henry
Kissinger
this position was
still no negotiations this course
the preference first
that is Bentley led directly within
mostly
big business because you're realized at
that point that you can't just dismiss
diplomacy finally ended up with the
peace agreement at Camp David
in which the u.s. the u.s. Israel
essentially accepted
1971
though from there going too much
so in 1979
right it's interesting that in u.s.
that's regarding a great triumph great
triumph or just
their rejection of the offer
they could have been
the vast amount of
finally they more or less accepted us
but try to find
I'm
we ask one last thing I'll McCoy oh and
nobody asked that I was in that room yes
please up saying I don't mean to stay on
the same topic I'm sorry I want me to
stay on the same talk of topic I'm sure
there's other questions and you yes but
uh oh when you were talking about how
our form of democracy is kind of like do
what we say or else and I know you're
here to speak to the larger question of
the United States and the United Nations
you still can't hear me I'm sorry I know
you're here to speak the larger question
of the United States and the United
Nations wouldn't feel that this whole
situation that you're on here with the
Israelis and the Palestinians
effectively here tarnishes or image it
amazes the United Nations in terms of
fact that the settlements are direct
violation of international law their
occupation to go on hikes in the shovel
arms is
in the United States
the United States and Europe recent poll
threats the world peace the greatest
threat for obese not allowed to ask
if you go outside of Europe
when the United States over
the record is clear the u.s. reject
anything
unless it goes along with us now the way
that's presented here the United
the top ski is separated to to see you
in person see you appearances with any
good bad democracy now my question he
with regard to you both because
publishing 2006 and Penn State's ever
since the propagation of new
developments pretty much we affirm your
views that justice is fair of state for
United States the famous take into in
two dimension two aspects are rather a
rather pretty much Jennifer failings
that one with regard to the decision
last year since the united Supreme Court
versus the Federal Election Committee
812 United States reactive policy
towards new Hot Springs like Egypt's
revolution in Tunisia so with that I
would like to see your views whether
that's the same since the publication of
your book or five years you know this
morning with place to store this morning
to New York Times the front page story
complexity of facing us diplomats with
regard to what's happening in Egypt
and they say that creates real dilemma
for the United States because this
conflict between the u.s. passion for
democracy and the realistic
understanding of export military well
what's the evidence for the passion for
democracy zero as pure ideology this is
if we're living in North Korea you know
the cheerleaders is
the passion for democracy doesn't exist
in fact the US was very frightened of
democracy in terror and there's a very
simple
you can easily figure it out take a look
at pol there are careful polls done by
us polling agencies do regular careful
studies in the air they're not recorded
compressed but be sure
you're still looking for and remember
what democracy democracy society in
which public opinion
if
well suppose public opinion influence
ninety percent of the population
opposition US policy was so strong that
about eighty percent of
the region would be more secure if you
ran
grandpa
questions for that but given the
enormous threat post
so of course us opposed
stand through
this one throws
state
so there's no fabrication
you have to say that Pepe believe that
if you want to be respected
these are things that will interest so
everything
but I suspected
the reason it was
Oh
and the introductions interesting what
the introduction says yes of course this
book was a setback
english
it was free
he says in deeply unpopular ideas can be
suppressed without these
as part of its because the precedent by
wealthy but the more important reason is
a good education had a good education
you just have instilled into the
understanding that there are certain
things
when you think unless you have that and
still influence
so the end
news first
it's a pretty strong pendant
and this way you can get regular playing
time
you
record
sort of carries forward
Supreme Court ruling in January 2010
Phil's but in effect corporations
by-elections
science
Ferguson has been working for many years
on the what he calls the investment fury
of politics
the basic theme is that elections are
occasions in which groups of investors
coalesce and invest to control the state
he shows
dude you can pretty well predict who's
going to win an election by the amount
of campaign funding and war policies
that are going to be followed by looking
at the nature we just saw that
dramatic Obama's main funding support
came from financial institutions that is
cause ever since
what happens consistently and Citizens
United
so sure this that
go back to nineteen ninety population
was extremely dissolution
there's a lot of hype about the Rays
popularity is quite low in 1999 and
narrows bridge Barry God 1992 Bret if he
left office he was sure that he people
were asked their opinion about living
next president reagan right read the
bottom barely above the Nixon iets
consider was part regan with huge
propaganda campaign has produced his
image raven
I even in the collection for even one
or
her
about two-thirds of people who voted for
said they hoped his legislative
perspective
you don't expect and anybody except your
eyes doesn't expect a political figure
to live up to the promises that make
them
that these are in fact they make
different promises different audiences
very carefully organized by the PR
agencies to run their
and they their weight issues difference
the condition collapse why is there a
deficit
about seventy percent of things
and they're right
the large majority population since the
real problems might have guns so there
are to be a joblessness finish but the
bank's doesn't care
they care about the dentist because
they're afraid
might lead slight inflation and
inflation isn't
inflation is good for borrowers then so
they want to make sure that
alright suppose you look at the deficit
suppose you decide to pay attention
please are there ways of dealing
population
I
first of all get the rich to pay taxes
preserve cut the military
whatever is going to come out of this is
the exact drugs and in fact it's one
topic which you just
which would eliminate the deficit
meeting effectiveness of circles the
United States has a totally
dysfunctional
it's the most dysfunctional in the world
president wisely
cause other industrial countries
the United States simply had the
healthcare system of other industrial
countries
not only wouldn't we have a deficit we
have circle but you can't touch that
these busty insurance companies in the
bank's financials and when Brady
privatized Healthcare's
but public opinion and policy which is
exactly
maybe then we'll do in Sumatra
Turnipseed office to do scientific work
right one you da mystic impression of
language and all that mostly with your
thesis you know that even beings as
species are born with this linguistic
acquisition device ready as you current
some time now this is a kind of it you
know this is in an idea thesis but if I
mean might say that it is an
underdetermined thesis like the be a
heuristic in depression of language what
will be your response to that various
every every statement
everything out that I'm even this up so
that you could get ism do you think Jim
does eat some
there were a lot of criticisms but you
know academic professions have wasted
close
so they did just Kendall
what actually happened the main most
respected committee occurs position the
most relevant with BF Skinner's radical
behavior what Skinner had students and
the students believe that we were
affected students one drifted off into
animal dream
but probably some toward an age for you
so things like flipper
Skinner students training
and it looked like he seemed to have the
answer
his name students whip it up its color
and Nancy three letters they want to
train
discover they discovered that when they
were tracking an animal they could get
everything to work directly
reinforcement
work up to a certain point a certain
point it started to regress so for
example they were training at the train
service tunnels that kind of big
pick up a coin and stick it in a mailbox
it's like
the more even he ran the reinforcement
schedule it's fine
to the point that for certain point they
found it started Rudy
and the lake erie abortion
over what they found was what they
called instinctual drift the animals
humans thought they were training the
animals the animals didn't think that at
all they thought their training
they wanted but they were going to
working it into their own instinctual
patterns and after
in central patterns to go the scanner
was training pigeons to play ping pong
or you can do that because pigeons
training to change their pain
this happened over in fact when the
people started finally looking at the
lab experiments they discovered the
world's company was 15 scientists were
cutting off the experiment that point
where the learning curve started to
deteriorate so as long as that Britain
fun to experiment and published paper
starts compressed
there's nothing going on it was just
animals modifying difference
famous joke columbia undergraduate
a couple of the mice cage
one
do
I got that guy condition every time I
when it's going to cut it on the other
hand of there's still plenty of work of
a sewer
the common opinion is that there really
is no such thing as my collection
process
I'm a question regarding to the current
situation in the Middle East
specifically in music so with the
revolution started in January the
military chose to be neutral and states
to the people but later on like last
week and friday he started to open fire
against evil and use the tear gas
against uprising and in my opinion I
think that even have enough experience
to run the state but at the same time
the remote here with people you know did
you have like a specific day for the
pre-election the military no no further
asleep for that recession addition they
don't have didn't even mention that
they're not untrue and you all say you
know we want to stay in power for the
same time remotely piloting they are
very serious about it I think they wanna
stay out but were they are most serious
about addiction and just you know giving
a country to as the river wipe it
election to undermine their power comes
up the military
not just the political system there is a
large bread comments like asking general
electric's really going to hang on to
what they have as long as they can they
know that the west backs Western powers
won the military
so sure about friday i'm in the square
movement in the early days was you can
kind of understand it but they regarded
if you know they regarded a military
isn't a lie in the struggle against
kinvara military was willing to give him
but not when you look down and sooner or
later happened there
there are other serious from
would like to run an election in which
the only participant effective
40
want to make sure
South Africa getting rid of you look at
how that is pretty well the United
States and Britain we're supporting the
apartment
change super temple
was considered by the United States and
Britain would be one of the more
notorious terrorist Nelson Mandela gist
but around nineteen ninety the US and
Britain decided to let
Western corporations also wanted South
African white business community decided
it's not a riddle what they wanted to do
was
in place but would work
and that's pretty much what the old
transmission place for the majority of
as bad or worse never
but
well
our just
Plus
justice what are some of your
suggestions to give me suggestions to
improve the United Nations some of the
United Nations of improved the United
Nations the United Nations yes in risk
in life response to crisis best way to
improve the United Nations
would be for the United States and stop
destroying I'm into the United States
stop undermining it every time it gets
in the way the United Nations
ambassadorship
testified
but nevertheless the windows
the man pediment who is doing his work
the you know primarily the United States
Britain France unless it keeps to their
the United States extreme
in the United States 14 when if they
were implemented that would improve the
situation so the population is quite
supportive consider our people in the
u.s. think the UN want to take the lead
the United States
crazy and think that the US or followed
aluminum dirt majority think we would
give up
but these policies are so remote they
need concessions but if policy moved in
that direction
yes who is next musically we saw the
capital punishment in 34 states in the
u.s. we still capital punishment in 34
states in the u.s. how do you feel about
the death penalty especially after like
the troy davis case there are other
countries that have the death penalty of
honeymoon sort of like to think
ourselves and be my very idea of
atrocity i'm the state should not
that's just the beginning it's not just
the death penalty the incarceration
and it's a recently passed a bill said
the night
the United States was pretty much like
a little bit towards beginning around 19
p incarceration level started an
increase but now it's about 10 times
and if you look at what's driving it
it's mostly large
this growth and the victimless crimes
on the street for joining furthermore it
so it's extremely racist the people who
get you know send white businessman
sorry
his butt and then it gets very punitive
three strikes you're out and stay on the
reservation system
is not it doesn't try to rehabilitate it
just creates
system design essentially get rid of the
superfluous population
very close race class correlation in the
United States and starting in the 1970s
think Carmen changed dramatic change the
financialization and offshoring less and
less production
need for production workers meaning less
less need for working-class people and
of course the first to get
the last to come in
they get rid of so we can rid of them by
this completion farcical
throw but is technique getting rid of
prison industrial complex the buildin
jail private
and in rural areas
in rural areas
it's the area's gauge it
nose
what's happening
said well they're going to
New York so your social policy
gender filey poor areas new
worst aspect is introducing some
striking cases it's probably yes but in
this is pretty savage
should be proud of the fact that we're
so how do you convince the government
united state government to eva is all
fade voices right we understand that
here there are many problems right the
government is abstract of the u.s. is
obstructed government is obstructed too
many like what we're doing gross
injustice who eats own people but how do
you convince that the government of the
tradition corporations ready elias to
change their course of action to change
to give up their policy is there a very
anybody back work and you change the
Gyptian military
changes in the Chinese Communist Party
and convinced
but again in Egypt right there the mass
population post posting the water and
then again it's like me right back how
to give up but again it came back right
how do you use please see in any near
future that is you know like
marginalized math marginalized right
mass population nor Kelly at Marseilles
bullet area right rising up and the
changing the structure not only in one
geographic area but twelve acquire we
have no food that's why we are not Kings
princes slavery so none of these things
from us kids under one by strong and in
fact just
last generation
brothers and we saw how this college is
like
to go to say my university
fifty years ago when I got there if you
walk down the walls what
oh wait males that will dress
differential
walk down those days half women but a
third minorities in formal dress which
reflects in relation
people
just
always
slavery didn't end because
the slave owners
yes if you were President Obama how do
you try to from the Congress and what do
you think about them what they're doing
about you know try to solve this crisis
and also what you thing about the Occupy
Wall Street good answer we should spend
develop the kind of change
Bartra it's not as hard as like you're
not gonna have the army
did
yes
there are things that Obama certain has
constraints but there are things could
have done it Carrie yet any principles
there would have been substantial
possibilities so for example paper right
now the story it would be perfectly
possible for a president to do say with
did a large majority population quite a
large majority thinks way to do personal
things and devastated and much more
problem this job's neuro problem so the
president could say okay
new the population to force through the
things that you think are important
happen to be correct the corporations
would like
the same is true one safe healthcare
pretty large majorities have to favor
when even when it came down to the
public option but about Serena to
population
favorite moments gameplay the gifts to
the pharmaceutical corporations the US
and having laws that are the government
from negotiated for crisis about 85 10
population against that Obama gave it
away political figure who had some
principles could have said
stand up for the principles mobilized
population fight for the negative one
now there it's not too dark on the
obstacle
these legislation about obstacles but
they're not they're not kind of grateful
stone and this is a pretty free country
so you are pretty free from
so I put it
this
I thought well in my head for most of
this semester it kind of goes to what
we're talking about just before the
health care about a couple of things fun
taking a class right now propaganda
public opinion / memory but your focus
there seems to be this underlying tone
right now in a lot of the Republican
debates and things like that that if
people are willing to subjugate
themselves to the Wills of the market
that will all end up better again and I
think economic theory is pretty
classically shown that that's just not
the case you can comment maybe on why
this theory has kind of come around that
segregated pupils of markets instead of
markets that people will remember
the United States of a semi
most of that stuff state section it's in
the state sector
researchers
to pretend everybody now workers Steve
Jobs basically the skill that taking
workmen
stay and turning it into thin chickens
LOL mark
but it's certainly not on Marcus's and
there were not market pressures
initiative consumer choice
there's one part of the economy that is
it does run pretty much by market brazil
since 40 90 d best
once the fuel regulations were dissolved
then it became pretty much a market
system so it crashes every two years and
every time the first crash was earlier
82 more crashes during the Reagan
fresh in
and massively and of course that this
predictable looking at the way markets
work after Ohio markets work suppose I
go into place it is a deal between me
and the guy selling the car and if we're
paying attention we work out that deal
so that works out okay for us but
there's something we don't pay attention
as an angel externalities
now externalities but the effect on
others so if i buy a car in the favorite
place I don't take on you
this congestion the price of gas is a
Sean on at reach individual may be small
and you don't count it now in the case
of financial institutions the thing that
is not paid attention to what's called
systemic risk so if Goldman Sachs and
again another secret
if Goldman Sachs makes a risky
investment meaning they had a lot of
profit from if they're paying attention
they insure themselves against lightly
laws but they don't insure the system
against collapsing that's called
systemic risk and it happens over and
over so the risks the collapses are
going to build into the system however
since you know since number of people
were talking about markets they don't
follow this to its conclusion they
believed in markets both the statics
JPMorgan Chase Citigroup the bank of
america movil bankers because when they
crash and a capitalist system
street sweeper that's not what happened
they go on the nanny state has to do
with systems that are run by a private
power how do you think that people
admitted that once these leaks and how
you pisa leaks and power managed to
convince the population so totally that
these things are in our best interest on
we can see directly salida shot
and this population dunno very clear
picture this in effect the popular
attitudes by now it's so confused just
giving any sense of it so it takes a fun
public attitudes very careful study in
the United States one of the main topics
political sciences it's done well the if
you take a look at public opinion
studies are statements instead of
particular segments of the population
and it's a museum so if you study people
would say Tea Party sympathizers get the
government off my back
and you ask them what they think about
particular issues turns out they're
mostly Social Democratic so they think
there should be more spending on health
more on education that moron assistance
to mothers and children and so on but
not welfare you can't have money from
welfare because reagan succeeded in
demonizing welfare welfare means that
rich black women
so we want and children envelope and
it's the same on issue after issue the
additives totally
so there's slogans that you're supposed
to believe
don't believe any
issue and that's a good situation in
which
of your fantasy let's get beautiful
thank you much tells me that I think the
decision
