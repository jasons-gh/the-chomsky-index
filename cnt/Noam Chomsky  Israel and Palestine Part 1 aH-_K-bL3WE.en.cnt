well I would I was saying that I'll
start with a couple of general comments
on the topic and then we throw it open
to discussion it's a quite usual these
days to draw analogies between South
Africa and and Israel most of them I
think are questionable at best but
there's one that isn't discussed much if
at all that is actually quite valid I
think one analogy that has to do with
the topic with a matter of what's
nowadays called legitimation and D
legitimation that was an issue for South
Africa for about the last 40 years of
the white nationalist regime back in
1958 the South African the foreign
minister called in the US ambassador to
talk to him and said we know that we
were becoming a kind of an international
pariah everyone's voting against us in
the United Nations we are right but they
don't understand it but that doesn't
really matter because you and I both
understand that there's only one vote at
the United Nations namely yours and as
long as you the United States back us up
we don't really care what the world
thinks and the so matters in fact
proceeded through the by the 1970s the
United Nations had did declare an arms
embargo on South Africa South Africa by
that point was reacted by becoming
extremely aggressive and contemptuous
towards the international community and
in fact even the United States President
Carter at that time so for example when
the President Carter and a group of
international diplomats were about to
present a plan 24 atmos African
withdrawal from Namibia UN Protectorate
which they were occupying sending in a
population and so on in violation of UN
orders just at that point in South
Africa attacked a refugee camp in Angola
causing a refugee camp killing eight
hundred people there causing
international outcry but they basically
didn't care well fortunately for them
ronald reagan came along and he strongly
supported the apartheid regime and
continued to support it right through
the 1980s that included its aggression
and violence in neighboring countries
which was quite lethal killing over a
million people plus what was going on
within South Africa but but they spot us
supported it in fact US trade with South
Africa increased that was in violation
even of congressional sanctions by that
time and the justification for it was
the war on terror the war on terror was
not declared by george w bush contrary
to what's claimed here ed cleared it it
was declared by ronald reagan when he
came into office 1981 announcing that
international terrorism plague of the
modern age would be
focus of the u.s. foreign policy so in
the case of South Africa the
justification was you to defend the
white nationalist regime against the
terrorism of the African National
Congress in fact in 1988 the u.s.
designated this is Mandela's and see
that he was of course in prison
designated the u.s. designated the ad C
is one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world in fact Mandela it
was just taken off the terrorist list
about two years ago he can now come to
the United States without a special
dispensation the then the US policy
changed around 1989 1990 the US policy
shifted and within two or three years
the white nationalist regime had
collapsed and apart height was over this
is not the only time that's happened and
so it was not the only factor another
major factor was Cuban the qubu which
has a played an enormous role in the
liberation of black Africa this sort of
well known by now to scholarship but not
to the general public they essentially
drove South Africans out of Namibia and
as they had drew amount of Angola and
that was a big factor but the main a
change was just that the US policy
shifted and exactly as the South African
foreign minister had said four years
earlier when the u.s. changed policy
other regime collapsed as I say there
are other cases well the problem for
South Africa was its d legitimation in
the international community sustained by
us port so it didn't matter until you
escort was withdrawn and the
legitimation of its main enemy the
African National Congress which by the
late eighties was at an enormous
international support and it was kind of
a secular st. I know the you that that's
those of you follow Israeli Affairs know
that that's pretty much what they're
discussing now with great concern
there's concern that the country is
being that D legitimated in the
international arena and at the same time
it's the Palestinian the Palestinians
are being legitimated it's a situation
and they have one Supporter the United
States alone in fact that has known for
a long time you probably know that a
couple of months ago in February there
was a Security Council resolution
calling on Israel to pursue what in fact
is official US policy namely to stop
settlement expansion it was vetoed by
the united states alone that aroused
some attention but it really shouldn't
have because the US have been vetoing
resolutions condemning Israel's actions
for a long time the first one was in
january nineteen seventy six thirty five
years ago when the major Arab states
brought to the Security Council a
resolution calling for a a two-state
settlement Israel and a Palestinian
state on the international border so old
green line with and then it took up the
wording of you n 2 42 which everyone
is to be the main the main diplomatic
instrument so there would have to be it
added the guarantees for the security of
every state in the region and it's right
to exist within secure and recognized
borders that's that's 1976 the US Vita
again in 1980 will run through the rest
of the record but until the present
that's in the pattern things moved out
of the Security Council because I was
excluded by the US veto but the General
Assembly almost every year was hadn't
regular votes with a 150 22 or something
like that and that continues up to the
present well this is continuing there
will be another important vote very
likely in the coming session of the
General Assembly next starting next
September as a winter meeting what's
coming up and then is palaces
recognition of Palestinian statehood the
by now well over 100 countries recognize
Palestine that's about something like
eighty to ninety percent of the world's
population I in contrast Kosovo which is
now accept that as in the United Nations
is supported by a tiny fraction of that
but the crucial difference is the u.s.
does not join me eighty to ninety
percent recognizing Palestine and the US
that does recognize Kosovo so that's
basically the South African the
ministers an insight into how world
affairs works and he's correct but
anyway this is going to come up it's
very likely going to come up in
September and it'll pose another dilemma
from the United States will it stand
virtually alone
in the international system in blocking
the kind of settlement for which there
is simply an overwhelming international
consensus hard to find anything like
this in world affairs but for years
there's been an overwhelming agreement
on approximately the January 1976
Security Council proposal at the US v 2
by now it includes essentially everybody
at least formally that all the
non-aligned countries europe latin
america the arab league as an even more
forthcoming proposal the Organization of
Islamic states which includes Iran in
fact essentially everyone the only
holdouts are the United States and
Israel and the South African ministers
principle still applies there's only one
vote that's the United States the
consequence of having overwhelming power
so the word hope can say what it wants
but if the United States subjects nobody
do anything about it well that's the and
that of course shapes commentary and
discussion and so on at least in the
United States this some extent elsewhere
lesser looks net well that's basically
the situation and it's at its if as far
as Israel's if the legitimation is
concerned they're getting much more
concerned so for example Human Rights
Watch which is a very conservative
organization they don't take strong
positions on policy they recently came
out with a declaration which I don't
think was even reported here this agency
which called on the United States to
terminate aid to Israel ne8 Israel up to
the level of what
spins in the occupied territories
because as they point out correctly all
of that is in violation of international
law they also call on the United States
government to investigate foundations
organizations others in the united
states which have a tax-free status and
are giving aid to anything in israel
that involves discrimination and
repression so that would include
everything in the occupied territories
plus more that cuts quite a while wide
swath if you look at it they also called
upon europe and of course the united
states as well boycott goods from the
settlements and to refuse in any way to
participate in activities in sporting
israeli activities in the occupied
territories now all of which are illegal
i mean that's not been in question for
years it was actually was recognized by
the government of israel back in 1967
any transfer population into the
occupied territories is in violation of
the Geneva Conventions core of
international humanitarian law as I say
that was recognized by Israel's top
legal authorities back in nineteen sixty
seven including the Attorney General
including the official in charge of the
occupied territories general Moshe
Taeyang who simply pointed out sure it's
illegal that states violated
international law and so we will too and
they can as long as the big boys in
Washington support them basically the
South African principal and so it
continues to the present most recently
the februari 2011's curie council
resolution I call that of which the core
was supporting official US policy that
is calling for an end to settlement
expansion
but the u.s. vetoed it in a court with
the traditional pattern see what happens
this September but it could be quite
significant Amnesty International also
which also very rarely takes strong
positions on policy issues had already
called for a an arms embargo on Israel
directed to the United States because
it's this is the time the Gaza invasion
because Israel was using the arms and
violation of international law they
could have but didn't add that the arms
that the United States is sending to
Israel are also used in violation of US
domestic law which conditions arms
transfers on are very specifically on
particular uses only the defense and
internal security and of course anything
the Gaza war was obviously not that and
where is it nor any of you serials
actions and in the occupied territories
well Israel's reacting to all of this
and pretty much the way south africa did
a lot of history and a lot of anger
circling the wagons and carrying out
actions very brutal and arrogant actions
which are almost as long as if they're
being carried out in purposeful defiance
and contempt of international opinion
like the gaza attack where they attack
on the flotilla last May which Israeli
commandos landed on a ship in
international waters that was trying to
bring humanitarian aid to Gaza and
killed nine people including an American
citizen which both
actions caused an international furor
but again the one vote that matters
didn't go along with the international
opinion so they think they can get away
with it and in fact they're kind of you
read is really press they're quite
surprised that there is any
international reaction because they're
so obviously right and everything they
do just like South Africa since they're
obviously right it must be that the
world is worlds therefore wrong and
there has to be some explanation
anti-semitism or whatever it might be
and the internal reactions in Israel are
kind of like South Africa to imposing
pretty harsh legislation somewhat so
pretty extreme so much so that the head
of the Israeli Bar Association Shlomo
Cohen a pretty conservative figure
recently had an article lamenting what
he called Israel's drift to fascism he's
pretty strong word and he ran through
the legislation that brought that to
that led him to that conclusion well
these are it's not unfamiliar in many
respects it is reliving the pattern of
the South Africa particularly reaction
to the D legitimation that they
perceived in the sanctions movement the
boycotts other protests and
correspondingly the legitimation of
their enemy which will come to a head
Justin in just a few months in the case
of Israel Palestine which will be a
sensitive an interesting moment well
what are the options given these
circumstances one option is that the US
and
and will shift policy as it did in the
case of South Africa and decide to join
the world that is to join into the
long-standing quite overwhelming
international consensus and accept the
two-state settlement the general form of
that settlement is pretty well known and
you can argue about details but there
are basic guidelines are quite clear and
in fact it actually came quite close to
realization once there hasn't been one
month in the last 35 years when a u.s.
president was willing to tolerate a
settlement in terms of the international
consensus that was Bill Clinton's last
month in office in January 2001 the
Clinton there had been negotiations at
the summer before at Camp David and they
broke down on Clinton recognized that
the position that the US and Israel had
proposed there could not be accepted by
any Palestinians no matter how modern so
in December to that of 2000 the Clinton
proposed what he called his parameters
the general guidelines for settlement
which were somewhat vague but more
forthcoming he then made a speech in
which he said that both sides had
accepted the parameters both sides had
reservations the two sides
israel-palestine met in tapa Egypt in
january two thousand one we have no very
detailed record of that of those
negotiations there was internet
observers detailed israeli sources and
so on and they came pretty close to a
settlement close enough so that in their
last press conference the jointly the
group said that if they had a little
more time they could have sold
everything all the details well Israel
called off the negotiations prematurely
and it didn't continue now there were
informal high-level negotiations that
did continue came out with proposals and
won the best known one is called the
Geneva a chorus was presented in Geneva
and december 2003 by the two sides it
was welcomed by the world europeans sent
envoys and so on Israel rejected at the
US didn't even refused even to comment
on it barely mentioned here in the press
but it would that was an extremely
detailed proposal you can think it was
right or wrong can argue about it but
the facts are was very close to the
international consensus that has been
accepted for a long time and that
happens to be exactly in a court with
international law it's been reiterated
over and over most recently
authoritative ly by the International
Court of Justice with the US Justice
agreeing separate declaration a couple
of years ago up 2004 well that's one
option one possibility is the US will
make the same kind of move that it
finally made in the case of South Africa
and then would come the task of
implementing it but it's really not a
big problem once the u.s. agrees it can
be done that's one option now most of
the discussion of this topic assumes
that there's a choice between two
options one the one I just described and
another that Israel takes over the whole
territory and then the Palestinians
carry out a civil rights struggle
internal to
the dow unified israel-palestine on the
an attic part I'd struggle so that's
let's consider the other option you look
at most of the debate about the topic
that's what it is Israel in Israel its
objected that this would create what
they call a demographic problem meaning
too many non-jews and a Jewish state so
that will be a problem but and the many
Palestinians are supporting it they say
this is the way to go to state
settlement is out so we'll have a
one-state settlement at which will have
an anti-apartheid struggle there's only
one problem with this it's on this
discussion it's omitting the third
option the realistic option Israel will
never agree to this nor is there any
reason to expect them to what they'll do
is the third option namely continue
doing exactly what they're doing and if
they have us support they can continue
to do it and we know what that is
because it's happening under our eyes
and it's begun been going on for years
since the early 90s of the US and Israel
and just about everything Israel does
should be called the u.s. Israel because
they work in tandem and Israel cannot go
beyond what the US will support it
little support and permit it to do so
there's the US and Israel since the
early 90s have been committed to
separating Gaza from the West Bank in
strict violation of the Oslo agreements
which declared them to be a territorial
unity that's been done in many ways
closures and so on and so forth my now
they're pretty separate so if a person
in the Gaza say as a young person in
Gaza wants to study in West Bank
University can't do it if
in Gaza needs medical attention that
they could get into Jerusalem hospital
can't go somebody wants to see their
family you know not very many miles away
they can't do it so by now they're
pretty well split that's one element the
second with regard to the west bank is
to take over Israel the US and Israel
want to take over essentially what's
valuable in the West Bank and to let the
rest kind of right and we know exactly
what it is because you can see it
happening and in fact it's the plans or
develop I've been developing step by
step over the past 20 years sometimes
it's called the shore on plan sometimes
something else but it's always
essentially the same Israel takes over
everything that's inside what's called
the separation it's actually an
annexation wall to wall which snakes
through the West Bank that leaves on the
Israeli side powerful and major water
resources that Pleasant suburbs of the
major cities what tel Aviv and Jerusalem
pics over the Jordan Valley which
essentially imprisons the rest and then
cuts cars through the remaining area one
east of jerusalem and i should say
jerusalem is now about five times where
with the size of what it was in 1967 and
xt illegally in violation of security
council orders so huge greater Jerusalem
then card are extending to the east
which pretty much bisects the West Bank
that's what it was built for and two
other corridors in the north which you
know separate the rest and what's left
that amounts to roughly fifty percent of
the West Bank and forty-two percent at
the moment
expand the rest that in if Israel just
takes that over there's no demographic
problem because that region has kept
free of Arabs virtually I'm this total
scattered Arab settlements but
essentially free of errands so no
demographic problem Israel gets the
valuable territory the valuable land
whatever it likes and the Palestinians
are left in unviable Canton's very much
separated from one another that's the
option that's the alternative to having
a two-state settlement now notice I say
settlement not solution I don't think to
state settlement is is or should be the
end of the road there it could lay the
basis for what seemed to me better
settlements but you have to get there in
stages can't just you know say I want
the world to be the way I you know I
want the world to be the way I like it
that doesn't work you have to show how
you get there and there's their possible
ways to get there but I have heard
nothing but then he has any option but
this one so those are the realistic
options well they depend crucially on
the u.s. position the will the u.s. join
the world on this issue or wanted the
say this goes far back goes back to the
1970s there are many factors that keep
the United States separate from world
opinion just as there were in the case
of South Africa many other issues but we
might as well face the reality that's
the structure of World Order the United
States is an outlier and it's so
powerful but it gets its way but it gets
its way in violation of global opinion
on many many issues that relates
say one word about this to another major
phenomenon that you're all familiar with
major events that have been taking place
in the past few months the so-called
Arab Spring the democracy uprisings in
the Arab world now these didn't come out
of nowhere the background is not
discussed much but it's pretty easy to
find out so take say each of the most
important country you know the biggest
most significant and so on the uprising
the Jensen january twenty fifth movement
is called the-- was led by a group of
initiated by a group of fairly young
kind of tech-savvy professionals pretty
much who called themselves the April
sixth movement why April sixth because
on april six 2008 there was a major
labor action organized by what has been
quite a militant labor movement at the
Maha textile conglomerate one of these
industrial conglomerates in Egypt they
were going to have a labor action
calling for you know minimally decent
working conditions of wages and so on
and along with it were to be solidarity
actions in the cities well I was crushed
by force crushed by the us-backed
dictator Navarro so therefore we don't
know about it but they know that the
victims tend to have memories and that
was reflected when the popular movement
burst out again a few months ago led by
the April sixth movement the same is
true in Tunisia and the other places
where things are happening in any event
in the past couple of months has been
quite spectacular they've been major
developments in the Arab world there are
moves towards
there are efforts to try to construct
some kind of but to overthrow the rule
repressive regimes and to bring about
some sort of degree of freedom and
democracy and if you look closely you'll
find that the u.s. is pretty isolated on
this to an extent along with Western
Europe there happens if you have a very
good reason why the United States and
its allies cannot tolerate the democracy
in the Arab countries very simple reason
do you want to figure out why just take
a look at the poles of our public
opinion now they don't get reported in
the press here but they're known and
surely planners known there the polls
are taken by the most prestigious us
polling organizations they're released
by major institutions brooking
institutions so on so they're perfectly
public and certainly in the eyes of
planners are thinking about them and
what do you find when you look at them
well they take Egypt again the most
important country in Egypt ninety
percent of the public thinks they're the
worst threat they face is the United
States and Israel which they don't
distinguish much from the United States
rightly about eighty percent think the
region would be better off and more
secure if he ran had nuclear weapons a
small percentage roughly ten percent in
the region think that Iran is a thread
these figures extend you know little
variation over the almost the entire
region well if you've anything like a
functioning democracy then public
opinion is going to reflect it it's
going to be reflected in policy that's
what democracy is supposed to be so the
idea that there could be a democratic
uprising in the Arab world is just a
nightmare for
planners and they will do whatever they
can to prevent it and if you look
closely that's pretty much what's
happening well it's also a nightmare for
Israel Israel has relied on the Arab
dictators to suppress their populations
and to enter into arrangements with it
and if there's if public opinion that
manifests itself in policy that's going
to that's going to be a huge problem and
they know it that's why they're so
strongly opposed to the democratic
uprising and the same is true here
though it's not put that way well that's
going to have an effect to you know so
far the uprisings have been fairly well
controlled they've changed the names but
not really the regime's so say in Egypt
the military still runs the show but
that probably you can't keep the lid on
that forever this has been going on for
a long time we don't read about it but
but certainly planners know it so again
go back about fifty years and President
Eisenhower late 50s was discussed in
internal discussions so it's been
declassified for years it's public he
discussed with with his staff what he
called a campaign of hatred against us
in the Arab world and not from the
government's they're more or less okay
but from the people and a at that time
the National Security Council which is
the main planning body that came out
with a memorandum discussing the Arab
world and explained it I said there's a
perception in the Arab world that the
United States supports the harsh brutal
dictators and prevents democracy and
development and that we do this because
we want to make sure we maintain control
over their energy resources and I went
on to say that the perception is more or
less accurate and furthermore that's
pretty much what we should be doing and
so it continues right to the present but
again chance that you can keep the lid
on this forever are not very high so the
explosion might get out of control and
that is certain to influence other
developments in the region in quite
unpredictable writ ways will all stop
this just mention that the crucial issue
that we should bear in mind i think is
that contrary to almost all media other
commentary on this matter the framework
is not one in which say in israel
palestine the united states is an honest
broker that trying to bring about
negotiations between two recalcitrant
difficult parties Israel the
Palestinians that's simply not true if
there were serious negotiations going on
they would be run by some pathetically
neutral party and the US and Israel
would be on one side and the rest of the
world would be on the other side and
that's the way they would have been
going on for 35 years well until we
realize that and until we do something
about it this region is going to
continue to face extremely dangerous
times and very explosive ones which may
blow up all over the world only do you
in for I don't fly solo from Gaza as a
resolution over Gaza will Israel accept
this resolution or what I just
continuous is doing capital health I
zone over Gaza because the ruler of the
world doesn't permit it okay just like
there's no interference when the US
invades Iraq look that's the way the
world works it doesn't work the way
you're taught in civics classes the
world is ruled by force not by law and
force happens to be overwhelmingly in
one place not entirely of course and so
there can be you know if if the US is
participating in an invasion as it was
in the case of Gaza the Gaza invasion is
a u.s. Israeli invasion that's why I'm a
Steeler national call for embargo it's
American Arms they're using the American
diplomatic support and so on so if the
u.s. is participating in an act of
aggression can't have any interference
so sure they won't it won't even get to
the point where it could be considered
I mean that doesn't have to happen these
things happen because the American
population permits it really only ones
who can stop it said what percentage of
military stay throughout the world is
spent here in the United States close to
fifty percent a little below fifty
percent of course that depends somewhat
on how you count it so if you count the
spending for past Wars you know for
veterans for interest on the debt and so
on then it goes up and even beyond that
but the standard calculations the US
military spending is close to fifty
percent of global zman's and of course
it's quite totally different in
character so this is far more advanced
in technological development and means
of destruction you can see that in Libya
I mean the United States was kind of
reluctant to get involved in Libya
France and Britain were in the forefront
but they couldn't even impose a no-fly
zone without calling on the United
States to do the heavy lifting in the
first couple of days was all US
tomahawks and warthogs and so on the
u.s. is so far in ahead of the rest of
the world and military expenditures that
it's laughable like the Pentagon comes
out with statements warning about say
the Chinese military buildup you know
the next biggest power in the world
turns out according to the Pentagon
calculations is by memory
and I would exact that the Chinese
military budget is roughly I think they
said a fifth of what the United States
spends in Iraq and Afghanistan which is
a fraction of the military budget in
fact it's actually less than the US
military spends on research and
development I think that was their
conclusion also it's not just advanced
technology advanced killing techniques
and so on that's many other things I
mean is there any other country in the
world that has eight hundred military
bases all over the world where the
troops are and supplies and so on are
ready for use and are used it's unique
also the u.s. despite the what we're
doing to our own country I'm in the
country's being internally crushed that
was astonishing ways but despite that is
still richest advantages that may not be
true for long if current policies
continue here domestic policies options
proceed so theoretically America ditches
policy
so what are the real irritants do is
repair public opinion is us support for
Israel it's not the only one I think the
National Security Council was basically
correct back in the 50s and since that
the main issue is that the United States
supports harsh brutal dictatorships
blocks democracy and development and so
because that's the best way to keep
control of their energy supplies that's
you know that's been the major issue
there are others like for example there
are fairly not regular but there often
are public opinion studies and so for
example right after the it was
interesting when right after nine eleven
The Wall Street Journal to its credit
did a study of public opinion in the
Arab world about attitudes toward the
United States they just kept to the kind
of people they were interested in the
bankers professionals but they called
money and Muslims and care about that
what's called the Arab Street just the
rich guts the guys who were all involved
in the u.s. western international
development programs and so on do
liberal programs they just dissed idea
among men well it turned out to be very
much like the conclusions in 1958 strong
opposition to the United States because
of its support of harsh dictatorships
it's blocking democracy and development
and efforts just control the energy
system they had other concerns by then
one concern was is it was support for is
really
occupation and oppression the other
concern which strikingly never really
hit the radar in the United States they
did over the Arab world was the Iraq
sanctions the sanctions Clinton
sanctions on Iraq a man killed that
killed hundreds of thousands of people
that may be a minyan they strengthened
the dictatorship they crushed the
population and they probably provement
prevented this that I'm saying from
going the way of other dictators that
the u.s. was 40 by in turn over goal and
there was an enormous bitterness about
that over the whole hour now these are
these are major crimes so there are
specific ones but I think the basic one
is it remains the what the National
Security Council said actually that's
responsible for the fact that the United
States and Britain incidentally also
have fairly consistently supported the
radical Islamism in opposition to
secular nationalism you can see it right
now the main ally of the united states
in the region is saudi arabia which is
the most extreme radical Islamic state
anywhere also this main supporter of
jihadism and funder of Judaism and the
ideological center of it that's been the
main beneficiary of us and british
support for a long time because it's the
right kind of dictatorship it keeps the
population under control for example
that was an effort in saudi arabia to
have a day of protest you know friday
day of protest like everywhere else
