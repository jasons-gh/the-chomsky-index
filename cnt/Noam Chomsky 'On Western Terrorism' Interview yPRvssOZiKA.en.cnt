Brian Lehrer WNYC and with me now is
linguist activist and political
commentator Noam Chomsky professor
emeritus at MIT at age 84 he is one of
the most cited scholars of his lifetime
in the field of linguistics and one of
the most influential commentators on the
political left the title of his new book
exemplifies why he is such a giant to
his fans and so reviled by his
detractors it's called on Western
terrorism from Hiroshima to drone
warfare the book is a collection of
conversations between Chomsky and writer
filmmaker on travel Chuck will talk to
Noam Chomsky now about the book get his
take on the serious situation and talk
about his life in times generally
including in a little while your calls
dr. Chomsky thank you for doing this
welcome back to WNYC glad to be with you
your book is called on Western terrorism
what's your definition of terrorism I
began writing about terrorism
extensively in the early 1980s as did
many others that was the impetus was
ronald reagan's declaration of a war on
terror has came into office announcing
that the focus of u.s. foreign policy
would be on state-directed international
terrorism called the plague of the
modern age returned to barbarism in our
time and so on I so I started writing
about at the time and what I used is of
the official definitions the u.s. code
army manuals British law later UN
declarations I think those are quite
adequate definitions of terrorism so we
usually think of terrorism as political
violence against civilians to terrorize
a population into some kind of action do
you go with that basically yeah that's a
pretty good definition and the sub
includes also scratch
use of violent and the subtitle of the
book is from Hiroshima to drones
coincidentally we were talking about the
history of weapons of war that people
want to try to ban as weapons instead of
warfare itself earlier in the program
and Hiroshima nuclear weapons came up
but so Hiroshima in your title because
the bomb was dropped on a largely
civilian target in part and because it
was also the
do be a strategic reasons incidentally
the Hiroshima bombing was not the worst
of the urban bombings the Tokyo bombing
a couple of months earlier was probably
more devastating try it was an effort to
turn Tokyo into a just a kind of a
firestorm wooden buildings that could
that was the goal and it was achieved
yes which also came up in the prior
discussion but by conventional means
conventional so cold I mean that it's a
defenseless City attacked by lethal
weapons that are designed to create a
firestorm that if you want to call that
conventional okay the Potsdam
Declaration which was the ultimatum to
Japan from the Allies before the bombing
was to surrender or experience quote the
utter devastation of the Japanese
homeland which makes it sound like a
threat to civilians oh yes definitely
and incidentally it wasn't really
intended so the agreement that was made
finally the surrender terms did include
maintaining the imperial system which
was not offered at Potsdam but if it had
been it's possible that a surrender
would have just taken place and
certainly by now we know a lot more
about the end of the war than was known
earlier there's been extensive research
the most significant recently by
Hasegawa japanese scholar who's the
first person to have
the unlimited pretty unlimited access to
Japanese archives
I think it's called racing the enemy
it's kind of the gold standard no he he
argues quite convincingly I think that
what ended the war was the Russian
invasion of Manchuria the Japanese
generals were holding out even after the
hiroshima bomb hoping that the Russians
would not enter and that there could be
some kind of some kind of negotiation
which would preserve the imperial system
and preserve their essential structure
but as soon as the Russians had entered
the war they knew it was over

the stations of New York and New Jersey
Public Radio I'm Brian Lehrer with the
linguist and political activist and
commentator Noam Chomsky his latest book
is called
on Western terrorism from Hiroshima to
draw drone warfare the chapter in your
book on the Arab Spring begins with the
British pioneering of the use of
aircraft against villagers and Winston
Churchill endorsing the use of poison
gas in Iraq in 1920 and saying gas had
become part of the permanent arsenal
after World War 1 what was the context
of that as you see history the British
were after the Second World War in the
First World War the British and the
French mainly who were the main imperial
power at the time were carving up the
former Ottoman Empire and the British
and drawing the lines which would
satisfy their needs had nothing do with
the needs of the inhabitants and part of
it was a British creation of the borders
of the modern Iraq
they designed the Iraq carving it out of
the former Ottoman Empire so that the
British would have control of the
Kurdish areas in the north where there
were oil reserves they didn't want this
to go to Turkey they wanted them for
themselves and they patched together a
system of Kurds and Sunni Shiites and
ensured that Iraq would not have easy
independent access to the sea to the
outside world by imposing a principality
of queit British principality
british-run principality not independent
and that if you look at the geography
that kind of barred Iraq from the easy
access to the Persian Gulf
those were the borders but the Iraqis
didn't accept that the people of Iraq
didn't accept that they resisted and the
British carried out a pretty brutal
counterinsurgency campaign to suppress
the resistance and part of it was the
first extensive use of aircraft bombing
against civilian targets villages and so
on that was it had been used before the
British use the Italians had used it a
bit in Libya in their murderous
campaigns but the British really carried
it forward to a new tactic and the
British among other things tried to and
succeeded in borrowing international
agreements that would ban the use of
aircraft against civilians and this was
greeted with considerable acclaim by
leading British statesmen so for example
Lloyd George famous British statesman if
you look at his Diaries after the one
the it was a 1932 Convention which was
attempting to ban
air attacks against civilians the
British succeeded and Bob barring it and
Lloyd George writes with a claim that is
I'm quoting him we have to reserve the
right to bomb niggers so therefore we
have to ensure that we can that there's
no barrier to this bombing of niggers
when we feel like it that was the
standard Imperial attitude at the time
it is shocking that he would have said
that I read that quote in your book he
was British did he mean that word in the
sense that it was used in American waste
relations a nigger was just a general
term for any person of what we now call
the third world on people as George or
will to borrow his term not really
people there what we can do to them what
we want Ellen in Montvale was calling in
with a question about the line between
terrorism as we define it and military
action Allen you're on WNYC with Noam
Chomsky hello hi um yeah I guess I feel
like the the definition of terrorism
that's being discussed is kind of like
an on definition or at least an on
distinction because even in large scale
military compact big country against big
country there's always the real threat
there's a threat against a civilian
population either it's going to be
collateral damage from conventional
warfare or the implied threat is after
we want enemy destroys an army the
implied threat is will do as we wish and
impose what we want on an opposing
civilian population so I'm not really
seeing the distinction there maybe your
guest can comment on that
thank you yeah well the you're perfectly
right the distinction the terms are not
precise but the terms of political
discourse are not precise altogether in
fact outside of mathematics and part of
physics terms are not really precisely
defined even in the history of
mathematics they weren't defined until
fairly recently so these terms are loose
as you say but that nevertheless they're
useful there's a difference between
terrorism and aggression and under the
a degree of aggression sometimes there
are actions that should count as
terrorism namely those directed as aimed
at intimidating and terrifying and
controlling civilian populations by
violence or the threat of violence
that's a tactic that can be used within
aggression but aggression is worse than
terrorism aggression is the dispatch of
armed forces to the territory of another
country without their request I mean
that's aggression it's pretty well
defined in international conventions and
the aggression is also defined and the
Nuremberg principles which are part of
the foundation of modern international
law under Nuremberg aggression is
described as I just defined
characterized it is identified as the
supreme international crime differing
from other war crimes in that it
encompasses all of the evil that follows
those are the principles under which the
Nazi war criminals were hanged and that
we ought to think about them so take say
the invasion of Iraq is a textbook case
of aggression no ambiguity about it u.s.
British aggression and it is the supreme
international crime it encompasses all
the evil that follows including for
example the sunni-shia
conflicts that were that had been
simmering but they were really elicited
by the aggression are now tearing the
region apart and it's variant that's
part of the that's part of the crime of
aggression that we carried out that's
interesting to see the way that's
discussed so for example a couple of
weeks ago David Brooks in The New York
Times had no
article in which he argued that the real
threat in the Middle East what we really
have to pay attention to is not just
hunger massacre and so on but the
spreading sunni-shia split which is
tearing the region apart and there's
some merit to that then he attributes
that to the withdrawal of US forces or
as he puts it the withdrawal of our
moderating influence that's turning
things on their head and I must
grotesque fashion it's the result of our
invasion not our moderating influence
and if we at least if we're willing to
take seriously the tribunals that hang
Nazi war criminals as we certainly
should we should ask ourselves what does
that mean for us but denies it but it to
relate it to the president I think the
context in which David Brooks wrote that
article in a situation like Syria where
the dictator with the army is seen as
responsible for most of the killing of a
hundred thousand people who at first
tried to rise up peacefully as in some
other Arab Spring countries there is a
liberal internationalist view that the
West or the US in particular has a
responsibility to intervene because no
other power can stop the slaughter do
you find that zero convincing well first
of all it's a separate point it was not
his point his point was that it was the
withdrawal of our moderating influence
that led to the sunni-shia conflict and
in fact it was the opposite it was our
carrying out the supreme international
crime that led to it turning to Syria
that's a separate question there is a
doctrine which of responsibility to
protect it's constantly cited it's been
you know we have articles about it in
the mainstream press academic journals
and so on it's important to look at it
because it's continually misrepresented
in Western discourse crucially
misrepresented
there is a doctrine of responsibility to
protect it was approved by the United
Nations General Assembly in 2005 and it
therefore stands as a respectable
principle of proper international
behavior now if you read that if you
read the General Assembly proposals
resolution what it says is first that
states have a responsibility to protect
their own citizens and if they fail to
do that the international community has
a responsibility to try to mitigate the
crime and to do so in accordance with
the United Nations Charter the
fundamental the basis of modern
international law the United Nations
Charter as this resolution repeats
allows intervention under two
circumstances one if it's authorized by
the Security Council of the United
Nations - if it's in self-defense
against armed attack until the in
Security Council has a chance to act
well the second is obviously irrelevant
here and the first isn't applicable
there's a second doctrine of
responsibility to protect which has no
status other than the fact that it's
accepted by the West as that's the
version that came out of a committee in
2001 run by Gareth Evans former prime
minister of Australia's usually called
the Evans Commission and that develops a
constant concept of responsibility to
protect which is the same as the one
later endorsed by the General Assembly
with one crucial exception and that's
crucial
the Evans Commission adds that if the
Security Council fails to act regional
organisations can carry out intervention
by force in the area of their
diction subsequent subject to subsequent
authorization by the Security Council
now there's only one regional
organization that can carry out such
actions that's NATO not for reasons of
law but for reasons of power so what the
Evans Commission is saying is
irrespective of international law NATO
has the right to intervene by force that
when it chooses in the area of its
jurisdiction which is worldwide well
that's a pretty crucial difference the
version of responsibility to protect
that's discussed in the West is the
Evans version that's not the one that
has any international legitimacy yes you
know my guest is dr. Noam Chomsky the
linguist activist and political
commentator professor emeritus at MIT at
age 84 one of the most cited scholars of
his lifetime in the field of linguistics
and one of the most influential
commentators on the political left we've
been talking about ideas in his new book
on Western terrorism from Hiroshima to
drone warfare when we continue in a
minute after the break we'll talk more
broadly about dr. Chomsky's life and
times and we can take your phone calls
for him to 1 2 4 3 3 WNYC for anything
that you want to ask Noam Chomsky 2 1 2
4 3 3 9 6 9 - stay tuned
right Lera WNYC my guest as linguist
activist and political commentator Noam
Chomsky and we'll go to your phone calls
in a few minutes our lines are full so
if you want to post a question you can
at WNYC or click on Brian Lehrer show
but we'll take a few minutes to talk to
dr. Chomsky more broadly about his life
and times now that we've talked about
his recent book dr. Chomsky the press
release for your book says your
political education began at a New York
City newsstand can you tell us where
that newsstand was and how your
political education began there yeah it
was 72nd and Broadway there's a subway
cask there and maybe the newsstand is
still there back in the 1930s when I was
growing up there were four newsstands
there one of them was run by not my
uncle he was disabled and other under
New Deal programs there were special
opportunities for people who were
disabled and he was able to run the
newsstand under that that this is 1930s
remember the peak of the depression he
was one of the very few members of the
family the extended family who actually
had a job so the his newsstand became
kind of a source of employment for other
family members who'd come in and help
when I was a kid I was visited I lived
in Philadelphia but I was visiting New
York I visited whenever I had a chance I
sometimes work at the newsstand my uncle
was a remarkable person he had Milton
Krauss was his name he had never gone
past fourth grade but he's one of the
most educated people I've ever met in my
life he had read everything he's he
actually ended up becoming a lay analyst
he was deeply versed in psychics like
the psychological and psychoanalytic
theory and
they'd been very involved in a wide
variety of political activism knew lots
about them had read about them world
literature world affairs and it was just
a kind of a joy to talk to and I'd
sometimes the newsstand actually
attracted Emma grace the people who had
emigrated from Germany mainly during the
Hitler period many of them you know
phd's doctors Khayat rest' and others
and there was they kind of congregated
around this but became a kind of an
intellectual center and it was
interesting to listen to the discussions
while handing out newspapers to people
rushing out of the subway station I'm
curious what was the selection of
reading materials at that newsstand more
politically diverse than what one might
find at 72nd and Broadway today well you
know everything was a little more
diverse then but if he wanted to go to a
newsstand with a variety of political
literature you had to go down to 42nd
Street this was essentially an ordinary
newsstand for example for years I as a
kid I thought that was a newspaper in
New York called noose and mirror and the
reason was that as people were rushing
out of the subway station they'd yell
news in mirror and I'd hand them a
couple of tabloids I later realized it's
the news in the mirror you know but
that's and I also noticed that the first
thing most people looked at was the
racing forms but it was an ordinary
newsstand except for the midea
surrounding it which also went back to
his small apartment nearby and visitors
another family member so as a it was a
source of intellectual stimulation in in
childhood at the same time oh sorry
that's okay at the same time yeah I was
by the time I was about 12 years old my
parents would let me go by myself to new
from Philadelphia by train and I spent a
lot of time around the fourth Avenue
below Union Square Union Square was a
center of political offices like the
anarchist offices of friar Arbeit
there's Timmy the Yiddish anarchist
newspaper down fourth Avenue there were
small bookstores then many of them run
by recent a McRae's refugees from the
Spanish Civil War
others fleeing from Europe in the 30s
and I spent a lot of time hanging around
those bookstores and the offices talking
to the older people the people who ran
them so those would have been the world
war two years did you have strong
feelings about the war at that time and
how did what was going on with the Nazis
and the Japanese influence or interact
with your budding interest in socialism
very much so I mean the shadow of the
war was a very frightening right through
the 30s actually the first article I
remember writing I'm sure I hope it has
disappeared but it was for a fourth
grade newspaper and it was about I can
time it it was about the fall of
Barcelona in February 1939 and I just
remember how it started it was about you
know Austria Falls Czechoslovakia Falls
Toledo Falls in Spain now Barcelona
Falls it looked to me as a 10 year old
as the the this grim shadow of fascism
was going to spread over all of Europe
and maybe the whole world
I was very frightening even for local
personal reasons I we happen to it just
happens that we were the only Jewish
family in a mostly German and Irish
Catholic neighborhood which was pretty
anti-semitic for you know boys on the
street you see it the practice took me a
long time to get
over a kind of a visceral fear of
Catholics because of the tough Irish
kids down the street who were there came
out of the Jesuit school raving
anti-semites and that was all you know
it's kind of local personal media
connected to the what you could see
happening in the world which was pretty
frightening my own feeling you know what
don't give much not not much attention
to be paid to it but I felt myself that
then and by now I feel much more
strongly knowing a lot more that if the
US and the British had intervened not by
force simply taken strong moves in
1937-38 of the war the Nazi invasions
might have been averted the Germans were
not then in a position to carry out the
military strikes they did later but both
Britain in the United States primarily
Britain at the time were not
unsympathetic to the Nazis didn't like
them but they had a certain sympathy for
them so for example mostly the British
must and largely for business reasons
that intense business connections with
the Nazis also because they regarded the
Nazis as defending the establishment you
know the British business world and
Americans to defending them from the
threat of the workers movements the left
of the socialist and communist movement
in fact in 1937 the US State Department
argued that we should not be too harsh
and criticism of Hitler because he was
essentially a kind of a moderate who was
deflecting the the forces of the
extremist forces of right to left but
obviously that view fell apart upon
further evidence by him I wish it had we
had a consul in Berlin us had a consul
in Berlin
up until the the war was declared in
September 1941 he was writing back
fairly sympathetic commentary on the
Nazis not saying I love them but saying
we shouldn't be - pretty much what the
State Department it's kind of a
moderating influence deflecting the real
enemy which is the forces of the left
that man is well known his name is
George Kennan later became one of the
major post-war planners wartime and
post-war planners even as Roosevelt was
looking for a way to get into the war
because he felt it was important to
intervene on the side of the Allies same
time it was a lot of conflict it's time
active Roosevelt himself was a somewhat
ambiguous for example he he had quite a
favorable attitude to it miscellany who
he called that ad verbal Italian
gentleman and he as late as I think
maybe 1939 he was still taking the
position that Mussolini wasn't such a
bad guy it's just that he was misled by
Hitler the ambivalence at the time was
quite extreme your wikipedia page says
you align yourself politically with
libertarian socialism do you use that
term libertarian socialism people might
think they are the opposite of one
another
libertarianism for the individual and
socialism for a strong state to enforce
justice inequality well that's not
that's these are u.s. terms that you're
using but I'm using the traditional
terms the United States is kind of off
the spectrum on this here libertarian
has a special meaning and socialism has
a special meaning and the rest of the
world that's different than
traditionally it was different the
libertarian socialism is just a
traditional term on the left for the
variety of socialism that was opposed to
state power what sometimes called
anarchism very close to anarchism that
was called libertarian socialism
that's the term that I use it's your
traditional term and Wikipedia page also
describes you as identifying with
anarcho-syndicalism is that a term you
use
yeah anarcho-syndicalism and which is a
variety of anarchism is pretty close and
content to left anti-bolshevik Marxism
and libertarian socialism they're kind
of a nexus that pretty much falls
together so what is Anarchy mean because
when people hear that term and you know
without deeply studying political
history Anarchy it just sounds like
chaos lack of order yeah that's again
the standard American usage and the
traditional right-wing usage but
anarchism is a very broad concept there
are many different varieties but the
kind of core notion but most varieties
of anarchism the kind I'm interested in
like anarcho-syndicalism have in mind a
highly organized society but organized
from below with eliminating a hierarchy
of domination and illegitimate Authority
so it could be regarded as appeared the
closest you can imagine to pure
democracy it's quite different from
what's called libertarian in the United
States
remember that u.s. libertarianism which
is a unique phenomenon calls for it
tolerates in fact expedites tyrannical
control over the society by highly
concentrated but highly highly
concentrated capital that's what's
called libertarian here it's kind of the
opposite of what's meant by libertarian
in the tradition my guest is linguist
activist and political commentator Noam
Chomsky professor emeritus at MIT his
latest book is on Western terrorism
from Hiroshima to drone warfare but
we're also talking about his life and
times and now it's time for some of your
phone calls ask Noam Chomsky what you
want
Sheryl in Rego Park you're on WIC hello
thank you very much for putting the on
Brian mr. Chomsky it's an honor to speak
to you I can see you're a very great
intellectual and you try to think things
through but you very well may be
mistaken about President Truman's
motivation for bombing the unfortunate
bombing of Hiroshima Nagasaki
my father was assigned to protect the
President on the Agusta he was in the
Navy in 19 August 1945 on the
president's trip from the United States
to Europe during that time that's when
the bombings on Japan occurred my father
was thoroughly convinced and he was a
very brilliant man he's no longer alive
exceptionally brilliant person he was
thoroughly convinced that the
president's intention was merely or only
to end the war quickly and to limit the
loss of American life and not all the
other match nations and and conspiracy
theories that people have I know that
the world was in turmoil then I know
that when you're talking about politics
is all sorts of different differences in
thought that people have occurred and
concurring events that occur Oh Charlie
I'm gonna leave it there for brevity's
sake and and briefly on this if you can
dr. Chomsky be you know prevailing
history and interpretation is that
President Truman thought he was going to
save at least US military personnel
lives with the use of the nuclear bombs
and we did have an armed student arms
control expert and historian guest
earlier in the show who said they
actually were surprised by the amount of
civilian devastation
well it's true that Truman hoped to save
American military lives and I didn't
question that but and there was a vastly
exaggerated claims made about the number
of American military who would be
required to occupy Japan and to fight
Japan by now there's been extensive
scholarship tearing that to shreds but
that's not the issue
surely Truman wanted to save American
lives but that's entirely separate from
the question of what the motives were
for dropping the atom bomb which went
way beyond that
so one primary motive and there's plenty
of internal evidence for this it was to
warn the Russians that we were going to
dominate the post-war world as for
bringing the war to a close and assure
an immediate in there were other
approaches that could be taken one was
to propose what in fact was the
agreed-upon surrender terms which did
include a place for the imperial system
that was not proposed at Potsdam it was
what what the u.s. instituted after it
took over and if that had been proposed
in Potsdam
might well have ended the war and
there's another question we could ask
did the United States really have the
right to occupy Japan it's a long story
but if you go back to the earlier
history things are not as simple as
they're presented here and no one in
Japan was a hideous imperial fascist
state which carried out horrendous
crimes most of them in the 1930s in
China and Manchuria but the u.s. didn't
really oppose those in fact the US was
still trying to make a accommodation
with Japan up two weeks before Pearl
Harbor as long as US interests in China
were preserved
and I want to Aniak all know you know
and the well I think it's probably too
long did winter but the background for
pearl harbors the quite complex
I should add just one more point what
the US ran a peace treaty afterwards the
u.s. took over the region excluded
everyone else and ran the San Francisco
peace treaty with Japan but it crucially
limited the Japanese crimes to post
Pearl Harbor those are the only crimes
that were considered that outraged the
independent Asian countries to the
extent that they refused even to the
attend the peace conference because the
real crimes were in the thirties
where the US had a pretty ambivalent
position Alex and free point during WNYC
with Noam Chomsky hello hey how you guys
doing dr. Chomsky I'm in a an
international relations class right now
in college and I have to say I found
your work to be the most captivating
that I've read so far I wanted to see
how the propaganda model released it
today specifically the filter with
anti-communism and how that relates to
anti terrorism today in the United
States with what's happening in Syria
and this relates to his model of how the
media works in this country you said to
me referring to yeah yeah that's a very
good point actually we the book you're
referring to came out in 1988 and yes
one of the filters we talked about was
any communism with there is a second
edition of it in 2002 where we changed
some things that corrected some of our
own misinterpretations manufacturing
same book yeah but there's a 2002
edition and in that we pointed out just
what you said that the anti-communism
filter was too narrow it's really anti
any enemy of the day it could be
communism it could be a radical Islam
that could be terrorism and so it was
much too narrow the
filter we tried to fix that up in the
second one the second addition it's been
international terrorism since Reagan
Reagan as I said earlier Reagan came
into office declaring a war against
state-directed international terrorism
that's mostly been removed from history
because what happened is a huge increase
in state-directed international
terrorism initiated by the United States
that was mainly true in Central America
but also in southern Africa and the
Middle East and elsewhere and that's
kind of a nice story not a nice story so
it's been excised from history you won't
read about it in your international
relations but let me jump in there and
say that since we're talking about your
life and times that perhaps one of the
biggest criticisms of you by your
critics over the years has been that you
draw equivalencies like that between say
the US actions abroad during the third
war authoritarian during the Cold War
forgive me and those of the Soviet Union
which most in this country and in the
West would see as a much much more
malevolent actor than the United States
and well first of all I don't Troy
equivalences I describe each of them
they're each horrible in their own ways
and the fact of the matter is that latin
america at us debates were the locus of
far worse atrocities and crimes during
the period say from nineteen solon
period then eastern europe that's a
staple of scholarship mainstream
scholarship you can read that in the
Cambridge University history the Cold
War for example so yes they were both
pretty awful but our own domains were
much worse in terms of torture terror
Massacre destruction it was just a
horror story the starting of the early
actually goes back to Guatemala in 1954
so
are you excluding then the tens of
millions dead in Russia under Stalin no
I was I referred to the post Stalin
puros Stalin period right yeah you
always were staunch anti-stalinist from
very early on and an anti Leninist but
in the pan I'm opposed to the Soviet
tyranny and the post Ahlan period but if
we want to be accurate in the post
Stalin period the horrendous crimes in
our own domains for which we bore plenty
of responsibility outweighed the
horrible crimes in Eastern Europe by
considerable margin and again that's a
staple of scholarship well people will
certainly have different opinions on
that but let's get one more question in
for you before we run out of time and
herb in Manhattan I think wants to go to
the the other part of your career and
that is your career as a linguistics
scholar herb you're on WNYC dr. Chomsky
did your let's political views it's the
ones who I understand to be your
dismissal of Darwinian continuity when
you when you stated that you need human
beings have unique biological capacity
to speech well first of all there is no
notion of Darwinian continuity but
Darwin himself did believe and firmly
stated that evolutionary changes are a
small and incremental fact he regarded
that as a kind of a cornerstone of his
theory but in modern evolutionary
biology that's recognized to be untrue
there are plenty of cases of a sudden
emergence which lead to sharp changes
and in the case of human beings they're
just it's just a an empirical fact the
humans modern humans that's roughly the
last hundred thousand years have
cognitive capacities that Nara are not
shared elsewhere in the animal
world but have no real analogues no
homologs
nothing like them they're something
pretty new so something happened in the
latin roughly the last hundred thousand
years which led to a cognitively
distinct species these are descriptive
facts don't you just have it to a much
lesser degree than us know if you want
to look at things close to us at
probably birds or closer than aids which
are giving a huge evolutionary distance
apes are very different for example in
the case of language which the caller
brought up and is crucial
there is simply no sign of any
linguistic capacity among apes that is
different from other organisms so this
is passed out on the evolution of humans
in the Darwinian sense that most people
generally think of it in your opinion
well if you mean by the Darwinian sense
Darwin's original formulation you know
150 years ago
yeah but science moves on modern science
recognizes that there are there can be
changes which are not small and
incremental and even understand some of
the mechanism so go back to the 1970s
for example of one of the great modern
evolutionary biologist Francois Jacob
who was one of the discoverers of what
are called regulatory genes genes that
don't produce proteins but regulate the
behavior of other genes kind of a
monitor the whole structure systems of
genes and he observed at the time he was
kind of speculating then but now there's
evidence for it that very small changes
in arrangement of regulatory circuits
could lead to a difference between safe
fly and an elephant was one of his
examples and by now there's a lot of
meat that's been put on those
speculations some of these mechanisms
are even
understood so in our last minute or so
is there a relationship between your
study of linguistics and your lifelong
interest in politics did one influence
the other or the other influence the one
or are they just two completely separate
tracks in your life there are pretty
separate tracks there are points of
contact a core feature of human
linguistic and general creative capacity
is recognized by descartes for example
is our ability to produce novel
expressions in a creative fashion they
are not caused by situations but they're
appropriate to situations in an
innovative unbounded fashion it's a core
element of human freedom which shows up
all over the place and the core concepts
of my own my own variety of anarchist
views are kind of the same there's a
instinct for freedom that's part of our
nature and a social system that
constrains are limited in illegitimate
ways that should be dismantled in favor
of a greater freedom and and creativity
MIT professor emeritus Noam Chomsky his
new book is called on Western terrorism
from Hiroshima to drone warfare thank
you for spending so much time with us
and talking both about the book and your
life and times and taking phone calls
from our listeners good to talk you
Brian Lehrer on WNYC there you have an
hour with Noam Chomsky and coming up
next the ten words the college students
look up the most in fall semester
according to merriam-webster by the way
Chomsky we're probably happy be happy
with a lot on this list stay with us
