what's happened in Europe in the past 10
or 20 years is just astonishing I mean
even the Wall Street Journal is
astonished they pointed out recently in
an article that which is correct that in
Europe no matter what government is
elected you know far left far right
anything else they follow exactly the
same policies because they have no role
in setting policy the policies are set
in the and by the bureaucrats and
Brussels under the shadow of the Bundys
bunk so it doesn't matter what people
think in fact there are some dramatic
illustrations of that couple of years
ago the Greek Prime Minister Papandreou
meekly suggested that maybe there should
be a referendum in Greece so that people
could say whether they have wanted to
accept the policies that were being
dictated through them he was denounced
across the spectrum
everybody denounced them as totally
crazy how can you dare ask the
population what policies ought to be in
Europe we know that policies have to be
set by the bureaucrats and the bankers
