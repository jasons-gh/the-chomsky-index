he had won it with your tummy boys what
would you say
tell the honest truth adapt very much
the George Bush has much to do with
policy formation I mean the way the the
presidency is more or less like royalty
in the United States so the Queen of
England opens parliament with a speech
right but nobody asks whether she
believes it or whether she understands
that her role is to it's a ceremonial
role you present it's a role that is
connected with unity of the people of
patriotism obedience and so on and so
forth there the content is something
else that's by people who run the
country the people who run the country
are those in political office but much
more importantly their associates and
the concentrations of private economic
power that's where the country's really
run and that should be big security
America's leading social philosopher
John Dewey who's right very mainstream
American he pointed out that once that
as long as we have what he called
Industrial feudalism rather than
industrial democracy that means
tyrannical capelli totalitarian
institutions running the economy command
economies basically as long as that's
instead of industrial democracy like
workers control and management as long
as we have that then politics will be
the shadow cast by business over society
and that's approximately accurate it's
not that the state has no independent
choices it does put an amalgam exactly
the role that George Bush plays in this
is very dubious questionable in some
cases like say Ronald Reagan
you know what the policies work like he
was reading off his mouth parts of the
teleprompter or something like that and
Bush may have some knowledge of them but
I think he's mostly symbolic a
ceremonial figure trained at in certain
ways and so on so if I had a minute with
him i would say have you talked to God
lately or something
