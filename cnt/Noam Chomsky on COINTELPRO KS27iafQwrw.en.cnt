I was a minority of maybe one in
thinking that Watergate was a kind of a
tea party actually was asked to write
about Watergate right away by the New
York Review and agreed but I said I
would write only if I could explain that
it didn't amount to anything in fact it
was pretty striking the Watergate
exposures came out at the very same time
as the exposures of COINTELPRO same time
COINTELPRO was a massive government the
criminal operation directed against the
population went through four
administrations mainly kennedy and
johnson and nixon started a little
earlier and it targeted a virtually all
critical thought and action for not only
surveillance but for disruption we went
way beyond the Snowden case it went as
far as a literal political assassination
in fact right at the time of Watergate
there was an exposure of the fact that
in 1969 and one of the COINTELPRO
operations this is an FBI operation FBI
is the national political police so the
target they were trying to destroy the
black the black movements and that
really decimated them mostly the the
peaked the worst case which had just
appeared the time of Watergate was the
assassination of Fred Hampton a Fred
Hampton was a black panther and
organizer a very successful organizer no
chart criminal charges nothing like that
he was organizing in the Chicago ghettos
the FBI under COINTELPRO wanted to
assassinate him they tried at first to
incite a criminal gang in the ghetto the
Rangers Blackstone Rangers to kill him
they sent false letters to the heads of
the
Jers written and kind of fake black
dialect which they decoded instantly
FBI's not very smart to try to tell them
that you know that Fred Hampton was
going to go after them so they'd react
but they didn't what happened is that it
the FBI had implanted an informer who
was Hamptons bodyguard and he they gave
false information to the Chicago police
about guns in the apartment of where I
am the police broke in a really good
stop of style raid and just murdered him
his bed oh that that alone just swamps
all of the Watergate exposures and
interestingly it was barely reported and
that's the only one I mean they went a
lot of other things under control Pro
which was far more serious than
Watergate and I think more serious than
the NSA
