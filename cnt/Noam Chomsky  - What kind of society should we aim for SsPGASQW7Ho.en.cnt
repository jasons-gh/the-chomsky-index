what kind of society we aiming for well
I have my own view I think there's much
to value in the ideas of participatory
economics but my own view is we're not
smart enough at least I'm not to sketch
out the details of an ideal Society I
think we can give general guidelines
they should be based on eliminating
illegitimate structures of authority and
domination that one of the core
illegitimate structures is wage labor
the idea that a person in order to
survive has to people have to rent
themselves to a tyranny from so that
most of their waking lives there under
totalitarian control of a kind that
Stalin couldn't dream of like Stalin's
couldn't say here's when you can go to
the bathroom or here's when you can talk
to a friend or here's the path that you
have to take between picking something
up and going back to your desk that's
life for most people for most of their
waking hours in the early Industrial
Revolution workers fought bitterly to
block and prevent that regarded as a
fundamental attack on their dignity and
rights that should be recovered it's
recovered to a limited extent when you
have co-determination
working people on management boards but
that's a very limited extent to go well
beyond that there should be worker
control of production community control
of all community institutions
interaction between them you can think
of many free association of voluntary
Association of self governed self-rule
groups of both production consumption
survival policing everything you can
sketch out that kind of struck
how exactly you could reach it and be
implemented
my feeling is a lot of experimentation
since I don't think anyone is smart
enough to design it in detail
I think Karl Marx went too far and
refusing to say anything about future
society he just said you take a look at
all of his works there's a couple of
sentences scattered around about a
post-capitalist society says we'll leave
it to the liberated working class and
that goes too far I think but at the
other extreme I my own feeling is it
also goes too far to try to spell it out
and too much detail I just think there's
too much we don't understand about human
beings in society so let's try try many
ways to approach these goals
