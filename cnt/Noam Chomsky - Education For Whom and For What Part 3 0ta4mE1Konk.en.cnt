others opinions we want a thoughtful and
civil discourse as he talked about there
may be a few difference of opinion in
here also the ground rules for this
we're not going to do follow-up
questions from our people in the
audience because we want to get as many
questions as we can so please try and
keep your questions as succinct as
possible and we'll get through as many
questions as we can in about the next 30
minutes or so
should play here it will soon have to
translate the questions yeah as you line
up for the questions and we will have
staff there I'm going to ask the first
question I'm going to take moderators
privilege here if you will professor
Chomsky you were talking about towards
the end corporate influence corporate
funding and the idea that the
universities in the corporate eyes need
to turn out commodities MIT your home
institution now has a new program called
OpenCourseWare that I know is getting a
lot of information given out about it
for those of you that don't know what it
is there are many courses at MIT that
the materials are now available free and
online for the public talk about that a
little bit and how that may be going
against that corporate idea I think it's
actually one of my close friends is more
or less running but I think a great idea
you know I think it's just what it'll be
done I mean of course that means it's
available it's available on the internet
so not only here but everywhere all over
the world you could hear leading some
scientists scholars others delivering
their lectures of here the classroom
interaction I mean it's not like taking
a course in a decent you know in a
serious university because you're not
part of the interaction like you can't
stand up and say that's wrong that our
way to do it no which is a large part of
what real education is it is supposed to
encourage independent thought that means
challenges and a lot of what we
never else's teaching is wrong that's
why you don't teach the same thing every
year must your field is dead you because
you're learning and a lot of the
learning comes from what students are
doing their part of the educational
process and you don't interact with
other students I'm sure all of you know
that just from your own experience that
what's enriched your educational
experience is pure interchange talking
with the other with other students you
know arguing about things trying to work
things out together and so on any take
my own University since I know it best
but I'm if you walk around the floors of
the department students are talking of
each other working to get it right and
joint papers or and a lot of very
important stuff comes out of it well if
you're watching OpenCourseWare you're
not part of it so it is necessarily kind
of passive actually there are efforts
being made and it's tricky to develop
modes of more interaction and it's not
impossible but it's hard and I hope that
we'll go to that but the general idea is
great I think all right I will abide by
oral animals and not ask a follow-up as
badly as i would like to let me start on
this side and again let's keep our
questions fairly short so we can get
through as many as we can high pressure
Chomsky first thing I want to say is
thank you for visiting the University of
Arizona and thank you for such a great
I wanted to ask about the two documents
you mentioned the Paola memorandum and
the trilateral commission do you
consider that the major reason for the
increase in tuition and what other
factors come into play well I don't
really know of any study of this so I
have to speculate it's kind of
surprising that there isn't far as I
know there isn't any study because it's
a major phenomenon but if you just look
at the timing and the thinking behind it
then other things that are happening in
the society it's hard to doubt that the
concern about what they called on the
liberal end the failure of the
institutions to indoctrinate the young
they're afraid they wrecked the failure
of this which showed up in the active in
the civilizing effect of the 60s it was
followed very shortly and not only by
the beginning of the rise intuitions but
by lots of other things even university
architecture so university architecture
began to change if you look at
universities that were built and
designed this is worldwide incidentally
and I Japan the United States everywhere
that are designed in the 70s and the 80s
where they usually don't have public
places they don't have anything like
Sproul Plaza and Berkeley where students
get together and have discussions
demonstrations and so on there are paths
from here to there but not places for
students to get together I said that is
conscious I've talked to architectures
about it and I suspect that the same is
true of tuitions actually a good good
topic to study I don't know of any
studies
but looks very close I'll come again
there isn't there can't be an economic
reason for it for the reasons I
mentioned it's got to be an ideological
reason thanks for your question now come
over to this side thank you for coming
professor Chomsky I just wanted to ask I
think a lot of us here are in that group
would say the education is for everyone
so in light of things like No Child Left
Behind and the HB 2281 anti ethnic
studies my questions about hope what
where should we find inspiration has a
lot of us being educators in here to
kind of go forth with hope for education
well for one thing there's imma take say
Mexico is Right nearby as I say we're
basically in it the
so it's a pure country and it's not a
rich country like us for reasons to have
something to do with us as you know but
anyway it's a fact and what they do in
the higher education system is quite
impressive the action should add that
this city college and city university
opened city university in mexico city is
not old it was instituted by over at the
word when he was the mayor left-wing
there and mexico city started it then
it's been currently flourishing since as
i said is it it was pretty impressed
things like that that's an inspiration
or you can look at the student movements
over there over this hemisphere I mean
from Chile up to here in fact there are
very lively vibrant student movements
and Chile it's amazing it has just
revitalized the country there's been
student protests remember this is
protests against the lingering effects
of the dictatorship that we imposed on
what in Latin America is called the
first 911 it's kind of striking that
people here don't know what that means
most of them but the first 911 911 1973
by any dimension that i can think of was
much worse than what we call 911 number
not just in Chile it had very global
effect but an attentive the dictatorship
has formally been gone for about 20
years but there are lingering effects
that just as there are in Spain there
are lingering effects of the Franco
dictatorship right now and the young
people protesting their indignados as
they're called are trying to undermine
the very serious linking and flickering
effects and dictatorship they're very
real well that's chilly and there are
similar things going on through the
hemisphere in fact abroad in fact right
here the I mean the protests about the
destruction of the Mexican Studies
program for example it's important and
the teacher teachers are organizing and
there are a lot of pressure you know
tremendous pressures against public
school teachers you speak up you're
thrown out and so on but that doesn't
mean that people are taking it passively
there are efforts to respond there the
journals where people are writing about
it and there the struggles of the past
after we've cheesed a lot you know this
country isn't what it was 30 years ago
or a hundred years ago there's a lot
more freedom justice rights and so on
again take my own University but it
generalizes over the country if you walk
down the halls at an MIT when I got
there 1950s that you would have seen
white males well dressed very passive
very conformist doing their work
often very well but that's it that was
the Institute if you walk down the halls
today it looks like this half women
third minorities in formal dress which
mean which symbolizes informal relations
and a lot of concerns and activism of
all sorts of things it didn't happen by
magic this happened all over the country
in many ways all over the world and
that's the kind of inspiration that
water suffice i think it goes back to
the to the early days at the very
earliest days way far back samantray
certain history thank you on the side hi
I'm Denise from Chicago first I just
want to thank the intergenerational
audience that came tonight from where I
stand it's so exciting especially seeing
all the young people here so thank you
to both of you for bringing that out too
I'd like to invite you professor Chomsky
in any one year to Chicago May
nineteenth the concert for troubadour
Woody Guthrie who emulates many of the
themes that you talked about tonight and
you could find info on the Illinois
labor history webpage who holds the deed
for the Haymarket martyrs yeah the
question what do you think of the super
PAC and the decision by the Obama
administration to get into it with the
you know you talked about lobbying and
now they made the decision to enter that
fight no it's obviously cell but of any
principle not the first one incidentally
on the other hand you know there is an
institutional fact that political
figures just have to live with the
structure of election the electoral
system has been shredded
I mean it always was under the effective
there's always a big effect of campaign
spending if you want to learn about it
the best work that's done is by a
political economist named Thomas
Ferguson's personal friend but he is a
book called Golden Rule which goes back
a century this is studying in detail the
effect of campaign spending and not only
on who's elected but on what their
programs are that goes right through the
New Deal right up to the present he's
since extended it since and I think it's
pretty convincing that's what he calls
the investment theory of politics it
treats elections as occasions in which
groups of investors coalesce to invest
to control the state the campaign
funding is one standard mechanism and
you know it doesn't explain everything
that pretend it does but it explains
quite a lot now let's change radically
in the last 30 years last 30 years part
of this whole something they basically
neoliberal assault on democracy and
justice and that's what it is it's
worldwide but here to a part of it has
just been the sharply rising cost of
elections and now since especially since
citizens united and the super PACs it's
gone through the roof but it's been
going up steadily and it has a very
definite effect it forces political
figures into the pockets of those who
had the money the private corporate
sector it's increasingly financial
institutions but it's only that's not
only true of you know the president
running for office or Congress running
for office it's even permeated the
Congress I mean it used to be the case
that if positions of thought some you
know some
the authority or prestige in Congress
say chair of an important committee that
used to be the result of seniority and
service by now literally you have to buy
it you have to pay money into the party
coffers in order to qualify for a chair
of a committee well you can guess what
the effects of that are obviously and
this has been enormously changed by
citizens united in the super PACs but
it's a process that's always been there
actually you go back a century there was
a great famous campaign finnen seer the
most famous of the year of Mark Nana he
was once asked what are the important
things in politics and his answer was he
said well I can think of three things
that are important the first one is
money the second one is money and I
forgotten what the third one was that
was over a century ago and it's gotten a
lot more extreme so yeah this is a
sellout on obama's part but if he wants
to run in a multi-billion dollar
election you don't have a lot of choices
it's the system that's rotten at the
core not the choices individual
the clutch Thank You professor Chomsky
Alan a student from South Korea and then
thank you a lot for you writing for
village of Ganjam in Jeju Island it
suffers a lot from the like a military
base construction but like I just want
your more your opinion about the tax
expenditures on the military expenditure
instead of education is the poisons like
Korean students are suffering a lot from
that increasing like tuition almost we
are heading towards the same way
american students been then like it was
still the government in expanding lots
of money on the military instead of like
educating people and for better humanity
yeah actually that jeju island
construction that you mentioned is
something very significant we ought to
know about it it's Jeju Island is quite
significant for Korea was the site of a
huge massacre in 1948 by the us-backed
mostly basically fascist state and South
Korea horrible massacre and that the
island is it's been actually designated
I think where the UN is an island of
peace it's trying to be an island of
peace and the u.s. and South Korea are
building and trying to build a major
military base major naval base on the
island oriented towards China I think
it's 500 kilometers from china
approximately and it's part of the kind
of encirclement of China which is for
containment of China to hear it's
described as protection of Freedom of
the Seas which I need to see it a little
differently they see it the way we would
see it if the Chinese Navy was building
bases in the Caribbean say wouldn't we
blow them
planet if we did but the way the world
is supposed to work we're supposed to be
able to do it anywhere in fact if you
read the professional literature and
strategic analysis of security studies
they refer to the Chinese American naval
confrontation as a classic security
dilemma each of the two sides thinks
that there's a kind of an existential
danger they just can't give it up it's
too important so we think that it's an
existential threat if the United States
doesn't control all the oceans around
China and they think it's an existential
threat if we send nuclear-armed you know
supercarriers into their territorial
waters that's the security dilemma you
know what can you do and in fact the
u.s. is trying hard to essentially
encircle China so that they can't have
access to the Pacific or to the Malacca
Straits where a lot of trade goes and so
on Japan is part of this system that
Japan's a client state is military bases
all over Japan the many of them on
Okinawa this is over them
strong objections of the people of
Okinawa we've been trying to get those
bases off for 60 years and I can't do it
recently the u.s. basically forced the
Japanese Prime Minister out of office
because he was thinking about it well
Jeju Island and South Korea is another
case so that's and it's really serious
important issue there's a lot of protest
on the island civil disobedience a lot
of arrests or violence and so on but
your general point is quite right i mean
the vast military expenditures are part
of the you know i don't think the main
reason like we had fastened military
expenditures in the 50s and still was
pretty almost free education and for a
GI Bill totally free and huge amounts of
money going to the research system and
so on and now it's a it's a burden
undoubtedly but I don't the side he has
to depend decide where you want to spend
your money you want it to spend it on
classic security dilemmas in the China's
territorial waters with all that that
could lead to building naval bases on
Jeju Island Okinawa and so on or do you
want to spend it building a decent
society and this this question arises
all across the board I mean one of the
most striking cases this doesn't involve
the education but it does involve
survival is a Canadian tar sands and the
shale oil
throughout the country but in obama's
state of the nation address if you read
it carefully that one of the things he
said was that we're now coming to a
position where we can have a hundred
years of energy independence by
exploiting you know using high
technology techniques and fracking and
so on to get previously inaccessible and
incidentally very dirty oil of with all
sorts of environmental local
environmental consequences and this is
all over there was a recent speech by
the president of the Chamber of Commerce
main business lobby about it Thomas
worker and I think you can find it in
the internet this is annual speech to
the business world and the first point
that he mentions most important point is
that we can now move to he says several
centuries of energy independence but was
tapping our own oil you go to the most
responsible in serious newspaper in the
world that i know of the London
Financial Times they devote a whole full
page to a euphoric description of the
possibility of the United States having
a century of energy independence and a
century of global hegemony by tapping
these resources there's only one small
footnote if we use those resources we're
finished you know there's no future for
your children and your grandchildren
that's not discussed you gotta
gained wealth for getting old itself and
that means my profits tomorrow not what
happens 30 years from now to my
grandchildren but that's
well you know that there are
alternatives like ultimately probably
solar energy is going to be the main
alternative and it's quite striking to
see what's happening to the solar energy
industry that by now about half the
world social solar panels are being
produced in China now that's not cheap
labor it's not a labor intensive
industry they started the way all
manufacturing starts very low level
manufacturing manufacturing provides the
incentive the ideas the design
conceptions and so on that lead to
technological advances that very common
and slowly they've been not so slowly
they've been moving up the
high-technology ladder there now
producing the most advanced solar cells
in the world well okay that's one way to
use your resources we have choices we
have plenty of choices we're a very rich
society Chinese a very poor society
you're very Richmond so we have plenty
of options we have about ten minutes
left so thank you so much for keeping
your question shorts that we can get
through as many businesses I should keep
my answers true you're the guest of
honor you can serve as long as you like
hello dr. Chomsky i'm a member of
needles and our question is what are the
larger implications of the decision by
the two SD governing board and state
superintendent john huppenthal to ban
mex american studies i think it's it's a
particularly ugly part of the whole
attack on anything like the
Enlightenment ideal of Education in this
case to destroy the diversity richness
of the educational system the
meaningfulness for students and so on
for a large number of students you know
after all big Mexican community so I
think it's just part of the general
attack on a free and creative education
that stimulates learning discovery
richings one's life and so on and it's
just trying to impose indoctrination and
conformity a particularly ugly case
right here because of where it's
happening it would be ugly anywhere but
it's particularly so right here thank
you back to this site
professor Chomsky I I believe I speak on
behalf of almost everyone here it's an
absolute humbling honor to be learning
from you in person I made
iranian-american peace and human rights
and environmental activists and I am a
participant in the Iran's green movement
a supporter of the Arab Spring movements
against them up against dictatorship and
obviously I'm a passionate participant
in the Occupy movement in this country
which I believe has already awakened
incredible energy and therefore I am
hopeful but also fearful of what it may
do wrong in order to possibly waste this
last-chance movement so please share
with us your wisdom about what is it
that you think at this point in history
the occupied movement needs to be wary
of or be careful about well like you i
think the occupy movement has been a
quite a remarkable success way beyond
what I thought and the tactic has been
very effective for a lot of reasons one
effect that it's had is just changing
kind of national discourse in fact even
that terminology and imagery of the
Occupy movement is now sort of
mainstream it's focused attention on
serious problems
inequality somebody asked before the
purchase of elections rating of
democracy the extraordinary power of
financial institutions which probably
contribute very little if anything to
the economy in fact the the leading the
most respected financial commentator in
the world I think Martin wolf of the
Financial Times in London is very
conservative highly respected
correspondent he describes the financial
institutions that have developed in the
last 30 years as kind of like a larva
that destroys the host in which its
embedded I I couldn't get away with
saying that but he can you know and I
think I was quoting it but the and the
Occupy movement is directed attention to
foreclosures you know homelessness a lot
of problems that are there but we're
kind of buried another major
contribution it's made in my opinion is
just overcoming the atomization of the
society that people indeed I idiot
sitter Adam on society people are kind
of alone you know the ideal social unit
from the point of view of concentrated
power is dyad you know you and the
screen but nothing else that's a way to
make sure that everybody's conforming
and there's a lot of that no children
it's it's it's a real disease of
pathology and the Occupy movements
overcoming it it's creating
spontaneously communities of people who
actually are reviving traditional ideals
I mean if there were any real
conservatives in the country they'd be
applauding the fact that they're
reviving the concepts of solidarity and
mutual support
sympathy free discussion and so on
they're just the most traditional values
we have there's been major efforts to
destroy them and that's being revived in
the communities of mutual support and
solidarity that are being created oh
this is really important I think but now
where do you go from here well in
Jennifer Solano regard myself as any
kind of a expert on tactics I've been
wrong so many times on tactical
judgments that easily shut up but this
is but but and these are important
judgements the tactical judgments are
those that have direct human
consequences that are not marginal but
my field my general feeling is that
tactics have a kind of a half-life you
know they have diminishing returns they
may be very successful but it sort of
declines after a while the tactic come
is kind of a dynamism in which the
tactic begins to relate to overcome the
purpose apart from beginning to a lien
eight other people who you're trying to
reach so while i think that the occupied
tactic has been a great success i think
it has to be rethought and moves have to
be made some how to reach out into
larger communities that's been going on
in a number of interesting ways like one
of the developments in several cities I
know in New York and Boston elsewhere
has been what's been called occupy the
hood neighborhood occupy movements which
is to some extent integrated with the
you know the
ones that make the newspapers Occupy
Wall Street's an occupier neighborhood
in Brooklyn occupied other things and
those deal with the immediate problems
of the local people and they can be very
serious I'm it can be something that's
sounds as simple as getting a traffic
light where kids have to cross the
street I mean if people can achieve that
they learn you can achieve something by
mutual aid and you can go on that's what
successful organizing is about and if
the Occupy movements can go in that
direction reach out to larger sections
of the population and engage the the
working class which I've yet really to
do that's very significant then I think
they have great prospect but it's not
easy to do there's many a lot of
repression you know violent repression
sometimes and power systems don't fade
away cheerfully you know what they can
to control things but I think that David
Hume was correct power is in the hands
of the governed there's nothing there's
no weapon that the powerful have other
than control of opinion attitudes
opinions beliefs if they can make people
feel hopeless dependent passive atomized
okay then you can keep power but the
government that is the ninety-nine
percent in the imagery of the Occupy
movement they have the power but you
have to have to get organized committed
and that's the task of people who want
to devote themselves to this
we have time for one final question
would come from this side hi dr. Chomsky
I met you first with Daniel Berrigan a
long time ago but anyway getting back to
your specific expertise in linguistics
it's been troublesome to me that the
media will use words like socialism
class warfare but we never hear fascism
and from my studies of ideology
state-supported capitalism pretty much
what we've been talking or what you've
been talking about is fascism I know
words have power you know that too is
are we too shy to talk about what
basically almost brought the end of
mankind in the last century or is it
just the media controls and you have to
go to link TV or democracy now where I
don't know but they are not supported
they have to be supported by people
donating to them isn't anyone aware oh
well the history that word is kind of
interesting fascism obviously took on
bad connotations in the 1940s but if you
go back and instantly it seems through
other words like take propaganda the
term propaganda now is not used for
information in English it still is in
other languages if you go back to the
1920s information was just called
propaganda like Edward Byrne eyes who I
mentioned the founder of the public
relations industry the book of his from
which I was quoting on engineering of
consent and controlling the masses and
so on it's called propaganda propaganda
is just what you do when you try to
control beliefs and attitudes well since
the
1930s in the 40s and can't use that term
anymore for its obvious connotations
fascism is very interesting one and we
can learn a lot about ourselves from
looking at its history before the second
world war before the United States got
into the Second World War 1941 fascism
was not regarded particularly critically
in fact there's a very important book
urge you to read if you haven't called
the business as a system of power by one
of the great political economists Robert
Grady's Veblen economist it's about the
spread of fascism through the industrial
world he points out that in every
country all the industrial countries
there are the developments of basically
fascist character and he discusses them
and perfectly understand was quite right
in fact different there's nothing
inherent in fascism that says you have
to have gas chambers that's a special
thing that developed and in fact say
Mussolini's fascism was very highly
regarded in the United States remember
that's free Nazi so FDR Franklin Rosen
Roosevelt he described the Mussolini as
that admirable Italian gentleman I'm in
as late as 1939 he was praising
Mussolini saying well he's been kinda
misled by Hitler but basically doing the
right thing in when fascism was
instituted in Italy and it was pretty
ugly it was praised across the board in
the United States a business investment
shot up that also did after Hitler came
in
iron there was a fortune magazine the
main business journal had an issue and I
think 1932 the title you look at the
front page cover that big letters it
says the wops ah run wats are finally
doing something right you know they got
a fascist government which works and we
like that people on the Left were
praising a same loop same with Nazism I
mean as late as 1938 Roosevelt's main
advisor sumner welles went to the Munich
conference that's the conference which
tore up Czechoslovakia he came back full
of praise for the Nazi moderates who
were going to help us usher in a new era
of peace there the moderates you know
kind of protecting civilized values from
the extremists of the right and left and
so on I mean George Kennan who's very
much honored and respected now there's a
major biography that just came out full
of praise if you take a look at his
actual record he was the American Consul
in Berlin right through 1941 he was
withdrawn Pearl Harbor and he was
sending back diplomatic correspondence
to washington saying you shouldn't be so
hard on the Nazis they're doing
something's wrong but basically we can
do business with them they're right kind
of people well a couple years later you
couldn't talk about fascism that way the
fascism meant crematoria you know gas
chambers and so on so you stop using the
word but your point is correct as a
social and political order Robert Brady
knew what he was talking about
there are elements of this kind of state
capitalist order all over the industrial
world taking different forms thank you
for all of your questions and for your
attention
