okay in the morning when I came to the
restaurant
I saw you bent over some secret
revolutionary pamphlet or something what
are you reading these days answers on
the org metaphysics anneristo okay
[Laughter]
always the subversive and continuing in
this Lane of being subversive we were
talking politics the first hours of the
morning now we are going to be talking
linguistics could you lay out for the
ordinary person change youth not USA and
this time the ordinary person
what generative grammar the thing you've
been doing basically for sixty years
what it is all about what makes it
different from when on before what makes
it different from what's going on in
other we arms of the human humanities
and linguistics now
my grandchildren grew up in Nicaragua
yeah and they they have facility with
this stuff that they're not immersed in
it they have this kind of something they
use when they after all right we're all
in okay so let me just repeat the last
the last question can you set out what
generative grammar is all about and set
it out for the ordinary cousin well if
you go back sixty years roughly when
this work began it departed from
prevailing conceptions in a number of
ways for one thing it took seriously
something which is obviously true our
each of us has a language capacity
something internal to us that enables us
to do what you and I are now doing so
there's something in inside the organism
mostly the brain which is constructed in
such a fashion that we can do this
so there's a biological problem studying
this did you stop to think about this as
a biological thing do that right away
when you wrote your PA or an A or did
it's not and more later pretty much but
it really began to become clarified in
the early 1950s about sixty years ago
the provision and said the prevailing
conception at the time was that there's
what was called the behavioral sciences
that's what dominated all thinking and
psychology philosophy of inquisitive
and that regarded language just as a
kind of behavior so it's like drinking
cup of coffee or something else and the
gentle prevailing assumption was that
behavior is all a matter of conditioning
conditioning and training so you're
trained through conditioning the way of
training you know the bull could lie
down or something you're trained through
conditioning to produce these sentences
and other people are trained to
understand it and for Lucas all you can
study is either the behavior and the
training period that leads to it
conditioning period or the the outcome
of behavior like a text you know class
of material so the object of the study
would be behavior behavior and its
products the most its product so you
were linguistics was a well you would
tape sentences all you would studied
texts and it's in principle I mean any
linguist is head was screwed on didn't
do that but that was the principle and
the theories of such as it was was a set
of techniques procedures for organizing
and analyzing data segmenting it
classifying the segments bigger units
would you're done with that it's a
constructions are called you know
passive verb phrase or whatever when
you're done with that you're done with
the work it also followed and indeed was
said stated that languages can differ in
arbitrary ways yeah so any of any old
thing can be a language - a band and of
course from this these assumptions it
also follows that there can't be much of
a difference romantic other animals and
humans after overall just what
conditioned yet by the same methods
humans will be different in that they
may be bigger memory come to give the
other memory
something like that I'm always it just
total nonsense it can't possibly be true
in fact it takes one minute reflection
to see that it can't be true so for
example take say my granddaughter and
suppose she has a pet chimpanzee or a
songbird or something that's because
from birth literally from birth my
granddaughter
that they both have the same data around
them let's say they've exactly the same
data the my granddaughter instantly from
birth after its pre natal
adults did we know no but from birth you
can past that the infant selects out of
the environment with very complex
environment select data which is
language related that's instantaneous
and then almost reflexively develops the
capacities that we're using it's now
known that very early way before the
child can exhibit anything they know the
acquired love there is always something
more than something's going on
something's going on internally
reflexively so training doesn't matter
they did infant just picks it up only
and the pet chimpanzee you can't take
the first step it's just not there's a
lot of noise going on yes and from that
trivial fact alone and that's just the
bare beginning it follows that there's
some unique biological capacity when you
begin looking at the language that
what's acquired it has properties that
just don't exist in the animal world
outside of humans in something something
has to be there that enabled humans to
do this just as the same reasons why you
have a mammalian visual system and not
an insect with assistance not from
experience yesterday you are talking
about
there is no language you language
doesn't exist you what what about that
that was the view avail something that
maybe even kind of prevalent now is the
view that would give that point there
has to be something that is innate
nobody excuse that that it disputes that
now well that's not true that word ugly
it's ok fact it's very common to deny it
now and re just as in this 1950s that's
what takes slightly different forms but
a very dominant view in the cognitive
sciences related parts of linguistics is
pretty much like the 1950s there is no
language there's just some relatively
arbitrary collection of actions of
acquired by pattern formation or habits
or something just like other you know
actually none of this works for animals
either incidentally that's another story
but it was assumed at the time that
animal behavior could be accounted for
in terms of conditioning habit induction
and so that's now known to be false also
but the assumption is whatever is going
on with language is the same and
languages can differ in arbitrary ways
there are no generalizations in existing
South animal cell consent experiments by
love and thought in bagon that at the
time then in Europe even at that time
tended to show that that is oh that's
quite interesting the back in the early
50s these were the prevailing dominant
attitude tonight in question that there
were a few graduate students at Harley
two or three I was one Eric lyna Berger
is another I was just going to Marcel at
that we were reading Lawrence Anton
yes but nobody was looking at that that
is heresy is kind of old-fashioned the
European nonsense so in fact the first
mention of any of this really I'm there
was some in comparative psychology a few
people did yet zoologists looked at it
but in these fields what became the
cognitive sciences in the gwizdo --xx
the first referenced any of his work was
in things that we were it was not known
at all and we got to the extent it was
known it was dismissed when did you
first stopped reading this stuff and
when did you start neck meat
Eric Klinenberg about 1951 so 60 years
ago when we all got to Harvard yes we've
got there's grad students yeah was some
of the other people who were part of
this Nora Tali obviously what they don't
bomb back now Gail jump on that Gail
now that's later he said he came he's a
mathematician and a biologist he came
around in 1960 or so visiting and he
fell in right away
you know yeah but it's just coming for
different background that's Maddox and
biology I think the beginning something
like a six-piece is also when you met a
lilac like men a lot of lightnin was a
student in the late 50s and I met her I
was teaching part-time at Penn where she
was and I met her 57 58 and she got
interested in it and by the late 50s
others were beginning almost all
students literally nobody else exactly
about the only senior faculty member who
was even marginally interested was
George Miller so he adjusted the
universe Harvard he was here behaviorist
he was originally a very committed
behavior as the news
open-minded he also had a mathematical
background and he could as soon as he
think about these questions it instantly
collapses and he was open-minded enough
to think about it and have to understand
how dogmatically the atmosphere was at
the time you just couldn't talk about
these things but Miller did and he
became interested and he was helpful and
in fact Eric Klinenberg who was his
student but the knowledge that's working
when I worked with him to from the
mid-50s but it basically was young
people who just kind of looked through
Lois firstly one aspect of it is the
biological orientation in fact Eric
Klinenberg went on to pretty much found
biology and language the other aspect
was just the question of what is the
system as soon as you recognize that
there's some biological capacity kind of
like say the visual system or immune
system or whatever it may be
next question is well what is it well it
turns out that as soon as you look at it
you see it has a very unusual properties
so one of the simplest property of
language is what's called discrete
infinity so it's kind of like the number
system yeah 1 2 3 so there's there's a
five-word sentence there's a six word
sentence on the limit that there's no
five and a half word sentence and
there's no end you can make longer more
complex sentences without them so that's
a special property and it was understood
by the roughly 1950 the the formal
nature of such systems was then pretty
well understood the foundations of
computer science theory of automata and
so on so what it means is there's some
kind of process procedure that
constructs these things in your mind
and a generative procedure you go you
would consider and that also relates to
some of the things you said yesterday
you would consider that in module like
the visual system a life
nobody says well all of the brain is
committed to what the visual thing the
system is doing and you would say the
same is true for languages if the module
distinct from other modules that is
brain may have knows it does not follow
from that that it's localized like take
the immune system yeah that's in every
cell or not in one phase can't cut it
out
you know but in fact it is somewhat
localized but but it turns out that it
is localized that doesn't have to be it
just because it's a module their modules
are localized but the by announce the
fact was known in the 19th century that
there's some parts of the brain that
seem to be specialized for language yet
in Broca's area very Kazarian zone but
and then by now fair or not is known
about this and it's pretty interesting
what's known for example it turns out
that a lot of everyone surprised that
sign language is language of the blind
the cup of death is is localized in the
same areas of the brain as sound
language which is a surprise because the
modality is visual not auditory but it
all goes into the same left hemisphere
analytic center of the brain for normals
which is members by now much more
detailed knowledge about similar they
are so there's something inventions the
name of Feng Korea moral well that's an
interesting equation linguistic works
and yet Milan with neurologists on
neurolinguistics and too hard topic I
mean get them there are some results
they had one
quite an interesting result which I
mentioned last night they found that the
actual experiment which isn't described
they had the speakers in pyramid
monolingual speakers of German and they
presented them with materials one of the
set sets of materials was actually taken
from Italian so for them it was nonsense
syllables but it was actual Italian and
had met the principles of universal
grammar the genetic principles the other
was invented and it was a simple pseudo
language which used principles that
violate the conditions of what's called
universal grammar Universal grammar is a
technical parents often misunderstood it
means the genetic component gets just
the reference to the genetic component
so they took systems that violate the
simple rules would violate those
principles the case that they used was
something like say forming a negative
sentence by taking a litigation particle
as like a charge Mon knot or something
and putting it after the third word of
the sentence so the way to negate a
sentence is to citizens oppose I didn't
be the kind of Romania rule a linear
rule that you are talking about yes but
yeah and those rules are computationally
extremely simple and much simpler than
the actual rules but they're just not
consistent with the genetic basis for
language and what they found was that
when the Germans were learning but in
fact with Italian the normal language
areas were Broca's area was activated in
normal fashion when they were studying
when they were presented with these
pseudo languages with quite simple
computational procedures it wasn't going
to Broca's area other parts of the brain
were
I think the different in the brain react
well and what it means is the people
we're just treating as a puzzle okay I
could jigsaw puzzles and that's good
this is the brain maybe general problem
solving time you know somewhere
it's called general problem-solving but
that's just yet expression of our
ignorance and actually ever understood
anything about problem-solving which we
don't do we find that it's also probably
highly modular display specific yeah
because if we knew more about it we will
be talking in that way now when people
talk about general systems that just
means that on with the dog and I because
as soon as you begin to understand
something to even see it doesn't work
like that
I mean the same is true of insect you
know hey Jackson
whatever what looks general is mainly
arrogant so it takes a radical ed
behaviors the studies of pigeons
one of the main experimental animals
they thought they could do things like
trained pigeons to say play ping-pong or
something but when these were analyzed
more closely what it was discovered was
they're actually taking the instinctive
behavior of pigeons pigeons Peck that's
something they do instinctively and you
can slightly modify their pecking
behavior so it looks to you like they're
playing ping-pong a pigeon design coach
packet you know and in fact if you look
even more closely it turns out that was
considered pecking is actually at least
two different totally different systems
the one is pecking and one is swallowing
water they look the same but from the
pigeons point of view they're totally
different and if you and you have to
distinguish these from each other and in
fact there's a whole behavioral systems
of behavior it doesn't just totally
collapse just from internal inquiry
through the nature of the actual
behavior instance incidentally when I
say it collapsed I don't mean it
disappeared so it's still very widely
believed in my cognitive science is
among the general public and so on in
fact it's even thought the universe's
shouldn't be good is let me say that the
various and very famous April anguish
experiments all the same like the
pigeons nineteen common language
experiments are an interesting
illustration of the pathology of human
inquiry whole idea is absurd I mean it's
as if we were ago there's been a lot of
very good working on B communication you
know unfresh famous work Nobel Prizes
they do all sorts of strange things you
could train graduate students to do
something like the waggle dance of bees
and they do a pretty good job you know
they throw arms around
right over there but the whole idea is
ludicrous I mean you would learn nothing
about bees that way you would just learn
it's possible to get uh some superficial
similarity to something bees doing but
when you humans we refuse to study
rationally and we will willing to study
insects rationally when we turn to the
safe humans we don't totally irrational
so you do things in the study of humans
it would be a joke if you did it with
say insect and that's what the ape
language is some of your sort of
training these poor animals to do
something which very superficial which
they can't do you know so they can kind
of mimic a few simple things as I say
graduate students could do much better
mimicking be communication but it's all
a joke and of course it gets nowhere but
it but even if it did get somewhere it
would be meaningless because you're
trying to train them to do something
they can't do if they could do it then
the tip might my granddaughter's
chimpanzee
Pat she would be doing it just get the
same data what they do the same thing
but so it's all it's all basically a
joke and it's taken seriously it's
written up in the science journals and
so on but that's that's a reflection of
human irrationality it has nothing to do
with the science a lot of the same is
true of a lot of the work in computer
science trying to what's called
artificial intelligence which actually
one smart biologist once called natural
stupidity it's a it's an effort to try
to get automata to do things we look
human-like like little robots from space
waters or whatever and you can do things
and you can construct an automaton
little do things that look something
like what humans do but it's utterly
meaningless it amulets it but it's not
the same thing it's like a kitten
graduates right when you get behavior
and study behavior again but not what
you're not finding out what's going on
is and the point is we understand that
perfectly well when it's any non-human
organism we're talking about so to get
humans to act like say Apes or dogs or
these people would regard as ridiculous
correctly because who cares
and the same with automata that act like
dogs let's say you could speak and
people at visa I just do construct
mechanical bees but for scientific
reason they construct automata which act
more or less like bees but they want to
see if the bees will swarm when they're
led by a mechanical v instead of an
actual bee and that's important because
that can test how the bees doing it
what are they following an odor trail or
are they doing something else well okay
you can test that by constructing a
mechana-bats once again
question what what is the real research
interest do you study the organism or do
you study something that is going on it
yet and the in the sciences for impacted
the babylonians you don't just study
data yeah totally pointless when you
started to go about this seriously how
did your own methods of the linguistic
kind of linguistics Yousaf is doing how
did it differ for example from what laid
down in that same is cooked by your
teacher belly carrots
you just characterized this couple of
minutes before and you cut language into
segments and then you have larger
segments and so on and so forth
you did something different first as
kind of kind of a hobby of yours and
then you discovered that the different
methods of the real thing
I mean the energy if you purchase from
the point of view we've been talking
about the first problem is to figure out
what the general procedure is what's the
procedure that currently have to it has
some elementary properties there's got
to be some computational procedure in
the brain which constructs an infinite
array of structured expressions which
are interpreted by other systems so
they're interpreted by the sensory motor
system that's with column this idea is
very central that it's a generative
procedure that has to be able to do the
things you mentioned before namely
create an infinity discreet infinity of
structured expressions yes and they have
at least two interpretations one is
century motor
but the other which is much more
fundamental is that it intersects with
thought systems systems of planning of
organization of action and join conclude
inferences and so on so that the objects
that are constructed by this
computational procedure must be such
that the thought systems can interpret
it and that the sensorimotor system can
interpret it that's elementary not the
approach that harris did a very
sophisticated the actually by far the
best development of the structural
linguistics approaches which took the
object of study is a text corpus yet and
asked how can you organize it and you
organize it by applying certain
procedures you segment it into units you
classify the segment's go on from there
well you know when you look at it
closely that's simply Ron he also went
beyond sentence sentences could disclose
it takes yeah but it just doesn't work
from the first step the move from say
phonetic unit to the next higher units
it's a whole phoneme it just doesn't
work even at that level so you when you
when you really look at how these
systems this is also true of European
structural linguistics same problem you
just can't get the the phonological
segments the actual segments of the
analysis of sound by segmentation of
noises just yet it fails right away so
when you get something much more
abstract that's going on much more
unattended when you get to things like
we're called morphemes you know the
minimally intervening or bigger phrases
it just collapses totally seconds and
also ceramics is actually what you
started out with mainly all the way was
what you did the surface if it
but if you look back I had a rudimentary
syntax yeah because you can't even get
the more phonemic sign I have a
syntactic structure but and some of the
earliest things that were like the
Marsala and I did a paper and I came out
1956 I guess we should investigated one
of the main topics of structural
linguistics study at the time which is
the analysis of pitch and stress stress
yes you know so this bikes and online
yakov it was an honor roman yakusan but
if you read the paper what she read the
paper he was like this but what it
basically argued is that the systems of
analysis that were used were just they
could give notations they could provide
notations for annotating what you hear
but they couldn't explain the why do you
have this contour and not some other
countries and you could explain them if
you use some very simple ideas one you
assume that you had this impacts so you
do the organization of the expression
into phrases and bigger phrases and so
on and you had a simple computational
principle principle of what's called
cyclic computation you start you have
personal rules you apply them to a small
unit you reapply them to a bigger unit
you keep reapplying them finite system
of very in fact small systems rules
applying it according to a principle of
cyclic computation and that yields the
actual contour yes unlike you basically
have would be the sentence right that's
the largest unit of generation of the
computational procedure jewelry beyond
that was going to write and rake and
beyond that it's just a pile of beads
and another talk very arbitrary thing
well you know they're not arbitrary they
have a lot of interesting structure to
them that different still a different
beyond blows and yes so anyhow that was
like that was the first
really concrete example of how you just
had to throw out the whole system
because that approach violated every
procedure you can imagine it was getting
higher more complex abstract levels like
this index in order to account for the
most rudimentary phonetic that and as
and that works all over the place as I
understand you put quite a lot of effort
into trying to make these procedures
work for cut off here as as far as
student of Harris's you know you try to
do that was just the way that's the way
everybody was a good thing so I did a
lot of work now the procedures didn't
quite work so yeah I assumed if you'd
work harder you can fix them up and
don't openly work but pretty soon it
became pretty clear that just on the
wrong track yeah you're never going to
get anywhere I think in terms of syntax
this would be the fault at the point
where one of the same notions of general
just Graham out it came in namely
transformation when did you did you stop
well actually because in the syntax
component in your first work on Hebrew
there were no transformation yeah
actually the note that there's a notion
of transformation in Harris's work to
but it was very different purpose it was
for analyzing analyzing discourse and
the idea was that if you want to try to
analyze discourse you first have to kind
of normalize the sentences make them
look alike so if you had a passive
sentence change it to an active nin and
if you get all the sentences kind of
normalized then you can do something
like structural analysis with this group
but that's again organization of data
the transformations in generative
grammar are quite different they're part
of the procedure for forming sentences
in the first place yes so take it turns
out if you think about say a passive
construction the john was killed the
word John actually has two functions and
that's
the one it's the object of kill so
you're killing John you know the other
is it's the subject of the comment it's
the topic of the sentence and those are
just two different people that would be
a difficult related motion for Harris it
was just a discourse disciplining for
Harris everything with this quote but
beyond behind segmentation and
classification but if you're working on
generative procedures for sentences you
have to generate the sentence John was
killed with two interpretations because
the thought system interprets it in two
positions that becomes clear if you take
something like what did John see the
it's actually interpreted as for which
thing X John saw X and that's what has
to go to the thought system well
this displacement phenomena is
ubiquitous in language and it gets far
more complex than that
so pick a sentence I talked about last
night with you to take us in they expect
to see each other each other
refers to they it means each of them
expects to see others of them on the
other hand if you say who do they expect
to see each other that analysis doesn't
work
they each other is nothing to add a it
has to do with something that isn't
heard mainly this subject of see what
the sentence means who do they expect to
see each other what it means is for
which person acts they expect the ex's
to see each other and each other goes to
X and you don't hear that ear doesn't
hear it that the mind here's the mind
sees it mind sees it and the general
procedure has to provide that to the
mind well at that point you get into the
so-called transformational operations
and one of the major discoveries
roughly 15 which was the areas where
transformations get us first came in I
remember quite vividly when I taught a
course on syntactic structure and one of
the things that was really fascinating
to the students was the opilio system so
lovely it worked when you had that
phrase structure component and then you
just had fun having coffee and that that
was it and I was actually the first
effort that was the first yet major
discovery if you look at the structural
linguistics analysis of the affix system
it just listed everything it listed all
the possibility but if you sort of look
into the nature of the system you can
see that there are what are called
discontinuous elements like if you say I
am reading the ink in the and the copula
that they work together they're a single
unit they just appear in different
places and if you do a simple analysis
of what makes them discontinuous it's a
transformation that's it and then the
whole thing falls into a simple pattern
and that works for every language
basically so that's one kind of simple
transformation and it's a essentially
morphological discontinuity it's a
non-contiguous relation relation to two
things that aren't next to each other so
you can't get it infrastructure grammar
and you can't get it by procedures of
analysis but you can get it by a simple
displacement operation but the much more
general case is the general displacement
that you get in things like save as is
WH questions and so on and when you
begin to analyze constructions this way
you very quickly find all sorts of
you know puzzles that you can't deal
with in terms of segmentation and
classification and constructions and so
on like who they expect us each other
very simple example where what the ear
is hearing is not what the mind is see
yep and there's very simple at all
donation has to be something that's not
at the bottom it does it yeah but you
know that's true right away I mean as
soon as you look at phonetics you find
that so even if you take a is also
discovered in the early fifties but
Haskins laboratories and others that if
you take a simple click it just take it
we make a noise click how that click is
perceived linguistically depends on the
vowel that follows so there's a take a
particular click it will be interpreted
as a T or a P or a K depending on
whether it's followed by E or oh so it's
heard as P tah ku but it's the same
click actually have my wife worked and
this is a fun addition in those days
phonetics meant clipping things out of
tape with scissors D F night wake of the
idea it was really better on tape and
you can cut it out from the footage
footage and you feel the same thing yeah
but then that even said things like head
blow the whole system out of the water
and as soon as you go beyond you know
everything collapses like what happened
with behaviour ecology so if you look at
the simplest cases like a pigeon playing
ping-pong you see the experimenters just
fooling themselves in fact what happened
in the behaviorist literature is quite
intriguing
the main leading figure was BF Skinner
and he developed in the systems of
conditioning operant conditioning and so
on which after useful experimental tools
then
jaymund but his students assumed just
like the linguist assumed that the whole
field is over we know everything so now
we can go into applications and in fact
his best student started to go into
animal training so all the famous
animals flick all the dolphin and so and
they were trained but it's guest the
student but they discovered something
that is quite intriguing they discovered
that the entire behaviors literature was
fooling themselves if you if you train
an animal you think you're training you
know pick one famous case they tried to
train a pig to pick up a coin and put it
in a slot like a mailbox so the pig was
picking up the coin putting into the
mailbox and pig looked fine
however they discovered that if they
continued the training if they continued
the performance the pig started rooting
that's what pigs do that we meant to the
coin and started big it out
and it took longer so the reinforcement
was slower and finally the pig would
starve to death because we just keep
rooting was hungry or hungry or keep
rooting yelling but with it what
ethically they they were thriving making
that but what they were doing is working
on the pigs instincts they didn't know
it
they thought they were training the big
to pick up a coin that pig thought this
is food you know because if I do this
crazy thing I'll get some food and as it
tried to get more and more food it could
starve to death and in fact all the
training was like that then they went
back and looked at the actual
experiments say with pigeons and they
found that exactly what happens in the
experiments except that the
experimenters stopped the experiment
when the reinforcement starts work
doesn't work anymore so they it goes the
experiment goes in the early stage where
yeah it works the animal was interpreted
in a different way but then invariably
the it stops working and at that point
the experiment stops and so you don't
see that it's not working but when you
redo the experiment stands out
conditioning
going on at all you're just modifying
slightly the animals instinctive
behavior they called it instinctual
drift meaning the instincts take over
it's basically Tinbergen Laurens others
which no game is paying attention to and
that was enough I mean by the time this
if people started picking this up they
essentially blew away the field it's not
clear that conditioning even exists
listen if it does it's a marginal
phenomenon but and the same it's kind of
the same processes in linguistics and
also in general biology so if you go
back to the 1950s 60s it was generally
assumed by biologists and said that
animals can differ in organisms can
differ in a possible way but just
depending on the accidental courses and
by now that seems to be a much different
totally different infected seeing that
so different that by now there are even
serious proposals that are taking quite
seriously that there's a universal
genome of one organism which came out of
you know the famous explosion that half
a million years ago the Cambrian
explosion but and every organism from
bacteria to humans is just some slight
modification of the same genome it not
not know everyone doesn't accept it but
it's considered a serious I thought the
same I know how much that think we can
question how much information did you
draw from developments in biology or the
chemistry things like that some I mean
only because you start seeing how the
sciences were the so called human
sciences are very different from the
Natural Sciences all sorts of ways I
mean in the Natural Sciences for example
if you have a theory some kind of a
theory and you get counter examples
you try to hold on to the theory and get
rid of the data a social famous case in
the 19th century the it was discovered
that the orbit of Uranus the planet
Uranus didn't what talking about that
yeah well the famous case in the
nineteen century I think even Kepler
Galileo it would be number 20 they died
who I don't think fly off see well
Galileo could not explain why think I
should let's take the same with Greek
yet go back to the Greeks one of the
major problems in Greek science science
and mathematics when distinguished was
the discovery of the irrational numbers
yet if you take the diagonal of a square
its incommensurable with the sides of
the square which was considered like
discovering that God doesn't exist or
something but they didn't throw away
geometry they tried to figure out what's
going on and the same with the orbit of
Uranus they didn't say okay let's throw
away Newton's laws they asked well you
know what could be doing and then pretty
soon the very a discovered a an extra
planet out there new connected okay that
accounted for it by the laws in the
human science is quite different they
find a counter example you throw
everything it's just totally irrational
that in fact the whole dominant line
kind of inquiry that goes on into human
behavior from looking at eight languages
to analyzing corpuses to
misunderstanding generalizations is
completely different in the Natural
Sciences for not recent I'm invited back
to the Greeks and as honestly ever come
so in this sense yes it was influential
I mean noticing there were major
really major errors in the Natural
Sciences will head to the 20th century
which we're not understood and are very
similar to what you read it's a
philosophy of language today so for
example it's a big argument in
philosophy of mind philosophy of
language is alleged the problem is
supposed to be that you can't reduce the
study of mental acts to physical
behavior you can't find getting the big
problem and that was a problem in
chemistry until the 1930s you know when
I was a kid you know
people assume that the major peaks at
the scientist you know Nobel Prize
winners thought that chemistry is just a
computational technique it can't be real
because you can't reduce the physics
well in science meets little things you
depend on blackboard and just
calculating it is a technique for
calculating the result so experiment
Blacula fear of gases was treated the
same way where where's the molecules you
know a punk array they are scientists
the 20th century said that we can't take
the molecular theory of gases seriously
as you can see the molecules but I mean
might my take on phone Kelly is he
should have been the one to discover or
called relativity he pretty litter did
he did very much did he was very close
but he didn't give it a realistic
interpretation it gave it a positive
interpretation he it looks as if things
were like that and then Einstein came
along and said well I always ask and
then he did one that he developed the
mathematical theory of it but even if
you look at Einstein immediately after
Einstein's famous 1905 papers special
theory of relativity experimental
physicists started studying it in
Germany where the main X
mental physics is and they refuted it
you know the experiment after experiment
that showed it didn't work younger
scientists completely disregarded the
experiments I mean it was so obviously
true that in care with the experiments
were they just waited to find out what's
wrong with the experiments in fact that
goes on up till 1930s and there's a
reads them day the correspondence
between Max Born and Einstein and
explore in famous visited in the late
1920s the Max Born who followed
experimental physics much more closely
than Einstein did pointed out that
Einstein in the correspondence that a
famous American experimental physicist
had apparently disproven the
michelson-morley experiment famous
experiment which part of the basis for
relativity theory but he said look he
seems to have disproven it and then the
correspondence is quite interesting both
Einstein and born take it for granted
that the experiments wrong and born asks
Einstein do you think it would be
worthwhile to go look closely at this
guy's experiment and see what's wrong
with it
then Einstein says well you know who
cares or something but and then finally
some years later you know people we did
the experiment and found there were
statistical errors into them but that's
typical of the time he would say all the
way back to the Greek it's an a very
sharp break from the human sciences and
he had to get back to the chemistry case
which is not quite understood is that
the it happened to be true that
chemistry could not be reduced to
physics it was true and the reason was
discovered physics is wrong it wasn't
until the quantum theoretical revolution
took place that you then had a way of
giving an interpretation of say the
chemical bond
yet in terms of the diva quantity retic
explanations like - Pauline got the
Nobel Prize for this 1935 but until then
chemistry could not be read into
creation turned out to be closer to
chemistry then it was chemistry and
change as exchanged and they were
unified that was never reduced couldn't
do this and very likely the same will be
true about we a lot more was known about
the physics and chemistry that is known
today about metal acts and the brain
yeah so the fact that they can't be
unified we all know what that means
could mean that all neurologists ranks
meet to another area where the question
of abstractness comes in and nothing
bothering many people namely the
question of the relation between
competence and performance
have you seen do you see a lot of
progress and development going on in
theory of performance because I was just
reading some stuff
Australian book by but the week when he
talked about that the Psalms tent is
popping and processing in a minimalist
setting there's supposed to be a problem
about that but I don't know what it is
in biology is just taken for granted
like it's taken it's so taken for
granted there isn't even a name for it
so takes a the digestive system I mean
it has a certain structure a design you
can investigate the properties of the
digestive system
that's essentially competent on the
other hand how the digestive system
works depends on whether you ate bean
sprouts with E coli say okay then it
works differently and so that's
performance but this is so trivial that
nobody even talks about it
just taking for granted obviously is the
difference between the structure and
design of the system and the way it
operates in particular circumstances
where many other factors intervene
that's complement I think the question
how the phone system uses the system of
knowledge so perfectly fine question yes
and this considerably and work on it
most of the work is parsing programs
yeah so an effort to kill nobody has an
idea of what's going on between having
an idea and making another answer that I
nobody can even discuss but it's you
know it's a question that beyond the
levels of yet contemporary science but
the parsing you can study and there's a
lot of work and there's some interesting
ideas about what is done when a person
tries to assign the properly generated
structure to a series of noises or words
or whatever it is that come along so yes
there's that they're interested is
perfectly interesting studying and you
find this is done back in the 1950s so
some of the work that George Miller and
I were doing back in the eighties was
about this very striking fact that they
could we have some articles about this
you can show that in performance I mean
the competent system allows indefinitely
deep embedding you can take yet if then
sentences either Orson's is you know men
are not men is instructors like that and
you can embed them in each other without
limit on the other hand if you look at
performance you ask if people can
understand these sentences it turns out
you can we did construct examples up to
about that seven but you couldn't go
beyond that not that's a seven is
already very much well seven as events
like the cheese the mouse rat the cat
way but that's that's a different
problem yes that's the problem of self
embedding yet with self embedding when
you keep embedding the same structure
you know I get to about three yes and
the fact he gets
relates to the nature of short-term
memory it's Miller in fact I chose that
famous opticals the number seven plus or
minus two and that's true all the way
you know for birds and so on there's a
kind of a fixed bound on short-term
memory and humans are a little bigger a
short-term memory would be another one
of those modules it's some kind of
module of the memory system yet and that
kicks in for humans maybe about seven
for birds about five you know they're
not fundamentally different the other
hand self embedding is a much more
interesting question because why should
it be harder to parse construction where
you keep using the same principle over
and over than if you use different
principles that's still not solved
incidentally but it's definitely true
with self embedding let's say if then
you can't get beyond even three is very
hard and yes two is about the actual
limit so that probably what's going on I
always have problems in the seminars to
even create the Phantom jest well if you
get the three nobody understands it
barely and if you go beyond and there is
a question why self embedding should be
much more difficult than embedding and
the principal probably is that when
you're parsing a sentence you in
computer lingo you call on a subroutine
like if you get an if then you call in a
subroutine which is okay I'm looking for
if then and you can't call in that
subroutine again while you're executing
it that seems to be the general
principle and so and that is going to
keep prevent self embedding but if
that's true that's a much more
far-reaching principle of course that's
essentially it look beyond the trivial
things like say short there memory you
find that basic performance principles
are entering but these are principles of
performance and it may be general
cognitive like you should be
to show comparable examples and things
like puzzle solving or object
recognition so I'm not easy that you can
look for them because these are probably
just general cognitive principles that
enter into the performance system
however they all are quite they all make
use of the design and structure of the
system which both competence just as in
the case of digestion let me get to a
final complex that relates to things we
talked about yesterday memory is not
going back to our total who talked about
language being a relational sound
meaning and you kind of landed around
that was saying that actually we should
regard it that meaning being primary
thing and sound something secondary
that's good not externalizes kind of
externalizes what is the real thing
it may or may not be externalized in
fact if you just introspect for a minute
almost your entire use of language is
talking to yourself yes you can't spend
one minute with us volunteer so the like
99% of the use of language is internal
but the one question I was wondering
about yesterday when you talk about the
island sentences when we are talking
half consciously fully consciously or
subconsciously to ourselves not having
to externalize the things we'll probably
with disregard the island constraint for
example like this is that's it that's a
misunderstanding internal speech
internal speech is actually more complex
than I just said it's Rhian ternal
ization of externalized speech also when
you're consciously thinking you know
you're walking down the street and
thinking about something you're thinking
in the external language ok think about
it yeah you can tell whether sentences
in their mind
I'm okay whether one's longer than the
other that means you're using the
external language your rien turna lysing
it but the actual thinking is just not
accessible to consciousness
remember when what we talk about we
introspect we're talking about
consciousness the consciousness is just
a superficial reflection of whatever is
going on inside most mental things going
on our subconscious cannot summon that
has been inaccessible to consciousness I
mean that's there's an interesting
history of this in fact if we look
through intellectual history the idea
that there is internal thought that is
inaccessible to consciousness is almost
never expressed and it's not even in
Freud like if you look at Freud being he
does talk about the unconscious but kind
of tacit assumption is even bring it or
until you have that principle of
accessibility to consciousness in
principle so you can bring forward to
bring to consciousness
that's a that's a philosophical dogma
yes which has actually no evidence and
is totally incoherent when you look at
it but it's a dogma it's considered even
the criterion of the metal you have to
be able to bring it in principle to
conscious yet absolutely no reason to
believe that and it's almost entirely
it's on the all the evidence resists
totally false the language the case in
point what we think to ourselves is
Rhian turn alized
external speech in fact it's kind of
interesting to ask the question about
signers it hasn't been studied but the
people work on sign gasps you know that
studied yet that signers probably think
to themselves in sign now there should
be way that would be very
internalization of their of their
external system that there are very
subtle ways of testing things like this
so for example in the case of you and me
we think in spoken language if you do
very sensitive analysis of say the lips
you can find
evidence from kind of unconscious
impulses something's going on when
you're thinking things like and it's
conceivable if you could do the
experiments properly that if you stayed
the fingers of signers that you would
find some reflection of what they're
thinking about in there and fingers you
know but these are hard experiments but
something like but the point is hitting
beyond this below the level of
consciousness for either signers or
speakers we've got the same things going
on there are a lot of misunderstanding
of this it shows up in a lot of domains
that recently you may have read that
there were some discoveries that that if
you're planning to do something like I'm
deciding to pick up this glass before I
decide to pick it up before small amount
of time but before if there's activation
in the motor centers of the brain this
again has been abused and misused in my
way in my view for example when you have
these philosophical discussions about
freewill that's been being used exactly
this was like it doesn't show anything
at all all it shows is you're making
this decision before you're conscious of
it
second again but this gets wildly
misinterpreted because of a Dogma it
says there's nothing beyond what's
conscious at least in principle
accessible to consciousness and that
goes way back in history it's very hard
to find anyone who can open up a field
language and mind so you know that much
better than not I would color what
people are writing that still the case
everyone used to and refer said well the
- it's about consciousness or what's in
principle accessible to consciousness
you get at all kind of problems because
of things like what's called the blind
sight
the famous phenomenon now but
with a certain kind of damage to the
visual system a special kind of damage
that you get people who have this
behavioral phenomenon they look at a
they look at it they say it damages half
the visual system see agency was on the
last but not what's on the right
so you present them with a visual image
and say they can't see what's on the
right where what's on the right is let's
say a fire and you ask the person where
you see they don't see anything on the
other hand you find behavioral evidence
that they're actually seeing it there
are not conscious of seeing it but
they're like they recoil or something
like that which is called The Blind Side
which means that something's going on
which is that's the most inc
demonstration that something if the
techno to the philosophical literature
those kind of elaborate ways of trying
to get around this but there's no way to
get around it without doing as a total
incoherence but in general the whole
dogmas be thrown out it's a it's an
ancient Dogma it's almost unchallenged
it's really hard to find anyone in the
whole history of philosophy that ever
questioned it maybe um questions it's
sort of but in a very obscure fashion
you know but it's in a very very tight
grip that has to be thrown out it's like
the belief that you know people like
bunker ray and others that if you don't
if you can't see it can't really be
there yeah it's back to the
crystallization once more saturate
technique books
article in that new book by linguistic
and price that we that relates the
character of words as we have them as
humans different that will explain
yesterday from let's say animal calls
when one relation to what's going on and
we outside work and he relates the
character of words to the computational
system so words have an edge feature
which makes them
notable if I understand him correctly
yeah but he's talking about the syntax
of word yet but what I was talking about
yesterday is the semantics of words
yeah that's quite a different question
so there's another philosophical dog 90s
he's also getting at that at the
referential question metal coil as I
understood him he was also bringing in
in the idea that the detach ability of
words from the concrete object also has
something to do with the edge features
see clear it can't be them it just can't
be it's a completely different
phenomenon if you look at the meaning of
the word this is again pretty obvious
but it's there is a philosophical dogma
unchallengeable which holds that say you
have the word cow standard example the
meaning of cow is that thing over there
and there's a causal relation you know
you kind of look at the cow and somebody
says cow and that establishes the
meaning it's totally false and you can
tell yeah you can tell from children's
stories you know it's stand up to magics
but I kept I kept telling students to
say curry out we are doing this stand-up
thing so that you know but think about
it so as soon as you think that you see
a can't a true yes so standard fairy
tale that every infant understands the
Wicked Witch turns the handsome frame
into a frog okay and finally the
beautiful princess comes along and
kisses the frog and out comes the prince
every infant understands that that thing
that has all the properties of a frog is
actually the prince
like if a prince didn't come out that
are you know an eagle came out the child
would be surprised so somehow an infant
knows that what identifies a person is
in fact some non-physical property a
property what's called psychic
continuity so there's something about
the psychic continuity that identifies
persons same is true of cows there has
to be get the same stuff for example
there is a children's story which my
grandchildren like where the Wicked
Witch terms a baby donkey into a rock
and throughout the whole story this rock
is trying to convince its parents I'm
really your baby guck even the since the
children's literature always has happy
endings and at the end out comes the
baby donkey but the kids understand that
that rock which has only rock properties
is in fact a baby donkey the same with
cows yeah the psychic continuity is a
property of which we impose upon organic
creatures but it's not a physically
identifiable probably and that means
there is no reference this is true for
every word you think of them I mean so
the whole I in fact it's interesting if
this was understood by actually
something like it in Aristotle even if
it was pretty well understood by
classical empiricists they locked at
humor others they understood it and
that's something I wanted to get at the
character of the words that we use which
is radically different from what animals
do
probably were down three decisis did
most certain certainly because eights
don't do yet not the second or not cret
Assessors whatever common origin there
was - yes primates certainly didn't do
it
