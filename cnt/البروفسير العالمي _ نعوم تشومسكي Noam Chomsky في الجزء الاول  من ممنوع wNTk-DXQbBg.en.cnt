but for the professor Chomsky it's an
honor for our show forbidden men want to
have you our guest pleasure to be with
you and actually I am the guest new
place professor we we know you have said
lots about what's going on in the Middle
East how do you see the situation after
three years of what so-called Arab
Spring the Arab Spring was one of the
most dramatic and exciting developments
of the recent period that appeared at
first that the Middle East might be
moving in a direction which has been in
a way pioneered by South America during
the past several decades they are a
really dramatic event took place for the
first time in five hundred years since
the conquistadors South America has
begun to move towards independence from
foreign Imperial control that meant US
control in the recent century towards
facing some of the tremendous internal
problems of the countries towards
integration not completely smoothly but
a very significant development and it
seemed that the Middle East was moving
in that same path not for the first time
have been many democratic movements in
the Middle East crushed by Imperial
force and internal dictatorship so it's
a revival of things that had happened
before and I think many positive
developments took place the reaction
very in the oil dictatorships the
efforts were just crushed by force
almost immediately like behave but we're
in Saudi Arabia was less visible in
Saudi Arabia but the first bhavani about
well the first mild efforts to
participate in
Friday demonstration yet we just crushed
by force so fast that the people were
just terrorized nothing else happened
and hurted my friend that finally ended
up with us of the invasion in effect in
Syria it it's a nightmare turned into a
nightmare
very quickly the Assad Assad regime
responded with such extreme violence
that it elicited a militant response and
since then the country is virtually
destroying itself what do you think
about the city in situation when it's
protecting all these fighters Qaeda on
al-qaeda for many nations and lots of
fighters are from Western countries well
what they're many the many factors
involved one very significant one is the
u.s. British invasion of Iraq Iraq had
been in this pretty awful history not to
go into it but the invasion was just a
sledgehammer smashing a vulnerable
society without any concern
understanding for the nature of the
society the regime that the u.s. imposed
immediately was strictly sectarian for
the first time it elicited sectarian
rivalries the brutality the invasion led
to a harsh reaction within a few years
the country was in flames yep
I mean Baghdad had not been the most
utopia but no people didn't live
together he my guest Massoud Shammar
his Iraqi musician he's one of the best
old player he said Iraq used to be one
of the best mosaic Museum of X like old
languages unique religions now it's
disappearing and now you're leading me
to the topic of my knowledge it's the
last summer wasn't a very bad nightmare
for minorities I'm sure we heard about
what's happening
the CDs to the Christian the old
Christian communities we know the Arab
or the Middle East lost its Jews Jewish
community and now it's the other
communities minorities what can we say
about that that's a consequence of an
even greater catastrophe the creation of
a sunni-shia divide that had became in
the wake of the invasion for various
reasons including what I mentioned
became a very violent and brutal as
tearing Iraq apart is tearing the region
apart that's that's a major factor in
what happened in Syria not the whole
story of course the main factor was the
brutality of the regime's reaction to
the first mild reformist proposals but
all of this is combined it's Isis is an
outgrowth of it actually there's a
recent article by one of the leading US
government specialists on the Middle
East at Graham Fuller's long background
and CIA and other intelligence the the
title is the u.s. created Isis he
doesn't he says I don't mean that the
Washington sat down and planned and he
created Isis he's not taking part in the
rampant conspiracy stories that
circulated in the Middle East
yeah he's saying that the effect of the
US invasion of Iraq was to elicit and
exacerbate sectarian tensions which led
to Shiite repressions any reaction
finally the extremist fringe of the
already extremist Wahhabi doctrines
these are the internal factors we have
the majority doesn't allow minorities
and to speak freely even before like in
our history as part of our history
yes that's true in many cases but this
became much worse yes it became a major
internal war right now Isis on the one
hand and the Shia militias on the other
are brutal and violent there's and as I
say it spread throughout the region it's
also led to international conflicts the
always latent conflict between Iran and
Saudi Arabia
there's no exploded that's all of us is
in addition to Israel's violent takeover
of the occupied territories we began
last summer with a horrible attack on
Gaza so it's just a cauldron of
animosities and conflicts and disasters
but going back to the Arab Spring it had
I think it's at the month there is a
regression undoubtedly particularly in
Egypt I mean Libya is just an article on
you know but Egypt's the most important
country in the Arab world for always has
been and the repression and Egypt is
very serious and unpleasant I think it's
easier if there's moving and the one of
the worst fear isn't about Tunisia
Tunisia is the one relatively bright
spot the uprising didn't succeed in
eliminating the French back dictatorship
and opening some space for direct
participation the UNAM indeed step down
its hasn't imposed it's not make
dictatorship nothing like that and there
are
dear mothers today we had a good
discussion with the professor Chomsky
and were honored to have you part of
this show if you can tell our viewers in
the Arab world about Chomsky the friend
and the Chomsky the professor you worked
together for many many years
okay my collaboration with Chomsky had
to do one a technical problem namely the
nature of the phonetic in this sound
nature of English you know every
language is made up of words and the
words are made up of sounds individual
sounds so you say dog oh I mean yes so
the word dog has three pieces do you
know the word part has again three
pieces but t OT you know etc I mean this
is a very brief way of explaining it now
the writing systems of motion of many
languages are essentially they represent
these sounds now in Hebrew which is and
I which has a writing system you know
they don't they don't systematically
represent the vowels they only represent
the consonants and if you don't if you
speak Hebrew you can you're supposed to
be able to guess correctly at the
concerts but it's a vowel sorry at the
vows now that the consonants and you get
the consonants and then you guess at the
valves but
a person who reads Hebrew fluently or I
mean I think the same is true of Arabic
he doesn't read the vows but he can
because he understands what's going on
Heaney he knows what the vows should be
yep
so it requires in addition to knowing I
mean to know the vows needs to know a
great deal about Hebrew a lot of it all
right well if you have that writing you
know that's writing
now there are writing systems where
nothing is supposed to be left to
guessing you know where everything is
written out yes and so Dilys there's
what's called the phonetic transcription
and that is it's a way of writing down
an utterance in some language without
leaving anything out but that implies
you see that you have that the person
who devised devices this system knows
that nothing will be left out I mean you
know it's
it requires particular skills and most
existing systems are not quite a they
repair they show things somewhat
incorrectly and one of the first papers
that Chomsky and I wrote I was a book
really called the sound pattern of
English heads the aim of writing down
the vows and the consonants is they are
produced in English uh terms and that's
what we did and you know some people
thought we were wrong some people sorry
we're not wrong and but that was our
first book which who came out in
nineteen something you have a journey
together at the same Institute
no no that's different
I mean Chomsky got a job here at MIT and
so it's not he but it's it's a time MIT
did you see him there did you get
yourself we have reviewed him today
today in in his office yes and and we've
written various papers and books
together and we've been friends for many
years although I shouldn't exaggerate I
mean because Chomsky is I mean you know
I don't call him up
when Tim misbehaves or when I traveled
at home you know we're not that close
but since I've known her for very many
years I mean since nineteen think I've
known him since 1951 but I may be it may
be 52 or 50 or I mean around their
fifties he from the nineteen fifties
honor and he got a job in our department
maybe he told you this when he got the
money was first hired at MIT I think it
was 1955 he became a professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
which is where our department is located
and it's they who pay our salary
Chomsky the man some two men so he's a
colleague now but of course he was my
professor for four years and he was also
my thesis adviser and I mean I could
tell you a lot of stories about him both
sort of touching and funny stories I
will start with the very last memory
that I have of him from my student days
that is the very last interaction with
him I had with him when I was a student
which was after I graduated and I was
getting ready to go to to Philadelphia
where my first job would be and he
walked with me to the subway in fact he
even came down the you know down to the
train with me and I gave him a hug and
asked him you know sent him very much
for everything you done for me and asked
him and said something like I wish there
was something I could do for you
it was I was I wish there was a way I
could repay you for everything that you
did for me and he said there is if you
think I helped you and the things for
you then do to others mmm and I thought
you know this is the last words that I
had from him from when I was a student
and it's something had stayed with me
and it's actually I think shows the type
of person that he is but of course all
of us also have is like he really does
have a very good sense of humor yeah
he's funny
so we've I have left a lot with him but
sometimes was also funny is jokes it
does not intend to make so ya know he
has so for example once I was I was
sitting with him about something in
linguistics and there was agreeing and
he was sort of our beggar talking back
and he said you're just being
obstreperous and I said what is that I
don't know that word he said well I'm
not gonna tell you you go and look it up
and yes and I said why and he said well
because I've done these experiments that
if you something you solve you learn it
better that like for example that put
people in distorting classes and they
have them walking on the vision adjusts
after a bit but if you put somebody if
you put the Storting glasses on somebody
and then you push them in a wheelchair
down a path the vision does not adjust
so instead of telling me what observers
means you know but if you know he it's a
story and I went to look it up and then
I found out what it means and then it's
another story so what is it yes I
thought they understood yeah mostly it's
so obstreperous means to noisily defy
orders or resisting commands so
basically just to disagree you know in a
sort of vehement and stubborn way thank
you thank you
if I say cube the chomsky we never know
what you say I say he has a sense of
humor
I say he's wonderful with little
children he lights up I say he's a
fabulous grandfather I say that he is
sensitive you probably know that but
there are ways in which he's sensitive
that he just he just won't show because
otherwise he can't do the work that he
does you worked with him for how long 20
years I think you know him better than
anyone pretty well yeah I know I'm
pretty well but there's also a private
side to him the latest movie God is not
dead mentioned Chomsky as one of the
greatest atheist how do how much do you
agree with that I don't think I can make
a comment on that I don't I mean I know
he doesn't go to church or temple on
Sundays I know that our Saturdays or
Fridays or I think he's more like the
Buddha I think he's more spiritual than
than than religious do you see like does
he have any sense of spirituality yeah
the traditional sense yes
yes I think he does I think there are
things that he wants to believe but I
wouldn't say he's tremendously spiritual
on the outside but yeah I think I think
there are ways it's it's amazing when I
told people I'm gonna interview
professor Chomsky some religious people
or believers they said and by believe as
I said they believe in God they said oh
I wish if I can ask professor how can
non-religious person have such high
morality from where can he like
non-religious people person like Chomsky
get his morality outside of religion
that's a complicated question
I mean he's he was taught well by his
parents I
think you think like his mother yeah and
I think even the way that they were
morally had a lot to do with with his
upbringing and a lot of how his family
was they're all hard workers they're all
a lot of them are doing work in in
they're all active in some way I'm not
saying this well edit cut cut cut oh yes
what they told me like when his first
wife was really sick
Carol yeah Carol when she was really
sick then people they so very much um
ski the kind yeah I wasn't going to
bring that up but there is I think it's
in Columbia there is a forest that was
named after Carol and that happened soon
after she died and he traveled there and
he you know trudged up the mountain in
his sneakers which were coated with mud
and they called Carol spirit in and he
said that that was one of the first
times that he really felt that he felt
that her spirit was there he felt her
there mm-hm and it was a surprise you
told me about to blog can you tell my
viewers about you blog and I love to
promote well my blog is really away from
me not to go crazy because there are a
lot of people that come here Sufis and
heads of state and little you know when
I say little people I mean people who
are just who are doing I shouldn't say
little people people who are doing great
works of activism people are making
documentaries trying to get the word out
there and so many things happen that are
out of the ordinary I think because of
where I am that I had to write about
them or I would blow up and often I
write about nomes interaction you know
if a Sufi comes here and talks to me and
says he goes into gnomes office and he
says Bev I feel it here and I say what
is it you feel and he says the truth I
feel the truth in this office and so
then gnome comes out wearing the Hat
that the Sufi you know gave to him and
rolled and I think I'd like to I think
it's such serious business that it's
it's important to bring the humor into
life all the time and so I I try to
bring humor to Nome and I try to bring
humor to the office and I try to write
with little I mean I can't help but
writing with humor because that's that's
who I am
and so I try to show him in that light
but I thank you so much you know thank
you very much guru D sad

it's any case Tunisia it's 99% Sunni
population yet the nagas and the Muslim
Brotherhood they they couldn't win the
election and they didn't they didn't try
to maintain power by force which i think
is very important
mm-hmm so that's how do you read that
how do you read it how do you understand
that well Tunisia is has been quite if
it's a small country it has it's been
somewhat separate from the general Arab
world even its location and its main is
it because of boogie bear
periods of is it because of the acts
president will give away if it has how
do you see Bourguiba probably what you
remember working well I mean it's he was
a anti imperialist
nationalist who did achieve independence
left a mixed legacy but enough of a
non-violent element to it so that it's
possible for the reformist uprising to
succeed incidentally this was not the
first in the arab spring that was the
second the first is generally forgotten
it was in western sahara right before
the uprising in Tunisia where there were
again efforts by the the to protests
there were tent cities set up crushed by
moroccan force very quickly with the
back were backing of france yes
tacit support of the Western powers it's
worth remembering that there are two
colonies in the Arab world the one is
Western Sahara the others Palestine yes
and the Western Sahara one has been kind
of ignored but it's pretty awful it if
it's pretty horrible I'm in Morocco soon
as they won independence from Spain
Morocco invaded by force Santa
lots of Moroccans to try to overwhelm
the outcome of any referendum which so
far they haven't allowed bitter attack
against the indigenous population led to
a guerilla movement lost REO and and it
continues to try to seek independence
and there was kind of a pre Arab Spring
if you want right just weeks before the
Veneti outbreak
so today's he was actually the second
case okay but it has maintained
maintained itself Egypt as a more
complex and significant significant its
impact and the Sisi repression is pretty
harsh on the other hand there still is
the still there is resistance the labor
movement is oh yeah exit lane like lots
of liberal liberal people and thinkers
one of them is no well saddle your
friend and she's part of the extreme
left if you over the left and one I used
extreme but this is how they qualified
in mainstream media which is I tried not
to be part of that she's she became pro
CC and lots of people they see the hope
in CC instead of the Muslim Brotherhood
well I actually don't want to go into
personal things but yeah I did have
discussions with them yep and I thought
they were making a very serious mistake
okay you cannot expect the military to
bring democracy one time you said sorry
to interrupt one time you said it's
always the story like in the Bible about
King Ahab and prophet Elijah that's
that's that's a good example that's a
very good example of something because
explain it because the biblical story
record and coming from you what the
story is that King Ahab who's the
epitome of evil in the Bible I called
the prophet Elijah to this is in the
book of kings and there he called the
prophet Elijah to him and he
and Elijah for being the Hebrew phrase
is a hairy Sorelle that kind of a
literal translation would be hater of
Israel the reason is that Abdullah Sayid
well the the conception is a typical
totalitarian conception which comes
right to the present from the
totalitarian point of view if you
criticize I of course was criticizing
the acts of the evil King warning about
the dangers denouncing their immorality
against the nation nation as on so and a
hub was capturing that he's since the
Prophet was condemning the acts of the
evil king he was a hater of Israel of
the country and that goes right to the
present it's one of the just give you an
illustration back about the 1972-73 Abba
Eban the Israeli Foreign Minister the
state you know Oxford graduate very
popular in the West he wrote an article
in the one of the liberal American
Jewish journals in which he informed the
Jewish community in the United States
that their test was to show that any
criticism of I said Zionism but it meant
Israel should be either condemned does
anti-semitism or as Jewish self-hatred
that's the the idol that's the a I was
to be the Elijah a little puddle is that
correct can I say that he actually
mentioned me yes the Jewish even haters
of Israel he said he mentioned to the
one I was key I was one is I have stone
was the other I like the company so if
you maybe get that conception of your
anti-semitic if you criticize Israel or
else it's Jewish self-hatred
that's King Ahab you find it in
totalitarian state
it's so for example that I assume I
imagine under the Egyptian dictatorship
of our dictatorship in Europe if you
criticize the the state you were anti
Egyptian in the old Soviet Union if you
if you were a dissident criticize you
know the Kremlin you were anti Soviet
you're against the country that's a
standard phenomenon in totalitarian
societies incidentally it exists in the
United States surprisingly one of the
there's the concept anti-american which
is common in the United States it's
commonly used for critics of US
government actions they're called
anti-american if you criticize if you're
an Italian and you criticize the
government of Italy you're not called
anti Italian no it's a it is a
deep-seated totalitarian conception and
it's kind of intriguing to see that it
does show up in formally democratic
societies and yet is real another case
the Egyptian dictatorship was a case
going back to the support of my friends
you know in Egypt many of them for the
CCT government I think they made a
terrible mistake believing that a
military regime would impose wouldn't
bring about opportunities for democracy
yeah the military regime is going to
protect itself and its own power and in
Egypt that means a big economic system
system of corruption military force
that's what the militaries want to
protect and impose

CC CC get startled so its shadow V&A
tell me a little bit about Chomsky the
friend and Chomsky the man outside of
the academic circles well I find it
difficult to really you know well if I
asked you to talk about a person you
know very well I mean I'll say your son
or a close friend of yours it would be
they hard to say what now he's he's very
serious and when you talk to him about
he's most likely to take any question
that you ask him and interpret it very
technically in the most technical sense
and try to answer you as though you were
a fellow scientist and asked about you
know the the phonemes of English or the
phonemes of Arabic one of the phoneme so
from whatever language and he's likely
to give you are listed in my if I were
to ask him that's what I'd get and
that's why I would ask him because I'd
like to know more about and he probably
knows quite a bit more about it then I
thought about it then I wish I haven't
thought about atheism it's a big topic
now on the other bullet
you see ISM yes and Chomsky like people
they they like to call him atheist and I
talked to him about that he answered me
differently how can you like define
atheism and how do you see it as a
phenomenon well I mean you know it's
like believing in air now do you think
there was air around it or do you think
this system
I mean the space between you and me is
it empty or is it filled over there well
I believe it's over there
now many people believe it's empty and
they're wrong that's all there is to it
I mean we know that the spaces I mean we
can make it work various experiments to
show that the spec for example you
continue breathing you know whatever the
space is between you know now the reason
you can breathe is because there's air
in this space and we know what there is
you know we are not is so much oxygen in
the air so much Hydra hydrogen and we
can perform experiments and remove some
of them from the air and have unpleasant
consequences for us and so there's no
question if you believe in the I mean if
you understand what these experiments do
namely that they actually remove the
these gases from the air then you will
also understand the consequences that
you cannot fill your lungs with these
gases and that causes severe problems to
your lungs and that's pretty can perform
at least in principle and you wouldn't
do that here because I mean we don't
want to hurt you or anybody else but in
principle we could perform such an
experiment and the experiment would show
that because we do not get this nitrogen
or oxygen you know we have problems
breathing I mean our view and this will
have immediate physiological effects on
personal people in this room but if you
have the door closed so that the
atmosphere in in this room was isolated
from the atmosphere outside this room it
would have no effects for me outside the
here on but it will certainly have a
these effects for people who are in this
room if you did that then the kinda we
had a Falabella weekend a villa in
Mahalo said Chomsky
how do you know Chomsky outside of his
books I saw you talking to him yeah well
I've been a fan of Chomsky since because
I I'm doing international relations with
my degree and I've been a fan of his
because of not only his books because of
his old documentaries as well because
I've seen him throughout the decades
performed so much and provides so much
information for students in terms of you
know how ethnicities have moved along
the regions and about linguistics so
I've been a fan for for ages
and you know Pakistani student right I'm
Pakistani and I yeah I'm studying in
Australia as well but I'm Pakistani
originally yes I am planning to go back
to Pakistan teach it would really depend
it would depend on how the story
concerns up but yes definitely that
would be one of the things that I would
consider if if I can if I am
knowledgeable enough and accepted there
yes how was your meeting with a Chomsky
as he phoner students in this place it
was amazing man like I was surprised how
humble he is and how hard Android and
you've seen the office you were there
upstairs it's so like it almost seems
like a regular professor it doesn't seem
like Noam Chomsky up there it seems like
you know someone you would just meet and
without any consideration that he is one
of the biggest in the in the occupation
that he is and yeah I was I was amazed
with that the humbleness and I'm amazed
at the fact that he still makes time for
students and for for people who were not
able to you know who were not at his
level of communication he still takes
that time and you know talks to them and
provides them the information that they
need yes I saw you also taking pictures
with him ever again I see those fixes on
Facebook I'm not on Facebook but yeah
I'll definitely keep those photos
because if I think I'm doing my own
thesis on drones and you know warfare
that kind of thing so I just wanted it
to be more as authentic as possible
because I use his teachings for to write
my own material so if if I can use that
I would use more more so to you know
provide evidence in terms of that I have
met Chomsky and it's not just like I'm
using his material because I've been in
correspondence with him over email and
you know write written to him several
times and he's provided me good
knowledge so the photos are just you
know additional evidence said yeah thank
you it was nice enough to meet me yes
thank you so much oh thank you
nothing is obvious at that time I mean
were there no problems but there
couldn't be any it was in principle
impossible for there to be any more than
official problems
that's I think it's pretty welcome
change its it has historical antecedents
it's had some similarity the early days
of the modern scientific revolution you
go back to say the 17th century Galileo
and others began to be puzzled allow
themselves to be puzzled at things which
had been taken for granted for millennia
so for example why does a rock fall and
steam rise our style explained it going
to their natural place and that story
and that was accepted for millennia as
an explanation as soon as you begin to
ask questions about it everything
immediately falls apart
turns out all your intuitions are wrong
about the rate of fall everything else
and you get modern science and I think
there's a lesson there one that should
have been learning and that is it's very
important to allow himself to be puzzled
by what seemed on the surface seems on
surface to be obvious and that can turn
out to be quite illuminating as I think
we've learned in the last 50 years thank
you for your kindness and I wish all the
best
