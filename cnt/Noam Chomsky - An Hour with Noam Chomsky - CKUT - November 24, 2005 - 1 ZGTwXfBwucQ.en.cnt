good afternoon I'm Joe brother Stan
you're listening to a cket special
presentation joining us from Boston on
the phone is professor Noam Chomsky good
afternoon mr. Chomsky I agree with you
mr. Chomsky has agreed to answer
questions from several members of the ck
UT News collective in the studio i'm
joined by mr. dave hassium miss Brett
story and mr. Scott born each member
will have approximately 18 minutes and
we'll begin with mr. Dave TAS IAM who
has been with the collective for six
months mr. Tessie hello my questions are
essentially media related and my first
question we're all fairly aware of of
what the US is prepared to accept in the
ex-soviet republics of central asia but
what about the ukraine could the orange
revolution be chalked up to something
positive that the u.s. is finally done
as an imperial force the US didn't have
much to do with it it was coming from
inside the Ukraine the Ukraine is sort
of split there's an eastern part and
Western party geographically the eastern
part is mostly the old manufacturing
section working class and so on the
western part is more oriented toward
Western Europe it's a bigger range
professional some people who want to be
part of Western European society and the
split was approximately that it was kind
of a class split and the ones who want
to be part of Western society or they'll
have more formal democratic systems less
probably lesson in the way of support
systems for working people and so on and
some respect like West nice Germany work
so this split and the United States is
of course on the side of the more
westernized ones but the developments i
think threaten see were mostly
internally right a year later we don't
see much of a positive upswing in
Ukraine though it's true isn't it yeah
but look what happened after the fall of
Berlin Wall I'm at the fall of Berlin
Wall led to a
but more or less happened this is the
old communist party hierarchy figured it
would be better off if they became like
the typical third world elite so which
is what they become very corrupt many of
them very wealthy and so on oligarchs
etc but for the population of total
disaster I mean it was it it was a
economic and demographic disaster in
Eastern Europe nobody has the numbers
but the the extra deaths over the
expected in Russia are estimated at
somewhere in the 5 to 10 million that 5
10 million range that's almost at the
level of stalin's purge in 1930s and the
economy went a little tail spin it
became pretty much a third world economy
I meant not badly off but that's because
they have a lot of resources so you can
sell it on oil and so on and so forth
but it's basically robbing resources to
enrich sector of people who are two very
tightly linked to the west if you visit
Moscow and be there been there but I
read and I'm told I'd say you know this
is all the glitter of fashionable
sections of New York maybe more but
that's true of every third world country
on the one hand tremendous concentrated
wealth and elegance and high fashion and
so on right next to very serious masses
of serious poverty and even misery
that's the third world that's basically
what they became at a huge human cost an
enormous blow to the economy Ukraine
that hasn't happened at least but it's
right there hasn't been very much and
we've change and I didn't really expect
it I'm going to shift over to Iraq now
and ask a question as many many seem to
claim that the after fumbling the ball
initially the media is now mainstream
media do
a better job on Iraq coverage could you
comment on that well frankly I think the
job is just shockingly embarrassing
that's not the US media all the Western
media as far as I know I mean I suppose
we were in Nazi Germany let's say in
1943 with the only question be how can
we make sure that our efforts our
success is there a better strategy is we
make a mistake by starting a two-front
war and maybe we should do something
else to try to make it work better and
was that the only question is listen I
mean just driving in this morning I
happen to be listening to the National
Public Radio it supposed to be the
liberal media and happy listening
discussion of this that's the only
question what went wrong how can we make
sure we succeed can we do it better
where we mislead into getting into the
war I mean there's another question
after all same question that was raised
at the Nuremberg trials what right you
have to invade another country why were
people hanged at Nuremberg because they
committed with the nuremberg tribunals
called the supreme international crime
which encompasses within it all the evil
that follows namely the act of
aggression attacking another country in
fact the german foreign minister
Ribbentrop one of the main charges
against him was that he participated in
a pre-emptive war the invasion of norway
on the grounds that it posed a threat to
germany as infected it but but that was
considered enough grounds for hanging in
the American justice at the chief
counsel American chief counsel at
Nuremberg Robert Jackson at the end of
the tribunal when these notice that the
people charged at Nuremberg were not
low-level soldiers who worked hurt
somebody or push someone into a gas
chamber or something they weren't tried
at Nuremberg the ones who tried with the
leadership top leadership I mean if they
never pushed that he went through a gas
chamber they're the ones were charged
uh and Jackson's even eloquent duration
in which he said these crimes he said we
should recognize that we are creating
what he called a poisoned chalice we may
have to drink from it if we commit the
same crimes we should be subjected the
same judgment otherwise the trial of
Nuremberg is not justice but just
punishment by the victors well okay
lekin twerked anybody lived up to it
ever since let's go back to Iraq can you
think of a more open and flagrant case
of plain outright aggression does that
question even arise no the only question
arises is well you know how can we make
the best success of it and that's
typical same is true of the Vietnam War
outright aggression the same is true of
the US terrorist war in Nicaragua which
in fact Falls almost explicitly under
the definition of aggression given by
Justice Jackson at Nuremberg although
maybe you could just call in
international terrorism if you want to
be kind to the Reagan administration
that these questions ever arise would
the media ever even consider them not
just the media the journals of opinion
in fact the scholarship huh we just do
not apply to ourselves the standards we
insist upon for others which is just you
know that's the lowest level of moral
depravity the most elementary moral
principle you can imagine is that you
apply at least the same you've applied
the same standards yourself to others
actually stricter standards if you want
to be serious but at least the same
standards that's almost unthinkable in
Western discourse not just the media and
from then on it just theories everything
follows from the totalling capacity even
to think
the thought that we ought to be subject
to the standards we impose on others
anyone who proposes that is considered a
madman analytic conspiracy theorist or
whatever order upset Osama bin Laden
whatever the latest insult an individual
scandal that seems to be addressing the
issue of why America went to war and
Judith Miller I'm speaking of that and
we noticed that the media focuses a lot
on individuals and their scandals and
can any change be hoped for by looking
at Libby and Rove and identifying the
bad eggs well there are no bad eggs I
mean is I was tracking fact about the
first of all Judith Miller I'm here
reports were awful it was a busy time
but wasn't it obvious to New York time
editors they were saying pretty much the
same things in her editorials take a
look at their editorials pretty much the
same gotta do something the next thing
we'll hear from Iraq will be a mushroom
cloud and so on and so forth if and
that's across the board not just the New
York Times read The Canadian Press that
carefully but it's the same the nuances
of difference I mean there's a very
striking fact about the political
situation in the United States now I
mean so striking that many mainstream
political commentators have pointed it
out the the Bush administration and the
Republican Party are in pretty serious
straight there a lot of popular is
affection with them they're like doing
you know they've gotten themselves into
all kinds of domestic and international
disasters but the Democrats aren't
gaining anything from it the only thing
that they're gaining is decline in the
popularity of the Bush administration
why aren't they presenting some
alternative well there's a reason they
really don't have any alternative to
present they mostly went along with all
of this were they going to say well
there's an O an alternative path perhaps
that I've read about in the work of gay
heart senator Gary Hart who says in a
recent book of his i think it's called
the fourth power that America should
consolidate itself as a republic the
republic that it once was and he softly
criticizes the imperial aspirations of
america not an alternative yeah that's
what most of the population wants but if
you take a look at public opinion in the
united states has studied with great
intensity if you look at public opinion
yes it turns out that both political
parties are very far to the right of the
general population on a whole host of
issues including this one i mean from
most of the large majority the public
makes a pretty conservative view of the
UN Charter which rules out very
explicitly any kind of preventive war
preemptive war that's a major the major
work right and the public says the same
thing large majority the public's is
that the use of force should not be
permitted except under attack or even
threat of attack I which of course
didn't arise at this point why did the
public least the majority of it support
the war well you know because they were
there was a meet government media
propaganda campaign beginning in
September 2002 they're really frightened
people yeah Saddam Hussein is coming to
get us coward fear and New York Times
everyone else was part of it so yes
people were afraid our lives are in
danger we got to protect ourselves well
talk about that anymore but the public
was driven in the war and that's true on
this case and it's true on a whole range
of other cases so it's a very simple
quite conservative proposal as to how to
create an alternative in the United
States namely pay some attention to the
attitudes of the public the public
opinion there's an enormous gap between
public opinion and public policy well
and
turn ative is to let public opinion have
some influence may be a significant
influence on policy or to put it simple
it more simply an alternative is to move
towards becoming a functioning democracy
instead of a system with formal
democratic democratic forms but very
little substance public just didn't part
of it and knows it incidentally one of
the reasons for the disaffection so sure
there are alternatives but the political
leadership the media the corporate
system are not going to push them they
don't want the public public opinion to
have a role in policy and there's a good
reason when you look at what allah
pinion is so take for example i would
just take one example the every roughly
februari the administration comes out
with a budget so last February's a
second Bush administration came out with
its federal budget well immediately
after the budget came out there was a
serious study by the major polling
institution in the country of people's
attitudes toward the budget turns out
that they're virtually a mirror image of
the budget worthy budget was going to go
up population wanted to go down and this
is large majorities incidentally so
military spending supplementals for Iraq
and Afghanistan that sort of thing
budget going way up public wants to go
way down where the budget is going down
public wants to go up again by large
majorities social spending education
renewable energy huge majorities support
for the United Nations enormous
majorities and so on when you get to
taxes a very large majority the public
wants to rescind Bush's tax cuts for the
rich as for people with incomes over two
hundred thousand dollars which is the
major tax cut that's an overwhelming
majority the Congressional plans are to
cut it for
I mean in fact it's not a caricature the
opinions and budget are virtually a
mirror image well in a Democratic
Society there's nothing more important
than for people to know what their
neighbors think I can have a functioning
Democratic Society if each person thinks
I must be a lunatic because what they
tell me in the press is everybody thinks
something else you know how much
coverage has had zero was a big search
by people who databases who couldn't
find one report even a small newspaper
of people's attitudes toward the budget
at it it indicates doesn't suggest a
very serious erosion of functioning
democracy which does suggest a very
definite and extremely conservative
alternative let's reconstruct a more
democratic society I think that
democracy promotion in Iraq which is a
joke about democracy promotion right
here I'm Joe Brad reston you're
listening to a ck UT special
presentation with noam chomsky and now
we'll hear from Miss Brett's story who
has been with the ck UT news collected
for three years miss Tori hi professor
Chomsky think for speaking with us this
afternoon but I'd like to just continue
with this domestic focus for a little
while and ask you a few questions about
the mechanisms of power as deployed here
in liberal democracies such as Canada
and the United States first I just like
to ask you to comment on what seems to
be the most glaring repudiation of
international law and indeed even
domestic moral sensibilities enacted by
the Bush administration which is the
installation of torture into the fabric
of American military and intelligence
operations this is exemplified of course
in recent revelations of secret CIA
interrogation facilities in Eastern
Europe but also the the legislated
attempts to exempt CIA operations from
John McCain's anti-torture amendment to
the defense appropriations bill I do
was wondering if you could comment about
the functions you think this commitment
to torture serve very specifically in
the in the modern context in the modern
political landscape well you're quite
right it is very shocking I mean so
shocking that it has scandalized the
constitutional lawyers you know
conservative story ends of the justice
system and so on you take a look at the
journals of international law and so on
they're just utterly outraged I the
journal of the american academy of arts
and sciences which is about as
respectable as you can get had an
article by a very distinguished academic
specialist and lawyer on constitutional
on the Constitution constitutional
lawyer in which he said literally he
said that the eminence grise of the Bush
administration he said his Carl Schmitt
that was Hitler's legal counselor and
then he went on to say that the concept
of presidential authority being crafted
by the Justice Department is following
Carl Schmitz a concept of what the the
Fuehrer is allowed to do you don't find
work like words like that in super
respectable conservative journals very
often and there's a very detailed
discussions in the law journal yeah it's
outrageous I Gonzalez who was considered
too liberal to be appointed the Supreme
Court he was president legal counsel and
he advised he gave some very interesting
advice to the president in a memorandum
of 2002 first of all he said that we
should put aside the geneva conventions
which are the foundations of modern
international humanitarian law because
he said their provisions are his words
were quaint and obsolete okay so we get
rid of that and then he urged Bush
advised Bush as his legal counsel to
formally rescind the Geneva Conventions
elements of them because he said that
would reduce the probability of
prosecution under international law in
other words you're going to be carrying
out major violations of fundamental
international law see therefore better
rescind the law and in fact that makes
good sense because there's a quite apart
from international law there was a war
crimes act passed by Congress Republican
Congress incidentally and it was 1996
which makes were called grave breaches
of the Geneva Conventions a war crime
that is punishable by death okay ya
better resend it or else you're going to
be in trouble even under domestic law
yes that's happening and it's a pen
utter scandal I mean how it ranks in
comparison with the blatant act of
aggression and you know virtual
destruction of another country I don't
know how it ranks with that you can't
make that measure but it's very serious
this the Bush administration is quite
openly turning the United States into
what's called in the literature and
outlaw state a state that has butter and
total contempt for international law and
opinion of others and so on we call that
an outlaw state um it's not that they're
breaking entirely new ground on this
remember that the United States is the 0
is now the only country in the world
that has rejected a world worth judgment
it used to have company ojos albania had
done so but now Albania move toward the
civilized world and accepted the
judgment which leaves the US in splendid
isolation and a not on a trivial matter
that's on a matter of international
terrorism the court ordered you know the
Reagan administration 1986 to terminate
herb or against Nicaragua pay
substantial reparations the u.s.
disregarded it bipartisan rejection
incidentally media as well the New York
Times simply dismissed the court is what
it called a hospital forum because it
ruled against the United States so
therefore we can disregard it the
Nicaraguan brought the case to the
Security Council where the u.s. vetoed
two resolutions endorsing the court
judgment Britain politely abstained
that's unique and it's not a marginal
issue the ocean fact escalated the war
and went on virtually destroy the
country that's pretty serious fact not
kind of fact you're going to read about
in the media or journals or history
books and so on but a fact yes so it's
not that the other many other cases the
Bush administration however is breaking
totally new ground and torture is
horrible enough invasion is horrible
enough but in some ways there's even
more serious cases so I mean the fate of
the species it's not a exaggeration to
say that the fate of the human species
is in danger real danger from there to
major dangers one of them is nuclear war
which would be probably the end and it's
you know can't give a number but it's a
the danger is increasing I mean again
you can read in the most respectable
conservative journals leading strategic
analysts pointing out that rumsfeld's
transformation of the meat of the
military it carries I'm quoting an
appreciable risk of ultimate doom and
the doom is not always considered so
ultimate Robert McNamara had an article
in one of the leading foreign policy
journals called apocalypse soon because
the same policies one of the
barriers to that with the
non-proliferation treaty it has a
regular five-year review that last one
was in May is it a portal disaster the
media version is because they ran
wouldn't agree to tighten up the
non-proliferation treaty but the real
reason if you look and I think Canadian
foreign minister may have pointed out is
that the u.s. was simply refusing to
live up to its obligations under the
tree that quite openly said said in
effect we're bound by the tree okay
that's it could be the death knell of
the species it's also dismantled the
whole array of international treaties
that were part of the NPT bargain that's
one side incomes environmental
destruction as fast total as nuclear war
but it's very serious you can't pretend
it's not there unless you happen to be
in the White House there was the
meetings in the g8 meetings the
industrial countries in Scotland last
July right before the meeting the
National Academies of science of all
eight countries that includes the US
National Academy joined by China India
Brazil and others issued a strong plea
to the g8 leaders to take urgent action
to deal with an impending catastrophe
well they couldn't get much reported
here but Canada but the British
Financial Times into the world's major
business journal they described it very
straight out they said look we're facing
a really serious global problem there's
got to be something done about it but
there's one difficulty the White House
says it doesn't believe the scientific
evidence they just ridiculed but that's
a fact
and therefore they said that the
conclusions of the g8 meeting were just
meaningless words that's pretty serious
and again it's over the overwhelming
objection of the American population
population is very strongly supports the
Kyoto Protocol neither the political
parties does but the population does
that supports is so strongly that a
majority of Bush voters Bush voters
think that he supported it because they
regarded as so obvious
