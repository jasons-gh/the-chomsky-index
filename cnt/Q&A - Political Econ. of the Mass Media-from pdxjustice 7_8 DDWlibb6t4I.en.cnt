well there are probably accurate apart
from the fact that the sources were
accurate in the past presumably the Bush
administration will keep some low level
of support for mercenaries and
terrorists inside Nicaragua they assume
that the level will be so low that the
cooperative press will be silent about
it as they've been so far and that's
important because that means Nicaragua
can't be mobilize and it's important to
keep them mobilized for one thing
because when you mobilize the society is
repressive just like the United States
during World War two which was virtually
totalitarian and if their repressive you
can use that for propaganda so you can
get you know the Neiman fellows to cry
about repression and so on in the manner
that I described so you want to do that
you want to keep them repressive you
want to keep mobilized you want to make
sure that they can't divert they're
extremely limited resources to
reconstruction from this fantastic
damage second thing the United States
will try to do if Congress and the press
goes along they will do is maintain a
contra force on the Honduran border
that's what all this humanitarian aid
nonsense is about you want to maintain
the force on the border and violation of
everything as I pointed out and the
reason again is you maintain a threat as
long as you maintain a military threat
you can ensure that the government won't
be mobilize okay and that's important
because we wanted to suffer but of
course that's less at a lower level than
terror you know the idea is precisely
get back your point yeah also you
continue the economic warfare and the
pressure international lending
institutions intimidate the allies so
they won't give made and so on all of
this was abetted incidentally by the
hurricane the hurricane was a
devastating blow close to a billion
dollars in damage the United States of
course doesn't give a penny fact they
love it you know there gloating over it
the the other allies the US allies are
giving them a pittance like Canada and
whiskey over giving them virtually
nothing partly because they're
intimidated by Big Brother and partly
because they're a lot more colonized
than they like to believe you know they
like to believe they're all independent
and free thinkers and so on mostly the
European intellectuals believe every bit
of nonsense they read from the American
press the amount of cultural
colonization is very high
though they don't they're not aware of
it so it's so so you know they're all
upset about sending mr. repression
although the repression in El Salvador
and Guatemala which is a thousand times
worse that doesn't bother them at all so
they keep giving them aid so there's
that and you know this combination of
operations it is assumed will prevent
Nicaragua from recovering after all
that's the point the point is to prevent
what Thomas poor Thomas work I had it
right on that nose you got to prevent
them from constructing a society that
works because if they do others are
going to emulate it and pretty soon us
combination of the region is going to
erode and besides that kind of rot can
spread to other places where people have
similar problems and decide to use their
resources for their own ends and so on
you get real trouble so you got to
prevent it from working and the United
States certainly has the means to do
that short of the Reaganite absurdity of
just in you know inflicting pain and
terror for its own sake well that's the
kinder gentler methods and one part of
that has got to be to cut back the
coverage you know part of that is the
role of the media stop recording it so
people forget about it and don't notice
it and so on and the idea is the effect
will be your quiet domestic descent
you'll return the public to apathy and
obedience by stop by not reporting this
stuff anymore so I think your point is
precisely accurate the role of the media
in this system is precisely to keep
quiet about what's going on and I expect
we will find less coverage I mean you
know you'll find coverage when you can
you know you can find something you'll
call sandanista oppression or when you
if there's mass starvation as there may
well be because of the hurricane that'll
be covered and it'll be attributed to
sending us the incompetents nor
mismanagement or something so that kind
of thing will be covered or here's
another thing that will be covered the
next big move it's already been
announced is for the Contras to demand
that they've asked for ten million
dollars to establish an independent
television station in Nicaragua well if
Nicaragua allows what it was called an
independent television station that
means it's telling the United States you
take over our television
there is no way in the world in which a
small country can compete with the
United States and television I'm asses
out of the question you know I mean if
Nicaragua continues to do what most
countries do and have state television
if it then of course they can be
announced as totalitarians notice we
don't denounce Israel as being
totalitarian because it has only state
television but that's the usual
dichotomy so the idea is now we demand
that Nicaragua having a television
station run by the United States with a
beginning capital of 10 million dollars
which by how many Nicaraguan standards
is you don't even have discuss it it's
you know it's off the wall and the
United States already dominates the
media in much of the country much of the
media the only thing you hear is us
radio from powerful radio transmitters
in honduras and costa rica and even
television if they can if the united
states can put a television station
right in Managua with all the resources
the United States can pour into it I'm
they just you know that's the propaganda
agency for all of Nicaragua so that's
the next thing and the media will be all
excited about this and that'll be the
test of freedom you know they're only
free if they allow the total
communication system to be run by the
united states otherwise they're
totalitarians that'll be the next line
that comes along and there'll be that
kind of coverage but no coverage about
what's going on that's got a decline
precisely so that the American movement
will decline and people will go back to
the passivity and obedience that becomes
them as I said so I think your point is
quite accurate and the question as usual
as whether the American population is
gonna let them get away with it no
that's the device we don't forget it
work Bravo mr. Chomsky you're very brave
this is about the UN I don't get
information from the New York Times in
the ABC NBC all the news when I want
information I go to the specialized
agencies of the UN and there you can
find no where did they know that the
population of the world was five billion
you when got that information
information on the radioactivity of the
air and so forth they have a vast amount
of information they also had information
about cesium in milk products which were
going to highly populated areas Boston
in New York for two years the UN had
this information citizens groups
badgered the media to bring this
information it is never there but if you
went we were able to get that
information so what we did is we wrote a
proposal which was presented to the
General Assembly because we felt that we
as parents have a right to vital
information about the food and the water
in the air and the UN has that
information it just sits there so we
wrote this proposal calling for a
two-way global information service we
presented it to the General Assembly
very well in 87 at the International
Conference on the relationship between
disarmament and development was a very
important conference it received very
good support the year later we try to
present the proposal again this time we
had gained the support of the Swedish
government the Australian Government and
Costa Rica there was violent violent
opposition to the proposal to the point
where two ambassadors were told that
they would be terminated if they in any
