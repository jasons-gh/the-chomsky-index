a very good measure of how democratic a
society is is to ask about the attitude
towards taxes I mean if you had a free
functioning democratic society April
15th
you know when you pay your taxes that
would be a day of celebration here we
are getting together to fund the
policies that we decided on that's great
that's what we want to do here it's a
day of mourning that's not a government
of by and for the people know that
itself is a sign of the serious decline
of the functioning of the democratic
system
