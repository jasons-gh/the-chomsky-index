since of other things so question is
whether to reduce the constraints enough
so that they can enter into
international markets and Bush gave a
speech in which he said well we can
never forgive the Vietnamese from what
they did to us of course but we're
gracious people so we will agree to
allow them some entry into the
international system but only if they
face up to the one moral issue that
remains after the war what's the one
moral issue well finding the bones of
American pilots who they viciously shot
down in their aggression against us over
North Vietnam not a word of protest look
even because if you do media studies
could look back big public
pronouncements not a word protest that's
taken for granted you know part of their
aggression against us was defending
their villages then it got worse they
were addicting our army which is a myth
then comes there they didn't find the
bones of our soldiers that he
maliciously shot down like over central
Iowa or something and that goes on right
until the day I mean kind of stuff about
the POWs were never returned I guess you
and so on but well that was a it's an
amazing propaganda achievement which was
extremely successful and the drug war
was a large part of it well you know
these were among the ways of trying to
there were many others like for example
raising college tuitions for those of
you earn college I'm mostly going to
come out of college with a big debt why
is it is it for economic reasons it's
not for economic reasons let me take a
poor country like Mexico affect most
countries education is free public
education is free for practically free
in the United States a super rich
country education is extremely expensive
even in public universities and the idea
is to impose a heavy debt so that you're
trapped you come out of college with a
debt you're trapped you're going to do
with the system demands I mean you may
have done the law school with the
intention of becoming a public interest
lawyer but if you come out with you know
fifty thousand dollars in debt you're
gonna have to go to work for corporate
law firm and you could tell yourself
well I'm just going to go work there
till I pay off my debt but you know once
you get into the corporate law firm
culture it's going to be really hard to
break out of it because of for all sorts
of reasons as you can see on television
so it's a way of trapping people and the
whole pile of other techniques that are
used but interestingly they didn't work
they work to an extent but any more
activism group and other forms of
activism grew when they are still
growing so global justice movement so
there any movements and so on so too
that's it it's a long story but i think
it's it's a good history to review and
to learn from you can struggle against
these things is particularly striking in
the light of history you know just about
every war leads to radicalization of the
population didn't start to think words
sort of stir things up and the
radicalization leads to a repression
almost reflexively so during this first
world war the population was to summit
in the labor movement labour activism
popular concerns of all kind Woodrow
Wilson instituted was called the Red
Scare after the war the worst repression
in American history crushed the labor
movements crushed independent thought
led to a decade of passivity the 1920s
which was considered kind of end of
history yeah the Masters of one
everything is fine again the depression
that didn't change the Second World War
was the same the Second World War which
had come right after the Great
Depression that radicalized populations
all over the world in Europe Asia the
United States everywhere and there was a
large-scale repression afterwards they
would do it now but the first task of
the British and American conquerors was
to destroy the anti-fascist resistance
everywhere in the world and to reimpose
the traditional order including fascist
collaborators that was one part of it so
first should be chapter one of post-war
history actually began in around 1943
when they started moving into Europe but
it happened at home too there was a
massive propaganda campaign also
legislative and so on to try to destroy
the radicalized labor movement and
popular to say popular concerns and it
was pretty successful it's kind of like
Wilson's red scared so it's called
McCarthyism but that's very missing the
1950s were very quiet passive decade for
the motorsport I like the 1920s then
came the 60s and more than blew up again
well after the vietnam war led to the
same kind of thinking concerns activism
radicalization and there was the
expected repression which it were still
living with you know it's still going on
but it was much less effective it didn't
have the same dampening effect as the
traditional ones of that and i think
both the activism and the repression are
still underway we're right in the middle
of that struggle so I think that's
roughly speaking
history of getting back to the Iraq war
by the time the erect the records the
first first time in imperial history
there was hundreds of years there was
massive protest before the war
officially began and we actually now
know from leaked information that the
word or has been underway for about a
year but we didn't know it done so
before the war began that was huge
international purpose and I think that
put a significant break on them what the
US and British client were able to do
leading to the kinds of consequences
talked about before which are it's still
an ongoing battle shifting gears and
looking at another topic we know that
not too long ago you travel down to
Venezuela and met with President Hugo
Chavez what was your evaluation of both
Chavez and the boulevard revolution well
first i was there from that 20 hours i
think valuation of anything i spent some
time talking each other so it too I was
pretty impressed with this person we
talked frankly openly asked questions
you know answered questions some of the
answers are pretty interesting things I
didn't know so for example one thing
that I have been and we don't have a lot
of documentation from that period so we
can we don't real information except
peripheral about what US policy planning
was what were they thinking in
Washington his version of it at least
which I really thought of it sounded
plausible to me is that at first when he
took office
he was treated as kind of a like a bet
you know kind of a bad boy but not
really dangerous so we'll kind of
civilized him even when he visited
Castro he said he was still just tapped
on the wrist and said left but he said
policy really turned against him sharply
when he took part in an OPEC meeting the
oil cartel and convinced them as he did
to lower oil production which would
raise prices prices were very low at the
time I know they did agree to reduce
collection he said at that time he
switched from you know bad boy but no
problem to a real enemy and ever since
then the real hostility he was touching
a sore point you don't fiddle with us
domination of the global energy system
and a couple of other things I mean to
evaluate what's going on I can tell it's
complicated a lot a lot of things are
happening I saw a few things but not
enough to running conclusion not enough
to modify what I can figure out just by
reading today I'll be talking about the
Middle East so we won't ask you too much
about that but something a bit more
personal not to us at all if it's there
being any difficulties being Jewish and
being in solidarity with the Palestinian
people I'm not sure
there's a standard actually the Israeli
statesman famous is early States manabe
Evan very much respected considered a
leading vote back in around nineteen
early seventies I guess he wrote an
interesting article she might want to
take a look at it appeared in Congress
weekly it's the Journal of the American
Jewish Congress sort of more kind of
liberal wing of the organized Jewish
community and in the article he
described the he lectured to American
Jews about their task they said their
task is to show that criticism of he
said he called it criticism of Zionism
means criticism of the policies of the
State of Israel Mount Zion isn't so
criticism of the policies of State of
Israel is either anti-semitism or
neurotic Jewish self-hatred that's their
task okay that covers one hundred
percent of criticism so we don't worry
about criticism and he sort of captured
that's what you have to do if non-jews
criticized the policies of Israel to
anti-semitism and that wipes that off
like you could see it with the flick
toilet or just pick anything you like if
Jews criticize that it's neurotic self
hatred actually Evan picked two examples
at the time one of them was me naturally
the other was Izzy stone it's kind of
interesting because busy stone was a
really dedicated scientist and in fact
free right wing Zionists he was
supporting your gun you know the
right-wing terrorist groups but by the
late 1960s and early 70s he was becoming
pretty critical of the occupation
policies so that was neurotic Jewish
self-hatred those two cases and you know
you're faced with that of course
it has deep origins in Jewish history
here nobody knows anything but in Israel
it's kind of interesting in Israel
because there they study the Bible when
you go through key purpose schools in
Israel you study the Bible maybe you
forget everything like when we study
American is going to forget everything
but at least they study it and if you
study the Bible you know that this idea
has built the largest some of you had
the right kind of religious education
may recall that in the Bible League
there is one figure whose the absolute
epitome of evil as King Ahab you know
the worst a havin Jezebel all you
remember that stuff so King Ahab was the
ultimate evil king and at one point they
had called to him the prophet Elijah and
Elisha came and they had condemned him
as for his translates as a hater of
Israel okay that's the origin of the
conception of neurotic Jewish
self-hatred and in fact it's the origin
of the conception of anti-americanism a
hab why was Elijah a hater of Israel
because he was condemning the act to the
evil king he was Elijah like the other
prophets was what we would call a
dissident intellectual he was
criticizing state policy is giving to
political analysis he was calling for
bringing in moral values you know
concern for widows and orphans that sort
of thing norm what we would call a
dissident intellectual critical
inflation and of course the prophets are
treated very badly but that's driven
into the desert in prison
denounced and so on but that's normal
that's the way critical intellectuals
are treated in every society so anyway
Elijah was a hater of Israel and you can
understand a hubs point he was pure
totalitarian natural Layton's the king
and if he criticized the king you're
criticizing Israel because enough to a
pure totalitarian the state is
identified with the country you know the
society the culture the people it's all
the state that's pure totalitarianism so
if you criticize the state and its
policies you're criticizing the country
and the culture and so on so that's
that's actually if you take if you think
about the concept of anti-american isn't
what you hear all the time it's the same
thing pure totalitarianism you criticize
the acts of the state your anti-american
pura totalitarianism in fact the only
countries where this concept that even
used I think are in the United States
and in real totalitarian states so like
in the old Soviet Union if you criticize
the state you were anti-soviet in the
Brazilian military dictatorship if you
criticize the dictatorship your auntie
Brazilian in the United States if you
criticize state policy or anti-american
and the u.s. propaganda us power are so
enormous that in Europe which is very
subservient to the United States
culturally they don't
to admit it think they're very
independent but they basically kind of
reflexively adopt u.s. attitudes they
also use the concept that American not
recognizing that they're just
demonstrating that are pure
totalitarians well that's straight back
biblical origins and yeah and that's
Evans lecture to Americans and American
Jews and sure you get that all the time
I sell yourself hatred you know it just
compass apart it comes with a turf you
know it's nothing to get upset about
guns it's what I happen and it's not
just on this issue I mean you take any
issue that in the United States support
for Israel is kind of reflexive but if
you go to say England where support for
is really strong but not as reflexive is
here that have their own analyze you go
to England that you try to criticize the
holiness of the u.s. British bombing of
Serbia which is kind of like a religious
doctrine there you get the same thing
you know you're supporting terror or any
American so I mean States ten states and
cultures do tend to have religious
doctrines that the intellectual classes
adhere through and propagate and
typically they support power systems and
if you question them you know you just
too you're going to face one or another
kind of punishment depends on the nature
of the society you know if you're in say
Eastern Europe and the put Stalin hero
and save Czechoslovakia you get thrown
into jail like Cabo
an American dependency like El Salvador
get your head blown off like that's
happened repeatedly but it just depends
on the nature of the society if you're
in the United States you get villa phone
but maybe sometimes worse but but it
comes with tariffs you just expected I
mean yes if you question power systems
that are going to like it and that every
power system has a class of people
called intellectuals who are basically
state worshipers power worshipers and
they're going to overwhelmingly perform
their task which is to defend our
against critical analysis if I can't do
it by argument evidence they'll do a
base slander and vilification and if you
happen to be in El Salvador blowing your
brains oh it's it's just you can't get
upset about it if it didn't happen it
would be a miracle
looking more broadly at vision for the
type of society that we want what are
your thoughts on the development of how
we relate to children as a society and
as parents and what do you believe our
roles and responsibilities are when it
comes to raising children and enabling
them to participate positively in
society you answered it you should help
children that grow in ways which enable
in the parts to participate
constructively and there are a lot of
ways to do that so for example children
do require a certain level of discipline
so just my personal experience and once
I had three kids and once I saw one of
my kids on the hand she cried she had
put her hand we have an electric stove
she's about three years old her hand on
the electric drill you know it stays hot
after the stuff goes also grabbed her
hand and slapped it okay you see Brian's
you like it but she learned not to put
her hand on the stove well I don't think
it's a terrible thing to do there is
their art points at which you have to
impose limits for the safety of the
child but for the most part that
children should just be encouraged to
explore the world and use their natural
creative instincts and give them every
opportunity to it
just like things that just come natural
any sensible parent it can construct
some fancy rhetoric about it sometimes
done but I think it's pretty simple most
things that have to consume affairs Oh
anything affairs either we don't
understand it because it's too complex
or it's so simple we can describe it
simply again intellectuals have a task
of making it look complicated but it's
very hard to see my justification for
the complication look it's almost not a
little bit of an exaggeration but it's
pretty close to true that either we
don't understand it because it's way too
complex or else we sort of understand it
we can put it in simple terms and we all
sort of know it as soon as we think
about it I'll kids any things were found
to say about respectful children what
pitfalls and benefits do you see in
Perry calm which is very in da mix Harry
Potter do you think it is an ideal form
of future socialism why or why not if it
turns out or if the evidence seems to
suggest that competitive behavior is
intrinsic the aiken intrinsic component
of human nature what does that imply for
the core ideals about participatory
society that's I mean Mike and I have
been talking about this for decades but
my own feeling is I'm kind of skeptical
about detailed planning of a society
partly for the reason i just mentioned i
don't think we know enough about human
beings and about society's to be able to
sketch in great detail how they should
or would behave under various
issues so maybe this is the right way
but my feeling is that has to be a lot
of experimentation different kinds of
forms of cooperation and mutual support
which relate have to be considered there
may be lots of options so may not have
made consequences we haven't thought of
some of them may work out in different
ways I mean I think they're there the
particular questions that can be raised
but for example should people be
remunerated on the basis of effort I
don't think that's obvious I think
there's some justification and the old
principle to each according to his needs
from each according to its ability okay
that's a pretty conservative position
about a majority of americans think that
that's so obvious there must be in the
Constitution literally and I think it is
a sort of this is when Americans say
it's in the Constitution that just means
you know obviously true because nobody
knows what's in Constitution but there
was actually they've been several polls
have shown that and I think it's a
pretty reasonable position so I'm not
convinced that remuneration according
the effort is the right idea try it see
you try living City and so on and
exactly what kind of the idea of
distributing work equitably it's a nice
ideal but I'm not sure it's the right
idea and it may be that some people are
just different than the kinds of work
that they're happy doing and it seems to
me that's it competing ideal so you have
to ask how to reconcile those two things
and there are a lot of other questions
that arise along the way I don't have
answers to
they have to be worked out by experiment
there was a second part to that if if
what if it turns out or if the evidence
seems to suggest that competitive
behavior is intrinsic component of human
nature what does that imply for this
futures as the type of society but we
know that competitive behaviors
intrinsic to human nature because people
do it I mean and we know that
cooperation is intrinsic to human nature
because people do it human nature allows
a lot of options which ones tend to
predominate depends on all sorts of
things including social circumstances
culture social support power systems and
so on you can't say much about human
nature we ought to be really cautious
about that notion of course there's an
intrinsic human nature has got to be
otherwise it'd be angels so yes there's
an intrinsic human nature it's probably
highly restricted there's some domains
where we can even learn something about
how restrictive it is and it's a very
restricted we don't see the restrictions
because we take it for granted like we
take it for granted that everybody's
kind of like us how else could you be
you know but some other creature looking
at us would find what we do extremely
puzzling remember that it's well to
remember the history of science for
about 2,000 years scientists took it as
just obvious that if you'd attached an
apple from a tree it falls down instead
of going on and if you boil water the
steam goes up not down and the reason
was obvious they're going to their
natural place that was considered an
answer by scientists for 2,000 years on
a small amount of time and not stupid
people finally in the 17th century that
people will be a few people exit Galileo
we're willing to be puzzled about what
seems obvious well soon as you start
being puzzled about what seems up is
you immediately see we don't understand
anything you know we don't understand
why things some things fall down and
others go up now when you start to look
into it you find that other assumptions
that were made about it just collapse
like the idea that rate of fall depends
on mass when that's on these except it's
false and it was shown to be false not
at his fatal indicates but Galileo
dropping balls off the top of the pap
Tower of Pisa if he tried that probably
wouldn't work but most experiments don't
work he showed it by a thought
experiment like most of what sort of
proof very ingenious thought experiment
very convincing but the basic point is
that people allowed themselves to be
puzzled they quickly discovered that
nothing is understood and you get the
origins of modern science well you know
we haven't yet allowed ourselves to be
puzzled about human behavior we haven't
reached the point psychologically of the
Galilean revolution we just take for
granted that people kind of things they
do and they look like they do and so on
and so forth but everything about it is
quite pleasantly when you start thinking
about it on my own particular interest
in syria's you made mainly acquisition
of language and you know the general
assumptions how could there be anything
puzzling about it look we all do it you
know infants do it and so on so forget
it it's all obvious teacher training
induction
analogy whatever that is and so on well
that's like pre Galilean physic apples
falling to the ground and steam rising
so to see a lot of yourself to be puzzle
if you find that it's extraordinarily
strange that it happens and the ways in
which it happens show that there's a
highly restrictive human nature that
leads to a very few options and the same
is true every domain you look at vision
planning physical growth social behavior
and so on they're very few options and
to discover them if we could discover
them we know a human nature is but you
can't discover them unless you're
willing at least to be puzzled by what
seems obvious to you make that
psychological leap you're going to be in
the stage of things go to their natural
place and that's where we are in the
case of human nature but if you really
look at it we don't know anything about
human nature and we know something but
very little in fact we don't even know
very much about insect nature which is
much easier study and we don't have that
psychological barrier that we have about
ourselves and it's experimentally much
easier study of course these are the
hard questions so is competitive part of
competitiveness part of human nature
well trivalent trivially yes because it
takes place is cooperation solidarity
and mutual aid support part of it sure
listen to that what are the constraints
how do they show up in different
circumstances and and we have
experienced intuitive ideas
history but nothing in the way of really
serious understand almost anything that
said about human nature kept take with
an immense grain of salt because our
approach to it is pre Galilean we have
not accepted rare areas and a few people
who are not a lot you can you haven't
reached the point where you can be
puzzled even about what's in front of
your eyes if you can't do that you can't
have any understanding and this is not
just true of the general public it's
from scientists evolutionary biologists
psychologists philosophers and it's
across the board practically the whole
intellectual culture including science
is free Galilean when you deal with
human nature it gives us some striking
examples but get off into another area
but that's just a hard leaf to make and
it's again it's well known to us by now
but kind of striking but it took 2,000
years for science to be willing to be
puzzled about something as elementary is
the fact that stones go down and steam
goes up how can you be puzzled about
that well if you can't be puzzled about
that you don't have science that's the
first step once you are puzzled you find
quickly that everything is relieved
about it is wrong
some individuals on the radical and
progressive left are discussing the
formation of a revolutionary
organization for a participatory or
libertarian socialist society but their
historical examples you would point to
in order to illustrate what an effective
organization of this kind might look
like what challenges did that
organization face or how are they
overcome if challenges were not overcome
what might that organization have gone
to overcome them well the most
successful case in the most striking one
that I know of in history is the Spanish
revolution in 1936 and in 1936 a
revolution did occur in large parts of
Spain industrial Catalonia the rural
Paragon regions and it if you look at it
it looks kind of spontaneous happen
quickly all of a sudden as soon as the
Franco armies attack but of course it
wasn't at all spontaneous I'm it had
been going on for 50 years there had
been about a half a century of education
organizing there were Anika schools you
know there were uprisings that would
takeovers of towns which are then
crushed by force a whole history of
experience experiment initiatives
defeats and so on and it led to the
point where they what to do was just in
people's heads people at a conception of
what to do widespread conception of what
to do when the opportunity arose they
did it so you know looks spontaneous
from one point of view that it was the
result of a very substantial effort in
rural and
hilarious in Spain and it was pretty
successful and its problems but in the
middle of a war for one thing so big
problems it was fine and crush it was
crushed actually in about a year but it
took the combined forces of every power
in the world depression it was crushed
by the combined forces of comments about
communism Stalinism fascism and the
liberal democracies they disagree on a
lot of things but they agreed on
crushing the Spanish revolution and
after they had crushed the revolution
they started off on what's called the
Spanish Civil War and it was question
who would pick up the spoils when we
study it we study the period after the
crushing of the revolution that come
first but the first task accepted on
across the board by the power systems
the world is you gotta crush the
revolution we cannot allow
self-management independence freedom
justice people taking control their own
lives that's much too dangerous every
power system understood was that it was
humming crush and approximately a year
but it was very successful a lot of
flaws a lot of things were done wrong
it's conceivable that they go to one war
but it would have had to follow very
different tactics after the Revolution
was crushed a popular opposition to the
Franco invasion diminished substantially
because what people who really wanted
was already crushed so yes there was
resistance to the invasion but it's
going to
conventional award it would have been
possible alternatives they were
suggested actually the most interesting
suggestion which might have worked was
by an Italian anarchist Camilla venerian
Italian anarchist who was in Spain who
suggested an alternative strategy
instead of just fighting a war
conventional war he suggested strategy
which then sounded outlandish with by
now doesn't sound so outlandish he
suggested that in Spain itself the Ebro
the real revolutionary forces should
conduct the guerrilla war not a
conventional work find out actually
concept the guerrilla war is very deeply
rooted in Spain in fact it grows from
Spain and so I suppose irrelevant but it
was during developed during the French
Napoleonic invasion and as we've seen in
more recent history it can be pretty
successful but he was combined with
something else he suggested a political
war Franco's armies evading debated the
fascist armies they were based in North
Africa and they were using mostly local
Moorish soldiers North African soldiers
from Morocco and Algeria that was the
base popular base for Franco disarming
so binary suggested there was worth of
revolution going on in North Africa of
the Green Revolution he suggested
supporting the revolution in North
Africa which was trying to break up the
colonial system break it down and break
up no Claudia landholding Ian Desmond's
so forth he suggested supporting that
which he thought would erode the base of
the invading army well that was totally
unacceptable to any of the great powers
Stalin rosedale anybody of course the
fashion because allow the breakdown of
imperial systems so it might not have
worked but it might work in fact was the
only technique to put over a guerrilla
war in Spain and revolutionary war in
North Africa but it wasn't considered
was too much education to state power
and to conventional ideas about how to
fight wars so what you get is the
conventional war in Spain which can read
about in history books fascist one but
that's the most successful example I
know there are other cases that one's
merits careful study i should say in
connection to that or there were
proposals by anarchist historians and
analysts of there were very detailed
proposals about at it we're going to
every particular of the spanish
revolutionary society the most extreme
but i know of was idea an argentine
anarchist about the sub be honest way
now his book is properly translated into
english i think was called after the
revolution
I had the same feeling about that that I
had Paragon I think it's just through
detailed you have too much experiment is
needed to find out what you can do but
it was an interesting set of ideas may
be right there there are other
experiences through because in fact
their bits and pieces of it all over the
place there are lots their pieces in
American history the effect right now in
the United States there are probably
thousands of enterprises that are worker
manage that were not huge ones but some
pretty successful were used different
plans it's a it's a deeply rooted night
idea at an American working-class
history in fact the earlier industrial
revolution here say around New England
it's kind of taken for granted by
working people that so it was those who
work in the mills should own and manage
them it was also taken for granted in
the late 19th century that there there's
basically no difference between wage
labor and slavery the only difference is
that wage laborers temporary but
otherwise it's like slavery and that's
without any influence from marks or
European socialism or anything else it's
just the instinctive automatic
assumption of working people in fact it
was so widespread that it was a it was a
slogan Republican Party has advocated
the New York Times Abraham Lincoln
called that view and that but more
significantly that was the intuitive
feeling of working people who were at
that point being kind of driven into the
industrial system which they bitterly
opposed taking away their freedom but
they said wage labor is just slaver
shouldn't exist well I doubt that these
ideas are very very very
of course it's been a center and a half
of efforts to drive such thoughts out of
people's minds but I suspect they're
pretty close to the surface they can be
brought to the surface and used as the
basis for experiment and activism and
actually you know economic building
building little pieces of it in
different parts of this coming back to
what we're trying to do here at zee
media institute what do you think of
today's citizens and activists
journalism in confronting the mainstream
media and addressing the issues that
we've been discussing today like I said
when you talk about human affairs either
don't know anything or you can Bruce
truisms the truism in this case is it
said it's critically necessary I mean
unless there's some way of reaching the
public in fact even ourselves with
internal debate and discussion with kind
of an alternative perspective on what
the world is like and how it could be
there won't be any steps forward I'm
going back to the late 19th century one
of the exciting things in the American
working class industrial working class
was that it was full of adversarial
journalism that's probably the period of
the freest press in the United States
hundreds of newspapers a lot of them
written by working people in factories
and what were called factory girls young
women from the farms who went into the
mills or you know artisans from Boston
in the mills and so on and very lively
vibrant press a lot of it is available
