25 years ago yesterday on April
thirtieth 1975 the vietnam war ended
with the fall of Saigon that day several
tanks smashed to the gates of what was
then known as independence Palace and
soldiers hoisted their flag atop the
building the fall of Saigon was the last
act of a tragic drama which saw two
halves of the country South and North
Vietnam locked in combat and the
unleashing of American War technology on
a rural society millions of Vietnamese
civilians in almost 60,000 American
soldiers died in that war Vietnam
celebrated the 25th anniversary of its
victory over the United States yesterday
with several parades and by freeing more
than 12,000 prisoners nationwide and the
biggest amnesty of its history in the
United States there were teach-ins
around the country today we're going to
hear from a Vietnam veteran from the
Vietnamese ambassador to the United
Nations and from professor Noam Chomsky
they were all at a teaching in New York
called the 25th anniversary of the
victory in peace in vietnam Noam Chomsky
will begin with professor of linguistics
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology author of many books
including profit over people at war with
Asia manufacturing consent Chomsky was
one of the few Americans who visited
North Vietnam during the war and was
arrested during that time he spoke
yesterday at stephen wise free synagogue
part of the reluctance is that like
everyone else on the panel i find it
very hard to talk about topics of this
significance and range and horror in a
few minutes what we have to the other
reason for reluctance is that although
I'd like to join in a celebration of a
victory for peace or what it says up
there I've never felt that that was
possible and I don't think it's possible
today and I don't want to put a damper
on the occasion but I can only tell you
what I think like Ben I remember very
well the moment at which the
the war was announced actually it was a
for me a moment very much like this was
a teach-in in the middle of a teach-in
in boston and somebody ran down the
corridor screaming wars over howard zinn
was talking at the time and there was
also not unusual and there's a lot of
there was a lot of celebration but as
Ben said the celebration was bittersweet
we knew what had happened and those of
us with eyes open could see pre well
what was going to happen and it wasn't
pretty in the past and it was not going
to be pretty in the future it makes a
good deal to sense to ask the question
that's raised for today's panel what's
different what's the same but before
addressing that question we should be
clear about what was what did happen
there has been a major effort for well I
actually goes back half a century but
there's been a major effort since 1975
to erase the truth of what happened it's
what actually did happen is forbidden
turf and they're good reasons for that
because when we look at what did happen
we draw we discover truths that are
significant and that have great
implications for the future but that
anyone with power and privilege doesn't
want the rest of the world to know
certainly not the rest of the American
population and it's kind of interesting
to see what the effects of this massive
propaganda campaign have been over the
years we actually know a fair amount
about it and I'll say a couple of words
about it just in the last couple of days
last there's been a flood of articles
which I'm sure you've all seen all over
the press about the end of the war and
they there's a spectrum of opinion
that's expressed its not uniform of a
very between we're called hawks and
doves the Hawks say that the war was a
noble cause and we could have won if we
weren't
comes stabbed in the back or you know
the peace movement or something the
doves on the contrary say it was a noble
cause and we should have won but we
couldn't have won that for one or
another reason at the extreme dissident
n at the time and today say this morning
30 years ago anthony lewis at the very
distant end of discussion in 1969 said
that the war began with blundering
efforts to do good but we misunderstood
the situation we didn't realize that it
was a we were fighting a nationalist
movement and finally by 1969 it became
clear that we could not win at a cost we
could not win at a price that was not
too costly for ourselves that's the
extreme dovish position this morning you
can read David Halberstam saying
virtually the same words and the tragedy
of Vietnam was that us force was not
applicable properly because we
misunderstood the situation we didn't
know it was a nationalist war so that's
the tragedy why incidentally 1969 well
the reason was that that was a year and
a half after the business world had
turned against the war and essentially
ordered Washington to wind it down
because it was becoming too costly for
ourselves so after that the doves were
allowed to say things like I just quoted
and they're still saying that's the
spectrum and there's spectrum doesn't
include everybody of course rather
strikingly it doesn't include about
seventy percent of the american
population which is interesting and
important and something we're going to
pay attention to the fact that it's not
given much prominence for not surprising
reasons this is a very heavily polled
society the business world wants to know
what people think that's the way you
organize your advertising and the
doctrinal managers you know in the
universities and the press and everyone
everywhere they want to know what people
think because that's how you design the
doctrinal messages so we know a lot
about what
people think one question that's asked
regularly on polls about international
affairs and they're careful good poles
is what do you think about the war in
Vietnam and for the past 30 years the
most recent one was just a year ago
roughly seventy percent of the
population has said the war was
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake now that's a remarkable figure
for one thing you never get high figures
in a poll with an open question for
another thing though each of those
almost every one of those people who
said that made it up for themselves they
didn't hear it they didn't read it
certainly among educated sectors you're
not supposed to believe that in fact at
the peak of opposition to the war around
nineteen seventy the number of elite
intellectuals who felt that belief that
was you know almost otisco error maybe
two or three percent we also know that
from detailed studies so there's
absolutely an extremely sharp gulf not
only on this issue some many many issues
international economic issues for
example what are called trade agreements
and so on on many issues there's a
tremendous gulf between the population
and the educated privileged sectors who
want to write the article ones write the
articles no makeup history and try to
create it and so on and so forth the
difference is that the educated sectors
are overwhelmingly within the hawked of
spectrum if you can tell the differences
and the rest of the population is
somewhere else and they're somewhere
else on their own if there was ever any
open and free discussion about these
issues it wouldn't be seventy percent it
would probably be ninety-nine percent or
something like that that's important and
it's very important for people who want
to change the world to pay attention to
how much people actually know about the
war is another story I hear there are
some really horrifying figures so
studies there have been studies that ask
in which people are asked how many
Vietnamese they thought died during the
war and the average figure is about a
hundred thousand that's as if you took
polls in Germany today and asked how
many people died during the Holocaust
and the average figure was 200,000 if
that happened we think there's something
really sick about German intellectual
and moral culture and it's not different
here fortunately hopefully what's sick
is highly concentrated concentrated in
sectors of privilege and power and
that's important I won't review what did
happen because you know but briefly very
briefly for about since the early 1950s
the u.s. blocked every effort at the
negotiated peaceful settlement that went
until 1975 that included disruption of
the Paris Accords of 73 it instituted a
standard Latin American style terror
state in the south in the 1950s which
killed about 70,000 people in the 1950s
aroused resistance when the resistance
couldn't be contained John F Kennedy
invaded South Vietnam a little hidden
secret about the war is it wasn't it was
a US war against South Vietnam straight
out if anybody else had done it that's
the way we describe it was as much a war
against South Vietnam as the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan was an invasion
of Afghanistan South Vietnam was always
the major target of attack that remained
through right till the end it was
devastated the end result of the war is
that three countries were devastated but
the one that was hardest hit was South
Vietnam which was the primary target of
the u.s. assault throughout that's the
brief story there's a lot more and it's
a lot worse well this seventy percent of
the population who sort of is out of
control they there's a name for their
feeling it's called the Vietnam syndrome
and it's kind of interesting to see the
way that's interpreted so for example on
when these polls are taken like last
year when the last major poll was taken
it was Jenna you know academic study and
the commentator a reasonable analyst
says here's the way he interprets it
seventy percent of the Putman happened
maybe you know roughly seventy percent
of the population says the war is
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake and the interpretation is the
American people are unwilling to accept
the burdens of responsibility for
international intervention no that's not
what they're saying they're saying you
guys are criminals and we don't think
want to take part in your war crimes but
you can't hear that what you have to
hear is the American people don't want
to accept the burdens of intervention so
then you develop a invent the Vietnam
syndrome and you know some fantasy about
casualties and so on and so forth
actually the what the what the polls are
saying is extremely clear the topic has
never been investigated in any depth and
I think the reason is because nobody and
privilege wants to discover what they're
going to find out well it is understood
internally one of the most interesting
parts of the Pentagon Papers hence never
mentioned is the very end after the Tet
Offensive in early nineteen sixty eight
the Tet Offensive is what turned the
business world against the war was clear
there was going to be too costly right
after the Tet Offensive January 68
President Johnson wanted the Pentagon to
send two hundred thousand more troops to
Vietnam the South Vietnam to escalate
the war against South Vietnam the
Pentagon refused and the reasons were
interesting the reasons were that they
said they're going to need those troops
in the United States for civil disorder
control because if the if the war
continues they said the population is
just out of control and they said you
know its youth women minorities I mean
all kind of groups that are supposed to
be passive and quiet and obedient or
getting out of control and we just we
feel we're going to need those troops
here that remain that understanding
remain despite the massive effort since
to erase history by the by around
nineteen eighty it was assumed that
things were back under control and
Ronald Reagan in you know people around
Reagan probably didn't know who's going
on himself but the Reagan Heights
decided to follow their model their
model was John F Kennedy they greatly
admire them and they were going to try
to follow in Central America the model
that he carried out in South Vietnam
namely you know fraudulent white paper
about how the Communists are taken over
the world and then we send the Marines
and you bomb and you know and so on and
I started they had the white paper the
press played the role it's supposed to
do you know great terror about the
Communists taken over the world but then
the next step didn't happen why because
there was just too much unanticipated
popular resistance all over the country
and places we nobody expected it you
know Midwest churches or all kind of
places that aren't supposed to exist
there was a lot of protest against this
effort to redo what they had done in
south vietnam in the early 60s the
reagan administration backed off they
were afraid that the protest would harm
their other programs to which they were
much more committed like the massive
militarization and so on so they
essentially told the press to cool it
they said forget about the white paper
and yeah about six months later the
white paper was exposed as a total fraud
as of course it was first in the Wall
Street Journal and elsewhere New York
Times never came around but they backed
off and instead of fighting a instead of
a direct invasion of Central America
they fought what's called a clandestine
war clandestine war means everybody
knows about it except the American
public and the and the the press
certainly knows about it but then I'll
talk about it Noam Chomsky will come
back to him in just a minute on this
25th anniversary of the end of the war
in Vietnam with the fall of Saigon
professor Chomsky of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology was speaking at
a teaching in New York you're listening
to Pacific radios democracy now we'll
come back to him in a minute
you
you
you
you
you
you're listening to Pacifica radios
democracy now on this 25th anniversary
of the end of the war in Vietnam we'll
be hearing from a Vietnam veteran as
well as the Vietnamese ambassador to the
United Nations but now we continue with
the speech given yesterday by professor
Noam Chomsky he's a professor of
linguistics at MIT in Massachusetts he
also was an active anti-war leader who
was one of the few Americans who went to
North Vietnam during the war the u.s. is
not a minor terrorist power no it's not
Libya Libya wants to carry out terrorist
acts it hires private terrorists the
u.s. is a major power it hires
terrorists States so the Destin war
so-called in Central America was fought
by Taiwan Israel Britain Saudi Arabia
and Argentina as long as was under the
control of neo-nazis than had to give
them up and they fought a massive war
which was extremely destructive hundreds
of thousands of people killed millions
of refugees orphans and so on but it's
not the same as b 52 bombardment as a
you know say saturation bombing of the
Mekong Delta it's not like that so bad a
central america is and parts of it may
not even survive it's nothing like the
war against south vietnam and later the
rest of Indochina and that was
understood the Reagan administration
established what they called an office
of public diplomacy a propaganda agency
to try to propagandize the domestic
population that happens to be illegal
and it was finally exposed later and
when I was exposed they described
frankly what they were doing they said
we have to we're carrying out the kind
of activities in the united states that
you carry out in enemy territory namely
and they recognized that the american
population is enemy territory you have
to somehow propagandize them later when
beginning the Bush administration there
was a leaked document of high-level
intelligence assessment of policy right
at the beginning
the Bush administration and it talked
about intervention it said when the
United States carries out military
actions against much weaker enemies
which is of course the only kind you
ever attacked so when we carry out
actions against much weaker enemies we
must win decisively and rapidly because
anything else will undermine domestic
support and not because the population
doesn't want to accept the burdens of
intervention was world war two they'd
accept the burdens but because they
don't want to fight in your criminal war
so therefore get it over fast and
quietly and make sure nobody knows about
it and so on and this extends to other
areas too let's turn to the domain of
international economic arrangements what
are very misleadingly called free trade
agreements the leadership knows that the
populations opposed they can't fail to
know that they read the polls too just
like you and I can do and therefore they
have to do it in secret so almost
everyone whether it's NAFTA or the
multilateral agreement on investments or
whatever picket always none in secret as
much as they can if the truth ever leaks
through they're in trouble and very
quickly in trouble because popular
resistance develops and have to back
down and they understand it The Wall
Street Journal after the fast-track
legislation had to be withdrawn because
of popular opposition said that the
problem is this everybody's in favor of
a whole business world you know the
media you know intellectuals everyone
who counts is in favor but they said the
trouble is the people who are opposed to
have what they called an ultimate weapon
the ultimate weapon is populations
against it and unless you can keep the
population ignorant and passive and
looking at television and buying
sneakers and so on and so forth then
you're going to be in trouble as soon as
people find out about it you're in
trouble the ultimate weapon is still
there and the real victory in the
Vietnam War in fact in the 1960s all
together the whole ferment of the 60s
that led to all sorts of things the
feminist movement the environmental
movement in all the massive things the
real victory is the population is out of
control and remains out of control
despite the tremendous efforts to put
them back in their box well the
retrospectives are the in the last
couple of week or so are unanimous on
one thing and I think we ought to be
cautious about that the peace movement
agrees and I think it's a mistake their
unanimous in claiming that the US lost
the war and I don't think that's true
that is the question of whether the US
lost war is not a question of fact it's
in the idea that it lost the war is an
expression of Imperial arrogance and I
think we should understand that it's
true that the United States did not
achieve Washington this is did not
achieve its maximal objectives that is
it didn't turn Indochina into El
Salvador which is the maximal objective
so they lost in that sense but they won
their major they achieved their major
objectives and we know what the major
objectives are and that's very important
for the future in fact the major
objectives you can tell from the by now
be classified internal record we're the
same as they always are nothing to do
with the Cold War that's mostly a
pretext for the last half century the
major objectives in Vietnam are pretty
much what they were in Cuba Guatemala
Nicaragua Congo all around the world
they were afraid that Vietnam was going
to undergo a successful internal
development successful social and
economic development and has its put in
high places The Rock might spread the
rot might spread to others it might lead
to ideological victories for the mode of
socio-economic development they're
pursuing the virus might infect others
as Kissinger put it with regard to Chile
and you have to make sure that that
doesn't happen they were afraid that the
virus might spread to thailand and
malaysia ananda indonesia which is a
major prize and maybe even affect pan
japan and might have to accommodate two
an East Asian region which was
independent and developing and become
Japan would then become its industrial
center and that would mean the United
States had lost the Second World War
which they were not prepared to do in
the late 1940s the second world war in
the Pacific was fought to prevent Japan
from being the industrial heartland of
an Asian system that it would nominate
now the United States was perfectly
happy to let that happen in fact
insisted that that happened after the
war except for the dominate part so the
u.s. plans for japan and asia after the
Second World War were the chip that the
Japan's Empire should be restored to it
actually was put that away by George
Kennan on the major planners we have to
return Japan's Empire to it but under
our control crucial difference and if
the rot spread from Vietnam throughout
the region Indonesia and Japan
accommodated China then yeah Japan and
have its Empire back but not under our
control and that's the crucial
difference that goes right up until
today to the east asian financial crisis
when the u.s. blocked japanese efforts
to set up a hundred billion dollar fund
the bailout the country's because it
might have gotten out of control we're
right in the middle of that today hasn't
changed much what that was the major
goal prevent that from happening and the
US won Vietnam is not going to be a
model for anybody it will be lucky if it
survives it's certainly not going to be
a model of social and economic
development and if you look around the
world at the other interventions that's
what you find consistently are you going
to find it right you find you right now
in Colombia and everywhere else you look
that's a kind of a constant that runs
through imperial history and as the u.s.
takes it over as Phyllis pointed out we
just pick up the standard procedure it's
a global Empire you want to make sure
that the rot doesn't spread and it's not
well when you have a virus what do you
do with it you kill the virus and you
inoculate the potential victims and
that's what happened Indochina was
killed you know not going to you know
maybe
survived but it's not going to be a
model for anything and the surrounding
region was inoculated in the 60s and
early 70s the u.s. succeeded in
installing brutal and vicious military
dictators in every country and that
stopped the prevented the rot from
spreading the most important victory in
fact was in Indonesia where in 1965 as
you know there was a military coup which
instantly carried out a Rwanda style
slaughter and that's not an exaggeration
or one the style slaughter which wiped
out the only mass based political
organization killed mostly landless
peasants and instituted a brutal and
murderous regime there was total
euphoria in the United States so happy
they couldn't contain it yeah when you
read the press it was just you know
static it's kind of suppressed now
because doesn't look pretty in
retrospect but it was understood years
later McGeorge Bundy who was the
National Security Advisor recognized
that he said and I think he's right the
US should have stopped the war in
Vietnam in 1965 because we'd basically
won by 1965 South Vietnam was largely
destroyed you know most of the rest was
not was going to quickly be destroyed
and we hadn't we had saved the major
prize Indonesia brought wasn't going to
spread to Indonesia after this
delightful Rwanda style slaughter that's
not a defeat it's partial victory and it
was understood the international
business community understood it by the
early 70s said you guys are crazy for
going on with a war what's the point
well after 1975 comes the need to erase
the memories because the memory and as I
went it out there among educated circles
wasn't very hard because they never had
the memories they never saw what was
going on they wouldn't allow themselves
to population saw and it's intriguing to
see how it's done there's of course no
war crimes trials major you know huge
war crimes no trials no reparations no
apology nothing Robert McNamara wrote a
book a couple of years ago which was
as an apology the reaction was
interesting he was attacked by the Hawks
for treachery and shockingly he was
welcomed by the doves for having finally
come around to their side let me stress
shockingly because what McNamara in fact
said was yes there was a crime we
couldn't win and his crime he said as I
didn't tell people quickly enough that
we couldn't win and he did make an
apology to the American people for
having caused them problems not to the
victims thus not to those 4 to 5 million
people who are dead and the others who
were dying right now from chemical
warfare and so on and so forth no
apology to them and certainly no nothing
do to help them but that's considered an
apology well you know in a way he went
beyond others President Carter his
position was different his position was
I'm quoting we know that we Oviatt Nam
no debt because the destruction was
mutual to check that out all you have to
do was take a walk around Westchester
County and quang ngai province perfectly
obvious what's remarkable about that
statement is that it elicited no comment
I mean not a murmur of protest except
among you know the usual scoundrels like
folks here but no comment to say that
there's we owe um no debt because the
destruction was mutual the george bush
came along they actually picked the
anniversary of kennedy's invasion of
south vietnam to intervene to prevent
the European Union and Japan from their
efforts to end the Vietnam embargo which
was part of punishing them for daring to
stand up to the master he blocked that
but he was nice about it he told the
Vietnamese he said look you have to
understand we do not threaten
retribution we only want an honest
accounting of the crimes that you
committed against us that's all again no
comment well you know there's a pretty
tough competition for depravity but
maybe the peak at least to me was just a
couple of days ago perhaps you saw when
the Secretary of Defense William
one was in Vietnam to you know me to
explain to them that we're not demanding
retribution and so on he said that he
would not dwell upon the past but he
departed from that on one occasion and
did dwell upon the past and it was
described graphically in Washington Post
he and 250 women dwelt upon the past he
watched while 250 women were carrying
out over they were on their 15th day of
an excavation in which they were sifting
through pieces of mud and putting
whatever they found on wire mesh to see
if they could find a fragment of
something that might be identified as a
piece of a jet plane which was shot down
we were supposed to believe while it was
over Main Street high or something and
if they could find maybe a piece of a
jet plane maybe they got identify the
bones of you know the remains of some
pilot well you know its proper but
here's 250 women the only thing they
have to do is sift through the mud for
15 days well William Cohen watches them
that means you don't just win a war you
have to degrade and humiliate the
victims that's extremely important fact
is a name for it in international
strategic theory it's called credibility
establishing credibility you have to
that's why you bum use love it that's
why you kill hundreds of thousands of
people in Iraq you must establish
credibility that's a constant people
have to be afraid of you you want to
understand why just ask your favorite
Mafia Don he'll explain somebody gets
out of line you don't just take the
money from them they're supposed to pay
you beat them to a pulp than everybody
else gets the idea that's a leading
principle of world affairs and it
remains so well there are heartening
aspects that all of this and let me
mention them and again it's what I said
the worst rot and it is a very profound
rot is concentrated in privileged
educated and sectors a good deal of the
rest of the population really is out of
control that's the real achievement of
the 1960's and everything that followed
and it's the real hope for the future
professor Noam Chomsky speaking
yesterday at 25th anniversary
commemoration of the end of the war in
Vietnam the day Saigon fell you are
listening to pacifica radios democracy
now if you'd like to order a cassette
copy of today's program you can call one
eight hundred 735 0230 that's 1 800 735
0230 when we come back we'll hear from a
Vietnam veteran and the Vietnamese
ambassador to the United Nations stay
with us
you
you're listening to Pacifica radios
democracy now as we continue our 25th
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam
War special with been shitty a navy
volunteer in the Vietnam War from 66 to
67 and also in 1968 than Chitti the
Clarence Fitch coordinator of the
Vietnam Veterans Against the War in New
York speaking yesterday at a
commemoration ceremony at the stephen
wise free synagogue in manhattan the
moment when the war came to an end 25
years ago was a bittersweet moment for
me as I recall which is not very clearly
I got drunk as a skunk so I'm wearing
North Carolina the war had finally come
to an end but you know I had wanted more
I wanted peace with honor now honor is
not so mysterious it means being honest
accepting responsibility making amends
for injuries I didn't want much I wanted
official apologies reparations technical
assistance for Vietnam and a change in
the government a whole new government
here at home what I get we got new
fronts in a never-ending war we got
counterinsurgency operations low
intensity conflict police actions abroad
in Afghanistan Lebanon Salvador
Nicaragua Panama the Persian Gulf
Somalia Haiti Kosovo with Columbia be in
the next stop we got censorship in
repression at home orchestrated by the
military-industrial complex and the
national security state their allies and
agents look at what happened to the
sanctuary movement the South African
Solidarity movement militant
environmentalists and the new
anti-terrorist measures and somewhere
along the line the Soviet Union
disintegrated but not the subversion of
democracy there was no repudiation of
the policies which created such
destruction there was no resolution of
the prolonged crisis of legitimacy the
system still isn't working for most
people that still
people at home and abroad so some kind
of peace came to Vietnam 25 years ago
but not to me for one thing we were
changed that war was unwinnable long
before most of us got to it but no one
told us or we didn't listen we had to
find it out for ourselves it was an
experience which could raise your
consciousness we learned a new American
history the u.s. is not a democracy but
an empire not a benign Empire founded on
genocide and slavery expanded on
commercial interest and chauvinism
wrapped in a missionary spirit we
learned a new military history most us
wars have been wars first of conquests
than of intervention sending soldiers
somewhere to fight with the people who
live there over how they can live or
which government they can have or if
they can live at all even the details
look a little different to us the US
military learned to practice total war
wars on entire populations modern wars
we fought the Native Americans for
centuries killed or relocated them and
took their land we took Indian fighting
to the Philippines in 1898 and then we
found gooks to fight in Mexico Haiti and
Nicaragua we refined our technology of
death machine gun and Mauro's on mount
dojo in 1906 firebombing kako bands in
the Haitian boondocks in 1919 strafing
sandanista villages in 1929 finally
incinerating Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
1945 we still refine it in the Gulf we
proved the futility of opposing us
interest with fuel-air bombs on the
highway of death and according to one
report that videotape persuaded slobodan
milosevic to withdraw from Kosovo makes
no gunnery in Korea malai and Vietnam
the firefight in Mogadishu looked like
trivial excesses lapses of discipline
after all most of the people we killed
in Vietnam were non-combatants and we
kill them at a distance with explosive
and incendiary devices we even found a
new veterans history our government is
only rarely kept faith
it's veterans from the Revolutionary War
veteran cheated out of his bonds to the
Civil War veterans defrauded by lawyers
in cahoots with a corrupt Veterans
Administration to the World War one
bonus March vets dispersed by bayonet
from their nation's capital the korean
war pows accused of disloyalty the
atomic vets of the cold war dying of
cancer by friendly fire for another
thing we had some problems of our own we
had to help heal ourselves we formed rap
groups to deal with alienation which was
the original Vietnam syndrome and
post-traumatic stress we started going
back to Vietnam to help rebuild what we
had helped destroy we even built our own
memorial the wall in Washington which is
now so popular with tourists that we
forget how bitter was the opposition to
its design we had to deal with the p.o
wmia legend a story started by the
edixon administration to rally support
for a secret plan to end the war and
then fostered by anti-communist fanatics
and more than a few crooks and
charlatans inside the government and out
we tried to force recognition of dioxin
poisoning from agent orange exposure the
government began to give us that finally
just as it began sending half a million
men and women into the Persian Gulf
where the Pentagon did them with
depleted uranium nerve toxins and
experimental vaccines the same way it
had done us with defoliants we watched
as the major legislative reforms of the
Vietnam ear the War Powers Act and the
Independent Counsel statute were ignored
or flattered or perverted in an orgy of
partisan bickering then abandoned we saw
another reform the all-volunteer army
wracked by the everyday in deadly
oppressions of our society race and
class which loaded up the military with
minorities for people and immigrants
gender which left women subject to
sexual harassment to every level sexual
identity where don't ask gave a green
light to witch hunts and finally to
murder we learned of the environmental
cost the toxic wastes abandoned in the
Philippines in Panama and also kaho
Highway in Hawaii Eglin Air Force Base
Cape Cod Fort Drum
dick's diamond shamrocks production of
Agent Orange in the Ironbound community
in Newark Superfund sites so toxic that
today it's captain fenced and under
guard 24 hours a day seven days a week
you can go to see it we saw how the
lessons of our experience became
military control of the media and
minimum American casualties which turned
into unreported deaths and hidden
injuries how many patom aeneans died in
operation just cause no one counted how
many allied soldiers were injured in the
Persian Gulf that count is still coming
in now these events have some things in
common the real lessons of our
experience have been ignored or
corrupted by the same folks who sent us
to Vietnam and their political heirs the
machinery of death is more efficient
certainly more expensive and profitable
in fact while it's but politically
dangerous to risk a soldier's life and
responding to ethnic cleansing in the
Balkan Balkans it's okay to send Marines
to their deaths and a flawed and
unnecessary but very expensive and very
profitable airplane like the Osprey well
you know it's enough to make you crazy
so how crazy are we people say that the
u.s. could have been won the war we know
they could not people say the anti-war
movement harassed and betrayed the
soldiers we remember that the government
drafted and enlisted us lied to us and
let us die by giving me something
constructive to do the anti-war movement
saved my sanity and maybe save my own
life people say that the anti-war
movement lost the war wait a minute let
me get that straight I get sent to a war
I can't win and I should not be fighting
I come back and say this has to stop so
now it's my fault of course this
revisionist obsession with alternative
fictions is not really about strategy or
tactics or about geo political
constraints or even the various and
notorious betrayals the liberal media
Walter Cronkite Robert McNamara even
Jane Fonda
it's about you and me the folks who told
the truth about the war if we were right
than the people who supported the war
the folks who favored intervention the
people who sent us crusading against
communism they betrayed us their own
sons and daughters any more veterans of
the witnesses against them we have been
through the meat grinder we saw the
system was not working we knew the war
had to stop and we're still here we know
operation just cause was little more
than a badly bungled arrest we know we
went to war in the Persian Gulf to put
the Emir of Kuwait back on his golden
throne we know that the sedan missile
strike was a clear case of homicide by
depraved indifference we know the Balkan
bombing campaign a perfect war with no
American casualties or so they say
failed to bring peace to the Kosovars
whether albanian Roma or Serbian how
many of these Panamanian Iraqi Kuwaiti
Sudanese Kosovar people are better off
for American intervention we know more
we know the question is one of democracy
of political power and accountability we
know the problem is not bad people
though I've met some very bad people but
a bad system we know the answer will be
based on mass mobilization and militant
resistance here's an example on the
island of Vieques off puerto rico
several dozen people practicing
nonviolent civil disobedience have
stopped the US navy from bombing their
island for more than a year the largest
and longest civil disobedience campaign
in recent US history we know Puerto Rico
is a colony in the u.s. Empire we know
the Pentagon is told lies broken
promises and we know the Navy's claims
of national security are bogus we
understand what's going on in via kiss
and that's why it's and why it's
important if or when when the people of
Vieques chased the Navy off their Island
it will be our victory too now even in
VV AWS glory days when we defied the
Attorney General in the Supreme Court
dewey canyon 3 in Washington disrupted
the miami convention seize the Statue of
Liberty walked out of the Gainesville
courthouse acquitted on every count VV
aw was as much a state of mind as
formal organization Vietnam veterans who
opposed the war turn up in many places
in black veterans the social justice
Veterans for Peace Project hearts and
minds the veterans Vietnam
reconstruction problem project what we
bring to the movement besides passion
and perhaps credibility is this we have
learned something about just and unjust
wars we know that for us this
never-ending war of ours the real war
the Civil War in the heart of the Empire
in the belly of the beast is a war of
self-defense we know the system can
waste you in a heartbeat walk around the
protest camps in the live fire zone on
Vieques you'll meet veterans just one
more example I'm a Vietnam veteran I'm
alienated sometimes I'm a little grumpy
I don't like the way things are I don't
trust the government Barry McCaffrey
also served in Vietnam he thinks we can
cure the pestilence of drugs and our
communities by locking up a lot of
people here at home and by Armand a
brutal and corrupt military and its
paramilitary allies who use terror to
keep the rich rich and the poor poor in
Colombia a country already fully
integrated it into the freest of global
markets the international drug trade
which one of us is nuts
so 25 years after the fall of Saigon I'm
still a Vietnam veteran I'm still
against that war and i'm still looking
for peace with honor but i will settle
the peace with justice then shitty
coordinator of the clarence fitch
chapter of the Vietnam Veterans Against
war as the symposium and the 25th
anniversary of the end of the Vietnam
War was taking place yesterday two ships
with more than one thousand US Marines
headed to the island of yes and
anticipation of an fbi-led operation to
arrest protesters at the same time US
and British warplanes bombed northern
Iraq and finally we end with the
ambassador to the United Nations from
Vietnam yen fan ciao you in the West you
start your April with the first day and
with the Vietnamese we end it out April
25 years ago with the day which has gone
into the history of our people as the
landmark of the wharf for independence
and freedom 25 years have passed and the
rumblings of the shells and the
warplanes had been silenced but there
rumbling in the mind of the people on
both sides still going on and we
perfectly understand the agony of those
who got involved in the war on both
sides yes your boys came to Vietnam to
fight without knowing what's going on
and what's for we did it because we know
what we were for at the time and we have
a rivalry
I belong to a generation trick has gone
through different Wars you know that
savage our country and I think that's
enough no Wars no good nowadays you can
have you know some kind of crazy duck
trend about you know let's or have a
chance but I don't think it's proper to
say so you know we suffer in the war we
understand the sufferer sufferings of
the people in the world and we also know
that we have the nobel peace prize we
don't have the Nobel Prize for war
Vietnam is the land of the heroes yes we
have five thousand eight thousand and
five hundred mother heroes who lost
their relatives who lost the member of
their families in the war some of them
lost in Thai the family from the husband
to the son and daughters to the
grandchildren yes they were hero but
they suffer so much we also have 300,000
people still listed as missing in action
and you understand what the agony would
be on these people we also have
thousands of deformed babies and
children born to the families with
parents affected by Asian orange sprayed
on the people of your time by the United
States
the responsibility is clear and I
believe that it's now time that serious
thought should be focused on these
issues on both sides
the government of Vietnam has set aside
79 billion dance for the victims of
Agent Orange but that's a pinch of soul
in the sea it's not enough it's not
enough let alone the mental scars on
those people who got involved the war
and came back to give birth to these
children yes we have it all in Vietnam
it's a lesson that we on both sides had
to learn we learn you know how the
people would do to save the land and you
should learn how to stay outside
something which is not yours Vietnamese
