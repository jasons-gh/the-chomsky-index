you know can't stand our freedoms and
our magnificence and so on and so forth
anyone who is seriously concerned with
these issues certainly anyone who's
specialist than international affairs or
the Middle East knows that there's
nothing new about these answers you can
go way back and find them as far back as
you want to go obvious place to look if
you want to find out more about this is
the records for 1958 President
Eisenhower in internal discussion
observed to his staff his words that
there's a campaign of hatred against us
in the Middle East not by governments
but by the people and there was
discussion about this to the National
Security Council the highest planning
body gave their analysis they said that
there is the reason is that there's a
perception in the region that the United
States is supporting harsh and brutal
and corrupt regimes and is blocking
democratization and development and is
doing so because of our interest in
controlling the oil reserves of the
region and they said it's difficult to
counter this perception because it's
accurate not only is it not only is it
accurate but it should be accurate it
said it is natural for us to support
status quo governments meaning the kind
i just described and to prevent
democracy and development because we
want to maintain control over the energy
resources of the region so there's a
campaign of hatred against us by the
people and that's the reason for it
essentially the same as what the Wall
Street Journal discovered on September
14th and anybody new in between so if
you want to listen to some voices
outside the cocoon it's not hard to hear
them and they'll answer the questions
about why there's a campaign of hatred
against us whether it's now or in 1958
and in a good part of the rest of the
world where people just don't enjoy
being ground to dust under somebody's
boot I don't like it leads to hatred you
can avoid you know you can indulge in
the fantasies if you like but that's a
choice you certainly don't have to
everyone's worried about stopping
terrorism well as a really easy way stop
participating in it just that every
government want bent over backwards to
join the us-led coalition always for
their own reasons I mean maybe the most
striking case and the one that really
tells you something about Western
intellectuals is turkey Turkey Turkish
troops are now in Kabul or will be soon
paid for by the United States to fight
the war against terror why is turkey
offering troops the fact they were the
first country to to offer the US troops
or Afghanistan and explain why it was in
gratitude because the United States was
the only country that was willing to
provide them with massive support for
their own huge terrorist atrocities in
southeast Turkey in the last few years
it's not ancient history in fact still
going on they carry out some of the
worst atrocities of the 1990s far be
anything that militia which was accused
of in Kosovo were carried at about the
same time in southeast new turkey
against maybe a quarter of the
population Kurds who are horribly
repressed and millions of them were
driven out of their homes and thousands
of villages destroyed maybe tens of
thousands killed every imaginable kind
of barbaric torture Clinton was poring
arms in I mean turkey became the leading
arms recipient in the world outside of
Israel in Egypt a different category I
it and they're very grateful that the
u.s. was so willing to help them in
carrying out a massive state terror and
in reward they are now fighting the war
on terror you know the fact that Western
intellectuals going to look at this and
not say anything it requires is a really
impressive testimonial to the discipline
of educated people and it's a rather
striking fact about the West I don't
know if anyone in Japan noticed it but
it's extremely dramatic I just had a
interview this afternoon with the German
the German major German journal and
pointed this out and pointed out to them
which they ought to know that although
the US was the primary funder of Turkey
Germany was the second what about that
you wanna everyone's worried about
stopping terrorism well as a really easy
way stop participating in it I mean that
alone will reduce the amount of
terrorism in the world by an enormous
quantity it's true just about every
country that I know to varying degrees
but dramatically true for the US Britain
Germany and others
in March that was the 40th anniversary
of the public announcement that the u.s.
is attacking south vietnam the US pilots
are bombing South Vietnam that they
began to use chemical warfare two for
crop destruction dry started driving
millions of people into concentration
camps this is all in South Vietnam no
Russians no two Chinese not even any
North Vietnamese assuming they're not
allowed to be in their own country just
a US war against South Vietnam openly
announced no commemoration after 40
years because nobody even knows it's not
important if we do that to other people
that's normal it's if they do some of us
that the world is coming to an end but
if we do it to them it's unnormal why
should we even talking about it and
likewise in Japan yeah I see it's better
in Japan Japan was defeated and defeated
countries are forced to pay some
attention to what they did Victor's
never let me take a look at the Tokyo
trials you know i'm undoubtedly the
people were guilty of all kind of crimes
but the trials were total farce I mean
from a legal or any other point of view
they were disgraceful the end didn't I
try the US criminals in fact uh it's
kind of interesting the way the
Nuremberg would be the way the
principles were constructed they had to
decide at Nuremberg what's going to
count as a worker on and there was a
very explicit definition and it was
conscious and it's not hidden a crime is
a war crime if the Germans committed it
and we didn't so for example bombing of
urban concentrations was not a work
right because the British and the
Americans did more of it than the
Germans did so therefore it's not a work
right and German submarine commanders
were able to bring testimony in defense
by American submarine commanders who
said yeah we did the same thing and
there they were there for free because
it wasn't a crime so if they do it and
and it gets him worse than this I mean
for example opening the dikes
in Holland was considered a war crime
properly but in North Korea a few years
later after the US Air Force had wiped
out the whole country there's nothing
left to bomb they started bombing the
dams that's a huge work run it's much
worse than bombing the dikes it was
described but it was described with
pride now if you read the official Air
Force history or the Air Force quarterly
and so on they describe it and gruesome
detail but about what a great
achievement it was to bomb these dams to
see the huge flood of water or scooping
out valets and see the rage of the
people said they're asians who depend on
rice you know here we're really getting
them where it hurts and it's just like
racist fanaticism but praised that's
just a couple of years after they they
hanged German leaders were doing much
less than that do I simplify all matters
by saying that the u.s. act everywhere
is an evil empire yeah that would
certainly over simplified things and I
pointed out that the u.s. behaving like
every other power you know so the u.s.
happens to be more powerful so it's
therefore as you'd expect more violent
but yeah everyone else is about the same
when the British were running the world
they were doing the same thing that
takes a the curve let's just take the
Kurds what was written doing about the
Kurds well there's a little less history
that they don't teach in schools in
England the but we know from
declassified documents Britain had been
been the world dominant power but by the
time the First World War was weakened by
the war airpower was just coming along
at that time so the idea was to use air
power to attack civilians that figured
I'd be a good way to reduce the costs of
crushing the barbarians Churchill who
was then colonial secretary didn't think
that was enough he got a request from
the RAF office in Cairo asking him for
permission I'm quoting it now to use
poison gas against recalcitrant arrows
the recalcitrant Arabs they were talking
about having to be Kurds and Afghans not
Arabs but you know by racist standards
anybody want to kills an era poison gas
was the ultimate atrocity at that time
kind of the worst thing you could
imagine well there was this was
circulated around the British Empire the
India Office was resistant they said if
you used poison gas against Kurds and
Afghanistan cuz us problems in Indian
which we were having plenty of problems
that we uprisings as people will be
furious and so on I'm not in mind in
England of course but in India they
might Churchill was outraged by this he
said I cannot understand this
squeamishness about the use of poison
gas against uncivilized tribes it will
cause a lively terror it will save
British lives we have to use every means
that science permits us okay so that's
the way you deal with curves and Afghans
when you the British if we run through
the rest of the countries were going to
find the same thing so it would be
surely in the state to describe the
United States as the evil empire it just
happens to be the most powerful force in
the world since 1945 if you don't do
what we tell you you'll just be
pulverized we don't care what you think
or what you say the current US
leadership is extreme in this respect
but they are quite frankly and openly
committed to the use of violence to
control the world and they say so so for
example when Prince Abdullah of Saudi
Arabia was here a couple of weeks ago he
tried to persuade us leaders to moderate
their support for Israeli violence and
what Abdullah said is there's going to
be a uprising in the Arab world be
really dangerous for your own interests
like oil then their reaction was
interesting he was dismissed of course
but on interesting grounds I mean he was
told you know it was reported in the New
York Times you can read it he was told
what they said is look just take a look
at what we did in to Iraq during Desert
Storm now we're ten times that strong if
you want to see how strong take a look
what we just did in Afghanistan that's
what it's for to show you what can
happen to you if you raise your head so
try to if you don't do what we tell you
you'll just be pulverized we don't care
what you think or what you say that's
their attitude and they say so and it's
evident in the actions and it's not very
good for the World War for the people in
the United States there's kind of a
background to this if you read the same
authors other than many others they
explain further the
there's good reason why we should be in
favor of American hegemony the reason is
that history has a natural course and
the United States represents the
realization of history's purpose so
they're quoting and therefore us
domination is kind of by logic
beneficial to the rest of the world if
you think is anything new about this you
haven't studied the right history
courses they're just repeating what was
said by leading British intellectuals
people like John Stuart Mill and others
at the peak when written joyed it's day
and the Sun and the same is true of they
find the same among lesser aspirants for
the prize that standard whoever you are
the leading intellectuals explain that
you represent history's purpose and is
therefore beneficial if you rule the
world well I'm going to stop there's a
lot more to say about all of this these
are the some some not all of the deep
abysses into which we ought to be
peering the good side of the story which
there really is less mean to talk about
because we all know it and we don't have
to congratulate ourselves on
achievements but there have been plenty
of i mentioned that we're now
commemorating the 40th anniversary of
the attack on South Vietnam without any
notice the reason there's not notice is
because there was no protest at that
point and say Berkeley or anywhere else
nobody cared if the United States was
going to start bombing another country
and attack it with chemical warfare
that's fine that's what we do no
American president could conceivably do
anything like that today it took years
at that time before any protest
developed out of that protest and the
parallel civil rights movement and
other popular developments big changes
took place one change that the
government see the changes took place
over the past 30 or 40 years have made
the country at a lot more civilized that
couldn't conceivably have been a meeting
like this 40 years ago probably 20 years
ago there's been a constant improvement
places just a lot more civilized it
continues a historical course I mean
there's been a long struggle to attain
more more rights more democratic control
and its continuing and probably
accelerating and it's a tendency running
counter to the tendency towards
destruction and exactly which curve is
going to move up faster will determine
the fate of the species that question is
pretty much in the hands of people like
you
oh I think Chomsky is a very careful
again thoughtful person I think it shows
that um he has encyclopedic knowledge I
could speak on any topic and make you
think about it and the amazing thing is
despite all the depressing things he
said that he's optimistic and that was
really wonderful to see Noam Chomsky
knows a lot about a lot of things sure
doesn't he yeah he does oh it was
wonderful I agree with everything that
he said thank you and he gave us hope
that it would just organized and act
there's hope that's wonderful I feel
better than I felt months
even as a caltarian state but meteor
gonna have to be somewhat responsive the
public opinion and it's much more true
in a country like you class question you
don't have any concern that CNN and
MSNBC are becoming mouthpieces for the
US military though they are they're much
less so than they were in the past so
it's not they're becoming they always
were and it's less so than it used to be
so i could take MSNBC I mean you know
since September
