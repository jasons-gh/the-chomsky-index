as our chums the personal letter just
like to express my gratitude for your
conscience of awareness in this
situation but my question is what do you
see as the origin of this neoliberal
trend I think that as I said it goes on
all the time it's a constant in the by
the nineteen it started right after the
Second World War but it was as I said it
was of limited success despite a
because of the first of all the 50s and
60s were a huge growth period the
biggest period of economic growth in
American history it was also relatively
gallop terrian growth so the lowest
quintile was doing as well as print that
were that the New Deal measures were
enforced so that was some measure of
social welfare the 60s as many of you
know period very significant activism
and there were many achievements
Medicare all these things the civil
rights women's rights that led to a
backlash by the 1970s the backlash was
coming strong effort to feed all this
back and it was
there so for example take say the labor
movement in the early 1970s there had
there was a series of radical efforts at
a kind of unionization which actually
would have led to worker control in
industry like General Motors but it was
but it ran into a conflict for the labor
movement with a rather striking
phenomenon the achievements of the
1960's were in a civil and social rights
like race of minorities rights of women
and so on I'm sorry we're gonna switch
your mic it's people having trouble
hearing you're gonna give you back the
this one and then we're gonna turn that
one off and we're gonna put a new mic
there for people okay well I won't run
out of this but great is something
important and very unfortunate
early 1970s which gave impetus to the to
the class war organized constantly by
the rich and powerful
it was the successes of the 60s which
were implemented in a way which
alienated plenty of poor working people
so for example take take blessing okay
just take a look at how busing was
organized was busing was or attendances
or polo
busing was you know it was organized by
a very liberal judge judge Garrity
well-meaning liberal judge it was
organized in such a way that it sent
kids from the Irish area in South Boston
to the black areas and rocks
conversely well that already is gonna
cause problems an Irish lineman let's
say who had made enough money so he
could send this kids to a good school
house all of sudden his kid is going off
the Roxbury and black kids who doesn't
like anywhere coming into this area
conversely one thing was left out the
accident and sober no fussing
in and out of the affluent suburb okay
they're excluded but it was designed in
such a way as to set communities against
each other without the concern for them
and without bringing in the affluent
suburbs and that happened in the many
respects so take women's rights one of
the main achievements of 60s 70s was
very significant achievement
women's rights but for many male workers
that was an attack on them it was done
in a way which they could interpret as
an attack on them all of this was
exploited by clever and city's
propaganda you see it right now but they
say the Republican Party which has
drifted so far to the right that it's
literally off the spectrum they do not
run on their policies so you take a look
at the candidates Rubio Bush whoever it
may be they do not say here are our
policies we want to do the opposite of
what you want you will want higher taxes
on the rich that's been true for decades
we're going to lower taxes on the rich
now you all want health services and
other other benefits we're going to
wreck them for you they don't tell you
any of those things I mean if you read
the Ryan budget you can see but that's
not what they run on what they run on is
abortion rights religious rights this is
the this powerful government interfering
in your lives so on things
in fact that's where this strange what's
called libertarianism in the United
States comes from in the United States
contrary to the libertarian tradition
libertarianism means putting greater and
greater power into the hands of
unaccountable private tyrannies that's
what a private corporation is it's an
unaccountable tyranny internally is
completely tyrannical structure not
accountable the public its goals are to
maximize profit market share nothing but
welfare the hated that you're taught to
hate the government but remember that to
the extent that the societies Democratic
the government is you right of course
it's the site is not democratic yeah
sure every reason to hate it but that's
just an attack on democracy the hatred
of the government it means any
institution that might work for the
common good not for private power and
profit that has to hate all of this is
what's mobilized in fact what the
Republicans have had to do as they shift
it off the spectrum is to mobilize
sectors of the
that have always been around but were
never really mobilized as political
force so the religious right for example
it's a very fundamentalist society
unusually so the comparative standards
and that sector
evangelical right has been mobilized
into quite a significant political force
there are other things happening in the
country white supremacy has been an
extremely powerful doctrine in the
United States you look at comparative
studies of white supremacy in various
countries this is good news best one is
by George Frederick see very good
scholar with white supremacy he shows
pretty convincingly that it's
the more powerfully held in the United
States even than in apartheid South
Africa and if you go back in American
history there's a you know there's
really strange doctrines of not just
white supremacy but anglo-saxon
supremacy so for example Benjamin
Franklin you know figure of the
Enlightenment actually argued that
Germans and Swedes should not be allowed
to immigrate for the United States
because they're too swarthy they're not
pure anglo-saxons and it just goes on
like that well right now we're in a
situation where whites are going to
become a minority and there's a sector
of the population that is devastated by
that they're taking our country away
from us then the nativist sector of the
population it's a part of the gun
culture praised one culture in the
United States different any other
country
there's actually a law passed by one of
the states I think it's Iowa that
permitting just recently permitting
people who are blind to get gun permits
my wife and I happen to be in Arizona a
couple weeks ago and we visited an old
friend of mine who's in an assisted
living home when you go to this is that
living room there's a sign on the door
that says gun-free area you know I mean
it seems like that don't exists in other
countries but it exists here
it has its roots in fear it's been a
very frightened society such as origins
for good reasons
you're exterminating the indigenous
population they might fight back it's a
the economy was based on slave labor
camps vicious slave labor camps for a
long period and that was always fear
that there could be an uprising out of
that comes a fear of them you know
extends to immigrants the first and in
the early years of the country
from Europe were welcome you know you're
clearing the country of the inhabitants
you have to fill it they didn't want to
Orientals they were blocked but
immigrants for Europe were admitted up
until 1924 when the first serious
Immigration Act was passed and though
they didn't say of these words it was
and specifically against Italians and
Jews and this goes on that these
elements of the population are being
mobilized by the former Republican Party
they are not and those are the ways in
which candidates try to get votes not
the policies that they're actually
pursuing well you know all of this is
backed by concentrated power which is
fighting the usual class war these
factors have converged but there were
other things too the international
financial system that was set up after
the
or that did collapse in the early 70s
that was a critical factor the Bretton
Woods system collapsed that led the new
financial relation to deregulation of
capital and many other things that which
led to the enormous increase in power of
financial institutions I mean back in
the 50s and 60s the banks were basically
banks you the bank was a place for you
get some extra money put in the bank
maybe they'd lend it to somebody to buy
a car since the 1970s banks had become
basically a risky investment firms but
dedicated to massive speculation through
predatory activities you know extremely
trading
I've said Mike for a second things like
that that's a huge change they've gained
enormous power that's that's
there's very good literature on this is
quite a good book by Packer and Pierson
hold the winner winner take all beeps
politics
which goes into a lot of it a very good
book by Jefferson calorie on what
happened how the achievements is called
I think the decline of the labor
movement it's quote it's about the very
interesting question of how the liberal
achievements which were proud of rightly
in the sixties and seventies were shaped
and designed in such a way that they
alienated but many working people who
felt that they were being harmed by them
didn't have to be like that but that so
it was done quite question all of these
factors converge and it led to a
worldwide assault
it's the neoliberal system and it's now
being produced significantly it's not
the first time I felt like in the
nineteen twenties in the United States
there had been a very powerful labor
movement in dealers it almost completely
crushed by the night
but mostly by force we drove us a Red
Scare after the first world war was a
final blow to independent thought
and of course yet keeps the same kind of
think well
today the same phrase financial
speculations but it was reversed it was
reversed in the 1930s and it's being
murders now but it's gone on for long
time let's bring up a stand and then
maybe we can yeah then maybe we can move
the microphone
why don't we test up here and see if
that's better or labels and was one of
my France Italy and even a few things he
thinks in stopping briefs or do you
think are similar to saweeza are going
to spread and he think is it a good or
bad
how
we see
move around
you see
patience
we're gonna tell you what you don't it
seems that one of the most common ways
the American media collects to justify
capitalism as a source of good is by
correlating
contemporary American capitalism we've
developed a technology that can support
good instead of romanticized on these
visions we have size
in startups in Silicon Valley life and
there we hear so many reports of
universities and corporations with large
sums of money making using capitalism
Devon sir do you think it's fair to
extend credit capitalism American
technological development do you think
we value technology properly and maybe
most importantly and more vitalize the
Rotarians socialist society how can we
sustain but get one more
this
tell me about that I said there was a
liberalism in the future the future of
neoliberalism future beauty so just to
sort of synthesize a little it sounds
like we're asking a lot of questions
about sort of contemporary events moving
into the future of neoliberalism and if
I'm and also how technology comes into
play so I think three the questions as
for the future of neoliberalism that
you're the only people who can answer
that question literally I mean depends
how people act so as I said there was a
similar wave of assault on welfare in
the population in the 1920s there was
one in the 1890s there were popular
reactions they were beaten back and
there was progress
I mentioned Latin America with as
considerable the resistance has been
significant in fact to start southern
Europe it's beginning to take off in a
very
away but it's basically in your hands
the most serious threat of neoliberalism
is the one I barely mentioned the threat
of environmental catastrophe which
follows almost directly from reliance on
market forces in a sector of the economy
which is dedicated to energy production
if there's no serious rig I mean
scientists by now are is enormous
consensus of scientists concluding that
most of the fossil fuels have to be left
in the ground if we're to have any hope
of decent survival if you don't want
Boston to be under water for example
that's and it's not very far off but the
major energy corporations with the help
of the government are dedicated to
maximizing use of fossil fuels and that
more or less follows from the limited
market principles that exist the ways I
mentioned so that's but that's really up
to you as I said there's huge protests
right to our north at the moment against
the east energy pipeline if it succeed
if they succeed they may block it they
may block fracking right north of the
main border but the rest is just up to
us and
general let me say something you have
the technology question you whoever
asked the question is right that
apologist you know
proponents of what they call capitalism
use the example of technological
development as an example to illustrate
the wonders of capitalism and raise the
question how could a more a free and
democratic society that develops modern
technology well take a look at the
development of modern technology say
computers the internet your iPad or the
whole range of it almost all of it comes
out of the state sector the state sector
for decades popular public funding
public institutions the university is
National Academy isn't so nice
science centers for decades they carried
out the risky creative difficult work of
developing your laptop and your iPad
after decades these things were handed
over to private power to adapt for the
market and to market and make profit
from okay so how would it work in a
freer society same way it works now
except not handing it over to private
power to profit from and notice
incidentally how radically
anti-capitalist this is suppose you make
a risk in a capitalist system suppose
you make a risky investment for decades
you keep pouring money for decades into
something that's risky
our creative finally after decades
something comes out that makes profit
what I supposed to happen to you you're
supposed to share in that profit that's
not the way it happens here
it's American taxpayers who paid for the
development of computers internet
satellites GPS lasers and run through
the list do they get any profit from the
profit goes into the pockets of the
private corporate
that are handed the achievements and
then are able to market them for profit
no it's not that they do nothing
you know they adapt like Apple but
that's decades of computer development
into something that looks great and
works nice and so on but it's a it's the
fringe of technological development the
same is true for pharmaceuticals and
most else and it's understandable why a
private corporation does not want to
invest in long term risky projects that
may or may not work out and are going to
be expensive involve a lot of innovation
and risk and so on so they'd rather have
the taxpayer - what's both the
government have the government do it
that's actually the way technological
development largely works 100% but very
substantially the and here it goes way
back in his
the American mass marketing system mass
manufacturing system which kind of
amazed the world in the 19th century you
know efficient mass manufacture
quality control interchangeable parts
these new assembly lines they were
mostly developed in government armors
now because in a government installation
you don't to worry about the cost they
have to worry about the price you don't
worry about whether there ain't going to
work well you do it because I'm a little
a little workout in fact if you take the
American economy as a whole
what is it based on to a very
substantial extent the American economy
is based on slave labor camps literally
the cotton was the fuel of the 19th
century it was the basis for economic
development our slave labor camps were
the most efficient in the world
productivity and the coulomb plantations
in the south
slave labor pens that would have
impressed the Nazis literally they were
they were able to increase productivity
faster than an industry with no
technological
development just more and more brutality
more and more torture was able to
increase the rate of cotton production
it's not just the owners of the slave
labor camps of plantations have profited
the northeastern bankers did the basis
of our financial system the mills did
the biggest center of manufacturing
enterprises in the world were in Lowell
textile mill yeah coming right off the
slave labor camps in the south that's
massive government intervention state
intervention and economic development
clearing the country of the indigenous
population that's state intervention in
the economy right massive is never
counted by economists but even if you
look at the parts that are counted like
say development of computers the
internet and so on still an enormous
role in the public system so I thought
could only be improved a freer and more
just society anything what about the
prospects for syriza it was a wonderful
photograph that appeared in a copy
exactly where a couple of days ago
which should which shows uncle Americo
German Chancellor standing like this
with her finger pointed luxury suppress
the head of serezha down and she pays
her electric yeah you bad boy you better
do what we tell you to do
right that's power assistance
serezha has pretty strong arguments not
just that the population wants an end to
these utterly destructive policies but
the germany itself should those huge
reparations decrease the Germany of Nazi
Germany correctly destroyed groups of
the 1940s where's the reparations in
1953 a Germany convinced the European
Union to discounted status basically
could default its debts because they
couldn't pay em back and that's the
basement they create huge subsidy
that's the basis for their economic
development that's what Greece's that
you passed before and as I say these
days there's no basis for repaying their
the fault of the the banks the
multinationals corrupted leads the
population so will serezha succeed in
achieving this or will the
finger-wagging and them succeed well you
know that depends
not so much what we do but what your
opinions do if they're willing to
tolerate this sure they don't succeed
they'll be beating back the European
elites are terrified of syriza because
it's a popular organization that's
calling for the kind of social and
economic policies which could lead the
development and lead out of the crisis
but without paying off the banks over
responsible for the crisis so naturally
they don't like it they're gonna beat it
back the same on a larger scale with
podemos in Spain it's going to be harder
to beat back a popular movement in Spain
it's bigger economy in the resistance
but these developments are basically in
the hands of Europeans just like the
ones here in their hands this Arisa
connect a trip to Moscow it's
interesting to see the reaction here the
European Union bureaucrats are crushing
Greece and the head of the cereza went
to Moscow to see if he could make a
trade agreements and even loan
agreements which might help Greece is
that a crime he retreated is a major
crime but ask yourself why
we're crushing we you know Germany in
the European Union and the bureaucrats
are crushing Greece under their jackboot
and Greece does something to try to
alleviate the problem that currently it
is if you want to make sure that it
doesn't succeed it's a little bit like
this morning's news read the lead
article in New York Times it's about
another Russian crime they're agreeing
to apparently going to agree to send
anti-aircraft weapons to Iran and why is
that in front I mean the United in the
United States there are articles in the
major journals New York Times in the
Washington Post saying we should bomb
Iran right now
no negotiations Israel is constantly
saying we're going to bomb Iran okay
then all of these are utterly outrageous
I mean if articles were appearing that
Iran saying let's let's destroy the
United States though would be laughable
we'd be upset and this is not laughable
the major superpower and its major
regional clan are saying let's attack
your n and Russia is criminally offering
Iran of weak means of defense that's
really criminal and in fact if you read
the articles they actually concede
what's going on in the small print they
say is terrible thing the brush is doing
but if they give Iran an anti-aircraft
weapons it might make it harder for the
United States and Israel Obama okay so
therefore it's criminal
now that's accepted in our culture you
can ask yourself what kind of pathology
is it that allows this to appear without
people either collapsing and ridicule or
rebelling in fact it's accepted part of
our moral and intellectual culture is if
we want to attack and destroy another
country that's legitimate and if they
try to defend themselves its criminals
all the time take this famous film
it's breaking all records the some of
you have seen it I'm sure you know about
this is a guy who's became famous
because apparently killed or Iraqis
anybody else but take a look at the
incidents to the first incident it's
particularly clear in his memoirs but
also in the film the Marines were
attacking a town of section of the city
a man and a woman came out into the
street holding a grenade and the sniper
was his first shot he killed her with
one shot they also killed her son picked
up the grenade and what's described as
these are savages
they're monsters we hate them they're
not human we have to kill them we send
the Marines to invade another country to
smash up a town a woman tries to defend
they're savage monsters right nobody's
permitted criminal to stand in the way
of our aggression and violence and
that's taken for granted you know like
it's not just the New York Times art
section praised the film denounced the
East Coast liberals who are making fun
of it and so on you know understand
red-blooded patriotic American
sentiments um this is the culture that
we live in is deeply pathological and it
has to be remedy only from inside no
other way well that's Theresa on Moscow
it's a lot involved we'll take three
years one more I think next on this side
here
speaker
well the school one of the aspects of
neoliberalism sorry okay so okay I want
to try to take a few and then we'll come
back with these really obviously around
us today
well
in regards to my linguistics would you
argue or agree that due to the rapid
evolution
they're generally becoming over it okay
then one more on this side
last four five education students
do something this is Paige and Jacob Ben
Paige March it was it yeah okay yeah
and yes
so therefore 20 yards
that was actually provide some policy
that would provide redistribution either
people
let's take good these are all extremely
good questions that shouldn't have long
answers I'll try to be brief
neoliberalism and education the goal of
the primary thrust of neoliberalism as a
class business run class or generally is
to undermine and eliminate services to
the public and transfer them to private
hands where they can be used to increase
wealth and power and one aspect is
public education so the Boston Public
Schools like public schools around the
country are badly underfunded the class
size is too big there aren't enough
teachers the curriculums are setup to
get almost guarantee that children won't
learn and what we all know from our own
experiences I'm sure that every one of
you may have taken courses that we
weren't interested in but there was a
test so we studied for the exam we
passed the test and a week later we
forgot what the
was about but that's what happens when
you when learning doesn't come from the
inside
something that doing emphasize if the if
your study and your learning is driven
by an inner quest for understanding if
it's answering your curiosity you can
learn and it will stay if it's pouring
water into a vessel and then you pour it
out again it's a very leaky vessel but
that's the way curriculums are now being
designed
it's called a race to the top or
whatever it is teachers are well aware
you just cannot teach under these
conditions to where kids are driven to
pass the test but not pay attention to
what not pursued their own interests and
concerns I've actually had when I've
taught the groups of teachers I've had
teachers come up with their own
experiences which are pathetic
a kid says you know I'm interested in
this topic after class and the teacher
has to say I'm sorry
you can look at it because you have to
pass them guess you know your future
depends on it say it but my salary
depends on it so forget your interests
and concerns and try to just memorize
enough to pass this test meanwhile an
enormous amount of money is going in to
privatize schools which are draining the
public sector they pay for see more true
in higher education instead of building
the infrastructure the training t11
giving the teachers cutting that class
size giving opportunities for serious
learning although that's a normal part
of neoliberal education at the higher
education level
the statement for the public system over
the country legislators have sharply
decreased public funding for the public
public colleges and universities so they
have to try to you know go to the
private sector to pick up money to
survive and of course that's very
harmful tuitions have shot way up it's
very striking to see you might ask
yourself you know student debt now is
huge
why I mean is there some economic reason
for that educational reason it's very
hard to leave of the most successful
educational higher educational systems
in the world like Finland and Germany
it's test scores and so on
they're free he goes south of the border
to Mexico poor country has a very good
university system it has very poor
facilities like you know salaries
but it's quite high quality went on for
example it's free that you look back at
err earlier history back in the 1950s
this was a much poorer country than it
is now
education higher education was virtually
free the GI Bill gave educational
opportunities even not just for
education but even subsidies that huge
numbers of people who never would have
made it to college before and it of
course is very helpful
advantageous for them also for the
economy part of the reason why they come
growing there was a port much poorer
country free education even private
education was very cheap in those days
like when I went to college 1945 I went
to the University of Pennsylvania in
those days you just went to your local
school - it's a private college but
tuition I think is $100 today I mean I
don't think there's any economic
justification for this if you look at it
there's a huge increase in expenditures
for administration administration's have
just exploded that mean while the
faculty salaries stay relatively low
there's a shift of standard neoliberal
shift to temporary work - none
non-tenured work so you get the cheapest
labor you can which is adjuncts and
graduate students no rights can't
complain you know Pam anything from an
economic point
the point of view of the trustees and
the legislature looks great what a
wonderful way to cut costs but what
about the education that the students
are getting well that's not counted you
know that's not counted as of course all
of this is neoliberal policies what kind
of constitutional that is by no means
graven and stone like I say other
countries just don't do it
Finland Germany France Mexico they don't
do it and they have educational systems
in many many ways better than ours
constitutional amendments you can think
of a lot actually one I think would be
the one that 70% of the population was
in favor of in the 1990 guaranteed
health care how about a constitutional
amendment calling for implementation of
article 25 of the universal declaration
I don't think
but these are policies that should be
implemented and many others can run
through the list right now there's a lot
of talk rightly about some kind of
constitutional amendment which will make
it at least minimally possible to have
functioning democratic elections
elections that aren't you boy no we
don't need a couple of billion dollars
to run but it's a little bit idle to
talk about constitutional amendments
because they can only be put through if
there's overwhelming popular support for
it and if there is you don't need the
constitutional amendment you can just
instantly follow our people becoming
illiterate as a result of technology
there are studies showing that there's
less reading if you look
the texts that are assigned this couple
of studies showing studying the texts
that are signed in the schools pay to
twelve and it turns out that year by
year the reading level required is
lowered so you know say novels that were
signed in ninth grade 20 years ago
in 12th grade and that's happening
across the board what the role you know
how much technology is contributing to
this we could ask an interesting
question I just found a couple days ago
I saw an interesting example myself
having to write an article critical in
the New York Times which was called the
one day in the life of reading the New
York Times I immediately got letters
back saying you know that's a title of a
Beatles song title The Beatles songs
also the title of a famous book
Association is one day in the life of
event Vanessa brought in the notion
but I think getting a letter saying
small anecdote but I think it's the kind
of thing that happens with the there's
something much more general let me just
mention that this book that I'd
recommend that you look at it's buy a
gun and Jonathan Rose big book it's
called it's about the reading habits of
British workers in the late 19th century
it's a very detailed study of what poor
working people in the slums of London
were reading turns out that their
education didn't blur school but their
educational level conclusion is was
better than that of British aristocrats
the same was true in the United States
the late 19th century
I mean if an Irish blacksmith got a
little money he did a boy to read to him
while he's working they were reading
classics what we regard as classics the
best literature of the time this goes on
right into the 1930s I mean I could
remember myself my family are mostly on
it
employed working-class in the 30s the
many of them had very little formal
education but they're very highly
educated conversations about the latest
Shakespeare play concert with a string
quartet two debates about analysis all
kinds of things there was a lot of work
or education self education the unions
were very influential in this regard
that's a lot of that has disappeared but
it can be recovered we don't working
people don't have to be less educated
than they were in the late 19th century
those are social policies not laws of
nature
Oh last question was why aren't people
rebelling there's an easy answer to that
ask yourself
possi
so we
I'm curious
could you speak into the microphone of
the webinar we can't hear all the way up
there yeah everyone thinks that we
should be tax rate but let's say we also
want
for rank is CC because most
how do we
simple answer changed the structure
again it's not a law of nature that if
for the last 40 years of poll taking the
people of the much large majority wants
higher taxes on the wealthy it's not a
law of nature the taxes have to go down
that's just saying we don't live in a
Democratic Society so let's make it a
Democrat
we gentrification do you mean like
gentrification of neighborhoods and do
you think surely is and the ways of
combated are the usual ones organize the
neighborhoods in the pocket and the
general public to opposes and to make
sure there's decent housing communities
people quite general usually it's easy
to say hard to do but it's always the
same answer world extractor practice
appointed to you lose the solid
scientific evidence without access to
weekly reports to our extinction
imperative you know complex jargon for
people and planet is just profoundly
antisocial and yet you know governments
world life is being so thoroughly
corrupted by capital population to
remain compliant and enslaved the
society completely broke down before
were structural changes I mean
with which country
America's competitiveness suddenly
suddenly will be so low that there will
be trusted consequences
there should be some outside emotion so
it sounds like you're asking we we need
the greater good but sort of what's the
impetus to get there what's gonna push
us to get there and I connect that to
the last question which was we seem to
be on the verge of extinction like how
much more do we need to force ourselves
to sort of go towards that revolution so
what if we're not I think what is going
to push us far enough to move towards
revolution seems to be served what the
last questions are getting out if we
haven't gotten there yet what's going to
push us anything the Yale University
publishes a regular study of attitudes
on climate change okay it turns out that
in the state of Massachusetts their
estimate
less than 70% of the population even
believe that there's a climate change
happening over the whole continent the
South South Carolina it's you know maybe
50% when you turn to anthropogenic
climate change or humans and personally
implicated in climate change the figures
are much lower well you can understand
this I mean if you read the newspapers
there it's a kind of he says she says I
think there's a report that says you
know report on climate change 97% of
scientists say it's a catastrophe two or
three people say it's not happening at
sunspots so pick this or pick that we
have to present both sides of the
argument and people who don't do their
own research which most people can't do
are puzzled you know well maybe it isn't
happening maybe it's clouds maybe it's
sunspots maybe maybe we were really
going through an ice age know the last
we had a big snowstorms this
in Boston so there's no client there's
no global warming and if people do not
have the cultural and educational
background to assess the crisis it's not
going to be a serious reaction well how
do you deal with that provide the
educational background that's there's no
simple answer
that's what organizing is about it's
reaching people who are who do not have
the kind of privilege and access that
the people in this room have and getting
them and helping them understand the
nature of the world that's the first
step the next step is organizing them to
carry out significant actions like for
example the huge protests that are going
on
about the energy pipeline with tens of
thousands of people per distance there's
you know as I said before the answer is
easy to say and hard to do but it's the
only answer there ever has been whether
it was civil rights
abolitionism opposition to war you know
opposition to nuclear weapons you pick
it there's no other way and it's not
impossible there
many achievements but it takes hard work
I think that was it with the questions
and Duncan is are you going to say
something poetic okay Duncan is the
well-known is the university's poet
laureate so I think he might not ask a
question but but say a poem say
something poetic to you
thanks for that but there's a come as a
crucial comment which you know very well
talks at MIT in 1964 were to half a
dozen people half of whom wanted to kill
you in fact it's we should think back at
what it was like the Opposition in the
city of the Boston the most maybe the
most liberal city in the country you
could not have a public demonstration
against the war which wouldn't be
violently broken up until about 1967
that was when he is known as correctly
and this is an enormous change and
that's very positive well you never had
unimaginable an audience this on any
did you want
just one light yeah I think that it's
you I know you've been waiting patiently
so maybe what we could do is very
quickly hear your questions and then I
don't think we'll have a chance to
answer all of them but maybe pick one of
the questions that seems to maybe
combine some of the ideas because I feel
badly for you waiting for so long but we
are going to run out of time and I think
this has been a very long session so
maybe we could just pass the mic back
and hear your three questions and then
we pass the mic back here your three
questions and then we can just sort of
pick one of the most interesting that we
can kind of pull together so
so just saying to thank you
like us questions so I think we'll just
hear a lot no questions
did you put the mic just up close to
your mouth game thank you
so I think began will have some brief
comments from the three of you and then
try to sort of pull this together and
select one of these questions to answers
could you just go close to the mic
because the mics are not that strong
yeah just loud
if your passions
also
I think he was saying how that people
were very prosperous
and you were saying how to break the
pathology among citizens okay among
citizens as well as politicians yeah
yeah thank you
so I think that's a lot of questions but
maybe maybe selecting yeah somebody say
where I'm they're all important
questions right no time to talk
unfortunately
so what can we say take the last how do
you break the in
passivity cultural mythology only the
way it's always been done how did we end
slavery how did he get women's rights
how did the civil rights movement
develop how did the New Deal measures
take place how did the 1960s social
progress take place always the same
answer
it takes education and organization and
the kind of activism that's adapted the
circumstances there just are no magic
formulas and it works takes a lot it
takes a lot of effort but it can work
they're just different answers in
different cases and so for example I
happen to attend interesting meeting at
the downtown Boston School where
activists and parents and others were
talking about what they do and so for
example when success was getting these
are communities that are deeply
disempowered immigrant communities half
a dozen different countries as many
English and so on one of the first steps
that broke through was organizing a
group of mothers to demand a trip that
they get a traffic light at a corner
where children cross the street okay
they organized and managed to get the
traffic light and they realized that
they can achieve something so they went
on to something else and tried to
achieve that you know that's the way it
works black kids setna lunch counter in
Greensboro in 1960
of course arrested hauled away could
have ended except that others came the
next day
pretty sure you had Freedom Riders you
know you had to snake before bottling
coordinate but they finally you've got
huge demonstrations seems like Selma
that's wrong that's how things work
there just is no other way now Quaid is
a different story because there you're
facing harsh repression in fact I don't
have to tell you there were the Arab
Spring was very quickly crushed in the
oil dictatorships people were you know
Saudi Arabia which is the worst people
are afraid to go out in the streets it
was so violent and buffering
by there were demonstrations finally
they were broken up by force and this is
the army and they we don't face those
problems I mean for the people in Kuwait
it's a really tough problem not as bad
as in Saudi Arabia but bad and when
you're facing repressive state violence
your options are very much restricted
doesn't mean you can do nothing like
there are efforts that do introduce
changes don't have to tell you you know
better than I do but it's much different
than here we don't face that problem we
used to people used to face it so labor
organizing for example faced extreme
violence in the United States throughout
much of American history civil rights
organizing I mean you all know about it
but it was very brutal than ourselves
not very pretty here either it's not
wonderful now but it's nothing like what
it was and that gives you more off
2news but the methods are always the
same the only question is what's the
scope of doing with how do you ensure
that it doesn't regress we'll take a
look at Egypt why did it regress an
agent a lot of that was the fault of
people who are my friends the secular
left they were so busy fighting each
other that they did not unite and win
the election which they could have the
Morsi election probably could have been
won by the secular forces on the Left if
they gotten together instead of fighting
each other well you know that's a
disease of left activists many very
sensible secular left people actually
welcome the military dictatorship under
the illusion that it was going to bring
democracy there was even a New York
Review about it I know from friends who
did agree to that people who tried to
talk them out of it we're just dismissed
well okay those are errors that don't
have to be committed when you cannot
ensure that they'll never
regression but you can undertake steps
which can minimize the danger and that
just wasn't about going abroad to learn
that's very useful I mean the United
States an extremely insular Society and
you can understand why I'm if you live
in Europe and you travel a hundred miles
it's a different culture a different
language a different style of dress you
know the things are totally different if
you go from Boston to Los Angeles 3,000
miles the you know you've left home
that's a little warmer that's what the
same store is the same accent slightly
different but that's it's a huge country
which is as little relation to the
outside and people don't know about the
outside to a remarkable extent things
like say the Peace Corps how much they
contributed to other countries is
debatable but they contributed a lot of
the United States for exactly the reason
that whoever is the question mentioned
people were faced with other societies
where things are different and there's
different assumptions of different
cultures different achievements and so
on
that's very educational
- you know you can't send everyone
abroad it's a test here to try to
overcome the insularity and the
unwillingness to look outside to see
what others think what they believe as
to the automation that first of all is
almost no detectable effect there's you
go around Boston there's a huge amount
of work to be done I mean you can't it
drives down a street without having to
find you
potholes and detours there's there
aren't enough teachers there aren't
enough health workers there's a shortage
there's a vast shortage of work that it
has to that should be done there are
plenty of people who want to do the work
the employment they say employment is
going unemployed it's going down which
is not false but it fails to deal with
the fact that huge numbers have just
dropped out of the workforce and despair
the proportion of employable people to
employed is quite low so we have a huge
number of people who want work we have
plenty of work to be done
Automation isn't taking it away there
are plenty of resources to do it but the
system is so dysfunctional that it is
not able to put together enormous
resources we'll to work work to be done
as for the future of automation if it
can take away
be done routinely fine why should you
know frees people up to do other things
so there's I don't see any reason to
fear it we should welcome as for the
personal and political you know if you
have if you're safe physicist you don't
stop being a human being
maybe quantum physics doesn't relate to
you know opposition to poverty but you
do it many things in your life
nobody devotes themselves a hundred
percent to socially useful and effective
activities you do a lot of other things
in your life and some of them can be
pursuing intellectual challenges that
are significant demanding and appealing
so I don't see any in fact if you look
at say say the question of anti-war
activism which arose in the early
sixties most of the people involved were
scientists
from their professional lives to get
engaged from this these are always you
know remember that you know I'm surely
this is an audience of privileged people
you have lots of opportunities I mean a
lot of problems undoubtedly but by
comparative standards plenty of
opportunities and privilege and they're
plenty of choices you can make
it means you might do up some things to
others
