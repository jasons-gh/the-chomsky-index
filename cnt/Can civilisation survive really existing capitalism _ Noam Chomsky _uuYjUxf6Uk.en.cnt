so it had to Maria's account that when I
got here with when Karen I got here
without passports it actually was very
nice gesture on the part of the Irish
government to arrange it because they
knew that I was coming here and as a
guest of Amnesty International to speak
at a campaign they were conducting
condemning the government for its
participation and the globalized terror
campaign Shannon Airport but they went
ahead anyway well you've seen the title
I guess it's a question can civilization
survive really existing capitalism in
referring to really existing capitalism
I have in mind what really exists and is
called capitalism though whether that's
what it should be called as another
question and the United States is the
most important example for obvious
reasons the term itself capitalism is
vague enough so that it can cover a
great many possibilities in fact that's
a straight by the fact that it's is used
to describe the United States US
economic system which deviates quite
crucially from market capitalism
free-market capitalism as indeed did
Britain before it and in fact every
other developed society the only
societies that could authentically be
called capitalism are the ones that had
free markets rammed down their throat by
imperial powers they're what we now call
the third world not least for that
reason it's a worth bearing in mind how
the scale of the departures of really
existing capitalism from the official
doctrine free-market capitalism so keep
the United States to mention just a few
examples in the past 20 years the share
of profits of the largest 200
corporations in the United States has
risen very sharply partly as a result of
the internet which was supposed to have
the opposite effect but it's having the
effect of intensifying the oligopolistic
character of the core US economy so the
law ndeg in another sector the largest
banks with trillions of dollars of
assets have repeatedly merged to become
still larger by now the six largest ones
largely responsible for the current
global financial crisis they've
increased their assets from 18% of gross
domestic product 20 years ago to 63%
today oligopoly of course undermines
markets it leads to automatically to
collusion to prevent price wars which
the competitors don't want and to turn
to mostly meaningless
product differentiation to try to get
people to buy their goods instead of
someone else's identical ones that's
done through massive advertising
advertising itself
it was a huge industry maybe marketing
maybe 1/6 of gross domestic product its
advertising is explicitly devoted to
undermining markets taken an economics
course you know that markets are
supposed to be based on informed
consumers making rational choice
which is not exactly what you see if you
turn on the television said creativity
and innovation have also substantially
been in the public sector not much
appreciated so turn to Alan Greenspan
back in the days when he was still
revered as a saint Alan that was before
the crash that was caused in no small
part by adherence to the fundamentalist
market doctrines that he preached back
then in his glory days he gave a speech
to editors in which he extolled the
wonders of our free market system with
system free enterprise with based on
entrepreneurial initiative and consumer
choice but he made a mistake he actually
listed examples every example he listed
was a textbook case of the crucial role
of the state sector all the way through
there was actually one exception which
was an instructive one in itself namely
transistors transistors were developed
at a private laboratory Bell Telephone
laboratories and the lab was a great lab
for a long time
that's when AT&T had a government
insured monopoly over telephone service
so could therefore impose millat
monopoly pricing had great resources it
could use them to establish a terrific
lab as soon as the company was broken up
the lab had to be dismantled it's still
there but it's now devoted to the short
term applications for for the industry
furthermore the transistor development
though it did take
place in the lab was based extensively
on wartime technology Second World War
technology which of course all in the
state sector and there was no market for
high-end transistors they were much too
expensive so therefore the government
had bought a hundred percent of them the
procurement incidentally is a major form
of government subsidy to the industry
actually there's a kind of an analogue
here in the way the core sectors of the
Irish economy have developed the
construction services vary substantially
through government for kind of
procurement paying them paying them off
to do things for which there's no demand
Saint Allan's speech incidentally was at
the same time when he was testifying to
Congress and soberly explaining the
wonders of the great economy that he was
directing to great acclaim at the time
which he attributed to what he called
growing worker insecurity now that is
intimidating workers so they won't make
any irrational efforts to try to keep
wages up to inflation let alone up the
productivity which they ought to be kept
up - that's an obvious contribution to
the health of the economy under really
existing capitalism computers and the
Internet in fact the whole the basic
components of the IT revolution they
were in the state sector for
substantially four decades before they
were handed over to private companies
for marketing and profit that includes
the creative and innovative
research development subsidies
procurement and other devices again very
little role for consumer choice and
entrepreneurial initiative at least in
the difficult and risky period except
for the initiative and getting
government subsidy for what you're doing
and the same is true of much of the
high-tech economy and it traces far far
back actually back to the early days of
English industrialization in one domain
the financial sector the state
intervention is notorious and it's
expanded enormous Lee of course in the
past generation in the United States
it's hard to remember but back in the
50s and 60s during the big growth period
and banks were banks put your money in
them they lent money to some presumably
useful purposes that was it no
interstate banks no financial crises
that changed in the past generation and
now they their firms devoted to complex
and risky transactions and they have
grown enormously by the time in the u.s.
at the time of the crash
2007 they had risen to 40 percent of
corporate profits now the way they can
get away with this is because they rely
very heavily on a government insurance
policy tacit insurance policy informally
it's called too big to fail that
provides the biggest banks with great
advantages and the scale has been
roughly estimated by economists maybe 40
billion dollars a year or so however
there's a recent study by the IMF that
indicates that that may be a
considerable underestimate I'll quote
the business press reporting the study
says perhaps the largest US by
aren't really profitable at all and the
billions of dollars they allegedly earn
for their shareholders were almost
entirely a gift from the US taxpayers in
a variety of ways including bailout but
many other things like cheap credit and
so on that's more evidence to support a
judgment by the most respected financial
correspondent in the english-speaking
world Martin wolf of the London
Financial Times he describes what he
says is that an out-of-control financial
sector is eating out the modern market
economy from inside just as the larvae
of a spider wasp eats out the host in
which it's been laid with an observation
with a certain grim resonance right here
and it is thanks to the lavish
contributions of the taxpayer
unwittingly to maintaining this
destructive system the term capitalism
is also used for many other systems it's
sometimes used for systems that have no
capitalists at all like the great
Mondragon conglomerate in the Basque
Country or the worker on the enterprises
that are springing up in the decaying
Rust Belt of the United States some
might even use the term capitalism to
include some version of the industrial
democracy that was advocated among
others by John Dewey America's leading
social philosopher in the last century
he called for a workers for workers to
be wood in his words masters of their
own industrial fate and for all
institutions to be under public control
including the means of production
exchange publicity transportation and
communication short of this Dewey
concluded politics will remain the
shadow cast by big business over Society
his major work as some of you know was
on democracy and that was his conception
of democracy and he was condemning the
truncated version of democracy that
really existed by now it's been left in
tatters much worse than when he
described by now control of the
government I'm getting talking about the
United States but not very different
elsewhere control of government is very
narrowly concentrated at the peak of the
income scale the large majority down
below are effectively disenfranchised
that's been John pretty well by just
mainstream political science one of the
major topics is investigating the very
rich poll data so you know what people
think and of course you can take a look
at policies you can compare them and the
recent racial research right in the
mainstream estimates that the lower 70
percent on the income wealth scale have
essentially no influence on policy so
they are effectively disenfranchised
influence increases slowly as you move
up the rest of the scale and you get to
the very top they get what they want
there's always been a lot of truth to
that but it's increased enormously
during the past 30 odd years of the
neoliberal period really an assault on
the population very harmful just about
everywhere it's been applied you've
suffered from it here the current
political economic system is actually a
form of plutocracy it's very misleading
to call it democracy diverges radically
from democracy if by democracy we mean
political Arrangements in which what the
public thinks has some influence on
policy there have been serious debates
and academic debates over the years
about whether a capitalism is in
principle consistent with democracy but
if we talk about really existing
capitalism the questions answered
certainly not a really existing
capitalist democracy for short or ECD
you can pronounce it rekt if you like
they are radically incompatible that's
easily demonstrated for reasons to which
I'll return it seems to me unlikely that
civilization can survive that really
existing capitalism and the sharply
attenuated a democracy that goes along
with it
and an important question is whether
actual actual democracy functioning
democracy that might make a difference
well it's hard to speculate about non
existent systems but there's some reason
to believe that it would so let's just
keep to the most critical immediate
problem that civilization faces there's
plenty of them but this is the primary
one environmental catastrophe policies
and public attitudes differ quite
sharply in the United States that's
commonly the case under wrecked but
strikingly in this case actually there's
a an issue of the last recent last issue
of the Journal of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences which goes into
this so read some quotes the researchers
found that a hundred and nine countries
have enacted some form of policy
regarding renewable power at 118
countries have set targets for renewable
energy in contrast to this hundred plus
the United States has not adopted any
consistent and stable set of policies at
the national level to force the foster
the use of renewable energy now that's
it's not public opinion that's driving
policy off the
national spectrum quite the contrary the
public is much closer to the global norm
than policy is and much more supportive
of actions to confront the likely
environmental disaster that we're facing
maybe not too far off
could be lives of our grandchildren
here's what the researchers found the
same issue huge majorities of the public
have favored steps by the federal
government to reduce the amount of
greenhouse gas emissions generated when
utilities produce electricity in 2006
eighty six percent of respondents
favored requiring utilities or at least
encouraging them with tax breaks to
reduce the amount of greenhouse gases
they emit also in that year eighty seven
percent favored tax breaks for utilities
that produce more electricity from water
the wind or sunlight and these
majorities have been maintained up to
the most recent studies very sharply
different from policies and I just
quoted well the fact that the public is
influenced by science is deeply
troubling to those who dominate the
economy and largely control state policy
as very interesting current illustration
of that there's an organization called
the Alec the American Legislative
Exchange Council it's a corporate funded
organization that rights legislation
that they try to induce states to adopt
they have a new program it's called an
environmental literacy Improvement Act
so the
the the act is intended for schools k12
you know kindergarten to 12th grade
and the the act Manit meant I'm quoting
it now the Act mandates balanced
teaching of climate science through
these years balanced teaching is a code
phrase that means teaching climate
change denial in order to balance a
mainstream climate science it's
analogous to what's called the balanced
teaching that's advocated by
creationists to enable the teaching of
creation science in the schools and in
fact legislation based on this act has
already been introduced by the number of
states
aLEC has play a clout because of the
enormous corporate funding behind it of
course all this is dressed up in
rhetoric about the wonders of critical
thinking about a fine idea
but you can think of better choices than
an issue that threatens decent survival
and by accident happens to contribute to
corporate profits the alec legislation
is based on a proposal or project of the
Heartland Institute
that's a corporate funded Institute
that's dedicated openly to rejection of
the scientific consensus on climate
change the Institute project calls is
called calls for a global warming
curriculum for k-12 classrooms it aims
to teach that there is a major
controversy over whether or not humans
are changing the weather and in fact
there is a controversy it's regularly
reported in the media on one side you
have the overwhelming majority of
scientists all the world's major
national academies of science all the
professional science journals the
integral
or interview and intergovernmental panel
on climate change that's one side they
all agree that global changes
global warming's taking place this
substantial human component that the
situation is serious and perhaps dire
and that very soon maybe within decades
the world might reach a tipping point
where there's nothing to do about it the
process will begin to escalate sharply
and will be irreversible with very
severe economic and social social
effects it's pretty rare to find a
consensus of that nature on a complex
scientific issue there is another side
consist of skeptics including a few
serious respected scientists who caution
correctly that much remains unknown
which means it might not be as bad as
anticipated or it might be worse only
the first part is reported and then
omitted from the contrived debate
altogether is a much larger group of
skeptics so highly regarded climate
scientists happens to include the
climate change group in my own
university MIT and they regard the
regular reports of the IPCC as much too
conservative and they've been repeatedly
proven correct unfortunately but they're
not part of the public debate although
they're very prominent in the scientific
literature
well the Heartland Institute and Alec
are just one part of a huge campaign by
corporate lobbies to sow doubts about
the near unanimous consensus of
scientists that human activities are
having a major impact on global warming
with possibly ominous implications and
there's nothing hidden about the
campaign
it's quite public it's been openly
announced that includes of course the
major lobbies of the fossil fuel
industry it includes the American
Chamber of Commerce which is the major
business lobby and others the the the
efforts of Alec and famous Koch brothers
you've probably read about however a
fraction of what's underway is a great
deal more which is concealed in complex
ways every once in a while something
leaks out there was a story in the
London Guardian recently buses and
Goldenberg she finds that conservative
billionaires used a secretive funding
route to channel nearly 120 million
dollars it's last year to more than a
hundred groups casting doubt about the
science behind climate change
helping de Ville build a vast network of
think tanks and activist groups working
to a single purpose to redefine climate
change from neutral scientific fact to a
highly polarizing wedge issue for
hardcore conservatives and the
propaganda campaign has apparently had
some effect on public opinion in the
United States which is a little more
skeptical than the global norm not much
but the effect is not significant enough
to satisfy the Masters and that's why
you have sectors of the corporate world
that are launching their attack on the
educational system - in an effort to
counter the dangerous tendency of the
public to pay attention to the
overwhelming conclusions of scientific
research a couple of months ago there
was a meeting of the Republican National
Committee if read about one governor
Governor Bobby Jindal of Louisiana
warned the Republican leadership his
words we must stop being the stupid part
we must stop insulting the intelligence
of voters but Alec and its corporate
sponsors disagree they want to go much
farther turning it into this stupid
nation and they're doing it for quite
principled reasons these are rooted in
these central institutions of recht one
of the dark money organizations that's
funding climate change denial is a group
called donors trust it's also a major
contributor to efforts to deny voting
rights to poor blacks in the United
States poor generally there's a good
reason for that it's perfectly sensible
now they tend to be Democrats if you
look at their attitudes they even tend
to be Social Democrats welfare state
measures and things like that they might
even go so far as to pay attention to
science unlike those who are trained
properly in critical thinking by
balanced teaching and these these
efforts direct attention to another
aspect of rrect which is quite important
that roughly half the population the
United States doesn't vote and if you
look at the non voters it's skewed
towards the lower end of the income
scale a heavily in fact and
overwhelmingly they identify themselves
as Democrats and their attitudes tend
towards a social democratic there has
been no serious inquiry into why they
don't vote that's probably one reason is
the main barriers that are placed in
their way these are modern versions of
the old poll tax and other devices that
were designed to keep the rabble in
their place but it's likely that one
reason is that without studying the
professional literature there's know
that their opinions don't matter even if
expressed in the ballot box so why take
the trouble
well turning to the most serious threat
to decent survival of the major science
journals regularly give a sense of how
surreal is this corporate campaign to
produce a stupid nation so take science
the major scientific weekly in the
United States a couple of months ago it
had three items side by side news items
one of them reported that 2012 was the
hottest year on record in the United
States that continues a long trend the
second reported a new study by the u.s.
global climate change research program
which provided additional evidence for
that rapid climate change is the result
of human activities they also discussed
likely more severe impacts and a third
news item reported the appointments to
chair the committee's on science policy
that were chosen by the US House of
Representatives the House of
Representatives is overwhelmingly
Republican the the votes for house are
overwhelmingly Democratic last election
was striking that's another consequence
of the shredding of the political system
well there are three chairs all three of
them deny that humans contribute to
climate change a to deny that it's even
taking place the same issue of the
journal has a technical article with new
evidence that the irreversible tipping
point may be much closer than
anticipated I was followed a couple of
weeks later by another report in science
that underscores the need to ensure that
Americans become the stupid nation this
report provides evidence that even
slightly warmer temperatures less than
anticipated could start melting
permafrost which in turn could
it's well known could release the
trigger the release of huge amounts of
very dangerous greenhouse gases worse
than carbon dioxide which are trapped in
ice so it's best to keep two balanced
education at least if you can face the
grandchildren whose lives are destroying
well within rekt it's extremely
important as an institutional necessity
that the u.s. become the stupid nation
not misled by science and rationality in
the interests of short-term gains of the
Masters of the economy and the political
system that's not easy to change because
it's built into the institutional
structures of the society actually these
same people who are making these
decisions in their individual lives may
be contributing to environmental groups
they can read the science journals as
well as anyone else but in their
institutional function they're bound by
the structure of those institutions
which again makes it very hard to change
and explains why policies like this are
necessary and the drive for stupidity
goes well beyond climate change so
federal funding for the fundamental R&D
research and development has been
dropping sharply as a share of GDP as
compared with other countries the editor
of science leading science journal in
the u.s. he describes the government is
deranged sacrificing tremendous future
benefits on the altar of short-term
profit and the delusions and they are
delusions about debt which are driven
mainly by the financial institutions as
much as in Europe where in fact is it
you more severe than in the United
States these commitments are deeply
rooted in the fundamentalist doctrines
that are preached within recked
although observed in a highly selective
manner
if you look closely we're given a couple
of examples because it's also necessary
to preserve a very powerful state to
serve the interests of wealth and power
that's what economist Dean Baker calls a
conservative nanny state well it goes
beyond this the market fundamentalism
has a number of built-in and in fact
quite well known the latias effects so
one which is not discussed enough is
that market fundamentalism while it
pretends to expand choices in fact
sharply restricts them so for example if
I have to get the home home from work I
can have a choice in the market as to
whether to buy a Toyota or Chevy let's
say but I can't choose between buying a
car and having a public transportation
system that's not a choice that's open
in principle in a market system its
requires collective decision-making and
that's not an option it's in effect is
it under wrecked with the tattering of
democracy its diminishing option you can
see the consequences so for example you
can take a high-speed train from Beijing
to Kazakhstan and it'll probably soon go
all the way to Turkey but you can't take
a high-speed train in the most heavily
traveled corridor in the world the
Northeast Corridor in the United States
from Boston to Washington fact that
trains there are barely faster than they
were 60 years ago when my wife and I
first took him and that's a natural
aspect of a wrecked really existing
capitalism with a tattered democratic
system there are also what are called
the market inefficiencies in the
professional literature one of them
series one is perfectly well known gets
a
very economics text is the failure to
take into account the effect on others
in a market transaction so-called
externalities these externalities can be
quite substantial that's even true
simple transactions among individuals
when you move on to major institutions
they become huge in fact the current
financial crisis is an illustration the
it's partially traceable substantially
traceable to the ignoring of what's
called systemic risk that is the risk
that if some and you know some risky
transaction has taken place
maybe the whole system will collapse the
that's not a new discovery incidentally
fifteen years ago the height of the
euphoria about efficient markets there
were two prominent economists one
English one American John Eatwell and
Lance Taylor they were an important book
global finance at risk in which they
spelled out the consequences of these
market inefficiencies and dire
consequences we're now living with
another one we worse to come
and they suggested means to deal with
them which of course were disregarded
there's a well another major
international economist David Felix has
been warning about this for many years
ever since the liberalization
liberalization of capital in the 70s
he's been warning that the increasing
frequency of financial crises during the
period of financial liberalisation could
terminate in an uncontrollable one I had
good arguments for it fact there was
plenty of evidence that was beginning to
happen but these voices were unheard
during the corporate-sponsored
deregulatory rage with incidentally the
intellectual backing
of theses about efficient markets and
rational behavior that had no empirical
basis but were proclaimed with great
confidence within the economics
profession between every two market
collapses the minutes of the Federal
Reserve the US central bank which are
released after five years it's quite an
open society the US you can learn a lot
about what's going on they've just
released the two 2007 transcripts and
they make interesting reading 2007 the
whole system was crashing but here's a
group of very distinguished economists
and major banking system professionals
they couldn't see that the huge housing
bubble which is based on no economic
fundamentals by then it reached eight
trillion dollars of meaningless paper
money that it was happening is nothing
in the transcripts to recognize what's
happening before their eyes and is a
good reason there's a religion the
religion is market fundamentalism it
preaches that the markets are efficient
and investors are rational so what's
happening can't be happening so
therefore we march ahead into the next
disaster well after the predicted
disaster occurred there were a few
people predicted it leading economists
again right in the mainstream reported
what they called an emerging consensus
on the need for macro prudential macro
Prudential supervision of financial
markets that is paying attention to the
general stability of the financial
system and not only its individual parts
the two prominent international
economists stated that there's a growing
recognition that our financial system is
running a doomsday cycle whenever it
fails we rely on lacks money and fiscal
policies to bail it out this response
teaches a lesson to the financial sector
take large Gamble's get paid handsomely
and don't worry about the costs because
they'll be paid by taxpayers and the
financial system is thus resurrected
they say to gamble again and to fail
again worse each time the official of
the Bank of England who's responsible
for financial stability after the later
crisis described it as a Doom loop well
there is legislation being considered in
the United States the so called the
dodd-frank bill
supposed to put band-aids on the sores
and go very deep but it's as always
being whittled down by armies of
corporate lobbyists who are not
countered there are no lobbyists for the
public interest under wrecked just for
the for the banks and it's very unlikely
that much will come of the legislation
after they're done with it
so we'll march on to the next and
probably in worst crisis it's been a
regular occurrence over the past 30
years ever since Reagan in the United
States and none before
no crises before the because the New
Deal regulations were in place and there
were capital controls on international
financial flows up until 1970
incidentally under IMF rules which still
exists it's now forgotten but they are
in fact being instituted again most
recently in Cyprus to try to overcome
the latest European catastrophe under
the suicidal policies of austerity
during stagnation which fail miserably
every time they're applied although
failure is a misleading word because
they work quite well for the designers
of the policy they just fail for people
general people and that's
Vivek infect not just an interesting
booklet that just came out in the United
States published by the economics Policy
Institute it's the major source of
regular economic data of the state of
economy and working people the poly half
was called failure by design they review
the policies of the past 30 odd years
the neoliberal period and they review
the I won't give the data they review
what's familiar from what's happened to
the public over this period the enormous
tremendous concentration of wealth way
at the top top tenth of one percent
stagnation or decline for large majority
a deterioration of relatively weak
benefit systems and so on and the
pamphlets called failure by design but
they point out the design because there
always were alternative policies they
well-known ones but they point out as a
class-based failure for the designers
it's in a fantastic success you know
they're richer than imaginable and doing
better all the time they've done this
disaster they come out better corporate
profits for example are at record highs
in the United States corporations have
so much money they don't want to do with
it they don't invest it because there's
no demand but it's they use it for
financial speculation which and the
banks are bigger and richer than before
the crisis that they caused so its
failure by design and class based
failure and pretty much the same is true
of Europe just being careful when people
talk about these is failed or as I just
did suicidal policies well there's a far
more serious example of the danger of
ignoring externalities the ones that are
dismissed to a footnote under
fundamentalist market fundamentalist
doctrine and that's the environmental
catastrophe here the externality that's
ignored it
the fate of the species and in this case
there is no one to run to cap in hand to
be asked to be bailed out tax payer
can't help on this one
well these consequences have very deep
roots in wreck than its guiding
doctrines which also dictate that the
Masters will make major efforts to
escalate the threats even though they're
quite aware of them again institutional
fact that's one reason and not the only
one why it seems quite unlikely that
civilization will survive rekt without
serious blows well there's if there are
historians in the future there may not
be but if there are they're going to see
they look back on this period they're
going to see a very strange phenomenon
developing under our eyes with eyes open
the world is marching towards serious
disaster no secret eyes --as facts are
there read it right in front of you
under of course efforts to counter it
they vary and they vary in an
interesting way the most far-reaching
efforts to counter the crisis are found
in pre-industrial societies what are
called primitive societies anyway they
don't have the benefit of education
indigenous societies tribal societies
First Nations and so on and the most
strenuous efforts to escalate the
threats are in the most advanced most
educated richest and most powerful
societies
so take the Western Hemisphere Ecuador
which has a large indigenous population
and is an oil producer is undertaking
efforts under the pressure of the
indigenous population to get support
from Europe
which they surely won't get to leave the
oil in the ground where it ought to be
and turn to other forms of growth and
development
that's the poor uneducated indigenous
societies Bolivia which has an even
bigger indigenous populations way in the
lead internationally and doing something
about this then you go to the other
extreme
up north United States and Canada
they're racing madly to try to get the
crisis to be as rapid and as Extreme as
possible that's what's called the you
read the enthusiastic you know euphoric
reports about a century of energy
independence they which are all over the
newspapers including the financial
newspapers and both political parties
agree it's really a great thing we're
going to have a hundred years of energy
independence by trying to get every drop
of fossil fuels out of the ground
including things like Canadian tar sands
which are extremely damaging to the
environment that the local and in fact
global environment but we got to do that
and the energy independence is almost
totally meaningless so we have to make
sure that crisis is as quick and bad as
possible
all of these euphoric discussions don't
don't mention the raise the question
what's the word we're going to look like
in a hundred years not somebody else's
business within wrecked you don't ask
that question well that's the scene that
a future historian will see if there is
one to look back and it'll be a very
striking one and it's up to us actually
to decide if that scenario is going to
happen it's very imminent Thanks
you
