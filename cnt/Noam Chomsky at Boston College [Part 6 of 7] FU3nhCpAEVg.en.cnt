and doubt it very much I mean there has
to be something because the private
sector had created such a catastrophe
that as usual they're going to have to
call in the public to bail them out I
mean that happens over and over I mean
it happens to be kind of striking now
for one reason for such deep crisis and
because it happens to be the financial
industries usually its manufacturing
industry that's bailed out by the public
in fact that's the norm in history if
you look at economic history there are
studies of this now you take a look at
the full fortune 500 I mean the norm
among them is regular bailouts by by the
government because you know they get
into trouble and taxpayer bails amount
and that's only the beginning of what
the state does for them it also is
pretty much in charge of research and
development procurement all sorts of
other devices to keep the private
economy going so now they're in trouble
so there's going to have to be more
public intervention but there's no
indication that it's moving towards
popular control of these institutions
even shares in the bed voting shares
like in Europe they've been voting
shares do you see it as moving towards
greater control or what's happening i
mean it's mostly under wraps so you'd
really know the details but what's
coming out looks like patchwork to get
them back to the point where they can
wear the private attorneys can run the
economy again without interference just
with the public subsidizing them I mean
the basic principle of our economy is
that the public pays the costs and takes
the risks and profits privatized and now
it's kind of extreme because you see it
right in your face every day but it's
the way it goes on all the time if you
use a computer for instance when they
were developed in the public sector for
again about 30 years before they were
profitable you take an airplane it's a
modified bomber you know in fact the
things that go on in the international
economy are just comical I don't know
how
I'm just going to look and not crack up
and laugh I mean the biggest I suppose
the biggest civilian export are closely
with a civilian aircraft and there's
constant battles going on in the world
trade organization between Europe and
the United States about there's two
companies now in this competitive
economy Boeing and Airbus so Airbus is
subsidized by Europe and Boeing is
subsidized by us and there's constant
battles about who's violating the World
Trade Organization rules worse by the
kinds of subsidies they're given and all
kind of lawyers and economists or
writing position papers on whether this
subsidy outweighs that subsidy but it is
in close to a market economy I mean and
that's typical I mean the high-tech
industry is mostly oligopoly and it's
mostly state-subsidized in one fashion
or another is that going to change
probably not it's too valuable for the
private sector will there be any degree
of public control well probably not
because the interferes with private
Erinyes and that's the way the systems
built no indication in the Obama
campaign of any interest in changing
this it just take a look as advisors I'm
himself the settings mething so you
really don't know but if you look at the
advisors we know what they've done what
they believed there was another part
dear the second part of that was was the
use of media oh these are me well as I
said Obama did win the Advertising Age
award for the best marketing campaign of
the year that's use of media its use of
media to delude people to control
to make them feel good to make them feel
you love them and so on and we see it
every day it's on front pages every day
if you look so like yesterday i guess it
was biden gave a foreign policy address
it was all over the front pages it's
much more concerned how it's changed
since the bush years he was very
conciliatory he reached out his hand to
Iran and Russia you know it's going to
be peace and love from now on then you
look at what he said okay what did he
say well with regard to Russia he
reached out his hand and then said
you're going to go on building the
so-called missile defense system on your
borders there's a terrible provocation
to Russia I mean they're not stupid
enough to think that those systems are
built to stop a non-existent missile
from Iran you know in furthermore even
if Iran had missiles and nuclear weapons
the chances that they'd attack Europe
are kind of invisible you know unless
they had a death wish the minute they
armed the missile they'd be wiped out no
so there's no threat of an Iranian
missile to Europe or the United States
even though they did exist the missile
systems there are just a potential
threat to the Russian deterrent missile
that that's what missile defense is the
first strike weapon missile defense is
not nobody ever thinks it even if it
ever works it's not going to stop a
first strike conceivably it could saw a
retaliatory strike imagined future so
it's a first strike weapon and
strategists on both sides understand it
okay you're building them right on
Russia's borders what are they supposed
to think you know they can read American
the strategic hannelore the arms control
journals and that will tell them what to
think they'll tell them it's a threat to
your to turn no but so this is just a
provocation it's going to increase
tensions mean they're going to respond
with more weapons and your we march on
dorm again so that's what Biden's
conciliatory steps worth to Russia what
about Iran again you know will be
willing to talk to you you just have to
meet one
dition namely you have to agree in
advance to everything that the
negotiations are about that that's
exactly what he said he said you have to
stop your as soon as you stop your
illicit nuclear programs will be willing
to talk to you well that's what the
negotiations are about and what are
their illicit nuclear programs well as
far as we know they don't have any
weapons programs at least if you believe
US intelligence there was a national
intelligence estimate about a year ago
which stated with what they called high
confidence that Iran has not pursued
nuclear weapons since for about five or
six years okay maybe there that's nobody
like that the government here didn't
like that so it therefore disappeared
and the media it disappeared to so now
they're pursuing weapons programs
whatever the facts are as far as we know
they're produced there are producing
nuclear energy why is that illicit you
know I mean there's they're signers of
the non-proliferation treaty the
non-proliferation treaty grants signers
the right to produce nuclear energy when
you read about it here you read that
they're violating the will of the
international community who's the
international community I mean it's the
United States and anyone who agrees with
most of the world thinks they have that
right so then a lot non-aligned
countries which is yeah most of the
world they think Iran they were
forcefully repeat over and over that
Iran has the right to develop nuclear
energy but they're not part of the
international community because they
don't agree with Washington or the New
York Times editorial board what about
the American population will ask poll so
we're takin about Mynock maybe three
quarters of the population agrees with
an online movement that they have a
right to produce a nuclear energy okay
they're not part of the international
community the international community is
Washington and
editorial board you know okay and they
say its illicit so therefore abidance as
its illicit and he won't we won't have
any discussions with them until they
abandon it and of course that's the
thing that the discussions are about so
that's the olive branch to Iran but the
wording is nice you right about that the
rhetoric is different it's not like John
Bolton you know kick people to face and
so on be pleasant and the Europeans kind
of like that because they would love to
support the United States it's their
highest goal was to be able to shine
Washington's shoes but they couldn't do
it with the Bush administration around
because they're too brazen and arrogant
and unpleasant and so on and now they've
got this nice Harvard graduate speaks in
sentences now they can do it for very
they're very happy so they can go along
with the United States just like they
didn't get it but you're right about the
rhetoric the rhetoric is quite different
that's the effect of a good PR agent
professor I'm interested what what
changes if any do you envision occurring
in the United States with concern to
race and racism now that we've elected
an african-american to our presidential
seat it should have an effect I'm and I
should should assume that it would
change the aspiration level and
self-image of large parts of the
african-american community but it don't
exaggerate it I'm taking a look at South
Africa okay which is quite an
interesting case I mean the overcoming
apartheid was a tremendous achievement
and they really hit the fight
