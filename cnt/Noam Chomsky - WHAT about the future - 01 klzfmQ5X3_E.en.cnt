to ask what the future is
later bring it it's a reasonable
is to try to look at the human species
from the outside so imagine you're an
extraterrestrial observers trying to
take a neutral stance and figure out
what's happening here or for that matter
imagine that your historian 100 years
from now assuming that there will be any
historians 100 years from now is not
obvious and you're looking at what's
happening now looking back at what's
happening now so either those two
stances you'd see something quite
remarkable the for the first time in the
history of the human species we have
clearly developed the capacity to
destroy ourselves that's in true since
1945 it's now being finally recognized
that there are more learn term processes
like environmental destruction which are
leading in the same direction maybe not
total destruction but destruction of the
capacity for organized for decent
existence so there's at least and there
are others like the danger of pandemics
and so on but there which have to do
with a globalization interaction and so
on so there are processes underway and
institutions right in place like nuclear
weapon systems which could lead to
serious blow maybe termination of
organised existence and then the
question is what are people doing about
it it's it's not a secret I'm so
perfectly open so you have to undertake
an effort not to see it and there are
reactions is a range of reactions there
are those who are throwing hard to do
something about these threats now there
are others who are acting to s
laid the threats and if you look at who
they are his future historian our
extraterrestrial observer would see a
strange situation those who are trying
to mitigate or overcome the threats are
the least developed societies the
indigenous populations the remnants of
them tribal societies First Nations in
Canada and so on they're not talking
about nuclear war but they're concerned
with environmental disaster and they're
really trying to do something about it
in societies that have affect all over
the world Australia India South America
almost everywhere you look their battles
going on sometimes as wars in India it's
a major war over destruction of other
direct environmental destruction with
the tribal societies trying to resist a
very harmful the resources Strachan
extraction operations harmful locally
but also in their general consequences
so there's all over the world and in the
societies where indigenous populations
have an influence look they're large and
influential there were they taking
pretty strong stance so the strongest
stand of any country with regard to
global warming is in Bolivia which has
an indigenous majority constitutional
requirements for rights of nature and
things like that in Ecuador which also
has very large indigenous population and
happens to be an oil exporter that's the
only one I know where the oil where the
government is seeking aid to help keep
the oil in the ground instead of
producing and exporting it the ground as
it ought to be
hugo chavez who just died recently that
is a object of mockery and insult and
hatred throughout the Western world he
was at a he attended a session of the UN
General Assembly a couple of years ago
which elicited all sorts of ridicule
because he called the bush a devil and
so on but he also gave a speech at the
General Assembly which was quite
interesting of course as well as a major
oil from do certainly well it's the
probably the whole GDP but he gave a
speech in which he said that the he
warned of the dangers of over use of
fossil fuels and urged that the producer
and consumer countries get together and
try to work out ways to reduce fossil
fuel use that's pretty amazing on the
part of an oil producer I've kind of
kind of you know he's half Indian that's
about indigenous background so so that
was never even reported what was
reported was funny things he didn't zone
I could go into some women which are
pretty funny so for just to give you one
I got my one and only phone call and
life from the New York Times asking for
a comment that what had happened was
Chavez gave a talk there in which he
said they quoted him as saying that he's
sorry that he came here after I died he
wanted me to meet me everyone thought
that was very funny so no articles all
over the world and they called me up as
one slight problem with it if you look
at the transcript of what he said
perfectly straight forwards in Spanish
it was he said he was sorry that he
hadn't been able to meet John Kenneth
Galbraith before he died Galbraith had
died well apparently they felt it wasn't
it didn't fit the image to have him
wanting to see a
icon so he could want to see somebody
who's often a forensics it's conceivable
that the American reporters didn't
understand but it's hard to imagine that
the reporter for Salem own and
understand anyway but the speech he gave
was pretty interesting and in general
this Court is pretty much across the
world that's true so at one extreme you
have indigenous tribal Aboriginal
societies trying to stem the race to
disaster and go to the other extreme the
richest most powerful societies in world
history like say the United States and
Canada they are racing full speed ahead
to try to destroy the environment as
quickly as we can now they want to
extract every drop of hydrocarbons from
the ground as quickly as possible both
political parties of the media President
Obama the international press looking
forward with great enthusiasm to what
they call a a century of energy
independence for the United States
energy independent was totally
meaningless but put that aside what they
mean is will have a century in which
will be able to maximize the use of
fossil fuels and destroy the world as
fast as possible that's the other
extreme and that's pretty much the case
all around I'm in Europe's doing
something you know in fact the United
States richest country in the world is
the only country of maybe a hundred
relevant ones that doesn't even have a
national policy for restricting use of
fossil fuels doesn't have renewable
energy targets and so on it's not
because the population doesn't want it
the population is pretty close to the
international norm and concern about
global warming it's institutional
structures of blocking business
interests don't want it they're
overwhelmingly powerful determining
policy so you get a big gap between
opinion and policy on lots of issues so
that's what the future is Dorian is
there
one would see he might also read
scientific journals you can find right
now and I won't run through the details
but everyone to open has a more dire
prediction than the last the other is
his nuclear war that's a very serious
one I'm it's been a it's been known for
a long time that if there was a first
strike by a major power even with no
retaliation it would probably destroy
civilization just because of the nuclear
winter that consequences that would
follow you can read about it bulletin of
the atomic scientists well understood so
the danger has always been a lot worse
than we thought it was and it's been
pretty serious and we've just passed the
50th anniversary the Cuban Missile
Crisis where been called the most
dangerous moment in history by Arthur
Schlesinger tunities advisor which it
was what's but the worst and came very
close very close not the only time but
some almost the worst of the worst
aspect in some way is that the lessons
have you learned in fact what happened
has been pretty fight that to make it
looks
