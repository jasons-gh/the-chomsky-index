I know that you said that right-wing
libertarianism is essentially barbaric
and relieves the private concentrations
of power but what I wonder often is in a
truly free society wouldn't there be
different economic systems in different
places and when some people be allowed
voluntarily to have with some weight
called interval capitalism sure if
certain people for example decide we
want to be slaves I don't think they
should be stopped I don't I don't expect
it to happen if the options are
available but I don't I wouldn't like to
see a society in which the force
concentrated force including military
force blocks a group of people who say
we want to be slaves of some master and
if people say we want to rent ourselves
to to somebody which is temporary
slavery is classical liberals described
it I don't think that should be barred
but I think that better options can be
provided which people will accept
