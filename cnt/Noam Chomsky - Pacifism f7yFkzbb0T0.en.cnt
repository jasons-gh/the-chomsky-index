are you a pacifist no not a pacifist are
there justifications for a war under
certain circumstances I can see
justifications for a defensive war I
could in retinol together I think their
justifications for a war against Nazi
Germany in the 40s but I felt I was a
high school student at the time but felt
then and have continued to feel it in
fact wrote about it in this book that a
good deal of the alleged justification
for the war was totally beside the point
and that we were engaged in the war for
reasons other than opposition to fascism
were concerned for you know people being
sent to gas chambers and things of that
kind in fact those motivations I think
we're virtually non-existent
nevertheless despite the hypocrisy and
there was plenty I think that that war
could have could be justified and I'm
not a pacifist in the sense of someone
who believes that it is in principle
wrong ever and always to undertake
violent acts I think you have strong
reason for it very strong the burden of
proof is certainly on a person who wants
to undertake the use of means of
violence but I believe occasionally that
burdens in demand
