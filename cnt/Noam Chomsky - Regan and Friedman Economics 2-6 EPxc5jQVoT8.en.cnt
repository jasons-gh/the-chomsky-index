industry was falling falling apart and
there were calls in the business press
to reindustrialize America well how do
you do that you do it by keeping out
superior Japanese products and
increasingly South Korean products and
by calling on the usual Saviour namely
the Pentagon that's happened before like
a century earlier the big business the
biggest operation and business operation
in the United States was railroads was
beyond the competence of private
industry so Pentagon took it over it
wasn't called the Pentagon name the US
Army took it over and had the organizing
capacity and funds and so on and that's
often happened happened again with
Reagan called on the Pentagon who
designed what they call the factory of
the future a modern factory this would
teach backward American corporate
managers how to use computers to use on
time production and all the fancy
techniques that the Japanese had
invented the this this has many
advantages going on the Pentagon for one
thing they can design the factory of the
future so that it empowers managers and
be skills workers that's been pretty
well studied
David Noble who was on the faculty of
MIT now Canada did major work on this
particularly with regard to automation
and showed that the under military
auspices Automation was designed so as
to ensure that decisions were taken away
from the skilled mechanics and put in
the hands of supervisors and managers
the D skill the work force and empower
management there was no reason of
efficiency or even profit in fact the
study showed that it often harmed profit
but didn't matter it's very important
for a class war to ensure that the
working class is be skilled and passive
and that power lies in the hands of
managers and supervisors that there's
nothing new about that either sure
you've all heard of terrorism the system
that was introduced about a century of
essentially to turn working people into
robots in effect control every motion
you know make sure that everything was
maximally efficient and so on that was
designed in US military production
armories and so on that gives you plenty
of funding to do whatever you like no
controls or constraints you can
implement class war very efficiently and
it goes right through history but raiga
the Reaganites reagan probably you know
was going on but his administration were
broke new records in this
welltake democracy and development the
two concepts are closely related in many
respects one respect is that they have a
common enemy
the common enemy is loss of sovereignty
in a world of nation-states
it's true by definition that decline of
sovereignty leads to decline of
democracy the debate and decline in the
ability to conduct economic and social
policy and that in turn harms
development that's a conclusion that's
very well confirmed by several centuries
of economic history and at same economic
history shows quite consistently that
loss of sovereignty leads to imposed
liberalisation imposed of course in the
interest of the designers not the
subject in recent years the imposed
regime is commonly called neoliberalism
the that's the reigning economic
orthodoxy of the past several decades
it's not a very good term incidentally
the socio-economic regime is by no means
new and it's not liberal at least in the
sense of liberal understood by classical
liberals Adam Smith and others well with
those providers it's fair to say that a
common enemy of democracy and
development in the modern period is
liberalism although it has earlier
guises as I mentioned it's obvious in
the case of democracy in fact the very
design of neoliberal principles is a
direct attack on democracy so it takes a
privatization well true by definition
that that's an attack on democracy you
take something out of the public domain
put it into the hands of totalitarian
systems which is what corporations are
unaccountable totalitarian systems
obviously that reduces democracy when
you move on to the current primary theme
what's called trade in services trade
and services means privatization of
services as I do with trade
privatization of services
it's called trade so they can fit it
into the trade agreement general
agreement on trade and services it just
means selling off services what are
services well in brief services or
anything that human being could be
interested in education health water
pretty soon it will be air whatever it
may be
energy anything that a person could be
interested in is what's called services
trade and service trade and services
means putting all these into the hands
of unaccountable totalitarian
institutions if that is achieved to the
extent that that's achieved and you can
have formal democracy quite openly you
know clean elections count the ballots
properly etc but it doesn't matter
because there's nothing for people to
have
decisions about nothing that matters at
least so somewhere else in the hands of
unaccountable tyrannies
so that's goes under the name the
general agreement on trade and services
that's the leading theme of the current
trade negotiations
well another component of the neoliberal
package is financial liberalisation
means governments for example can't
control capital flight currencies aren't
regulated and so on it's very well
understood by economists what that leads
to financial liberalisation creates what
some international economists have
called a virtual Senate of investors and
lenders who carry out a moment-by-moment
referendum on economic policies and if
they don't like those policies they
destroy the economy by capital flight by
attacks on currencies by selling bonds
and so on and there are policies that
the virtual Senate doesn't like anything
that is irrational irrational means it's
helpful to people not the profit and the
virtual Senate keeps an eye on this
second-by-second and if a government
makes the mistake that being irrational
feels it very quickly huge capital
flight tax on bonds happens all the time
and it keeps the countries in line it
means that governments have what's
sometimes called a dual constituency two
constituencies one of them is the voters
the other is the virtual Senate and you
can guess who wins all this is coming to
a head right now in the what are called
the free trade negotiations which have
practically nothing to do with free
trade there was the what was called the
Doha round in work for countries the
so-called developing countries that's a
euphemism for
the former colonial countries that are
trying to escape from the grip of
Imperial violence and destruction
they're called developing countries
whether they're developing or not they
blocked the Doha round and it's not
coming up again the in the West among
the rich it's considered a kind of
no-brainer of course we have to
implement the Doha round we have to
bring it to a successful conclusion
popular opinion is generally opposed
usually strongly opposed in the rich
countries too and that's no surprise if
you look at the proposals which are
usually kind of in secret they're not
supposed to look at them but if you look
at them they provide great benefits for
investors for lenders for management who
are free to freed up to set working
people against one another all over the
world that's called globalization main
theme is set working people against one
another so that it will naturally follow
that wages are lowered benefits because
