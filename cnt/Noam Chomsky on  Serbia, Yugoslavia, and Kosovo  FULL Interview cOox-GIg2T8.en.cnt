hi good for you let's go see ya
professor Noam Chomsky in Europe if I'm
not mistaken first TV media appearance
for Serbian media thank you very much
for being with us last month marked the
seventh anniversary of the beginning of
the bombing of Yugoslavia
why did NATO wage that war or I should
say why did the United States which
Network actually we have for the first
time a very authoritative time on that
from the highest level of the Clinton
administration which is something that
one could have surmised before but now
has asserted this is from struck Talbot
who was in charge of the he ran the
Pentagon's Department to intelligence
Joint Committee on the diplomacy during
the whole affair including the bombing
so that's very top of the Clinton
administration he just wrote the
foreword to a book by his director of
communications John Narns and in the
foreword he says if you really want to
understand what the thinking was in the
top of the Clinton administration this
is the book you should read and take a
look at John Norris is booked and what
he says is it has the real crooks of the
war had nothing to do with concern for
kosovo albanians
it was because Serbia was not carrying
out the required social and economic
reforms meaning it was the last corner
of Europe which had not subordinated
itself to the us-run neoliberal programs
so therefore had to be eliminated that's
from the highest level again and you
could have guessed it but I've never
seen it said before and that it wasn't
because of the Cussler
manias that we know there is just under
this this is a point of religious
fanaticism in the West can't talk about
it for interesting reasons having to do
with Western culture but there is just
overwhelming documentation of impeccable
documentation to being compilations of
the State Department trying to justify
the war or the OSCE records NATO records
of the kayvyun monitor records of long
British parliamentary inquiry which went
into it they all show the same thing so
what we know I mean it was an ugly place
there were there were atrocities but
giving this given this clear documentary
record I want to ask about the elite
intellectual opinion what you call in
the United States the way because it was
run in the West in general because
that's for the reviewing it but
reviewing it you would get the
impression you would be forgiven for
imagining that every critic of the NATO
intervention was one of two things
either a military sympathizer or someone
who doesn't care about genocide what is
this well first of all that's a common
feature of intellectual culture one good
US critic Harold Rosenberg once
described intellectuals as the heard of
independent minds they think they're
very independent but their stampede in a
herd which is true when there is a party
line you have to adhere to it and the
party line is systematic the party line
is split nation state power and to state
violence now you're allowed to criticize
it but on very narrow grounds you can
criticize it because it's not working
there's a mistake or benign intentions
that went astray or something now you
see right now in the Iraq war is a ton
of debate about the Iraq war but take a
look at it it's very similar to the
debate in Pravda
during the invasion of
understand actually wrap it up to a
polish reporter recently and asked him
he'd been reading proud that they just
laughed so yeah this name when you read
Pravda in the 1980s it's a big travail
of the Russian soldiers to negative
killed that is terrorists who prevent us
from bringing justice and peace to the
Afghans it of course did invade
intervened and where I try to help them
at the request of the legitimate
government that the terrorists are
preventing us from doing all the things
we want to do yeah I've read Japanese
Karin surgeon see documents from the
Second World War from the 1930s and
check same no we're trying to bring them
an earthly paradise but the Chinese
bandits are preventing it I don't know
an exception in history may be like a
bridge Imperial limits the same and even
people of the highest moral integrity
will John Stuart Mill we're talking
about what we have to intervene in India
and conquer India because the barbarians
can't control themselves their credit
rasa teas with the bringing of the
benefits of Jewish rule civilization and
so on now in the United States the same
I take us at the moment because of that
was a critically important event for the
American intellectuals and the reason
had to do with what was going on during
the 90s the 90s are for the rest not
just the u.s. i'm fran sitting there
were spray the low point in intellectual
history for for the West I think it was
it was like a comic strip mimicking a
satire of Stalinism really you take a
look at the New York Times and the grid
opinion of French press the British
press it was all full of talk about how
there's a normative revolution that has
swept to the West for the first time in
history a state namely the United States
the leader of the free world is acting
from pure
altruism curtains policy has entered
into a noble phase with a saintly glow
on a nun quoting from the Liberals not
this particular this particular
documentary and charade that's what
Rico's of right and it was it was
specific in a sense because it was based
on the claim that it was preventing
genocide
let me just read something that you said
in an interview around the time of the
bombing you said the term genocide as
applied to Kosovo is an insult to the
victims of Hitler in fact it's
revisionist to an extreme what is really
neither the first let me just fix the
timing the things I've been quoting are
from the late 90s before Carson if now
they needed some event to justify this
massive self adulation okay long came
across a road fortunately all right so
now we have to stop genocide
what was the genocided Kosovo I know
from the Western documentation what it
was
in the year prior to the bombing
according to just the Western sources
about 2,000 people were killed killings
were distributed a lot of them were
coming in fact coded wittich government
which was the most hawkish element of
the alliance up until January 1999
majority the killing through like ala
guerrillas who were coming in as they
said you know to try to incite a rush
serbian response which they got in order
to appeal to Western humanitarians to
bomb I will we know from the Western
records and nothing changed between
January and March effect up until March
20th indicate nothing March 20th they
indicate a increase in KLA attacks but
it was ugly but by international
standards I mean almost invisible
unfortunately and it was very
distributed if the British are correct
the majare
he was coming from Delhi gorillas and as
it later turned out the camel was also
receiving financial support they were
purposely a nearly at the end of months
okay so that's not to call that genocide
is really to insult the victims of the
Holocaust time what Western
intellectuals were praising themselves
for their magnificent humanitarianism
and much worse atrocities were going on
right across the border in Turkey now
that's one side native none of the
borders of native they were saying how
can we allow this at the borders of NATO
yeah how about inside NATO where Turkey
was carrying it had driven several
probably several million Kurds out of
their homes destroyed about 3,500
villages laid waste to the whole place
every conceivable form of torture and
massacre you can imagine killed nobody
knows how many people we don't count our
victims tens of thousands of people how
were they able to do it the reason is
because they were getting eighty percent
of their arms from Clinton and as the
atrocities increased increased the arms
will increased affecting one single year
1997 Clinton sent more arms to Turkey
than the entire cold people were period
combined up until the current surgeon
see that was not reported in West do not
report your own crimes that's critical
and that's of all of this how can we
tolerate a couple thousand people being
killed in Kosovo mix2 ilysm yeah in fact
the 50th anniversary of NATO to push
right in the middle of the middle and we
were lamentations about what's going on
right across NATO's border not a word
about the much worse things going on
with inside NATO's border thanks to the
massive flow of arms from the United
States and that's only one case however
things were going on all over the US and
Britain supporting much worse but this
to focus on this that was the topic for
the heard of independent minds for the
crucial role in their self-image because
they had been going through a period of
praising themselves for a magnificence
in their normative revolution and the
noble phase and so on and so forth so
the bad thing
and therefore you couldn't ask any
questions about it it's not only the
same happened in the earlier phase of
the balkan wars so if it the other awful
and so on and so forth however but if
you look at the coverage uncertainties
one famous incident which just
completely reshaped Western opinion now
that was the photograph of the thin man
and the concept behind the barbed wire
right well you remember the thin man he
on the barbed wire so that was outfits
and we can't assure it's again so you
know everyone with the intellectuals
went crazy French were posturing on
television and the usual antics well you
know it was investigated and carefully
investigate fact was investigated by the
leading Western specialists on the topic
Philip Knightley is a highly respected
media analyst and his specialty is
photojournalism is the most probably the
most famous Western and most respected
Western annals do this he did a detailed
analysis of it and he determined that
was probably the reporters who were
behind the barbed wire and the place was
ugly there was a refugee camp it would
leave if they wanted right near the thin
man it was a
Magnezone well you know there was one
tiny newspaper in England and 33 key
called LM which ran a critique of this
the British who haven't the slightest
concept of freedom of speech that is
total fraud
a major corporation IP n big media
corporation had publicized thee so the
corporation seed the tiny newspaper for
libel or British libel laws are
absolutely atrocious a person who's
accused has to prove though what he's
reporting was done with malice it can't
prove that so and in fact when you have
a huge corporation with batteries of
lawyers and so on tearing out of suit
against the truth people in offices
close enough pocket money
Savi's what's going to happen especially
under these grotesque libel laws so yes
they were able to prove the littleness
or couldn't prove it on the house put
out of business there is just a euphoria
in the lip left logo British press after
they put the newspaper out of business
under this utterly grotesque legal case
and British laws the left liberal
newspapers like the body and were just
in a state of euphoria about this
wonderful achievement they had managed
to destroy a tiny newspaper because it
questioned some image that they had
presented and they were very proud of
themselves for which was probably
misunderstood or misinterpreted
well fortnightly wrote a very hush
critique of the British media for
behaving in this way and tried to teach
him an elementary lesson about freedom
of speech also added it probably the
photograph was misinterpreted couldn't
get published well you know that's when
Kosovo came along the same thing today
and why not tell the truth about it took
going through a ton of reporting on this
almost invariably they invert the
chronology the rare atrocities packages
they were after the bottom the way it's
presented is the atrocities took place
and then we had the bomb to prevent
genocide just convert it is let me ask
you about the conduct of the actual war
and you mentioned the Guardian it's
interesting because you yourself
recently had an unpleasant experience
where the Guardian is awarded you cover
the two over-serving it'sa to misquoted
you to make it appear as if you were
questioning the surveillance Alaska but
let me bring you back to the conduct of
the actual war because that was another
denied on the night of the bombing which
was also overlooked or selectively
covered by Western media in general now
Amnesty International among others
reported the NATO committed serious
violations of the rules of war during
its campaign numerous human rights
groups concur and document various war
crimes one of them had its anniversary
two days ago when the radio television
of Serbia was bombed the national
television its headquarters killing 16
people on first of all why would these
crimes completely unreported and
secondly you already touched on that and
secondly is there any prospect for there
being any responsibilities taken for
these crimes actually the crimes were
reported but they were cheered it's not
that or unknown what a bombing of the
radio station yeah I was recruited no TV
station but that's fine because the TV
station was described as a propaganda
outlet
so therefore the right to bomb that
happens all the time it just happened
last year in the November 2004 one of
the worst war crimes in Iraq was the
invasion of Fallujah that's one thing
about an example design worse but the
invasion of Fallujah and it was kind of
similar to shriven hu if you look but we
invaded Fallujah the first thing that
the invading troops
u.s. troops was to take over the General
Hospital and throw the patients on the
floor they've taken other bids put in
their floor mat hands tied behind their
backs and doctor is thrown floor hands
behind their backs it was a picture of
in front page in the New York Times if I
was wonderful and the Geneva Convention
for those hospitals three breach of the
Geneva Convention
now George Bush should be facing this
the death penalty for that even under US
law but it was presented no no mention
of the Geneva Conventions and was
presented as a wonderful thing because
the Fallujah General Hospital was a
propaganda Center well it was releasing
casualty figures okay so if it was
correct to carry out a massive work run
well the bombing of the TV station was
presented same way in fact a century
recall there was an offer from NATO that
the wind Amin if they agreed that prong
I think six years six hours of NATO
propaganda well this is considered quite
right
how can be dealt with a group of
international lawyers did appeal to the
international tribunal
on the news love iane to representative
brief saying they should look into the
native war crimes what they cited was
reports from Human Rights Watch and as
internet Human Rights Watch and the
International Admissions by the NATO
command that was what they presented and
yeah I think this was della Ponte at the
time so that she would not look at it in
violation of the laws of the tribunal
because she had faith in NATO and that
was the answer well something else
interesting happened after that
Yugoslavia did bring a case to the World
Court which also rejected the court
accepted it in fact that I delivered it
for a couple of years may still be but
what what is interesting is that the
u.s. excused itself from the case and
the court accepted
excuse why because Yugoslavia had
mentioned the Genocide Convention and
the US did sign the Genocide Convention
after 40 years ratified it but it
ratified it with a reservation saying
inapplicable to the United States so in
other words the United States is
entitled to commit genocide therefore
and that was the case that the US
Justice Department which clintons
brought to the world court and the court
had to agree if a country does not
accept world for jurisdiction after be
excluded so the US was excluded from the
trial on the grounds that it grants
itself the right to commit genocide do
you think this was reported here the the
World Court though excused itself from
hearing the case trying the illegality
of the war on the grounds that
Yugoslavia was not a full member of the
United Nations at the time when you know
the case when maybe they finally reach
their Jed for several years they were
deliberating but and that's the sequence
does any of this get reported you can
ask your friends at Princeton asked the
pack of faculty I don't know and these
two any more than they will know that I
mean they sort of probably remember the
bombing they capture the General
Hospital at Fallujah but did anything
there was the one comment anywhere
saying as a war crime can I what struck
law was that you compared the shrubbery
to Massacre with the Fallujah invasion
why is that for certain molarity in case
of sureba nature the women and children
were trucked out and then came you know
the massacre in the case of Fallujah the
men the women and children were murdered
out they were trucked out were ordered
out but the men were allowed to leave
then came the attack
in fact it turned out that the roads out
were blocked well I mean the whole thing
isn't them just not same story but that
part is similar I actually mentioned
that a couple of times
storm of protest hysteria incidentally
this Guardian affair part of it which
was total fraud on the part of the
editors not the reporter that he blamed
it on the reporter for the editors one
of the things that they were infuriated
about was that she asked me what about
the thin men and the behind the barbed
wire isn't that horrible atrocity I said
well you know it's not certain that it
was correct okay that led to a history
that's when Philip Knightley tried to
intervene to present once again his
analysis and once again his critique of
the media but couldn't and he's a very
prominent prestigious person and I just
cannot break ranks that's not tolerated
I mean we're lucky we don't have
censorship free society but the
self-censorship is a little whelming
actually for real once wrote about this
and something that nobody's read
everyone has read animal form well
nobody's read the introduction to animal
form a publication on public came came
out as an unpublished paper thirty years
later in it what he said is animal forms
of satire this totalitarian state is a
free England is not very different in
free England unpopular ideas can be
suppressed
without the use of force and give them
example it's very similar here and it
doesn't matter how extreme they are I
mean the Iraq invasion is a perfect
example there is not you cannot find
anywhere in the mainstream a suggestion
but it's wrong to invade another country
though if you invade another country
acted pay reparations after the throw up
and the leadership has to be punished
and I don't know if you ever read the
Nuremberg judgments but after the
Nuremberg judgments justice Jackson the
chief of Council for us
US Justice made a very very eloquent
statement about how we must were
sentencing these people to death are the
crimes for which they committed our
crime when anybody commits them
including when we commit them we have to
live up to that is that you're handing
the defendants a poisoned chalice and if
we sip from this poison chalice we must
be treated the same way can't be more
explicit
they also defined aggression aggression
was defined in terms which just apply
absolutely and without exception not
into the invasion of Iraq but to all
sorts of other invasions of Vietnam many
others actually even the terrorists were
against the garage WA technically fork
falls under the crime of aggression is
defined in the record does the does the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia and that's
not even questioned in fact there is a
resident circle Independent Commission
of Inquiry on the cusp of bombing led by
a very respected South African jurist
justice Goldstone and they concluded
that the bombing was in their words
illegal legitimate ok illegal makes it a
workaround but they said it was
legitimate because it was necessary to
stop genocide and then comes the usual
inversion of the history I feel justice
Goldstone who is a respectable person
later recognized that the atrocities
came after the bombing and that they
were furthermore the anticipated
consequence of the bombing he did
recognize that in a lecture Morgenthau a
lecture in new york couple years ago he
said well nevertheless we can take some
comfort in the fact what survey was
planning anyway and the proof that they
were planning it is guess what
operation or through a probable
intelligence fabrication that was
publicized after the bombing so even if
it was true it wouldn't matter and
furthermore even if it was true as a
contingency plan I mean look
this rule has contingency plans to drive
all the palestinians out of the West
Bank if there's a conflict does that
mean that Iran has a right to bomb
Israel I'm the US has contingency plan
to invade Canada okay's I mean
everybody's oxidizable of her right to
bomb the United States that's the last
straw of justification I'm a part of a
restricted perspective person
respectable person but fully heard of
independent minds it just doesn't matter
the bombing was because of our high
values and our nobility and it was to
stop genocide say anything else sir you
know torrent the vilification and abuse
comes but it's not just on this issue
it's on every issue so try to bring up
the idea take say the Vietnam War a lot
of time is passed
a huge amount of scholarship unto
documentation blew up the country
triages I'm sorry we won't have time for
going into that I want to ask you about
some of the present developments that
are being used again to advocate a lot
of these issues so building the ostrich
died last month what is the significance
of his death in your view the measure
which was committed in any crimes not a
nice person terrible person but the
charges against and we've never held up
and he was originally indicted on the
Kosovo charges the indictment was issued
right in the middle of the bombing which
already nullifies it it used British
they admittedly used British and US
intelligence is right in the middle of
bombing can't possibly take series her
if you look at the indictment it was for
crimes committed after the bombing it's
one exception rechak let's even grant
that claims of troops put it aside right
so there was one exception no evidence
that he was involved no evidence that he
was involved or you know
wait but the entire and almost entire
indictments are after the bonding
however this charge is going to stand up
unless you put Bill Clinton and Tony
Blair on the dock alongside him all
right then they realize that was a weak
case so they added the early Vulcan
worse okay a lot of horrible things
happen but the worst crime the one that
really gonna charge me that genocide is
forever hatred there's a little problem
with that mainly there was an extensive
detailed inquiry yet to it by the Dutch
government which was the responsible
government there were Dutch forces there
as I've read hundreds of pages of
inquiry and their conclusion is that
militaries didn't know anything about
and that when it was discovered in
Belgrade they were horrified well
suppose that had entered into testimony
does this way that you are under will
show that set the PI's I don't but it's
terrible if I should have been thrown
out packy probably would have been
thrown out in the early 90s if the
Albanians had voted it's pretty close
yeah I did all sorts of terrible things
but I was at the tellurian State I'm in
there were elections there was an
opposition a lot of rotten things my
rotten things everywhere and I certainly
didn't what I had dinner with him talk
to him and yes he deserves to be tried
for crimes but this trailer was never
gonna hold up if it was even semi honest
it was a farce in fact they were lucky
that he died and what's that because
they didn't have to go through the trial
now they can you can build up an image
about how he would have been convicted
as another Hitler and we not to do it
this is going to bring you back to the
bonding of RTS some have argued that the
this particular act of NATO 299 set
precedence for targeting of media by the
United States afterward notably in
Afghanistan and Iraq that is that it set
a precedent for legitimizing
you know media houses and labeling them
as propaganda in order to bomb
in the US invasion so do you make any
connection there well I mean the
chronology is correct but I don't think
they need excuses on the points you bomb
anybody you want to let's take 1998
so it's before it in 1998 - here's
another thing - not allowed to say in
the United States or the West it leads
to hysteria but I'll say it in 1998
Clinton bomb the major pharmaceutical
plant in the Sudan okay that was this is
the plant is losing most of the
pharmaceuticals and very veterinary
medicines for a poor African country
that's under embargo can't replace him
was that going to do it was how easily I
killed one of no numbers of people in
fact the u.s. bought an investigation by
the UN so we don't know of course you
don't investigate your own crimes but
for some evidence so the German
ambassador who was a fellow at Harvard
University into two sedan wrote an
article in Harvard International review
and which he estimated the casualties in
the tens of thousands of deaths the
research to the head of the Near East
foundation very respectable foundation
the Regional Director at fieldwork in
Somalia incident he did a study came out
same conclusion probably tens of
thousands did right after the bombing
within weeks
Human Rights Watch issued a warning that
there's going to be human a humanitarian
catastrophe and give examples of aid
workers being pulled out from areas
where people were dying at a vast rate
so on I cannot mention this any mention
of this that brings the same hysteria as
the presiding the bombing of the TV
station so imaginable it's a Western
crime and therefore it was legitimate
you're not that I mean if you just
suppose that al-qaeda blew up the half
the pharmaceutical supplies in
the US or England or Israel or any
country in which people live human
beings not ants people I imagine the
reaction to part of a nuclear war but
when we do it to a poor African country
didn't happen not discussed in fact the
only issue that is discussed the earth
discussion is whether the intelligence
was correct when it claimed that it was
also producing chemical weapons that is
the only question mention anything else
the usual hysteria entire raids this is
a very disciplined Western intellectual
culture is extremely disciplined and
religion you cannot go beyond fixed
bounds
it's not you know it's not censored it's
all voluntary but it's true it's not
generally not pillory societies like
this in fact a major in the third world
countries are different so it takes a
turkey half third world I mean to Turkey
the intellectuals the leading
intellectual now best-known writers
academics journalists artists and they
not only protest atrocities like the
Kurdish massacres they protest them
constantly but they're also constantly
carrying out civil disobedience against
it that you participated with them
sometimes on they will publish and
banned writings which report it present
them to the prosecutor's office demand
to be prosecuted that's not a joke you
know facing sometimes that they are sent
to prison that's no joke nothing like
that in the West and inconceivable when
I'm in Western Europe and I hear them
telling me turkey isn't civilized enough
to enter the European Union act burst
out laughing see the way around
you mentioned the Democratic movements
in various countries there was a course
of promising democratic movement in
Serbia before and of course during the
bombing and people like Wesley Clark had
claimed that this bonding would be of
benefit to the antonella's which versus
when of course it turned out to be a
disaster was this a sincere evaluation
half of NATO I can't look into their
minds and when you get a crime it is
extremely easy to find a justification
for it that's true a personal life it's
true of international affairs so yeah
maybe they'd lead I mean I'm probable I
think that's convincing evidence both
the Japanese fascists believed but they
were doing good when they carried out
this magnificent work John Stuart Mill
surely believed he was being honorable
and Noble when he was calling for the
conquest of India right after some of
the worst atrocities which he didn't
mention but you can easily believe your
noble all right to me it seemed obvious
was going to harm the democratic
movement I wrote about it I couldn't get
much information but it's obvious that
that's going to happen and I'm it's
happening right now in Iran the there's
a democratic movement here and they are
pleading with the United States not to
maintain a harsh embargo certainly not
to attack it's harming them it
strengthens the most reactionary violent
elements in the society of course may I
ask you one final question about the
future negotiations over Kosovo's final
status are underway right now the United
States is backing argument checker who
is someone involved in ethnic cleansing
not only the work room themself
lithography net explosion yeah which use
now do you first of all what what do you
see is appropriate realistic solution to
the final status of Kosovo and how does
it differ from what the United States is
now promoting my feeling has been for a
long time that the only realistic
solution is when which in fact was
offered by the president of Serbia I
think back around 1993 the main reason I
partition with the Serbian by now is
where she served left but the what were
the Serbian areas being part of Serbia
the rest be what they call independent
which means
veining I just don't see any other I
didn't see any other feasible solution
ten years ago still don't see any other
shall we wrap up Mr chocolate thank you
very much
