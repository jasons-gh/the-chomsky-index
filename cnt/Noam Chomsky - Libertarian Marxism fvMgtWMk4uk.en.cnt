Russian system was finally collapsing I
was asked by a leftist journal to write
an article on was it me in London
socialism collapses and I read an
article I said is this small victory for
socialism if this goes then I explained
why they refused to publish it it
finally appeared in an anarchist journal
in Montreal but I actually wrote
something like that for the nation and a
symposium they had I don't think anybody
understood a word of what I was saying I
mean even the people who are strong
anti-stalinist and so on that I think
that's true now you know out of the
Marxist movement there came another
strength people like well-known people
go Anton Pannekoek head of the secondary
national educational system at call
course others they are here like romatic
big strict Marxists but they had a
different position they are very opposed
to Bolshevism in fact Lenin had a famous
pamphlet about them they called the
ultra left infantile something or other
that was kind of left you know what kind
of left-wing Marxism wasn't very far
from anarcho-syndicalism effective
pretty close relation a lot of these
people were very much in favor of the
Spanish revolution anarchist revolution
but so there's that strain they wanted
workers control and factory and
factories and you know elimination of
the party hierarchy very anti Leninist
but that was although there was some of
the leading figures in the Marxist
movement that was disputing I mean whose
red moniker but you know you have okay
who but the fact stuff didn't even reach
the west until the 1950s but the and
then there was of course the whole you
know less libertarian movements
America's darkest indicas sources of
other people but that didn't become
socialism what socialism became Lenin or
a social democracy a German social do
korzy which was kind of reformist
parliamentary social democracy which did
do things for workers rights and women's
rights and so on so but it's within the
framework of state capitalist
democracies so that's that was socialism
but the real socialist movement was
pretty much crushed
