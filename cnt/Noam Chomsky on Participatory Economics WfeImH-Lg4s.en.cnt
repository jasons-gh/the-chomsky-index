what pitfalls and benefits do you see in
Perry Kahn just rhetoric endemics Perry
papa
do you think it is an ideal form of
future socialism why or why not I don't
think that's Mike and I have been
talking about this for decades but my
own feeling is I'm kind of skeptical
about detailed planning of a society
partly could have recently just
mentioned I don't think we know enough
about human beings and about societies
to be able to sketch in great detail how
they could or would behave under various
conditions so maybe this is the right
way but my feeling is that has the auto
experimentation different kinds of forms
of cooperation and mutual support mutual
aid has to be considered there may be
lots of options so may not have made
consequence of the auto some of them
they work out in different ways I mean I
think they're there the particular
questions that can be raised but for
example should people be remunerated on
the basis of effort I don't think that's
obvious I think there's some
justification and the you know the old
principle to each according to his needs
from each according to its ability
thank you it's a great conservative
position only about a majority of
Americans think that that's so obvious
there must be in the Constitution
literally and I think it is a sort of
just when Americans say it's in the
Constitution that just means no
obviously true because nobody knows what
I'm stupid but it was actually it has
been several polls which are shown that
and I think it's a pretty reasonable
position so I'm not convinced as
remuneration according to effort is the
right idea
try it see you try other things you see
and so on and exactly what kind of the
idea is distributing work equitably it's
a nice idea but I'm not sure it's the
right idea I mean it may be that some
people just different than the kinds of
work that they're happy doing and it
seems to me that said competing ideals
so you have to ask how to reconcile
those two things and there are a lot of
other questions that arise along the way
but I don't have answers to my feeling
is it has to be worked out buddy
