from the issue of israel-palestine to
the arrest of Julian Assange from
nuclear war to climate change after
viewing part of a new film about him
called internationalism or extinction
Noam Chomsky talked about the past two
years under President Trump you'll
indulge me I'd like to start with brief
reminiscence of period which is eerily
similar to today and many unpleasant
respects I'm thinking of exactly 80
years ago almost to the day happened to
be the moment of the first article that
I remember having written on political
issues easy to date it was right after
the fall of our salona in February 1939
the article was about what seemed to be
the inexorable spread of fascism over
the world 1938
Austria had been annexed by Nazi Germany
a few months later the Czechoslovakia
was betrayed put placed in the hands of
the Nazis at the Munich conference the
in Spain one city after another was
falling to Franco's forces February 1939
Barcelona fell that was the end of the
Spanish Republic the remarkable popular
revolution anarchist revolution of
nineteen thirty-six thirty-seven
thirty-eight had already been crushed by
force it looked as if fascism was going
to spread without end it's not exactly
what's happening today but if we can
borrow Mark Twain's famous phrase
history doesn't repeat but sometimes
rhymes too many similarities to overlook
when Barcelona fell there was a huge
flood of refugees from Spain most went
to Mexico about 40,000 some went to New
York City established
anarchist offices in Union Square
secondhand bookstores and down fourth
Avenue that's where I got my early
political education roaming around that
area that's 80 years ago now it's today
we didn't know at the time but the US
government was also beginning to think
about the how the spread of fascism
might be virtually unstoppable
they didn't view it with the same alarm
that I did as a ten year old we now know
that the attitude of the State
Department was rather mixed regarding
what the significance of the Nazi
movement was actually there was a consul
in Berlin US Consul in Berlin who was
sending back pretty mixed comments about
the Nazis suggesting maybe they're not
as bad as everyone says he stayed there
until
harbored a when he was withdrawing
famous diplomat named George Kennan not
not a bad indication of the mixed
attitude towards these developments the
it turns out couldn't have known it at
the time but shortly after this 1939 the
State Department and the Council on
Foreign Relations began to carry out
planning about the post-war world what
would the post-war world looked like and
in the early years right about that time
next few years they assumed that the
post-war world would be divided between
a German controlled world Nazi
controlled world most of Eurasia and a
u.s. controlled world which would
include the lot the Western Hemisphere
the former British Empire which the US
would take over parts of the Far East
and that would be the shape of the
post-war world those views we now know
were maintained until the Russians
turned the tide Stalingrad in 1942 the
huge tank battle that of course a little
later I made it pretty clear that the
Russians would defeat the Nazis the
planning changed picture of the post-war
world changed went on to what we've seen
for the last period since that time well
that was 80 years ago today we do not we
are not facing the rise of anything like
Nazism but we are facing the spread of
which sometimes called the
ultra-nationalist reactionary
international trumpeted openly by its
advocates including Steve Bannon the
impresario of the movement just had a
victory yesterday the Netanyahu election
and Israel solidified the reactionary
alliance that's being established all of
this under the US aegis run by the FeRAM
triumvirate the trump Pompeo
triumvirate could borrow a phrase from
george w bush to describe them but out
of politeness I want the the Middle East
Alliance consists of the extreme
reactionary states of the region
Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates Egypt
under the most brutal dictatorship of
its history Israel right at the center
of it confronting Iran severe threats
that we're facing in Latin America the
election of Jacob Olsen ro and Brazil
was put in power of the most extreme
most outrageous of the right-wing
ultra-nationalists who are now plaguing
the hemisphere yesterday Lenin Moreno
the of Ecuador took a strong step
towards joining the far-right alliance
by expelling Julianna songs from the
embassies picked up quickly by the US
will face a very dangerous future unless
there's a significant popular protest
Mexico and
is one of the rare exceptions in Latin
America to these developments this has
happened in Western Europe the
right-wing parties are growing some of
them very frightening in character there
is a counter development
Yanis varoufakis the former finance
minister of greece very significant
important individual along with Bernie
Sanders have urged the formation of a
progressive international to counter the
right-wing international that's
developing at the level of states the
balance looks overwhelmingly in the
wrong direction but states aren't the
only entities at the level of people
it's quite different and that could make
the difference that means a need to
protect the functioning democracies to
enhance them to make use of the
opportunities they provide for the kinds
of activism that have led significant
progress in the past could save us in
the future
I want to make a couple of remarks below
about the severe difficulty of
maintaining and instituting democracy
the powerful forces that have always
opposed that the the achievements of
somehow salvaging and enhancing it and
the significance of that for the future
but first a couple of words about the
challenges that we face which you heard
enough about already and you all know
about I don't have to go into them in
detail to describe these challenges as
extremely severe would be an error
the phrase does not capture the enormity
of the kinds of challenges that lie
ahead and any serious discussion of the
future of humanity must begin by
recognizing a critical fact that the
human species is now facing a question
that has never before arisen in human
history question that has to be answered
quickly will human society survive for
long well as you all know for seventy
years we've been living under the shadow
of nuclear war those who've looked at
the record can only be amazed that we've
survived this far a time after time has
come extremely close to terminal
disaster even minutes away it's kind of
a miracle that we survived miracles
don't go on forever
this has to be terminated done quickly
the recent Nuclear Posture review of the
new trump administration dramatically
increases the threat of conflagration
which would in fact be terminal for the
species we may remember that this
Nuclear Posture review was sponsored by
Jim mattis who was regarded as too
civilized to may retain to be retained
and the administration gives you a sense
of what can be tolerated in the trump
Pompeo bolton world well there were
three major arms treaties of the ABM
Treaty and that a ballistic missile
treaty the @f treaty
intermediate nuclear forces the New
START treaty the u.s. pulled out of the
ABM Treaty in 2002 and anyone who
believes that anti-ballistic missiles or
defensive weapons is deluded about the
nature of these systems
the US has just pulled out of the INF
treaty established by the Gorbachev and
Reagan in 1987 which sharply reduced the
threats of war in Europe which would
very quickly spread the background of
that signing of that treaty was the
demonstrations that you just saw
depicted on the film massive public
demonstrations were the background for
leading to a treaty that made a very
significant difference worth remembering
that many other cases where significant
popular activism has made a huge
difference
the lessons are too obvious to enumerate
well the Trump administration is just
withdrawn from the INF treaty the
Russians withdrew right afterwards if
you take a close look you find that each
side has a kind of incredible case
saying that the opponent has not lived
up to the treaty for those who want a
picture of the how the Russians might
look at it The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists the major journals on arms
control issues had a lead article a
couple of weeks ago by Theodore Postol
pointing out how dangerous the US
installations of anti-ballistic missiles
on the Russian border how dangerous they
are and can be perceived to be by the
Russians notice on the Russian border
tensions are mounting on the Russian
border both sides are carrying out
provocative actions we should
in a rational world what would happen
would be negotiations between the two
sides with independent experts to
evaluate the charges that each is make
against the other to lead to a
resolution of these charges restore the
treaty that's a rational world but it's
unfortunately not the world we're living
in and though efforts are all have been
made in this direction and they won't be
unless there is significant pressure
well that leaves the New START treaty
the New START treaty has already been
designated by the figure in charge who
has modestly described himself as the
greatest president in American history
he gave it the usual designation of
anything that was done by his
predecessors the worst treaty that ever
happened in human history we've got to
get rid of it if in fact this comes up
for renewal right after the next
election and a lot is at stake a lot is
at stake and whether that treaty will be
renewed it has succeeded and very
significantly reducing the number of
nuclear weapons to a level way above
what they ought to be but way below what
they were before and it could go on well
meanwhile global warming proceeds on its
inexorable course during this millennium
every single year with one exception has
been hotter than the last one the there
are recent scientific papers James
Hansen and others which indicate that
the pace of global warming which has
been increasing since about 1980 may be
sharply escalating and may be moving
from linear growth to exponential growth
which means doubling every couple of
case we're already approaching the
conditions of 125,000 years ago when
this the sea level was about roughly 25
feet higher than it is today with the
melting the rapid melting of the
Antarctic huge ice fields we might that
point might be reached the consequences
that are almost unimaginable I mean I
won't even try to depict them that you
can figure out quickly what that means
well meanwhile while this is going on
you regularly read in the press euphoric
accounts of how the United States is
advancing and fossil fuel production
snow surpassed Saudi Arabia were in the
lead of fossil fuel production the big
banks JP Morgan Chase and others are
pouring money into new investments in
fossil fuels looting the most dangerous
like Canadian tar sands and this is all
presented with great euphoria excitement
we're now reaching energy independence
we could control the world Turman the
use of fossil fuels and the world barely
a word on what the meaning of this is
which is quite obvious it's not that the
reporters commentators don't know about
it that the CEO of the banks don't know
about it of course they do but these are
kind of institutional pressures that
just are extremely hard to extricate
themselves from you can put yourself and
they try to put yourself in the position
of the say the CEO of JPMorgan Chase the
biggest gem bank which is spending large
sums and investment in fossil fuels he
certainly knows everything that you all
know about global warming
it's no secret but what are the choices
basically has two choices the one choice
is to do exactly what he's doing the
other choice is to resign and be
replaced by somebody else will do
exactly what he's doing it's not an
individual problem it's an institutional
problem which can be met but only under
tremendous public pressure and the
secondi we've recently seen very
dramatically how it can how the solution
can be reached a group of young people
sunrise movement organised got to the
point of sitting in congressional
offices aroused some interest on from
the new progressive figures who were
able to make it to Congress under a lot
of popular pressure Alexandria or
Cassino Cortez joined by Ed Markey
actually placed the green new deal on
the agenda that's a remarkable
achievement of course it's hostile
attacks from everywhere doesn't matter
it's a couple of years ago it was
unimaginable that it would be discussed
as a result of the activism of this
group of young people it's no right in
the center of the agenda
it's got to be implemented in one form
or another it's essential for survival
maybe not exactly that form but some
modification of a tremendous change
achieved by the commitment of a small
group of young people that tells you the
kind
can be
[Applause]
meanwhile the Doomsday Clock of The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists last
January was set at 2 minutes to midnight
that's closest it's been two terminal
disasters since 1947
the announcement of the settlement of
the setting mentioned the two major
familiar threats the threat of nuclear
war his increasing threat of global
warming which is increasing further and
it added a third for the first time the
undermining of democracy
that's the third threat along with
global warming and nuclear war and that
was quite appropriate because
functioning democracy offers the only
hope of overcoming these threats they're
not going to be dealt with by major
institutions state or private acting
without massive public pressure which
means that the the means of democratic
functioning have to be kept alive used
the way the sunshine movement did it the
way the great mass demonstration in the
early eighties did it and the way we
continue today this is democracy now I'm
Amy Goodman in Boston as we sit down
with Noam Chomsky for a public
conversation I asked him about the
arrest of Julian Assange
well the Assange arrest is scandalous
and several respects one of them is just
the effort of governments and it's not
just the US government the British are
cooperating Ecuador of course is now
cooperating
Sweden before had cooperated the efforts
to silence a journalist who was
producing materials that people in power
didn't want cut the rascal multitude to
know about okay that's basically what
happened
WikiLeaks was producing things that
people ought to know about those in
power people in power don't like that so
therefore we have to silence it okay
this is the kind of thing the kind of
scandal that takes place unfortunately
over and over to take another example
right next door to Ecuador in Brazil
with the developments that have gone on
are extremely important this is the most
important country in Latin America and
one of the most important in the world
under the Lula government early in this
millennium Brazil was the most maybe the
most respected country in the world it
was the voice for the global South under
the leadership of Lula da Silva notice
what happened there was a coup soft who
to eliminate the nefarious effects of
the Labour Party the Workers Party these
are described by the World Bank not me
the World Bank as the golden decade in
Brazil's history with radical reduction
of poverty massive extension of
inclusion of marginalized populations
large parts of the population
afro-brazilian indigenous who were
brought into the society a sense of
dignity and hope for the population that
couldn't be tolerated after
after he left office kind of a soft food
take place I won't go through the
details but the last move last September
was to take the Lula da Silva the
leading the most popular figure in
Brazil who was almost certain to win the
forthcoming election put him in jail
solitary confinement essentially a death
sentence 25 years in jail banned from
reading press or books and crucially
barred from making a public statement
unlike mass murderers on death row this
in order to silence the person who was
likely to win the election he's the most
important political political prisoner
in the world the DT here or anything
about it well Assange is a similar case
we've got a silence this voice you go
back to history some of you may recall
when Mussolini's fascist government put
Antonio Gramsci in jail
they said the prosecutor said we have to
silence this voice for 20 years can't
let it be speak
that's Assange that's Lula there are
other cases that's one scandal the other
scandal is just the extraterritorial
reach of the United States which is
shocking I mean why should the United
States why should any no other state
could possibly do it but why should the
United States have the power to control
what others are doing elsewhere in the
world
I mean it's outlandish situation takes
it goes on all the time we never even
know
at least there's no comment on it I take
the trade agreements with China okay
what are the trade agreements about
there are an effort to prevent China's
economic development that's exactly what
they are the China has a development
model the the Trump administration
doesn't like it so therefore let's
undermine it ask yourself what would
happen if China did not observe the
rules that the United States is trying
to impose China for example when Boeing
or Microsoft the some other major
company invest in China China wants to
have some control over the nature of the
investment they want some degree of
technology transfer they should gain
something from the technology is there
something wrong with that that's how the
United States developed stealing
technology we call stealing technology
from England so England developed the
taking technology for more advanced
countries India the Low Countries even
Ireland that's how every developed
country has reached the stage of
advanced development if Boeing and
Microsoft don't like those arrangements
they don't have to invest in China
nobody has a gun to their heads if you
really if anybody really believed in
capitalism they should be free to make
any arrangement they want with China if
it involves technology transfer okay the
United States wants to block that so
China can't develop take what are called
intellectual property rights suppose
exorbitant patent rights and for
medicines
windows for example bill Microsoft has a
monopoly on operating systems through
the World Trade Organization suppose
China didn't observe these who would
benefit and who would lose well the fact
of the matter is that consumers in the
United States would benefit it would
mean that they get cheaper medicines it
would mean that when you get a computer
you wouldn't be stuck with Windows you
could get a better operating system
Bill Gates would have a little less
money the pharmaceutical corporations
wouldn't be a super rich as they are a
little less rich but the consumers would
benefit is there something wrong with
that well you might ask yourself what's
what lies behind all of these
discussions and negotiations this is
true across the board almost any issue
you pick you can ask yourself why is
this accepted so in this case why is it
acceptable for the United States to have
the power to even begin to protect to
give even a proposal to extradite
somebody whose crime is to expose to the
public materials that people in power
don't want us don't want them to see
that's basically what's happening know
what about what's happened in Israel
Prime Minister Netanyahu winning a
record fifth term right before the
election he announces that he will annex
illegal Israeli settlements in the
occupied West Bank last month
Trump officially recognized Israeli
sovereignty over the Golan Heights well
first of all if mr. if Bennigan's had
been elected instead of Netanya
the difference would not be very great
the difference between the two
candidates is not substantial in terms
of policy netanyahu here's another
example of the extraterritorial reach of
the united states netanyahu is somewhat
more extreme the united states
desperately wanted him to be elected and
the trump administration has been giving
gift after gift than netanyahu to try to
get him elected it was enough to carry
him over the roughly 50/50 close to
50/50 election but one of them of course
was to move the embassy to jerusalem in
violation of not only international law
but even the Security Council
resolutions that the US had participated
in very dramatic change the second
equally dramatic was to authorize
Israeli annexation of the Golan Heights
the Syrian Golan Heights are under
international law occupied territory
Israel every major institution as every
relevant institution Security Council
International Court of Justice all agree
on this Israel did formally annex the
Golan Heights
but the Security Council UN Security
Council with the u.s. participating
declared that no long okay
Trump unilaterally reversed it another
gift that Netanyahu saying try to
demonstrate to the Israeli public that
with us backing he can get anything they
want the last was Trump's latest just
before the election
declaration that if elected he would
next parts of the West Bank that was
with tacit you with us authorization
these are measure strong measures that
were taken to interfere radically with a
foreign election have you heard
something about how terrible it is to
interfere and for elections I think
maybe that you notice that somewhere
here it's done radically it's considered
fine but exactly what are the actual
consequences of that in terms of the way
policy has been evolving fact of the
matter is not much
so take the annexation of the Golan
Heights in fact it was declared null and
void by the Security Council it was
condemned by the International Court of
Justice but did anybody do anything
about it has any move been made to
prevent Israel's development of the
Golan Heights establishment of
settlements enterprises development of
the ski resorts on Mount Hermon anything
no nobody lifted a finger and nobody
lifted a finger for a simple reason the
US won't allow it
nobody says that but that's the fact
well now it's formally authorized
instead of just happening take the
Netanyahu proposal to annex parts of the
West Bank that's been going on for 50
years
literally right after the 67 war both
political parties both major groupings
in Israel then former labor based
party Likud based part conglomerate they
have slightly different policies but
essentially they have been carrying out
a development program in the West Bank
which is geared towards the goal the
very clear goal of creating what will be
a kind of Greater Israel in which Israel
will take over whatever is a value in
the West Bank leave the Palestinian
population concentrations like in Nablus
and tolk arm leave them isolated in the
rest of the region there are maybe 150
or so little Palestinian enclaves more
or less surrounded by checkpoints often
separated from their fields able to
survive but barely
meanwhile the Jewish settlements or
developed cities have been constructed
major city mall de Dieu meme constructed
mostly under Clinton and some Templi
under the Clinton years east of
Jerusalem the road to it essentially
bisects the West Bank further ones up
north Jerusalem itself has maybe five
times the size of what it ever was
historically all of these are linked by
highly developed infrastructure projects
you can take a trip you can't read these
are it's basically creating a pleasant
suburbs of the of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem
in the West Bank
you can travel from malla do meme to Tel
Aviv on a big highway restricted to
Israelis and tourists not Palestinians
more easily than you can get from the
South Shore to Boston never seeing an
hour all of this has been steadily
developed year after year with tacit us
u.s. provides the diplomatic support a
lot of the economic support the military
aid meanwhile the government says we
don't like it stop doing it but
providing the means for it well the only
difference in Netanyahu's statement with
Trump's tacit backing is I'm going to go
ahead and the next annex all of this
instead of just developing it subject to
eventual annexation these are the real
things that have been happening the
Netanyahu the Netanyahu victory as I
mentioned before solidifies an alliance
that is being that has been developed
it's been parts of it have been kind of
undercover for years not formal but
functioning now coming into the open of
the most reactionary Arab States
primarily Saudi Arabia one of the most
reactionary states in the world Egypt
under the Sisi dictatorship the worst
dictatorship in Egypt's history United
Arab Emirates similar Israel right in
the center of it it's part of the the
international right-wing alliance system
of the International reactionary ultra
nationalist Alliance system that's
taking shape with the US leadership the
kind of a new global system that's
developing South America's other bowls
tomorrow's another part of it and yet in
the United States there's this growing
awareness we for example the Democratic
Republican vote against Saudi Arabia UAE
s war in Yemen fueled by the United
States does that give you hope
very interesting development that's
actually Bernie Sanders its what notice
and it's it is a very important
development but let's notice what
happened the suti the united arab
emirate war and yemen has been a hideous
atrocity this probably nobody knows
maybe sixty seventy thousand people
killed half the population barely
surviving that's the UN describes it as
the worst humanitarian disaster in the
world it's a real monstrosity it's been
going on year after year using Saudi
Arabia UAE or using US weapons
secondarily British weapons a US
intelligence support the US intelligence
directly we're working closely with the
Saudis to target bombing so on and so
forth all of this has been happening
with no protest then came the Khashoggi
killing brutal killing of a journalist
for The Washington Post that caused
outrage okay it should have but you know
that's not the reason why the Yemen war
should have suddenly had the spotlight
signed on it shined on it but it was
then Bernie Sanders came along with a
couple of others and initiated the
legislation which puts some crimps and
the you direct you a support for the war
which is significant but we should put
it in the context of what in fact
happened and I think I think we can be
pretty confident that the Trump
unpayable triumvirate will find a way
around it
keep the war going unless the public
seriously protests now there is
something else to pay it that's worth
paying attention to
the support for
Israeli expansionism repression the
whole alliance that's developing that
support has shifted in the United States
from the more liberal sectors roughly
the Democratic Party to the far-right
not very long ago support for Israel was
based passionately in the liberal
sectors of the population it was a
democratic issue it isn't anymore in
fact if you look at in the polls people
who identify themselves as liberal as
Democrats by now tend to support
Palestinian rights more than Israel
that's a dramatic change it's it's a
support for Israel now is in the most
reactionary parts of the population
evangelical Christians all from
nationalists basically it's a far-right
issue among younger people this is even
more of the case
I mean I've I can see it myself just my
own personal experience up until about
maybe 10 or 15 years ago if I was giving
a talk at a university on Israel
Palestine even my own university MIT I
had to have police protection
literally police would try to prevent
the meeting from being broken up they
wouldn't let me walk to my car alone I
had to be accompanied by police a
meetings were broken up nobody was
objecting to any of this was happening
all the time that's changed totally
that's a very significant change I think
that sooner or later
I hope sooner this may lead to a shift
in US policy there's some very simple
moves that could be made in the US
policy that would change
the situation in the Middle East
dramatically so for example one simple
proposal is that the United States
government should live up the US law
that doesn't sound too dramatic though
the United States has laws like the so
called lay law Patrick Leigh law which
requires that no military aid can be
given to any military organization that
is involved in systematic human rights
abuses
well the Israeli army is involved in
massive human rights abuses if the US
were to live up to US law we would cut
off aid to the IDF the Israeli army that
step alone would have a major effect not
just the material aid but the symbolic
meaning of it and it's quite possible
that with the shift of public opinion
especially among younger people there
might come a point when there will be a
call for the United States to follow its
own laws okay again not a very it
wouldn't even be breaking new ground
Noam Chomsky we spoke at the Old South
Church Thursday night he was visiting
his longtime home of Boston he was a
professor at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology for over 50 years at the
end of the event we celebrated his 90th
birthday speaking of which a very happy
birthday to Anna
Oh's Beck and Joe Parker special thanks
today to Mike fer John Hamilton KS video
Denis Moynihan and
I'm Amy Goodman from Boston thanks so
