overcoming apart height was a tremendous
achievement and they really had to fight
I mean you may remember you probably
don't remember positions kept quiet but
in 1988 which is right before the fall
of apartheid the Reagan administration
of the Pentagon Colin Powell's Pentagon
characterized the African National
Congress Nelson Mandela as one of the
more notorious terrorist groups in the
world and Reagan was violating
congressional resolutions to increase
trade with South Africa that was 1988 in
fact Mandela just got off the terrorist
list a couple of months ago it was
getting embarrassing but so it was real
is real battle I'm and they overcame it
and it's a great victory on the other
hand for the majority of blacks in South
Africa it's matt essentially nothing
like they may be worse off if you look
at mortality rates and so on that
probably were so I mean what you find if
you go to say Cape Town is black faces
and the limousines you know that kind of
thing I was there in fact and you know
it's an improvement but if you go out to
the hideous slums right outside Cape
Town I mean it's like monstrous II
activists won't take you in there
because they were afraid and you know
the so that it is I I think it is a
historic achievement and important have
a black family in the in the White House
but we shouldn't exaggerate the effect i
don't expect to see noticeable effects
on the say on the incarceration system
which is primarily and a system for a
locking of black males that nobody wants
to have around we'll see but i don't see
any sign of it actually there was a
rather acid commentary in one of the
black journals internet journals called
the black agenda probably find it on the
internet which some well-known black
activists i wrote a satirical piece on
how blacks can
get to be elected to high office this is
the first thing they have to do is make
sure they have no slave ancestry okay so
they come from effort from the West
Indies or Kenya or something like that
the second thing they have to do is
attack the black community and denigrate
it now saying problem of racism is you
guys don't pick in the garbage you you
know you know that kind of stuff but
never denigrate the white community
that's very important and then it goes
through a list of things you can predict
the rest of course they're they're
predicting what it means okay I think
it's some mixture it should have a
should have an effect or he is having
effect but it's just how restricted will
be depends on the way people I guess
respond I'm gonna take the civil rights
movement in the south it had a big
effect what effect did it have in the
North a very marginal effect so in fact
more did you listen to the speeches on
Martin Luther King Day I mean all kind
of you know how wonderful he was up to
up to the point where he was condemning
racist sheriffs in Alabama but what
about the rest of King what he really
cared about like organizing a poor
people's movement or opposing the war in
Vietnam and aggression generally that's
kind of been washed out of history or
take just Boston I'm gonna take say
where I live okay like I said I live in
Lexington when I go home tonight I look
if I go home after work I have to fight
rush hour traffic for an hour the subway
you guys are too young to remember but
the red line used to end at Harvard
Square in the 1970s there was a plan to
extend it to the western suburbs like
where I live if it had been extended the
western suburbs would take me 10 minutes
to get home and everybody else in
Lexington yeah pretty wealthy
professional community
but they didn't extended that far it was
extended to the border of Cambridge okay
2l wife why the western suburbs wouldn't
allow it to be extended and the reasons
nobody likes to put up a poster about
them but the pretty obvious it's better
to spend two hours a day fighting Russia
or traffic than to face the threat that
a black kid might be walking around
Lexington center ok that's the north you
know after the civil rights movement and
its characteristic of a lot of things
there's a long way to go in order to get
professor Chomsky home on time we're
going to take one more question ok thank
you pick so i won't be oh they can
criticize you i can get at it oh ok ok
we'll just um go to that side over here
yeah thank you yeah i was wondering how
far or how much can an individual push
for social change before they've impeded
on somebody else's right so you remain
yes some what a pathetic I mean
obviously violence is too far but can
you ask too much or tried to change too
much the point where you're impeding on
somebody's yes right to remain asleep or
somewhat not you well any kind of social
change that advances rights usually
steps on somebody's toes like pick
ending slavery stepped on it those of
the slave owners okay and if you look
back it wasn't a open-and-shut case I
mean the slave owners had arguments and
some of the arguments are not so easy to
answer for one thing they say look
you're violating property rights I mean
I blood this guy we're supposed to like
property rights so how can you take away
my property that's unconstitutional
furthermore the slave owners argued that
they were being benevolent it was the
northern manufacturers who were in
ro and their argument is not
unreasonable and just put it
anachronistically suppose that you and I
want to get a car okay same car and you
buy it and I rent it okay come a year
later and see which car is in better
shape it'll be yours because you own it
it's your property you take care of it I
mean I just rented it so it gets dented
or something or other I don't care i
give it back well the slave owners
argued look we own these people so we
take care of them you rent them let's go
out having a job you just rent them so
you don't take care of them so you just
throw them out if you don't want to or
do anything so we're the good guys
you're the bad guys so you know try to
answer that argument incidentally but
there were arguments like that that's
slavery I mean when you talk about
anything else yeah sure if you you know
if you integrate schools you're stepping
on people's rights the people who want
to preserve their own communities that's
a right in fact it's almost impossible
to think of anything you know let's
suppose you have a minimum wage so
people can survive well you know you're
infringing on the rights of employers to
exploit people and make more money so I
don't think you're going to find a
general answer to that question it's
takes a the American Revolution okay I
mean we all think it's their supposed to
think it's a good thing but you know
there were about as many loyalists as
there were rebels the country was
probably divided roughly a third a third
a third a third rebels third loyalists
the third didn't care the usual story
and
the Loyalists their rights were
undermined when the rebels won and
remember the rebels were terrorists but
standards of the day they carried out
terrorist acts the British finally left
but when the British left it wasn't such
a simple matter they were leaving behind
loyalists who were terrified of the
rebels in fact it isn't much discussed
in history courses but the was a huge
flight of people from the American
colonies white people because they were
just terrified of the rebels who won
they were writing letters from Nova
Scotia about other you know dying in the
snow boat people fleeing from Boston in
the middle of the winter we gotta get
away from these crazies who live in the
snow was a substantial literature on
this which nobody reads because you're
not supposed to but it's interesting so
that's like probably a third of the
population beside that there were the
blacks and the Native Americans who knew
what was going to happen to them if the
rebels won I mean Britain offered some
limited protection well was it just to
revolt was certainly infringing on right
I mean you can't find a case in history
where there aren't problems
