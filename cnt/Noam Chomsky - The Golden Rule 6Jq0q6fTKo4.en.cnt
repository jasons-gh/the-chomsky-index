well I think there are some simple
universal principles which we all sort
of which are kind of interesting if you
think about them there ee you know the
most interesting ones are the ones
they're doubly universal they're
universal and that we all accept them
and they're universal that we all
violate them so we accept them in
principle but we violate them in
practice so take the most elementary one
the Golden Rule you know apply to
yourself the same standards you apply to
others version of it if you ask do we
accept it verbally yeah do we live by it
not for a minute take a look at the way
with all the things we've been talking
about do we apply to ourselves the
standards we apply to our enemies say
Russia today or Iran or whatever we
don't have to go into we don't begin to
apply these standards to ourselves we're
immune to the standards we apply to
enemies so we preach thee we preach the
universal principles but we universally
violate them not everybody of course but
the systems that actually function in
the world do that's we can go on with
that I think there's plenty of examples
like that
