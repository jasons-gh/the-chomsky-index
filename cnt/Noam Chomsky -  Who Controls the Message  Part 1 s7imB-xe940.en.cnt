is it justified anger legitimate
frustration or pure nonsense why is the
tea party on the rise unless an answer
can be given to these people unless they
can be led to understand what's really
happening to them we could be in for
trouble Noam Chomsky who controls the
message a link TV special presentation
hello I'm Wendy haomer a vice president
of link TV I'm proud to welcome you to
this special presentation of Noam
Chomsky who controls the message Noam
Chomsky is one of America's most
celebrated intellectuals from his
groundbreaking work in the field of
linguistics to his commentary on media
and politics Chomsky has been an
academic icon for decades now in this
timely speech he takes a look at some of
the most important issues facing America
today whether it's the media's coverage
of the Tea Party or US involvement in
Afghanistan Chomsky's critique begs the
question who controls the message
Chomsky answers that question and many
more and we're proud to have him here on
link TV now Noam Chomsky who controls
the message there was an article the
other day in the new york times you may
have seen the headline MIT taking
student blogs to nth degree and a
student was quoted in paragraph 2 is
saying MIT is the closest you can get to
living in the Internet as you know
there's a great deal of pulling of hair
and gnashing of teeth on the part of
journalists and journalism people these
days about the decline and disappearance
of newspapers the shrinking content of
newspapers are we going through a phase
where so much attention is changing from
the traditional means of information
delivery to something else that we
should be concerned that something vital
to democracy is being lost or is this
just another transformation as we see
from time to time over the centuries in
the way that people get information from
each other
I think something's being lost we can
all you know put up blogs on the
internet and express our opinion it's a
good thing but there has to be there
have to be foreign bureaus doing inquiry
and domestic viewers somebody's got to
be researching now I don't necessarily
admire the way the major media do it I
think there are plenty of flaws in that
but nevertheless it is the source of
information that can't be duplicated by
people that there are computers they can
you can get access to a wide range of
information but you know even even that
is based on reporters on the ground and
if they are gone a lot is gone that
can't be replaced but nevertheless the
bloggers at MIT or people in this room
or people listening to us on the radio
now have access to a greater range of
contact with other human beings on the
planet all over the place and can get
input and information that you have so
eloquently written about over the years
is filtered out of the mainstream media
it's filtered out but contact with
people on the ground is not going to
replace that I mean if there are many
things that are happening right now that
are critically important that you can't
find in the major media I could give
examples but contacting people in other
countries is not going to provide that
information well let's say suddenly you
were knighted as editor of a major media
organization what would some of those
places be that you would want to see
more reporting done for well I see you
have something there about Willie ran
get a bomb yeah okay there's a there are
countries blasted me I read news wien
Newsweek somewhere yeah the I mean it's
good question whether we could discuss
that question whether Iran will get a
bomb but
much more important questions for
example a couple of about a week ago
here's something I learned because I was
in mexico in mexico that extremely good
newspaper la jornada maybe the only real
independent newspaper in the hemisphere
they happen to run a wire service report
which turns out is all over the wire
services which has not been reported
here to my knowledge namely that the
International Atomic Energy Agency
passed a resolution not about Iran those
are the ones we hear about usually
inaccurately but they passed a
resolution calling on Israel to join the
non-proliferation treaty and to open up
its its facility nuclear facilities to
inspection well the United States and
the European Union tried to block it and
when they failed the block at they voted
against it but it passed anyway well
that's really important news especially
with the hysteria about maybe Iran is
concealing something there was a report
two or three days ago in The Washington
Times that President Obama had assured
Israel that they wouldn't have to react
to this and of course they rejected now
that's important news or on the same
issue that our is Iran concealing
something there are other countries
nuclear powers that aren't concealing
except that it isn't reported here far
as I could tell so for example the the
Security Council passed a resolution
maybe a week or ten days ago which was
treated here as a great a victory
victory for Obama direct resolution
directed against Iran actually if you
read the resolution that's it was
directed against the United States
Israel India and Pakistan
but that's another question that that
you can find out on the internet by
looking up the resolution however what's
harder to find out is that India a
nuclear power that greeted the
resolution by announcing publicly and
proudly that it can now produce nuclear
weapons with a yield comparable to that
of the superb of the of the United
States and Russia well that's quite
significant they're not concealing
actually that if you really study the
internet carefully you could find it was
reported in the front page in fact of
the London Financial Times major
business journal in the world so it
can't be that the news viewers don't
know it and there's more that isn't
discussed and you can discover but it
takes research all of these countries
Israel India that there are three
countries that have never signed the
non-proliferation treaty India Pakistan
in Israel in each case their nuclear
weapons programs are have been
significantly aided by the United States
in the case of Pakistan maybe sometimes
called the most dangerous country in the
world with some merit its nuclear
programs are a gift to the world by your
former governor Ronald Reagan his
administration pretended of course
pretended that they didn't know that
Pakistan was developing nuclear weapons
in the 1980s because they wanted to
maintain their massive support for the
dictatorship of zeal Hawk who was the
worst most vicious dictator in
Pakistan's history and was also carrying
out a kind of a radical Islam ization of
the country with Saudi and US port and
we know the consequences of that we're
living with the consequences of that
well what about India is really enough
to talk about it's obvious in the case
of India
latty you may recall just about a year
ago the u.s. signed a entered into it
treaty with India which effectively
authorizes Indian nuclear weapons
production that's what the work that's
not the wording the wording says that
India though not a signer of the
non-proliferation treaty can override
the international restrictions and can
gain access to nuclear technology from
us from France from others and of course
that transfers very readily into nuclear
weapons production so here we have three
some countries that have never signed
the non-proliferation treaty in each
case there the clerk powers in each case
they're pretty openly proceeding to defy
international organizations the
international monitoring organization
the IAEA announcing that their programs
are moving long fast and and in each
case they're supported by the United
States well you know it takes work to
discover those things theoretically you
could find them through the internet but
with massive research and that's true
for every issue you look at you could
get around the failure of media to
present this information if there were
live active organizations which could
work together and you know we didn't
find out the information and circulated
discuss it discover the backgrounds and
so on but in the absence of a known an
organized public or many kinds of
organization individuals on their own I
can't face this what do you make of this
kind of what Pat Buchanan once called
peasants with pitchforks
approach to public policy coming from
the right in the streets and in the
media of this country with a certain
amount of vehemence and a certain
following as well that where I don't
know how many people but it seemed to me
from looking at television coverage
maybe a couple hundred thousand people
who marched in Washington a couple of
weeks ago under various banners of the
right what do you make of this and the
implications for small d democratic
government in the United States I think
the implications are dangerous but and
it's easy to ridicule them you don't
look at the crazy things they say you
want to kill my grandmother and so on
and there's a lot of nonsense that's
true but what we really ought to be
asking ourselves is why the peace
movement the left the activist
organizations aren't organizing these
people a lot of what they're protesting
is is pretty sensible I'm a lot of the
protests for example or against the
bailout the massive bailout you know
they feel that they were betrayed they
pressured worked very hard to prevent it
two minutes later they got it on why
should the you know bankers end up from
the recession more powerful than they
were before which is what's happening
you can read it in the business breasts
they're exalting about it the more
powerful and they were before they're
the big banks are even bigger than they
were the government insurance policy the
too big to fail insurance policy is
guaranteeing them that they can continue
doing exactly what they were doing which
tanked the economy they can take risky
make risky loans and investments since
it's risky they'll make a lot of profit
money coming out of the rears if it
collapses the taxpayer will come in and
bill amount was it too big to fail
bonuses and profits are going through
the roof and meanwhile people are
suffering well they have a reason to
protest that
and but but the tragedy is that the
protests are and many other things the
protests are being organized by pretty
much the same sectors that are creating
the crisis I'm the corporate money
that's behind them is the ones who are
very happy that it's coming out like
this and the the real failure of the
activist movements the left the peace
movement so on that we're not organizing
I think that's the question we ought to
ask and there are other things I mean
there are historical memories that are
awakened you don't want to draw
analogies too closely but there's some
similarities which are not encouraging
certainly for someone my age these
people have real grievances I mean I
have not seen a demographic analysis of
you know those who call in on talk shows
but I listen to them a lot and they're
interesting I mean if you sort of
suspend disbelief you forget about
reality of the world and just listen
it's not a joke if you listen the
message that comes across this has an
internal logic to it it's coherent it
gives answers to people who want answers
and need them and deserve them they're
crazy answers but they're not hearing
any others I mean these are people
who've you know worked hard they're done
everything right you know and Christian
God fearing and take care of their
families and and forth for 30 years
they've been shafted that somebody's got
to give him an answer why

drive make a stand for independent media
today thank you the media has always had
the function in this country
suspension of disbelief but that has
traditionally been called entertainment
what you're saying is the suspension of
disbelief has we've left edward r murrow
behind a long time ago that firewall
between the entertainment the Jack Benny
part and Milton Berle part of media for
those of you who go back that far and
the edward r murrow part of media that
wall has come down and what you're now
saying is that the suspension of
disbelief is a characteristic of
especially broadcast media in all of its
domains supposed entertainment
infotainment and information that's
happening but I don't really think
that's the main problem I was not a
great admirer of the media in the
earlier period I had a pretty awful in
many ways I think they're better now
than they were 30 40 years ago because
the country is better so we're civilized
country the media reflect that I think
I'm not really thinking about the
entertainment aspect of the media though
yes it's significant I'm thinking about
the part that has a substantive content
crazy content but it is substantive it
does give answers I mean to people who
for the last 30 years have seen their
wages income stagnate or decline
benefits decline services decline there
is nothing for the children you know
worlds out of control these are the
people who on poles maybe eighty percent
of them say the country's going in the
wrong direction the government's run by
the few and the special interests not
the people and so on you know they're
not wrong this is all happening to them
and the answers that they're getting
from say you know Rush Limbaugh Michael
Savage the rest of them are well we
haven't answered the rich liberals own
everything they own the corporation's
they run the government
they run the media and they don't care
about people like you they don't care
about the flyover people between the
East Coast and the west coast they only
care about giving everything you work
for a way to you know to illegal
immigrants or gays or something so we
got to protect ourselves from them and
furthermore they run the government when
they put up a health program it's not to
give you health it's to kill your granny
no and that's an answer to something
it's a terrible answer but it is an
answer and if you do suspend disbelief
you forget about what's happening in the
world really it's a coherent answer now
they're not hearing anything else and
the memory that comes to my mind again I
don't press the analogy too hard but I
think it's worth thinking about is late
by mar Germany there were people with
real grievances the Nazis gave him an
answer it's the fault of the Jews and
the Bolsheviks and we got to protect
ourselves from them and that'll take
care of grievances and we know what
happened germany in the 1920s was the
most civil I the peak of Western
civilization and in the arts and the
sciences highly democratic functioning
democratic institutions a decade later
it was in the pits of human history
again the analogy is not it's not close
but it's frightening and unless an
answer can be given to these people
unless they can be led to understand
what's really happening through them we
could be in for trouble well let me ask
you about the trouble that we may be in
for as a race on this planet not just as
a civilization in the United States your
linguistic approach is sometimes summed
up as emphasizing an innate set of
linguistic principles shared by all
human
do we also have in an eight cents do you
think of principles social principles
are we inclined towards violence are we
inclined towards fascism are we inclined
towards democracy are we inclined
towards anything or are those social
constructs that can be altered by
governments and by media and by general
social forces well just as background we
ought to bear in mind that not very much
is understood about these topics
studying human beings are very complex
objects it's hard enough to figure out
what the nature of insects is and when
you get to humans much much harder and
science has very little say about this
some suggestions but not a lot however
history tells us a lot and history tells
us that we have all those
characteristics and we've seen it you
know again take Germany it was the same
genes in the 1920s and the 1930s but
there are very different societies in
fact almost opposite extremes of human
possibility possibility and each one of
us you know has those characteristics I
mean every one of us could be a saint
could be a sinner usually something in
between and circumstances and conditions
make a big difference now you mentioned
before that's take something concrete
you mentioned before correctly that the
protesters the right-wing protesters are
denouncing government where does that
come from but since the Second World War
there has been a massive propaganda
campaign huge propaganda campaign run by
the by the business world to try to make
people hate government but it's
ambivalent because at the same time
those same sectors want a strong
government powerful state when the works
are them when they're trying to get
people to hate government they want them
to hate things like
services that the government provides
for the population but they're not
opposed to the government the powerful
government that works for them and it
takes a Ronald Reagan again he's called
a conservative but that's ridiculous he
was the most protectionists president
and post-war American history he
virtually doubled protective barriers to
try to protect incompetent us management
from being overrun by at that time
Japanese competitors he government
actually grew under on his watch he was
an advocate of big government but big
government that serves the rich and the
powerful and he left the country with a
huge deficit a Christ a major crisis the
savings and loan crisis you know not
quite as bad as this one but pretty
severe dude began to deregulation all in
the interests of concentrated sectors of
power he also initiated he sort of
pressed forward the program of massive
incarceration of poor in defenseless
people turns out mostly blacks so the
incarceration rate when he came in was
approximately the same as Europe but
maybe a little to the high end by the
time he was gone was out of sight it
increased further under same tendencies
increased under Clinton they're still
going on but Reagan drove it that way
actually and you mentioned something
about the internet before where'd that
come from I mean that didn't come from
private enterprise that come from state
intervention in the economy it was
Pentagon supported factors developed
right way was at MIT same as computers
same with lasers containers that are the
basis of trade micro electronics
biotechnology are you saying the
technology is value neutral basically
when it's not ended what or created well
you know in
its value neutral but in a society that
had no structure it would be valued
neutral but anxiety that has structure
yeah it's not valued the true but it
didn't come I mean to a substantial
extent it came from a powerful state
intervening in the economy and pursuing
a program which amounts to yes pretty
close to saying that the public pays the
costs and takes the risks and eventual
profit is privatized well that's big
government and you can be sure that the
corporate sponsors of the right-wing
movements I want to stop that they want
to keep it going just as they admire
Reagan you know there st. along the
lines of what you were just saying you
wrote a number of years ago we cannot
say much about human affairs with any
confidence but sometimes it's possible
we can for example be fairly confident
that either there will be a world
without war or there won't be a world at
least the world inhabited by creatures
other than bacteria and beetles with
some scattering of others you may
delusion before to your age your
generation do you think we've gotten any
closer over the course of your lifetime
to a world without war or are we on the
doomsday clock ticking moats mostly
towards midnight well I think their
tendencies in both direction and the
future of the species depend on which of
those prevail so what I said before
mentioned before about the escalation of
nuclear weapons well that's one of many
aspects of a tendency towards
destruction on the other hand we are a
much more civilized society than we were
say 40 years ago what do you mean by
civilized well let's take some examples
take the last election 2008 I didn't
happen to like any of the candidates but
40 years ago or for that matter 10 years
ago it would have been unimaginable
unthinkable that the Democratic Party
would have
two candidates a woman in an
african-american that's because of
changes in the society the the civil
rights movement the women's movement the
the environmental movement the
anti-nuclear movement the opposition to
aggression which is much stronger than
it was then and has in an inhibitory
effect let's just compare that all of
this comes out of the activism the 60s
which is why it's so denounced and
condemned it was making the society more
civilized and more democratic so of
course it's condemn takes a aggression I
compare the Vietnam War in the Iraq war
ok the the Iraq war was bad enough but
it's I think the first war in history
that was massively protested before it
was officially launched I say officially
because we later learned that bush and
Blair had already started the war but we
know at the time anyway it was massively
protested before it was officially
launched and that large-scale protest
has had an effect the US did not apply
and could not apply the tactics that
applied in Indochina they simply
wouldn't have been tolerated by the
population so there's no saturation
bombing there's no chemical warfare that
there's no you know that sending half
million troops to the country is no
driving people into concentration camps
there were four million people who left
Iraq under duress it was several hundred
thousand who were killed there were
probably several million who will suffer
psychological consequences of the rest
of their lives yeah it's bad enough but
it could have been worse and the
Indochina was much worse and consider
the and in fact in Iraq though it's not
the way it's presented in the media but
if you think about it the United States
had to steadily back down from its war
aims the US government fought tooth and
nail to prevent elections
but they were forced to permit them they
saw had all kind of schemes to make it
you know turn it into let it be run by
proconsuls they're forced to accept
elections they tried to prevent the
elected government from moving in a
nationalistic direction they failed as
late as november two thousand seven just
two years ago the bush administration
announced its effectively announced its
worms they were crucial parts were that
the US would have to be a lot permitted
a permanent military presence of
unspecified scale in Iraq and that the
country should be open to investment
privileges US investors that's november
two thousand seven that's the bush
declaration which I think was reported
in the press but you can find it on the
internet which it was the the proposal
for the status of forces agreement well
they had to back down at least formally
at least formally there's no permanent
military presence formally there's the
haven't ram through the kind of
investment law they wanted that's pretty
significant incident is not giving up
obama we can go into that but before
that just compare it with the 60s i mean
in the 1960s there was so little protest
against the vietnam war that most people
don't even know when it was launched it
happens that in 1962 a john f kennedy
sent the US air force to start bombing
south vietnam authorized chemical
warfare to destroy crops and ground
cover I started authorized napalm
started programs which ultimately drove
millions of people into what were called
strategic Hamlet's basically
concentration camps to try to separate
them from the guerrillas who the
government knew they were willingly
supported
protest was virtually zero I mean I
remember giving talks to four people in
a church the minister the organizer
drunk who walked in off the street and
somebody wanted to kill me yeah and that
went on for years but that's why you and
I were involved in things called
teachings which is where I first they
started in 65 r IC 6 that's after years
of what and in fact the large-scale
protest which finally took place was
after about five years of war by then
South Vietnam been destroyed the war had
expanded the rest of Indochina and yet
they were effective but very late and in
the elite sectors you know the
articulate sectors like the media
commentary there was really never any
virtual II never any protest or was
protest on tactical grounds it was very
striking what happened by the city the
end of the war in 1975 formal into the
war the population about seventy percent
of the population regarded the war as
fundamentally wrong and immoral not a
mistake as the polls from roughly then
if you look at the liberal commentary in
the press say at the extreme end may be
anthony lewis in the new york times his
some he summed up the war by 75 by
saying the United States entered Vietnam
with blundering efforts to do good well
efforts to do good is a tautology our
state did it it's to do good blundering
with didn't quite work so we entered
with blundering efforts to do good but
by 1969 it was clear that the war was a
disaster too costly to ourselves that's
what you get reading pravda in 1985 you
know when the russians were in
Afghanistan but that was considered
sharp critique of the war meanwhile the
public was way off to the anti-war side
well let's fast forward to now in those
years we had conscription we
have the classrooms that you and I
taught in full of young men who were
having to make critical decisions about
what they were going to do whether to go
live in Sweden Canada not registered for
the draft resist or go in the military
55,000 United States military died some
400,000 were injured countless hundreds
of thousands of more came back with
psychological disabilities which they
suffered to this day here we are at this
time in kind of a perpetual militarized
situation in this country strike the
kind of in a perpetual militarized
situation in this country where the
Obama administration is now facing a
decision suppose it would be about
Afghanistan but the protest against that
such as it is is an intellectualized one
largely on the internet to some extent
in what's left to the left media we
don't have conscription it does not
reach down into every classroom and
every family and every neighborhood the
militarization of this country where
does reach down into is the economy but
nobody talks about that well you're
right but I but we have to ask why don't
we have a draft now well we know the
draft because the Army in the Pentagon
and the government realized that in
Vietnam they had made a tactical mistake
you cannot use a civilian army to carry
out a brutal colonial war our
predecessors didn't use citizens armies
so the French used the Foreign Legion
you know the British used the Gurkhas
are in an arable the Revolutionary War
the Hessians know there was a sprinkling
the officer corps might be civilian but
basically mercenary armies by the late
sixties the you know the top leadership
realize they had made a mistake I don't
really think it's because of the effect
of the draft at home I think that's
vastly exaggerated in fact the you know
I mean you were involved I was involved
the the kind of leading edge of the
anti-war movement
the resistance who was mostly led by
kids would never get drafted like
theology students or students the elite
universities they don't want to get
drafted they didn't have to they put
themselves on the line they faced
serious dangers many years in jail eggs
permanent exile it's not an easy
decision for a 18 year old kid they did
it it was very courageous it spread it
had a big effect but that can't be
recognized in the mainstream doctrine
it's dangerous to recognize that people
can take honorable courageous actions on
principal grounds you're supposed to go
as far as say Anthony Lewis a tactical
error cost us too much let's let's pull
out actually that's like Obama he's
considered a in the doctrinal system a
principled opponent of the Iraq war what
was his opposition he said it's a
strategic blunder again that's the same
kind of thing you could have read in
Pravda in 1985 and did read people who
said the invasion of Afghanistan was a
strategic blunder we don't call that
principled opposition I mean you could

is greater than it was in Vietnam at any

to when there were sixty thousand troops

almost Europe wouldn't even talked about
