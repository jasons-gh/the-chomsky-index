and occasionally in the United States I
mean kershel television is much less
constrained and public television public
television is more liberal and it's
therefore much more ideological and
imposes much narrower constraints they
don't allow deviants
that's pretty constant constant but yeah
they don't want I mean their interest to
have people talk about things like this
sometimes they're pressured and they'll
allow a couple of minutes you're in
there it's kind of interesting the way
it works mostly out except for
commercial cable television but a radio
is a little freer the National Public
Radio is considered the liberal you know
the kind of outer limits or the left in
the United States very small but it's
considered very dissident and they're
the ones with the sharpest restrictions
by far I mean they won't allow a
millimeter of deviation from the party
line but sometimes they are under
pressure to do it and it's interesting
the way it works so for example during
the first Gulf War I'm pretty well known
around Boston and that happens to be the
center the ideological Center for
National Public Radio it's their
flagship station no one sort of thing
and there's a lot of pressure there to
let me be on now and then so during the
first Gulf War they did approach me and
they told me I would be allowed to have
two and a half minutes
however they insisted that I write out
what I was going to say send it to the
central office so they could ensure that
it's you know okay
and once they proved it I had to read it
and they pre-recorded it to make sure
that I wouldn't add a phrase that wasn't
you know that went off the limit the
first time is kind of ridiculous but and
so did the staff staff mostly laughing
the engineers and so on but I did read
it and the first reading took two
minutes and 36 seconds so they told me I
gotta
and so I read it a little faster got it
2 minutes and 30 seconds and then they
actually did run it and there are other
things like that I'll just mention one
other case the same National Public
Radio again the kind of left meeting
they have a book review thing and again
they're under a lot of pressure often
through to have something about books of
mine around ten years ago there was a
book of mine that was based on lectures
over CBC and it was actually was a
best-seller in Canada for years but
nobody ever heard of it in the United
States and never reviewed or anything
but there was pressure around Boston to
get them to review that book okay so
they finally agreed and the we again had
a pre-recorded five-minute interview
with Robert Siegel who's their big shot
intellectual and it was it was actually
announced the their main program called
All Things Considered it starts at five
o'clock and you know every educated
person supposed to listen to it and at
five o'clock they announced that they
were gonna have a review of this book
and the publisher South End press called
me up and said great it's gonna be on it
got to 5:30 it got to 5:25 at 5:25 the
program stopped and there were five
minutes of music you know at 5:30 when
they move into the next segment
they now to the next segment and phone
calls started coming in from all over
the place saying you know what happened
to that five minute review and people
said I wasn't listening but people
started calling me say you know what
happened the review so after about ten
minutes I got a call from the manager of
the whole thing in Washington who said
you know there's something very strange
we're getting a lot of calls saying that
your review didn't appear but we know
that it did I see it right on my program
here so I said
don't know anything about it about ten
minutes later she called me back very
chagrin and she said that she was
overruled for the first time ever by the
some higher-up
who heard the announcement in the first
five minutes and cancelled well you know
that caused quite a furor she was very
upset you know for professional reasons
and one of the overruled and there was a
lot of public reaction so they finally
agreed to redo another five minutes
you know pre-recorded and that one
second one they actually ran well that's
off at the left-liberal end of the
spectrum when you move to the more
conservative commercial media they are
less constrained
