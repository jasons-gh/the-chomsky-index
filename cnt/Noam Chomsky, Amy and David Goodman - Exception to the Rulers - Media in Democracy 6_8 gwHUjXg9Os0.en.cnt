I mean it's occasionally mentioned in
the press when it's mentioned it's
called the politically impossible and
that's correct
the pharmaceutical corporations are
against it the insurance companies are
against it so it's politically
impossible just as it's politically
impossible for Americans to vote on
their preferences as to what should be
done in Iraq there's a name for that
it's a name that we use when we talk
about other countries it's called a
failed state you know a state that has
formal institutions it has formal
democratic institutions but they don't
function there are plenty of states like
that that we call failed States or you
know elective dictatorship or something
that kind and if independent media ought
to be pointing out to us that we're one
and as Amy said matters a lot in word of
the world if the United States is a
failed state then if you know Honduras
is a failed state for very obvious
reasons and democracy now is one of the
forces that's helping overcome that
Thank You Noam Chomsky you're listening
to Cambridge forum with Amy Goodman
David Goodman and Noam Chomsky
discussing the exception to the rulers
let me start the questions I'll start
with a question for Amy and David in the
exceptions exception to the rulers who
describe the mainstream news media and
you've certainly given examples tonight
as a well-oiled propaganda machine that
is repackaging government's spin and
passing it off as journalism yet just
yesterday you announced on Democracy Now
that Ted Koppel will devote his entire
edition of Nightline Friday to reading
the names of Americans killed in Iraq
and I happen to turn on CNN last night
and it did report a fairly substantial
story about a poll showing that 71% of
Iraqis consider our troops to be
occupiers not liberators one man said on
the air that Saddam Hussein and
President Bush should both be tried for
war crimes was an Iraqi
my question is isn't such reporting
something more than propaganda I think
the latest news on the Nightline story
which is very important that they're
going to read the names of dead US
servicemen Friday night is that Sinclair
broadcasting which owns many of the
affiliates that run Nightline is
threatening affiliates is is threatening
affiliates saying that they cannot run
the program tomorrow night so we'll see
what happens with that and I guess some
will not be running the program I think
that there are exceptions and I think as
I was saying before when there is a
difference between Democrats and
Republicans we see some difference in
the media I think overall you
occasionally see exceptions but now with
the Democrats in an election year and
because the situation in Iraq is
undeniable we get occasional good
reporting but I will say I'll take an
example no one referred to he just
mentioned Haiti that's another one of
these cases where when the Democrats
hardly speak out in Washington the the
media this just happened the last few
weeks slavishly follows the
administration line
February 29th even if you're extremely
observant and you follow the news you
may not realize that there was a
us-backed coup that took place in Haiti
yet again this is the oldest black
Republic in the world born of a slave
uprising it just celebrated its
Bicentennial and on February 29th
according to President aresty the
democratically elected leader
the second number two men in the US
Embassy went to the home of the our
steeds and told them that they could be
killed thousands of Haitians could die
if they don't leave the country that
this group of rebels was going to
overrun port-au-prince this is a small
group of thugs who were well known 10
years ago they and others engaged in a
coup against eros steed once again
backed by the United States my colleague
Ellen there and exposed in the Nation
magazine that the frappe the
paramilitary death squad with its leader
Manuel constant was on the payroll of
the US intelligence agencies that was
ten years ago now it's ten years later
the number two men in frappe show
delshaun blend is the one who's running
the show found guilty of murdering the
justice minister of Haiti in 93 and
leading Haitian American businessmen and
twenties movie and others this is not a
popular uprising it's a small group of
murderers who working with the u.s. were
able to force the aresty president
Aristide from power on February 29th no
one exactly knew what happened
Aristide said this guy came to the house
said that they would die thousands of
Haitians would die
Aristide said he asked to speak to the
press instead he was taken to a u.s.
plane put on it with dozens of US
military and security and sent off they
didn't know where they were going when
the arrestees tried to lift up the shade
they were told to put it down and they
ended up being dumped in the Central
African Republic or a Moute area of
Africa that has one plane out a week
hard to even make a telephone call we
were following the situation very
carefully
February 29th we didn't know what had
happened to the heiress deeds and the
March 1st Monday morning we got a call
from US Congress member Maxine Waters
and TransAfrica founder Randall Robinson
who said quick please take this to the
airwaves we've just heard from the air
Steve there in the Central African
Republic
we took this we put out the story put
out the transcript immediately reporters
in Washington questioned Rumsfeld at the
Pentagon said are these reports of
pacifica true he started to laugh they
said we asked
for an answer not a laugh and and he
said it was ridiculous I've learned I've
learned after many years of reporting
that when a politician tells you
something is ridiculous you're probably
on the right track and but the US media
CNN and others when US Congress member
Maxine Waters went on the air and said
this is what aresty had said that he was
the victim of a modern kidnapping in the
service of a coup d'etat backed by the
United States the reporters are saying
oh come on isn't this a stretch I mean
what are you trying to say here now
that's actually fine to say to anyone
what evidence do you have and what lead
you to believe this but did they say the
same thing to Rumsfeld when they
questioned him or Powell and Bush on
this issue anyway two weeks later or a
month later Congress member Maxine
Waters Randall Robinson a member of the
Jamaican Parliament decided to take u.s.
foreign policy into their own hands and
they flew they chartered a jet and they
flew to the Central African Republic I
got a chance to accompany them and
chronicle this trip along with Peter
Eisner of the Washington Post we travel
2/3 of the way around the world from
Miami to to st. Thomas to Dakar Senegal
to bangy Central African Republic
reported on the seven-hour high-stakes
negotiation with the dictator our state
said to me that night when the dictator
went away for a little while to consider
the proposal of releasing the heiress
deeds he said he's got to call the US
and France to get his marching orders
ultimately this small group of people
called the bluff of the most powerful
country on earth they said if you're
saying he's not a prisoner if he's a
free man then he could do what he wants
to as Margaret Mead said never doubt for
a moment that a small group of
thoughtful committed people can change
the world indeed it's the only thing
that ever has and they brought the arrow
steeds back to this hemisphere and as we
flew over the Atlantic we heard that
Condoleezza Rice Powell and Rumsfeld
were saying that the arrow steeds were
not to return to this hemisphere whose
hemisphere and then US ambassador James
Foley the ambassador to Haiti said the
eros teas were not to return to with an
hundred fifty miles of Haiti whose
country but aresty did end up in Jamaica
where he had been invited and during the
whole 9/11 Commission controversy with
Condoleezza Rice if you thought she was
all caught up with that whether or not
to speak under oath and in other words
whether or not to tell the truth she was
also very involved with putting pressure
once again on Jamaican Prime Minister PJ
Patterson to expel the heiress deeds
they want to control this country Haiti
the United States and they don't want
our Stede anywhere near it it's
absolutely critical we have I'm sorry to
interrupt you and I really do apologize
but I wanted to open it up to I'm sorry
good questions if I could
I I'm going to hold off on my second
question till the end so there's an
opportunity for the audience here you're
you're joining us at the Cambridge forum
discussing exception to the rulers the
floor is now open for audience questions
but time is short so please limit your
questions to one keep your comments
short and because there will be a good
number of people in line I'd also ask
the panelists if they could keep the
answer somewhat short in terms of the
questions hi I wanted to ask a question
Amy about the story regarding the
capture of Saddam Hussein that I
understand was reported on Democracy Now
that he had already been captured by the
Kurds and then there had been a
negotiating process by which he was put
in that foxhole and then miraculously
discovered by the US military
partly to say it hasn't been echoed I
don't think anywhere else and I'm just
curious about more about that story
maybe maybe no one can come and tend it
more than they had but we did there's no
way of verifying it
but yes it's been reported in the
European media and elsewhere could be
true that Kurdish soldiers were the
first to find him if there were
reporters on the scene they could tell
you I had a question for professor
Chomsky I was wondering that given that
the Democrats supported the war in Iraq
and according to carries vow at least
promised to stay the course of Iraq with
40,000 more troops given that even years
before the war the Democrats just like
you professor Chomsky supported UN
sanctions against Iraq which claimed the
lives of millions of children given that
even the most left-wing Democrats like
Maxine Waters for example that you had
raised and and also like you professor
Chomsky don't oppose this racist system
of capitalism outright but rather seek a
more rational and lightened form of
imperialism and given that the the
masters of the Democratic Party just
like the Republicans are the capitalists
why why why have you come come out and
lined up behind Carrie saying that small
differences between bush and Kerry can
lead to very different outcomes now I am
with the Sparta's League and unlike you
we fight for class struggle against
imperialism I'm sorry but working-class
party that will fight for socialist
revolution and if you care to find the
truth in a newspaper a working-class
perspective it takes a side with the
workers and tells the truth check out
workers Vanguard good idea first of all
all these things you said are given our
false and you can easily find that out
second everything you said that was
given is false secondly did I support
the sanctions I strongly opposed the
sanctions I'm sure I oppose them far
more strongly than you
you had your say anyone who wants to
find out can anyone who wants to check
can anyone who wants to check and find
out I was bitterly condemning the
sanctions the massacres and so on all
through the 90s you can find that out
very easily one point you said is
correct there is a what small
differences in a very powerful system
can have large outcomes if the Spartacus
League cared about working people poor
people people elsewhere in the world who
suffer and so on they would care about
the large outcomes that follow from
those small differences if you don't
care about what happens to those people
and you want to live in some abstract
seminar somewhere then you don't care
but it's a fact and we can't deny
I wanted to ask if if you guys knew
anything any history about direct action
against corporate media and for example
picketing live broadcasts any any kind
of action like that that maybe you could
give some information on quickly
