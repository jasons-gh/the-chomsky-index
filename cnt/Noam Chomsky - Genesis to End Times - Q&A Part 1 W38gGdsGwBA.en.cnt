and this look here for the overhead so
just a quick explanation of what we did
with the questions we compiled them and
obviously there was some repetition so
this morning Steve shalom and i would
kind of went through them and we pulled
out the repetition and we've organized
them and some kind of flow that made
sense and um slightly edited some just
to give some segue to others and whatnot
and we try to include just about
everything we might not get everything
of course but we've got the two rounds
the floor natural of session so we'll
see what happens and hope to the best
capture the questions that you have her
for no work yeah I just have to turn it
on though should get some audience is
working yeah yeah I'm got here yes first
thing is everything that Mike said was a
lot
unclear or so to begin with can you hear
me okay this is John okay to begin with
what is the left what kind of language
can we use to describe our movement and
positions that actually mean something
to us and others the left is the
movement that's in favor of old decent
thing freedom justice like that he's at
get here I can turn you look at you when
i holding okay
sorry I kind of been talking just back
from a couple of long trips and I
totally lost my voice so what's the left
we of course have to define it for
ourselves but traditionally it's the
movement that's been in favor of more
freedom or justice more quality more
participation more control over / lives
peace tracto peace and things that's the
way how can you present it to people
honestly just take issues take good one
is no point the formulating abstractions
anybody can say those words the Hitler
can say them we'd have to show as you
mean them by in a particular way and you
apply them to the problems that people
face and I know but the drive to pursue
those those objectives I think that's
what's always animatedly very profound
about it because switching to more some
current events the change that many
voters helped for would come in this
country winds rock obama was elected has
yet to happen what went wrong when wrong
was the hope it was never a reason for
you and you can't blame it if you read
his website or you listen to thee found
what limited thought that there was and
what he was saying he presented himself
as a normal centrist democrat not very
different from an international affairs
very different from Bush's second term a
very hawkish just nothing there I mean I
wrote about him before the election
before the primary isn't just using his
website it was perfectly transparent if
people wanted to be deluded they had the
choice of course but you know I don't
usually agree with sarah palin but when
she asks what's happened to that hopey
changey business she's exactly right
nothing happened that there was no
reason to expect anything to happen but
he he was a creature of the financial
institutions as they prefer him to
McCain is his the core of his funding
was financial institutions and law firms
which doesn't mean civil rights lawyers
it means lobbyists and they expected to
be paid back that's what American
politics works and they were paid back
with a huge bail out there Richard
better off than before and there's very
little in it to be surprising so the
question is why do you do I mean this
happen before there was history doesn't
repeat exactly but knowledge is close
enough to pay some attention to if you
go back to nineteen sixty jonath Kennedy
was collected with similar illusions a
lot of glitz glamour or candle out this
so on and so forth and
it did to elicit a lot of enthusiasm
among young people thought okay also
change after these sajida terrible
eisenhower years well it didn't take
long for Kennedy to for the allusions to
be shed by Kennedy's actions and what
was interesting was how people reacted
they didn't react by saying okay we give
up illusions are gone they reacted by
deep engagement and activism and that
led to the activist in the sixties which
had plenty of out births like this were
exam and many others and I think the
serious question now is how people who
were misleading Liga is were misled by
the illusions created around the Obama
presidency how they'll react two choices
react by saying well no hope let's give
up through our private lives or saying
okay we were misled now we're going to
really pursue the illusions that were
shattered that there were the right ones
and get another period of activism and
significant change but I think that's
really in the hands and people who
believe the who were caught up in the
way to the enthusiasm mistakenly but he
can make mistakes and you can look back
and say to it it'll gone from here do
you have any strategic advice on how to
on how the left can better organize the
legitimate popular grievances the right
so successfully preys upon
there are things that can be done it
depends who you are where you are like
I'm not going to organize steelworkers
I'm still work but in our own
communities we could do a lot of things
they range from its across the board it
just takes a health reform or it's very
serious issue all right let's let's
start with the deficit we're supposed to
be the propaganda today is we've got a
got this hideous deficit we have to
concentrate attention on getting rid of
it everything else has to go well first
of all didn't make a lot of sense
economically in a recession you want to
have a deficit when I was stimulus
that's a grow your way out of the
economic recession 17 million unemployed
get back to economic growth and overcome
the deficit but putting that aside
what's the deficit well if you listen to
NPR the deficit is social security and
medicare but that's only because the
rich and privileged have been trying for
years to get to destroy them social
story isn't it isn't in any kind of
trouble Medicare is in trouble but
because it's linked to the privatized
health system which is in serious
problem take a look at the deficit about
half of it is no Terry spending which is
going up under Obama in fact it's
reaching new heights but I nobody's
talking about cutting that so when
people talk about cutting the deficit
you know right away they're not series
whether the other half is pretty much
medical costs maybe not right now but
you project it will
little the growing medical costs in the
completely dysfunctional health care
system or we are going to overwhelm
federal budget at which would which is
not bad for the Peterson Institute than
NPR the right wing and so on because
they're just as happy to I have the
benefit systems cut the rituals go get
what they want we already have a health
system that essentially is rationed by
wealth if it gets it even more so you're
not going to getting complaints from
wealth and privilege of it here are two
issues that are easy to organize about
we have its true this deficit consular
as it is you could argue about but it's
there so let's writing wave with concern
about the deficit let's look at what it
comes from I mean do we have to spend as
much as the rest of the world combined
on the military force technologically
far more advanced hundreds of military
bases all over the world I don't think
anybody's calculated it but if you
simply looked at the costs of the
pre-positioned weapons around the world
and the Navy's that the US has scattered
around the world doing nothing just
getting ready in case there are needed
to use those preposition weapons for
aggression whoever may be anywhere in
the world just calculate those costs
that would be astronomical do we need
that is that good for us is good for the
world
a good for us to be working on advanced
drum techniques with using
nanotechnology this is on the darker
drawing words where you can get
miniaturized drones that can find their
way into a person's living room the
killings at a particular person that
they're under surveillance then all we
have to massive ones that carry out the
huge crimes is that so we need them and
is that what's good to the country or
the world and so on plenty of organized
on about that and none of that's being
discussed in that public arena take all
the talk about the deficit again I
happen to listen to NPR on the deficit
couple of weeks ago they had their talk
program that one talk program a week and
they had two experts both of them
deficit hawks their only suggestion for
dealing with the deficit was to cut
social security and medical benefits
that's from the so-called left now
worried about the military budget not a
word about why the health care costs are
going out of sight the health care
reform is opposed by Robert concerns of
the population would you take a look at
the polls a very large part of that
maybe she already discussed didn't go
far enough it gave everything away okay
you appeal to the people who who have
that position and explain to others that
they're supporting idea a health care
system but is about twice that per
capita costs of the rest of the world
industrial countries and has about the
worst outcomes for example he can bring
to light something that the press hasn't
covered in ants international report
setting maternal death around the world
mithun of childbirth the United States
of way at the top of the list I nates
five times his eyes Greece or something
like that that's just kind of a blandish
the same these in other studies
comparing comparative health costs and
found for example that in Cuba was a
poor country under attack for 50 years
by the world's greatest superpower the
health outcomes are about the same as
the u.s. expenses are five percent with
the u.s. expenses and the reason is that
it's focused on preventive care clinics
all over the place doctors once again
who say for eternity not only did you
give prenatal care but the doctor will
go visit the mother
okay that's everything this kind of
granite all right so for one twentieth
of cost I they get about the same
outcomes we did if one of these these
are these just these two issues the two
issues that are causing the huge deficit
that's a huge with the large deficit
military and health now those are should
be easy things to organize about and
they lean all kind of directions now if
you're if you're somewhere else if you
have to be living in Central Michigan
you can be organizing that quite
different things social example takes
the government now pretty much on as
much of the auto industry and it's
following the path of state corporate
system for the last 30 years a
transferring industrial production
abroad it's not closing down industrial
production it's just continuing the
process that actually began around here
you know centered the Industrial
Revolution and get cheaper labor worst
conditions in the south so we move there
that you go to the southwest and move
there okay recent years you go overseas
there you go to Mexico and China Vietnam
and so on so the production is still
there and the prophets are still here
the bank's like it
like it puts destroying the society only
when you close down an auto plant you're
destroying not only the workforce with
the community trainees are usually built
around the industrial plants but do they
have to be close well as many things
that are needed here in fact mentioned
is a couple of times when you've heard
me say it at the same time that Obama is
closing down GN plans he sent his
Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood
to Europe to get contracts using federal
stimulus money taxpayers money that
contracts with the mainland Spanish but
also other industrial firms in Europe to
build high-speed rail transport which we
badly need here which could be produced
in those clothes down in plants
yesterday I came back from Fox in New
York and took the train the fancy drink
and we sell a hyper expensive them it
happened have been in Germany Long Beach
works of the Train can't begin to
compare the money is selling he can sort
of read if you don't mind being bumped
around a lot but trying to write it
almost impossible that it my wife and I
took the train to New York the first
time in from 1950 that then was three
hours and 45 minutes but now they've got
it down to three hours three and a half
hour
if it was in Europe or Japan or
correctly at China on the city where the
probably an hour would be comfortable
and so on well you know all of that can
be built under that's it's not just an
accidental something that happened by
accident that's careful state corporate
planning to design a particular kind of
society that's highly wasteful and
fossil fuel that scatters people with
works ten cities and so on goes back to
the 1940s and it's led to a situation
that's pretty harmful for everybody
except the rich very rich and is it even
harms them they have to take these elit
to but you can go first class so you get
a chance somebody got me a ticket for
one so it took it it's exactly like
coach except that it's a caricature of
the late 19th century until the Coleman
trains so there's a black quarter who
there's a white jacket polite box you on
board there's a black made a pun see
puts a paper cloth under they will
associate something or other other than
that slightly it's like my coach but
here's a kind of obvious but what's the
obvious strategy in this case well the
obvious strategy is for working people
to take over the factories and take them
over run them manage and produce the
high speed rail equipment or whatever
else is needed and badly needed in
society it's not such a radical step
that's the kind of thing that's just
below the surface in America
mr. on for example you back the 1930s
lead the major New Deal reforms were
instituted when the business classes
were really got frightened and they got
frightened by sit-down strikes sit-down
strikes are just one thought of a way
from taking over the factory and ruin
himself and kicking out the bosses and I
was scary so changes came pretty much
like what's happening China now in China
with working conditions are totally
miserable and wages have been declining
relative to GDP for the last couple of
years there's now a wave with strikes as
inventory on the front pages in the
foreign on planets most of the high
technology and advanced production at
China's far gone to China itself is
mostly an assembly plant but the but the
stripes of the first with a lot of
suicides in the plants that let strikes
and now the Taiwanese and Japanese
honors are being compelled to improve
working conditions and wages and if it
goes beyond that to take over the plants
then it really gets scared you get to
large scale measures like the new tool
measures well you know all of that is
possible strategy in fact even tactic
but not for me
working in Detroit but for people who
are in any similar the egg trivia
starbucks store anyone who's in that
environment gala plenty things you do
and for the rest of us will speak what
you need say there's its large-scale
issues and everything bigger ones of
that we are after all facing two crises
which literally have to do with survival
of species one of those nuclear weapons
the problem is getting worse another has
to do with the destruction of the
environment which is very serious and
just going to get a lot of worse it's
fun to do about that and there's plenty
of organizing possibilities so takes a
just keep to the front page it always
gives you opportunity or right now is a
big a lot of concern about BP and the
Gulf number of things to say about that
but one thing is that bad as this
catastrophe is it's not so substantial
like global standards what goes on in
the Niger Delta night Nigeria's and
comfortably use as we learned on for
decades but i canno oil companies just
destroying the place huge oil spills for
their black people are getting killed so
prepared them you make the newspapers in
fact what's going on in Ecuador then
Amazonia is worse than this with the oil
spills that are destroying parts of
campus
the indigenous communities I mean now
it's hit here for the wealthy people so
of course it makes the front pages but
that gives an opening for lots of
discussions and what's happening right
here is a substantial part traceable to
the collapse of the regulatory apparatus
under the mid liberal fanaticism of the
last generation which is pretty much the
same as what led to the financial crisis
there weren't any financial crisis from
the 1930s until the 1970s because the
regulatory system was in place and the
financial system is more or less
regulated but with the explosion of
finance of the elimination of regulation
they get defeated crisis getting worse
worse without being building up to the
next one and the same is true of the
environmental crisis welcome of all of
these things are there's so many things
that you can organize about that it's
kind of almost pointless to mention them
just stick a pin at grantham and almost
anything in people's lives and there's
an issue there that requires work it can
be a simple issue so a lot of organizing
starts with things like safe dating
people who are neighborhood together to
get the City Council to put a traffic
light on a street where kids of the go
to school and if people can achieve that
they can learn that you can achieve
something then they go into the next
thing and their groups that do it and do
it pretty well that right here in Boston
just to show you how atomize the society
it's a taint know anything about it
though it have been living here most of
my life there's a very good group in
downtown Los fergana by which has been
doing things exactly like this very
successfully for I think about 35 years
in poor neighborhoods mostly immigrant
neighborhoods they meet in place called
English High School which is called that
because nobody in sight speaks English
anything but that but there have to go
to a meeting listen to the things that
doing is very aggressive and it does go
from simple things like let's get a
traffic light to empowerment to looking
for bigger things like what's this on
both schools problems and those are
things you can already notice about and
that's the mission of the way define
considering the general exploitation of
homophobia by the right how can we as
activists leftist or generally conscious
citizens advocate for lesbian gay bi and
transsexual fear people in America and
abroad just the way we it's been to be
it's been done for a couple of decades
now I'm pretty successfully shad me
striking changes in the last year's who
should pay attention to them subject
good not just in the United States but
worldwide ticket dramatic case one of
the greatest mathematicians of the 20th
century that Alan Turing who's famous
for having developed a lot of
mathematical theories of that did my
computations own I'd also happen to be
one of people saved England during the
Second World War he was in the lead and
monthly meth addiction to crack the
German codes there's a major figure
angler he was murdered by written in
early 1950s it was no sexual they
regarded it as a disease then he was
subjected to some serious kind of
treatment which killed in wreck passing
doesn't happen anymore ok that's pretty
significant then
how did it happen well we all know how
yeah by education by organizing activism
has to be done in a way which doesn't
frighten people and appeal to the
working on sort of them he listed their
worst emotions and reaction so you don't
wanna kind of reasonably thought from
people be your attacks on their values
you have to make them help them come to
understand that their values and blue
tolerance and acceptance and hard work
no special strategies over just to keep
at it and mix changes it's very
substantial changes in all through the
large part of the world rip their own
lifetimes what forms of resistance can
help us stop the racism an
anti-immigrant sentiment that seems to
be growing well first we have to
understand it the people who were the
anti-immigrant sentiment is
extraordinary take a look at the
elections yesterday and in Europe the in
holland which has been a very tolerant
society for hundreds of years back in
the 17th century people from france
enabled were fleeing I long to say some
sort of freedom them in Holland babe it
was a very high vote for extreme
right-wing pemmican race of standing
Muslim racist whose real name not see
his programs
khalsa-ji call us I think of a raghead
tax or something like that for women who
wear veils if their rag tax things like
when a really vile racist addict Muslim
the sentiment and he's got a lot a lot
of support in England just yesterday the
new Conservative government passed a law
interest law that requires that the
spouse an immigrant spouse can be
admitted to England only if he or she's
the exam lished unbelievably civilized
country aside from the idiots place to
learn English as in England sound
language school Africa some kids but
partially idiocy the racism is extreme
but it's very strong here that tenant
that kind of understandable my people
have the feeling but they you know are
taking her any away from us I mean we
work for the Christians or white who
worked hard to achieve what we've had
and now they are taking it all away from
us who are they will
illegal immigrants just like in Germany
in the late 20s and early 30s the Jews
and the Bolsheviks are taking it away
from us so we've got to do something
about it turned out very pretty but the
feelings are genuine and the feelings
have to be dealt with and have to be
dealt with by partially partly just
explaining the facts are not sure why I
wire immigrants coming from Africa to
Europe instead of on the other way
around why are they coming from Mexico
and Guatemala instead of people here
going there actually people here do go
there namely rich people who buy land
and Costa Rica to retire but apart from
that why is the wave of immigration in
south to north when people don't
understand that because the sources of
that have also harmed them welcome the
fact that they've been involved in
criminal acts which they should also
understand so it takes AV integration
from Mexico and Central America to the
United States what's the source of it
well from Central America the sources
Reagan stairs towards tour the country's
to shreds some books it's like the Mayan
areas in Guatemala it was literal
genocide in the 1980s in fact they're
kind of unseen because undocumented
aliens trying to keep quiet or they may
clean your homes and
to the construction work and so on but
try to keep them visible but right
around the lesson northeast across and
go through Rhode Island is pre big Mayan
community people just fled from the
virtual genocide of the Guatemalan
Highlands at the u.s. escorting in the
1980s something people should have done
but it's not just these people coming
here because the kind of steel furnace
we destroyed their limits that we reach
longer okay the remnants are trying to
get away from Latin America multiple
together said the horrible history for
aggression violence to source it's one
is Western imperialism last century it's
mostly us or the other is their own
elites mostly European eyes white
leagues which are vicious brutal and
savage and between those two hammers
they've been crushed and the countries
are now the report if you look at how
the did little better now but a large
part of their improvement that was just
coming from remittances in fact
remittances to Latin America learn about
the level of the farmer there more than
to our aid and about the level of
foreign direct investment they survive
on that basis well it again the result
of histories of centuries of violence
and oppression the start of Mexico into
pretty striking case
I just read the paper this morning
coming down here that yesterday a
fifteen-year-old boy was murdered by a
US border patrol agent in Mexico thrust
over New Mexico killed this
fifteen-year-old kid and it ended up
with the Mexican army in the US were
patrolling aiming rifles at each other
we're with but it's her in brutal even
apart that people who were trying to
cross but I happen to know somebody just
personal open the details that the woman
was just gave birth to a baby couple of
weeks ago she in the last year she's
mine yeah fleeing from the Mayan areas
she crossed the border eight times in
the last year the Muslim period when
she's pregnant never had any prenatal
care anything like cross and she was
caught and sent back the eighth time she
finally made it thanks to the work of
very courageous and solidarity workers
in Arizona mostly young people who leave
bottles of water in the desert they can
people can get through the 30-month
desert that they have to go through
which is rivers experience if they
survive it in our cut by the border
police the solidarity activists help
them get out of the area and so on so
she made it on her extra
just our baby but wire CMG mind a little
more Mexican aware the Mexicans coming
soon something called NAFTA which was
established in 1994 by the liberals it
was ran through over the opposition of
the American public and the Mexicans and
the Canadians the media the wirral term
ative programs proposed by the labor
movement Congress's Research Bureau and
so on Olivia winning report in his long
story but Clinton managed to ram through
the executive versions NAFTA if you look
at the background it's pretty clear what
it was about the go into that in a
minute if you're interested but the
point is that when NAFTA was established
it was understood that it's not a
destroyed Mexican agriculture in Mexican
business Mexican agriculture cannot
compete with the u.s. agribusiness which
is is massively state-subsidized thanks
in large part to break the free market
cook was redder than being really huge
subsidies to agribusiness and begin
Mexican corn farmers and so on are
probably it will compete with it so of
course if they're forced to accept
imports from highly subsidized us
agribusiness on our way about the
agricultural system but the Mexican
businesses can't compete with us
multinationals also massively government
subsidized quite apart from scale which
have to get national treatment in Mexico
to be treated like Mexican businesses
under NAFTA so of course it's going to
devastate the next to the economy and
people are going to flee we're really
going to sleep
guatemala so they're gonna flee to the
United States so what do you do about it
while Clinton understood exactly what to
do about it the border between Mexico
and the United States had been a pretty
open border it was established of course
by conquest and pretty much the same
people have done both sides people
across the border and as if they're
cousins or party or something like them
in 1994 the same year NAFTA was passed
that Clinton initiated the
militarization of the border operation
gatekeeper why anybody could see that
the impact of NAFTA which is going to be
harmful to American workers to as it was
is also going to lead to a flow of
immigrants so you've got to stop by
force they get yesterday when a border
guard kills a kid in Mexico or the young
woman I was talking about who managed
somehow make it eight times and have a
defined well that's that's the immigrant
issue these are the bases bases in fact
fact that matters the immigrants
contribute to the American economy but
when an immigrant comes in it leads to
economic growth for one thing they they
do they treat it horrible other you know
they're all over the place that we own
dirty work a lot of dirty work in
society whether it's clean homes or
cutting
construction work or whatever and doing
it horrible wages and working conditions
they can't complain about it this these
reasons they're undocumented so they're
easily exploitable but they they send
back remittances but they also spend
mine that leads to business is
developing economic growth and so on so
their net effect just from pure economic
way it was beneficial to the economy and
even to the people is that some really
big threatening jobs they're taking jobs
that Merton workers don't want to take
they don't want to work under those
conditions rightly about but this is a
whole home massive issues that have to
be discussed to deal with the
anti-immigrant hysteria but it has to
begin by recognizing that does have
legitimate roots people feel threatened
seriously threatened their way of life
is being taken away from them it's just
not being taken away from them by
immigrants being taken away from them by
goldman sachs executives and they can
understand that that takes the work
that's what organizing spell taking the
legitimate grievances that people have
recognizing their legitimacy assay mr. o
masovian recognize the legitimacy and
come to terms with it get people that
know people try to understand what the
sources and causes are and what it
reveals about themselves
their own we're on internal problems
that they would face but also what it
reveals about the society in which they
live and the propaganda to which their
it being subjected that's the work of
leftist organized but the problem series
it's not the United States world one
Europe it happens to be Muslims and
Africans but in the United States its
people coming from the wreckage we've
created in Latin America and all of
those are things that we seriously
confronted with sympathetically but
without giving an inch on the real
issues it's currently 12 something we'll
just ask one more question and then we
can take the break for lunch and come
back and continue afterwards ask me
later about the backgrounds of the
Mexico things kind of interested give
effort if you're in the press the
shifting focus is somewhat given that
great britain was always able to rule
some of its colonies with minimal
presence on the ground in terms of
colonial staff what are the prospects
for Iraqi sovereignty should we expect
indirect rule in Iraq depends on two
factors primarily Iraqis and secondarily
us
what happened in Iraq is extremely
interesting the more time later I'd like
to talk about it but I think what
happened in Iraq is that the United
States was actually defeated and unusual
for example in Vietnam which was called
as the feet i think was actually a
victory when you look at the actual
warnings but iraq if you look at the war
aims was defeat series defeat and the
main factor in it was nonviolent
resistance the US was able to kill
insurgents really good at killing people
got a massive murder machine but they
could not deal with the hundreds of
thousands of people in the streets
demanding elections the u.s. tried in
every way to block the contrary to the
headlines the US was desperately trying
to prevent any form of democracy in Iraq
that they couldn't block it step by step
the US had to back off finally he had
again really have to search that the
data but they're important it's
important I'm as late as
