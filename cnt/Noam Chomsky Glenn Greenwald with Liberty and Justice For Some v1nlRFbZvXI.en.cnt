former constitutional rights lawyer
Glenn Greenwald contends that the United
States has a two-tiered judicial system
one for the haves and one for the
have-nots this is a little over an hour
so thank you thank you very much and on
behalf of Russell Chomsky thank you for
that very warm reception thanks very
much for for coming this afternoon and
and particular thanks to Professor
Chomsky it is indescribably gratifying
to be able to write a book and then
attend an event to talk about it with
the nation's bravest and most
accomplished public intellectual and
political activists so I'm particularly
grateful to Professor Chomsky for being
here I just want to begin by making a
couple of points that I think will frame
the discussion that we're gonna have
nicely and I'm not sure what that
discussion will be because we haven't
talked about it on purpose but there are
a couple points that I anticipate will
help to highlight that I think I'd like
to just briefly describe so the book
really makes the argument that the rule
of law as we've always understood it has
been radically degraded in a way that
wasn't previously true and the
interesting thing about the rule of law
is that it's a term that has a pretty
clear meaning by consensus it's not a
particularly complex term it essentially
means nothing more than the fact that in
a society we are all bound on equal
terms by a common set of rules and you
can look to contemporary legal scholars
who define it that way you can look more
interestingly to the 1980s in the 1990s
when Western institutions like the IMF
and the World Bank began demanding that
lending country or countries that
received lending comported with the rule
of law and there were lots of lectures
issued about what they were required to
do in order to comport with the rule of
law and there was a seminal Journal
article by Thomas Carruthers in foreign
affairs that warned that countries that
don't live under the rule of law in
those countries elites can use their
superior financial power to call out
political institutions and that the
critical requirement to live under the
rule of law is that
political and financial lead cease
placing themselves above the rule of law
and are subjected to it on equal terms
to everyone else and you go back to the
founders and as much as disagreement as
they had what you continuously find is
this emphasis not ancillary or secondary
but really central at the American
Founding in order to be legitimate and
just had to venerate the rule of law and
this was true despite the fact that
founders almost across the board
believed in the inevitability and even
desirability and virtue of vast levels
of inequality in all sorts of realms and
yet they continuously emphasized that
the only way that that inequality would
be legitimate and just is if everyone
were equal before the law now you know
any time you make the argument or point
out that the rule of law and equality
before the law was important in the
founding you'll be met with the
objection which is obviously an accurate
one as far as it goes so I don't think
it goes very far that the founders
violently breached those principles in
all sorts of ways and that the country
did as well and that this concept of
equality under law has never been the
predominant theme to describe American
political reality and although that is
true um the reason I don't think it goes
very far is because the important part
of that writing and and and that history
is that that principle has always been
affirmed as being central even at the
time that we violated it radically and
the reason that's important is because
if you affirm a principal and deviate
from it and in in your actions there's
an obvious aspect to your behavior that
is hypocritical but if the affirmation
is sincere and ringing and consistent
then those principles even though you're
not comporting with them become
aspirational they become guides to what
progress means how it's understood and
how its achieved so even though the
founders violated that principle in all
sorts of ways the fact that they
continuously enshrined it and it was
affirmed continuously throughout the
next two centuries meant that most of
the events that we consider to be
progress in American history were driven
by
the reverence for this concept that were
all equal under the law that equality
under the law is how we determine if
we're perfecting the Union and there's a
real value in affirming principles even
if they're not perfectly applied and
what I think is radically different
about today is not that the rule of law
suddenly is is not being applied
faithfully because that's always been
true what's different about today
radically is that we no longer even
bother to affirm that principle we pay
lip service to the phrase the rule of
law but there's in terms of the
substance of what it requires you can
often and I would say more often than
not and leading opinion making elite
circles find an express pronouncement or
repudiation of that principle so you
begin with the Ford pardon of Nixon
continuing through the shielding of
iran-contra criminals into the Obama
administration's decision to shield all
bush crimes of torture and illegal
warrantless eavesdropping obstruction of
justice the aggressive attack on Iraq
the decision now not to prosecute Wall
Street criminals for precipitating the
2008 crisis with systemic financial
fraud all of these acts entail very
aggressive and explicit arguments that
the most powerful political and
financial elites in our society should
not be an are not subject to the rule of
law because it's too disruptive it's too
divisive it's more important that we
look forward that we find ways to avoid
repeating the problem and so you really
see constant arguments and you did for
example during the debate over whether
or not the telecom industry should be
retro actively immunized for its role in
the illegal eavesdropping program that
the rule of law is really not that
important of a value any longer Jerry
Ford when he addressed the nation and
tried to convince it to accept the
pardon said of course I believe in the
rule of law the idea that the law is no
respecter of persons but and this was
the amendment that was concocted for
that episode the law is also a respecter
of reality meaning that if it's too
direct just disruptive or divisive that
it's actually in our common good not the
elite criminals but in our common good
to exempt the most powerful from the
consequences of their criminal acts and
that has really become the 10
plate used in each of these instances
and that I think radically is different
than how things were in the past the
other point I want to make just to begin
well but I'll turn the floor over to
Professor Chomsky is that the other
difference is that if we had a society
that just decided that we were going to
be very lenient and forgiving and
merciful
when people committed crimes as I just
described we do for elites you could
have debates about whether that was an
advisable policy or approach to
criminality about whether or not that
would be produced good results or not
but if it were a quite applied across
the board at the very least it wouldn't
implicate rule of law issues there are
countries that take very lenient
approaches to criminal justice and if we
were a country that applied that same
leniency to ordinary Americans as we
apply to elites then there wouldn't be
an issue with the rule of law so for
example if you went and broke into
someone's house and and and and bash the
owner in the head with with a baseball
bat and stole their valuable belongings
and a week later or two months later got
caught by the police and you said look
officer you got me I did what you think
I did but I isn't it more important that
we could look to the future why but why
focus on the past if that were something
that worked for you or for people who
sold drugs on street corners and the
like then there wouldn't be a rule of
law issue but the fact that that applies
only to to political and financial
elites and not to ordinary Americans as
the reason why there's a rule of law
problem at the very same time that we've
created this template of elite immunity
we over the past four decades we have in
the name of law and order and
tough-on-crime built the world's largest
and most sprawling prison state one of
its harshest and most merciless systems
of punishment for ordinary Americans and
the irony that Richard Nixon was the one
who received this pardon when in the
1960s he rejuvenated his political
career by becoming the law and order of
candidate following taking up the mantle
of Barry Goldwater running against the
disruption on the rest of the 1960's
demanding harsh sentences lesser parole
lesser opportunity for released from
prison the drug war was really
accelerated first under him the fact
that he built his political
career based on this harsh law-and-order
mentality and then suddenly when he got
caught committing crimes was completely
shielded from leo consequent is really
the personification of this two-tiered
justice system that I'm writing about
and then of course the war on terror has
brought all new tears of justice where
people accused of terrorism just accused
can have every right deprived from them
including the right to life without any
sort of legal rights or legal process of
any kind it's really a new class a
password there's not even a pretense of
due process it's a persona non-grata
a sub person class where the government
can do anything without any legal
constraints at all and it's this
contrast between the shielding and
immunity that we've vested in the elite
class or more accurately that they've
vested in themselves versus the
extraordinarily unprecedented arsh and
merciless punishment system imposed on
everyone else that is the real menace to
the rule of law and that I think is the
most responsible factor for the loss of
faith in our political institutions and
the widespread accurate belief that you
see motivating the Occupy movement and
other widespread citizen rage that our
political institutions have lost all
remnants of legitimacy and can no longer
be used to effectuate change so I think
it's one of the most menacing problems
and also one of the most consequential
well let me just pick up on Glenn's last
comments and say a few things about the
rule of law happens that last night I
was reading the current journal the
current edition of the journal that went
the main journal of the American Society
for his historical historical relations
the diplomatic history and there happens
to be devoted that several articles are
devoted to the Nuremberg Tribunal and to
what it means and how it developed and
so on and the lead article points out
that one of the most honorable and
admired elements of the American
historical tradition the legal tradition
is the principle of presumption of
innocence that is a person is presumed
innocent - suspect is presumed innocent
until brought to a fair trial and
convicted with proper procedural
guarantees
that's the proudest achievement of the
American legal and ethical tradition and
of course it was recognized at Nuremberg
the British wanted just killed the Nazi
were criminals but justice Jackson the
u.s. chief prosecutor insisted that even
though these people are maybe you know
the worst criminals in history they
should be brought to trial subjected to
a fair trial
the condemned if they were proven guilty
and furthermore he added that we're
[Music]
giving these defendants a poisoned
chalice and if we ever sit from it
meaning if we ever do the things that
they're accused of that we must suffer
the same consequences otherwise these
proceedings are a complete farce the
core element of the proceedings the main
crime for which the Nazi criminals were
condemned and hanged was what was called
in the tribunal the supreme
international crime namely aggression
pretty clearly defined which they said
is tribunal said is the worst of all war
crimes because it encompasses all the
evil that follows
well I won't run through the way that's
been we've applied that to ourselves but
that point is correct presumption of
innocence is a very deeply rooted
principle not of American law but of
anglo-american law or it used to be that
by now it's simply totally dismissed and
with phrase so for example when of
someone bin Laden was the prime suspect
for 9/11 plausibly though in fact in
fact of the matter is the government has
yet to provide the kind of evidence that
would hold up in a credible court and is
even more or less conceded it doesn't
have it but undoubtedly he's the prime
suspect a couple of months ago Obama
invaded another country
commandos apprehended him and murdered
and tossed his body into the ocean
without autopsy and this was praised
this was praised as a great achievement
it's a great achievement of the Obama
administration a couple months later the
concept was extended in a manner that
Glenn talks about in his book which is a
terrific book I should say that's the
case of Anwar al Awlaki Allah Allah key
an American citizen a cleric who was
accused not of committing them there was
some talk about involvement in crimes
but no evidence was presented the main
charge against him was he was a fluent
speaker of English and he was
transmitting he was presented giving
offering support for jihadi operations
he was killed a couple of weeks ago and
the general reaction was illustrated
adequately in a New York Times headline
which said West celebrates death of
radical cleric well it wasn't as death
it was murder along with another
American citizen of Abdul veneering and
while it's true that the and there were
some who didn't join in the celebration
completely almost all of them criticized
it because he was an American citizen
which makes him a person in theory as
distinct from non-citizens who may look
like persons but aren't that's
incidentally a core principle of current
American law with regard to undocumented
aliens interesting interpretation of the
14th amendment but so he was an actual
person and maybe we're not supposed to
murder such people suspected of inciting
others who carry out terrorist acts now
again there were some critics and the
response who went beyond that and said
we should believe in the principle of
presumption of innocence and the
reaction to that I'm actually I was one
was quite interesting most of it was the
usual shrieking which you can disregard
but some of it was interesting and in
fact the most interesting I thought
was a column by a well-known respected
left liberal commentator matthew
Yglesias who wrote that it is as he put
it amazingly naive to criticize the
United States for violation of
international law or other crimes
because the International the
International order is established
precisely in order to legitimate the use
of violence by the west and by the West
he doesn't mean Norway he means by the
United States so that's the nature of
the international order it's set up to
legitimate our criminal resort to
violence and therefore it's amazingly
naive to raise criticisms about this
incidentally this is not said in
criticism he's praising it he goes on to
say it's silly even to raise these
questions that happens to be directed
for me and I'm happy to accept guilt for
that on that charge but and if you look
beyond and ask just what does it mean to
be a non person say a terror have
accused of terrorism well it was a
striking example and Linton's book as he
points out the first child soldier in
American history to be brought to trial
for crimes and that was worth looking at
that's owner Hodder there's a 15 year
old boy who was apprehended in
Afghanistan and the charge against him
is that when American soldiers were
invading Afghanistan and attacking his
village he picked up the gun to defend
his village so that makes him a
terrorist a non-person and interesting
concept of terrorism and he was then
first sent about grom secret prison in
Afghanistan
and then sent off to Guantanamo eight
years in prison
no charges after eight years in prison
he was going to be brought the truck
what's called a trial before a military
commission we have to talk about that
but he pleaded guilty and a plea bargain
and was given an 8-year sentence in
addition to the eight years he spent
without charges we all know what it
means to plead guilty in a plea bargain
after eight years and a in torture
chambers he actually is a Canadian
citizen and Canada could extradited but
they are courageously refusing to step
on the toes of the master the concept of
terror and presumption of innocence is
don't find how it's so far gone that
nobody even bothers to discuss it it's
not maybe it was once an ancient
tradition but not for us and Glen is
quite right that the fact that it's been
violated in the past doesn't change the
fact that by now we've changed the
principle we've abandoned even the
principle I abandon it but forcefully
rejected it even to the extent of saying
the International order is established
precisely to legitimate our violation of
elementary legal and moral principles
well it goes beyond one of them if one
last example the one of them must in
there was an article recently by a law
professor who in fact Lynn cites couple
times of the book that Jonathan Turley
who argues that Obama may be at breaking
the record for a u.s. president for
violation of civil rights and the law
and you can make a case one example
which actually involves the former dean
of the Harvard Law School
happens to be Obama's latest Supreme
Court of appointee of Melania Kagan she
argued a case brought by the Justice
Department against a group called the
humanitarian law project holder the
humanitarian law project with the
support of the far-right justices Obama
won that case the charges is one that
might implicate plenty of people here it
the charges they provided material
assistance to a group that's on the
terrorist list the material assistance
in this case was legal advice to the PKK
a group that's on the Turkish groups on
Kurdish groups on the US terrorist list
which means that they expanded the
concept of material assistance from say
you know providing guns or something
like that
to providing the legal advice and even
advice to turn to nonviolent means
that's now a criminal under US law
thanks to President Obama and it extends
very broadly in fact shortly after this
Supreme Court decision dozens of FBI
agents raided homes in Chicago and other
cities destroyed documents a usual thing
when a couple dozen FBI agents raid your
home the charge was they're trying to
find evidence that the people they were
and finally indicted with a grand jury
or supporting a Palestinian group and a
Colombian group the FLP and FARC well
maybe they are maybe they aren't but the
idea that expressing support for groups
on the terrorist list is a crime is
material assistance
that's novel and the Justice Department
physician was explained by Kagan that if
you provide legal advice to a terrorist
group say advising them to refrain from
terror and pursue nonviolent means
you're legitimizing them and freeing up
their resources to carry out terrorist
acts we'll just think how broadly that
can apply as in these cases which are in
fact underway and a final comment which
has to do with the notion of the
terrorist list that's accepted in the
United States as a legitimate category
why is it a legitimate category how is
the terrorist list established it's
established by executive Fiat I don't
have to give any justification for it
those on the terrorist list can't say I
don't belong there this is just a
decision by the executive that I don't
like you and we're gonna prosecute we're
gonna kill you and prosecute anyone
now who advises you not to pursue terror
and then you look back at the history of
the terrorist list it's very striking I
mean one in person who was just removed
from it two years ago is Nelson Mandela
the reason is that the African National
Congress was characterized by the Reagan
administration in 1988 right near the
end of apartheid as one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
therefore the US was entitled to support
apartheid South Africa as it did not
only in its atrocities internally but in
its attacks on neighboring countries
which apparently killed about a million
and a half people but that's all okay
it's part of the war on terror that in
fact Reagan had declared and we have to
defend the apartheid regime against one
of the more notorious terrorist groups
in the world including Nelson Mandela by
today's standards older versus
humanitarian law project almost anyone
who wasn't
an anti-apartheid activity could be
regarded as a terrorist giving material
support for terrorism as I said Mandela
was just removed from the tip from the
terrorist list two years ago he can now
come to the United States without
special dispensation there are other
equally dramatic cases take 1982 there
was a state that had been on the
terrorist list Saddam Hussein's Iraq but
the Reagan administration wanted to
provide aid and assistance to Saddam so
therefore they removed
Iraq from the terrorists list and
proceeded to provide aid and assistance
right through his worst crimes denying
the crimes and in fact rather strikingly
when Saddam was tried it was for crimes
that he committed in 1982 by his
standards pretty minor crimes excluding
the major crimes I presumed because
those were all supported by the United
States and in fact even denied by the
Reagan administration well there was a
gap in the terrorists list because Iraq
was removed had to be filled so it was
filled by Cuba Cuba was added to the
terrorist list partly in order to give
some justification for outlandish claims
about why we were entitled to support
murderous terrorist regimes in Central
America which left a couple hundred
thousand corpses much worse thanks to
our involvement and you had that so the
argument was well they're being
supported by Cuba so it must be a
terrorist state fabrication but that
doesn't matter in these cases however
Cuba was a pretty good choice in the
preceding years the Cuba had been the
target of a more international terrorism
than probably the rest of the world
combined
a lot of it coming from right here so
therefore Cuba went into the terrorists
list and Saddam was taken off so we
could support his major crimes which
were coming
well these oughta we ought to think
about why we even tolerate the concept
of a terrorist list and it's just not
questioned the government says someone's
on a terrorist list period end of
discussion
and now if you give say legal advice or
other advice to somebody that they so
designate you're a criminal and if
you're a 15 year old child who's picking
allegedly picking up a gun to defend the
village that's under attack by US
soldiers you sent off for 16 years of
prison torture and so on if that's what
the rule of law has come to it's a sad
situation we wanna do we have a few
minutes and to start before we we get to
the questionnaires I want to make sure
to leave a substantial time but
unsurprisingly what we just heard has
provoked a lot of thoughts that that I
want to make because I think so many
seen points were just raised so one of
the interesting aspects of this two-tier
justice system and the idea that elites
can impose standards on everyone else
that they from which they exempt
themselves it's something that is
obviously mirrored in the context of
Foreign Relations and I think probably
was even pioneered there this idea that
the United States imposes standards on
everybody else and exempts itself is
really the template that then got
imported domestically and one of the
fascinating things to do is to go and
look at what current political leaders
say about things like war crimes
investigations and accountability when
they're in other countries doling out
sermons and lectures about what those
other countries should do so for example
President Obama who promulgated and
gifted us all with the slogan that we as
good citizens should look forward and
not backward in order to justify
shielding bush-era crimes from
accountability gave an interview last
year on television in in Indonesia and
the Obama administration has been
pushing the Indonesian government
to prosecute certain work criminals whom
the United States has long disliked and
what he told the Indonesians was it is
impossible to move forward into a
prosperous future until you've resolved
the past and Secretary of State Clinton
has visited both Kenya and Cambodia
where the United States is similarly
urging work crimes investigations to
proceed and has told them the same thing
essentially that you cannot be among the
nation the the community of decent
nations while you continue to harbor and
shield war criminals from accountability
and I think that time that she visited
Kenya and said that was the time that
George Bush's book was released and he
was on every major television station
being heralded as a great statesman and
of course if you read and I would really
recommend that you do I did this because
I heard professor Chomsky many years ago
talked about it and went and read at the
opening and closing statements by Robert
Jackson that the Nuremberg tribunals
it's incredibly enlightening because
that was supposed to be the expression
of modern justice and not only did
Jackson point out that aggressive war
was the kingpin crime the crime above
all others but he also said that the
Nuremberg tribunals would have value
only if they were applied not only to
the defendants in the dock but also to
all the nations here assembled meaning
the United States and its allies and yet
if you were to cite that and argue that
that meant that George Bush and Dick
Cheney and Don Rumsfeld should be
prosecuted as war criminals for the
aggressive attack on Iraq you could
almost nothing you could do that's more
self marginalizing than that even people
sympathetic to the idea that they should
be investigated criminally for the
torture regime or for a warrantless
eavesdropping somewhat recoil at the
idea that they should be held criminally
accountable for the at least 100,000
dead innocent Iraqis I think because
they view the act of Congress
authorizing yet and the large majorities
of the American citizen each hearing for
it as something that ought to immunize
them from that and it I think shows just
how lawless we become that you can't
even cite the Nuremberg principles and
argue for its applicability in the
clearest possible case
without becoming self marginalised just
a quick point about assassinations and
the like I certainly agree with
professor Chomsky that from a moral and
ethical perspective there's zero
difference between sending a Skye robot
over another country and eradicating the
lives of non-citizens as opposed to
doing that to citizens based upon mere
suspicion or even a lack of suspicion
just as a desire to kill them but I do
think there's a practical difference
that is that there is a greater and
enhanced danger on several levels when
the government begins murdering its own
citizens for political dissidents as
opposed to citizens of other countries
on foreign soil and the difference is
this I think that you know just
legalistically the Supreme Court for
writer for better for worse right or
wrong has said that the Constitution
applies to foreigners on US soil and to
American citizens wherever they are
found in the world but more importantly
than that is that when the government
starts acting against its own citizens
it really can escalate a climate of fear
that can lead to political suppression
and I think that's one of the things
that you've really seen in the United
States one of the most striking
experiences I've had since they began
ranting about politics was the first
time that I ever wrote about WikiLeaks
this was back in early 2010 and this was
before really almost nobody knew who
icky leaks was at the time this before
they had released any of their news
making disclosures inside the United
States they had released several
important documents and had exposed
wrongdoing among corporations and
governments in other parts of the world
but not really in the United States and
nobody including me really knew much
about them but the Pentagon had prepared
a top-secret report they literally
classify the top-secret in 2008 that
declared WikiLeaks to be an enemy of the
state and it described ways that they
could go about destroying WikiLeaks and
it's incredible because the way in which
WikiLeaks has been rendered all but
inoperable pretty much comports with the
things the Pentagon laid out in this
2008 report but in any event in this to
thought this 2008 report was top-secret
report ironically was leaked to
WikiLeaks which then published it and
the New York Times wrote about it and
then your
Times article basically said there's the
pentagon report that's been leaked
that's eclairs WikiLeaks an enemy of the
state and talks about ways to destroy it
and I didn't know very much at all about
WikiLeaks at the time but I kind of
assumed that any organization that had
been targeted that way by the Pentagon
was one that merited a lot more
attention and probably a lot more
encouragement and even support and so I
went and read a lot about them and I
interviewed Julian Assange for the
article that I wrote and I I wrote about
it and I posted the audio interview and
at the end I encourage people to go and
donate to WikiLeaks because they had
budgetary constraints that were
preventing them from going public with a
lot of these disclosures it takes a lot
of time and energy to authenticate the
documents one of the things the Pentagon
talked about to destroy them was
submitting fraudulent documents to them
so that when they published it it would
forever destroy their credibility and
the credibility of future disclosures
and in response to my recommendation
that people go and donate to them and I
provided the link how people could you
doubt electronically and online and
through PayPal dozens of people
literally told me in many different
venues in the comment section to what I
had written by email at events like this
where I talked to people that although
they agreed wholeheartedly with what I
had written about the potential of
WikiLeaks to achieve great good that
they were afraid of donating money to
WikiLeaks especially electronically
because they would end up on some
government list somewhere or that they
could even be subjected to criminal
liability under the extraordinarily
broad material support for terrorism
statutes that Professor Chomsky just
talked about and these were not people
prone to wild conspiracy theories these
were very sober Americans who I had an
interaction with in the past on other
issues a lot of them were and I could
just tell from the way that they were
expressing these fears that they were
very rational people and they these
fears were well grounded and the reason
it was so amazing to me was because it
really highlighted how this
extraordinary climate of fear has been
created in the United States WikiLeaks
is a group that had never been and still
has never been charged with a crime let
alone convicted of one and they couldn't
be because what they're doing is pure
First Amendment activity that the New
York Times in the Washington Post in
theory do every day which is publish a
publicized leaks that are given to them
by other people and yet these were
American citizens who were petrified
of exercising poor First Amendment
rights which is what donating money to
an organization whose political cause
you support is and they were basically
intimidated from the things we've seen
over the last ten years in terms of
lawlessness by what the government has
done from exercising these right so you
can offer all the rights in the world on
a piece of paper or a piece of parchment
that you want you don't need to
eliminate those rights if you can
intimidate and bully the population into
refraining from exercising them and this
really occurred to me even more when I
wrote for the first time about the
extremely harsh and oppressive
conditions in which Bradley Manning was
being detained and I remember when I
first wrote about it a lot of people
wondered and I actually even wondered
myself why would the Obama
administration basically turn Bradley
Manning into almost a martyr and even
jeopardize its own ability to prosecute
him by subjecting him to this extremely
severe you could call it torture but at
the very least it's inhumane treatment
he was in prolonged solitary confinement
for nine months despite being convicted
of nothing his clothes were taken from
him he was stripped nude and forced to
stand naked for many of those days just
completely punitive measures and at some
point shortly thereafter I realized that
the reason that that was done was the
same reason that the Bush administration
took people who were completely innocent
by the hundreds and shipped them
thousands of miles away to a Caribbean
island and dressed them in orange
jumpsuits and sack holes and showed the
world what we had done it's a way of
signaling to the world and to would-be
challengers to American power both
domestically and internationally that we
are not constrained by law we don't have
any limits on what we can do if you're
somebody who thinks about challenging
what we can do take a look at these
pictures of people at Guantanamo who are
gonna be there for as long as we want to
keep them there even if they're innocent
or if you're somebody who discovers
wrongdoing in Syria see legality on the
highest levels of our government and you
want to expose it to the world think
about and look at what we've done to
Bradley Manning or what we're now doing
to WikiLeaks without any even pretense
to legal authority and without any
constraint whatsoever it's really the
use of law as a means of coercion which
is the exact and
of what it was supposed to be it's those
in power using law as a weapon to
entrench their power and to shield their
ill-gotten gains and the fact that we
can call terrorism whatever we want it
to be the fact that people who as
Professor Chomsky said take up arms and
fight against American troops or
terrorists the fact that we just
indicted someone nine months ago for
quote raising funds to kill American
troops in Iraq this was an Iraqi who had
raised money to defend his own homeland
from the debating army so if you're an
Iraqi and the American army invades your
country and you take up arms against
them you're a terrorist Nidal Hasan who
attacked a military base of a country
that has spent 10 years for claiming
we're at war and killed soldiers about
to be deployed to war he is a terrorist
as well and yet when the United States
or Israel our allies directly target and
kill civilians by enormous numbers
whether recklessly or deliberately it
would be a radical act to describe that
as terrorism this is all designed to be
able to criminalize whomever the United
States wants namely those who challenge
it in any meaningful way and that really
is the use of law coercively to entrench
those in power rather than to equalize
the playing field the final point I want
to make them and I think we can turn it
over to questions and answers is
Professor Chomsky referenced this post
by Matt Iglesias who is a byproduct of
this school near near where we're
talking and he also worked for the
center of American prosthetic for
American Progress which is basically an
organization run by John Podesta the
former Clinton White House official that
was founded in essence to justify and
defend whatever the Obama White House
does with some exceptions here and there
if you search hard enough but basically
that's its function and the fact that
people who write for them do things and
say things to mitigate or defend things
like assassinating an American citizen
with no due process probably the most
radical act that you can think of really
underscores an important point about the
way the Obama legacy is being defined in
the way that lawlessness has become
normalized so if you know three years
ago and I know I say this is somebody
who was doing it if you were to go to an
event like this and fill the room with
50 percent
Republicans and 50% Democrats and you
were to talk about and condemn things
like wild assertions of executive
authority the idea that the president
can act against anyone he wants with no
constraints whatsoever including killing
him that he can do so in total secrecy
and with no transparency or checks and
of course after we killed Anwar Awlaki
two weeks later a drone attack killed
his 16 year old son and his 17 year old
cousin in Yemen and that the US
government refuses to even account for
what it did there or describe what
principles if you were to talk about
those things and the other radical
secrecy doctrines the Bush
administration used you would have 50%
of the room the ones identified
self-identified as Republicans
supporting it cheering for it justifying
it apologizing for it and being happy
with it but 50% of the room the ones
self-identified as Democrats would be
feigning anger over it they'd be
objecting to it as shredding the
Constitution and right-wing radicalism
and all of this if you were to take that
same exact group of people and put them
in a room like this now and talk about
those same exact things that I just
described you would now have 90% of the
room cheering for it and supporting it
or at least justifying it in mitigating
it the way not you glacis from that post
did or at least acquiesce into it maybe
10% of the room continuing to be angry
about it because they were actually
angry about its being done the first
time around and not pretending to be
angry opportunistically for partisan
gain and this has really changed the way
that these issues are discussed the fact
that now it's not just the Republican
Party standing for this form of
lawlessness but that it's become under
President Obama bipartisan consensus
which means it's removed from political
debate it is hardly controversial any
longer and it's entrenched as orthodoxy
in American political life for at least
a generation there's Jack Balkan who's a
yellow professor has talked about how
what when one party objects to a policy
and the other opposes it
or supports it what happens when the
other party gets into office and starts
continuing it it becomes no longer a
controversial policy it becomes American
consensus and indoors without much
challenge for at least a generation that
is what has happened to these policies
of lawlessness and wild periods of
executive power and the right of the
American president
to target anyone for violence or
interrogation or incarceration without
any oversight it has now taken on the
face of both parties and is therefore
likely normalized for a very long time
and to me that's one of the most
significant legacies of the Obama
presidency so with that I think it's a
good time to take questions I think the
mechanics were described at the start I
didn't hear it so I will rely on you the
first thanks to our speakers
we have about 15-20 minutes for
questions so just head down to this mic
and try to keep your questions brief so
we can get to as many as you as possible
Thanks
so how do you feel after all these years
seeing and all that you've done seeing
what's happened to our country is that
yes too well to you professor Chomsky
first I've had more years yes well
actually uh it's it's it's pretty bad
but we should recognize that it's not
really all that new go back to the the
the day the the modern conception of
international law was pretty well
founded right after the Second World War
the Nuremberg Tribunal charter of the
United Nations and so on what so what
was the position of the United States
then well the United States was
instrumental in setting up the World
Court in an International Court of
Justice but at once
the United States declared that it is
not subject to any charges based on
international treaties meaning the UN
Charter the Charter the Organization of
American States or others and in fact
that actually came to the court it came
to the court during the Reagan years
when the government of Nicaragua brought
a charges against the United States for
essentially war against Nicaragua or
international terrorism if you want to
lower the charge the Nicaraguan case was
presented by a distinguished Harvard Law
School professor most of it was thrown
out and it was thrown out because the
case appealed to the core principles of
entered modern international law UN
Charter OAS and so on so in fact when
the case was finally you know judged it
was restricted to very narrow grounds a
bilateral u.s. Nicaraguan treaty and
what's called a common common
international law was generally
understood
even on that narrow basis the US was
accused of unlawful use of force which
means terrorism and late language and
ordered to pay substantial reparations
well how did the bipartisan Congress
react by increasing aid to the Contras
increasing the actions just condemned
this criminal meanwhile the New York
Times for example dismissed the court as
a hostile for a proof that it's a
hostile and therefore insignificant
hostile forum because it made charges
against the u.s. a couple of years
earlier the same times and other
commentators were praising the court
because it supported the u.s. in a
charge against Iran
well that's in fact the United States
went on to veto I think two Security
Council resolutions which called on all
states to observe international law well
all that passed with virtually no
comment almost nobody knows about this
except maybe some specialists and it
goes beyond in 1948 the United Nations
passed a genocide condemnation of
genocide genocide major crime forty
years later the United States ratified
it but with the reservation inapplicable
to the United States and that came to
the courts two couple years later
Yugoslavia brought charges against NATO
for bombing and among the charges was a
reference to genocide the United States
representative appealed to the court and
[Music]
said that the United States would
withdraw from the proceedings because
the United States was formally entitled
to commit genocide which is true by this
reservation and the court accepted that
correctly the court rules are that they
can't try bring him into trial unless
they agree to the proceedings so the
United States was excluded from the
charges the rest of the Native
weren't that was reported but with no
comment if we declare that we were
entitled to carry out genocide fine then
we're entitled to carry out genocide now
these things are pretty deep it's
perfectly true that Bush broke
let's take even the torture charges if
you look carefully it's not so clear
that Bush was in serious violation of US
law when they carried out torture at
Guantanamo or at Abu Ghraib because the
u.s. never really signed the torture
convention it was rewritten by the
Senate to exclude certain categories of
torture and if you look at those
categories they are the categories that
the CIA carries out the CIA
back in the 50s basing themselves on KGB
manuals and so on redefined tortured to
allow what's called mental torture you
know the kind that doesn't leave marks
so for example actually even
waterboarding so you know take a Bradley
Manning and solitary confinement of
course tortured by any reasonable means
but not by US law and that was then
signed to the legislation under Clinton
so what's called torture here is a very
narrow category and a good deal of the
torture that the u.s. carries out is
actually legal under US law well you
know this is discussed by specialists in
constitutional law and Sanford
Levinson and others but almost nobody
knows about it
well you know these are things everyone
knows it know of it okay yep okay I
wanted to ask you about two implications
or suggestions that I drew from your
book the first is that it excuse me
the there's really the unmistakable
conclusion that that our officials you
know judges politicians won't or can't
which is more scary holt powerful
powerful criminal behave
you're accountable even in the most
egregious example such as torture and
this the possibility that the cognitive
dissonance that this raises and our
officials that they're not you know the
constant awareness that they're not
fulfilling their role as officials may
be driving this need to sort of
scapegoat to find the most vulnerable
the mo the least politically powerful
for the most trivial offenses
accountable so to be able to demonstrate
okay look we are holding if we're
holding a lot of people accountable
they're just not holding you know
accountable according to law so it's
this kind of charade of judicious 'no
stats ort of passes for lawfulness and
it's kind of vigorousness behind it that
maybe and you know this knowledge of
this imbalance may be driving this kind
of and perpetuating the imbalance and
then the second implication was that
when our when our officials give up on
law enforcement as their role that
perhaps law-breaking greater greater
extremes of law-breaking becomes a means
of expressing power so that yes you know
our financial system engages in
widespread fraud but only the president
can violate the Constitution yeah those
are both interesting and important
points you know it is true that law and
order basically tends to mean get drug
dealers off the corner who are smelling
selling salt small quantities of drugs
to two other adults who want to buy them
and of course that has all kinds of
implications I mean the drug wars
incredibly racist it has incredibly
disproportionate effects on the poor and
yet at the same time or or law and order
means and the rule of law means you know
pepper spraying protestors and putting
them into prison for peacefully
assembling at the same time that the
police are protecting the criminals on
Wall Street who destroyed the economy
and committed fraud on an
incomprehensible scale so I think you're
right that essentially these kind of
petty transgressions that are punished
so harshly is a way of obscuring the
fact that the most significant criminals
the most consequential crimes are are
shielded and that the the biggest
criminals are allowed to continue to run
rampant with their criminality on the
other point about as a way of expressing
power you know
the fascinating things about this whole
idea of look for not backwards and the
like is that at the same time the very
same administration that has invoked
this Orwellian slogan as a means of
saying that we shouldn't look to
political crimes of the Bush era on has
waged the most the harshest and the most
unprecedented war on whistleblowers
people who have leaked what
unquestionably is evidence of serious
wrongdoing so for example the NSA
scandal that revealed that the Bush
administration was spying on American
citizens without the law without the
warrants the criminal law said is
required and that the law calls a felony
if you do the only person to suffer any
consequences from that scandal is
someone named Thomas Tamm who was a
mid-level Department of Justice lawyer
who found out the Bush administration
was doing this in one day called Eric
Lichtblau
have the New York Times to tell him that
this was going on he was he was a grand
jury was convened he was continuously
subpoenaed he lost his job he couldn't
afford lawyers he went bankrupt and
became had serious emotional and
psychological problems as a result of
that persecution all of the people who
broke the law have been completely
shielded they want Alan to write books
and get very rich only the person who
exposed it has been subjected to any
form of sanction and and punishment that
absolutely is about expressing power and
saying that you know if you expose any
of the things that we're doing that are
criminal and wrong you will be the one
who will be punished
using the dressings of law to do it
while we simultaneously shield ourselves
hi and I hope you both have time to
answer this but first professor Chomsky
and I came down from occupy Burlington
Vermont today to be here and I'm really
inspired by the number of people that
have risen up to protest the bullying as
you put it of American elites in many
respects through the Occupy movement do
you think that the Occupy movement has
the potential to revolutionize
revolutionize the system to the point
that we can topple the power that has so
corrupted the rule of law what do you
think the movement will need to achieve
in order to achieve and overcome in
order to do this well I mean I think the
Occupy movements which are now all over
the country in fact all over the world
are a very exciting development in fact
inspiring in a lot of ways and really
unprecedented
I don't know of anything quite like them
in the past which is make sense this is
an unprecedented period in many ways
what can they achieve they've already
achieved a lot I think they've put
things they've shifted the range of
discussion which is quite important
they've at the very least are laying
down a legacy from which you can move on
there are short-term things that they
might be able to achieve which are quite
urgent so to take one in just a couple
of weeks the deficit Commission is due
to reach its decision which will
probably be stalemate but whether it
reaches a decision or stalemates
it's a real dagger pointed at the heart
of the country either way because if it
doesn't reach a decision you go into
kind of an automatic trap that's been
set up which is aimed at doing exactly
the opposite of what Americans want so
that a striking effect
you take a look at polls first of all
large majority that people don't think
that the deficit is the problem anyway
and they're right the problems
joblessness there shouldn't be a deficit
Commission but even if you keep to this
minor question of the deficit very large
majorities have a solution tax the
super-rich bring taxes back to what they
once wore were during our period of
rapid growth in fact so tax the
super-rich and preserve benefits even
Tea Party supporters that takes that
position that support protect the
benefits which are not great but are
crucial for people well they come the
Commission if it reaches a decision or
the automatic process if it doesn't
reach your decision are going to do just
the opposite they'll cut away at the
limited benefits incidently ignoring the
reason why they're a fiscal problem
Social Security is not a problem at all
that's just thrown in in order to try to
destroy it
Medicare is a problem because it works
through the privatized unregulated
virtually unregulated insurance based
health care system was a complete
international scandal the US had a
health care system like other industrial
countries there wouldn't be any deficit
effect to be a sort of look but that
that can't even be discussed because the
financial institutions are against it
and this goes back to things that Glen
outlines very well in his book the but
that's coming right away
and it's possible it's a long shot but
if the Occupy movements get enough kind
of force and energy and influence they
might do something about this short-term
problem now that's very far from
revolutionizing the society when you
talk about deeper problems more
long-term ones it has to be understood
and I think is that you don't get these
things overnight take say the civil
rights movement and that really began in
a militant form in the 1930s was years
of straw
before it even you know reached the
possibility where you could discuss it
if finally thanks to very courageous
activities students sitting at lunch
counters the Freedom Riders and all
sorts of other things it was possible to
get to the point where the Martin Luther
King a great figure in modern life was
able to give a talk I have a dream talk
and some games were won they shouldn't
be underestimated the South is a
different place from what it was and in
fact as long that's take people right
around here
Boston as long as civil rights movement
was aimed that racist Alabama Sheriff's
a lot of support for it as soon as King
began to move on to opposition of the
Vietnam War and class issues remember
that when he was killed he was on his
way to organize the Poor People's
Movement and he was killed during a SAN
estate in supporting a sound as well as
supporting a sanitation strike since he
moved on to those he was dismissed when
you listened to the adulation on Martin
Luther King Day you hear about the
racist alabama sheriffs well gains were
won after many years of hard struggle
there's a long way to go the
criminalization that Glenn talked about
is basically kind of reinstituting what
was done in the write up not long after
the Civil War criminalizing black life
and pretty much restoring the conditions
that existed so there's a long way to go
and that's one of the successful
movements and it's true of other things
too there can be very significant gains
in the long term really revolutionary
gains but they're not going to come
quickly and the main task of the Occupy
movement in
opinion is to make use of the quite
remarkable network of associations and
linkages and mutual support building
spontaneous building of communities make
use of all of that to turn it into
something that will be long lasting and
enduring and will face the inevitable
failures and go on to overcome which is
a hard long course to follow we have
just two or three more minutes and two
more questions to go so thanks I'd be
interested what both of you think about
this taboo subject
the US Attorney's scandal the bogus
acorn scandal the the current red
redistricting efforts the making photo
ID requirements the making the assault
on unions and an early voting and
registration all seem part of a
concentrated war on the right to vote so
first of all given that these people
seem to say do anything in pursuit of
their agenda what is the likelihood that
having highly hackable easily often
failing machines that they own and
operate with zero citizen oversight
would not be part of their strategy and
you have any advice for what I can do to
get this subject on the radar of my hero
Glenn Greenwald I guess I'm about to
address it but you know I think just
conceptually and I will address the
specific question in a second but you
know it raises the question about
whether or not significant economic and
wealth inequality can coexist with rough
political equality or whether or not
once there's a small faction that can
gain so much power through its wealth
then political equality or democratic
institutions cannot possibly resist it
any longer or remain invulnerable to it
and there are waves and you know even
the founders talked about this the
problem that if you're going to allow
wealth and income inequality that there
is the danger that it can become
so concentrated that it'll in fact
political and legal institutions as well
where it's not supposed to make a
difference and yet we've seen periods of
time in American history where there's
been lots of wealth and income
inequality and yet at the same time
political and democratic institutions
have been able to act fairly
meaningfully against the most powerful
oligarchs you know Standard Oil and and
and JP Morgan were broken up Franklin
Roosevelt was able to create lots of
redistributive and social programs lots
of social progress of the kind that
Professor Chomsky was just describing so
you can it's been empirically proven
that you can have significant wealth and
income inequality in the same time
political equality that's contingent
upon subjecting those who are the most
wealthy the wealthiest and the most
politically powerful to the same rules
and limitations to which the rest of us
are bound in in which we democratically
impose on them and once that starts not
to happen that's when you get the kind
of corruption that seeps into all the
other institutions as far as control
over the voting machines and the like
you know the all political processes are
subjected to corruption and coercion and
the like I haven't seen evidence that
there's systematic fraud on the part of
in terms of our electoral process that
comes from voting machine control and at
the same time I'm not particularly
convinced that there's anyone who has
such an overwhelming interest since both
parties seem to serve the same interest
anyway I'm not really sure who would be
motivated to care enough about about
that other than the two parties
themselves but you know certainly
there's instances where there's
irregularities but I think the more
important danger is the one that you
talked about which is efforts to start
restricting the right to vote more to
make towards sort of return to the poll
tax era where people who have certain
political views or have huge impediments
thrown in the way and that to me is just
part and parcel of the generalized trend
of using what is supposed to be law and
political equality to achieve exactly
the opposite last question here and then
we can
hi all the hassle and trying to get me
to ask this question is reflective of
how my civil rights and the civil rights
of all the people who can't be here with
people with disabilities are violated by
the elite of Cambridge who also exempt
themselves from the basic civil rights
of access for 20 years I've had the
right to fall free and front door access
every building in the country but the
elite of Cambridge and the good people
of Cambridge you support them exempt
this elite by using the term historic
which is an ideological term meaning
looks good and keeps property values up
and by that process there was a special
entrance for me that I got to go in in
which the elevator fell an inch and a
half when I got in when we got to the
top of the elevator we ran into a
handcart and boxes blocking my way out
and then the door into the auditorium
was locked and then when I came in
finally after knocking to get in no one
knew what to do with me or where to put
me so I I call this bullying it's it's
really a constant ongoing humiliation
now of course the burden that would be
placed on the bridle by making it fully
accessible through the front entrance
would cost a lot but maybe that money is
meanwhile being used to put the
torturing brick sidewalks on my way to
try to get to the front entrance which
everyone knows tortures people with
disabilities and anyone pushing any
wheels and yet they're all over this
area because the elite of exempted
themselves right in front of everyone
and unfortunately you end up
participating in a glen by coming to an
event where people can't get to were
bullied all the time i was in the street
most of the way on the way to get here
and i hope that in the future that you
would not speak in a place that didn't
have every single person who could come
in come in the front door because coming
in the front door used to be something
that was seen as a civil right in itself
thank you very much
yeah so I you know obviously I wasn't
aware of this building ever before
there's laws that require reasonable
steps to be taken to provide access to
people who are disabled I've litigated
those cases before on behalf of people
who are disabled whether there's issues
around historic designations on the like
is something I'm just not aware of them
I'm appreciative of your bringing it to
my attention though and and to the
attention of everyone here it's
something I'll certainly give some
thought to okay just add a word to that
I think the complaints are quite
legitimate but it also bears on the
preceding question of can we do anything
about it
and the answer is yes we can it's very
different from what it was 40 years ago
and those changes which have are part of
a part of the general civilising of the
country in many ways that has traces
back to many things but in particular to
the activism of the 60s and it's
aftermath a large part of the civilizing
effect of the 60s actually began later
so the feminist movement for example has
had a huge change the support for access
of disabled people that's all pretty
much post 60s and it shows what can be
achieved by popular engagement a
recognition of serious issues
pressures do something about them and
progress and progress still has big gaps
but we shouldn't overlook the fact two
facts one that there has been progress
and two that that progress has not been
a gift from above but has been achieved
through popular engagement often
struggle and that's a lesson for the
future
