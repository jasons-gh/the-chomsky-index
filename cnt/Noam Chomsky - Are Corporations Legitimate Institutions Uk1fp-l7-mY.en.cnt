your recommendation be for corporations
just said they'd be eliminated or a0 is
of a trend or changing them adapting
them to the democratic ideals well my
feeling about corporations is very much
like my feeling about Bolshevism and
fascism to which they which they
resemble in a short term period you want
to reform them okay so if you're living
under say the rule of a king you know it
makes sense to plead with the King to be
to act more kindly to his subjects and
that's always good you know instead so
don't torture as many people and you
know give more gifts to poor people and
so on and that makes good sense when the
population of the United States by 20 to
1 says that corporations ought to
sacrifice profits for communities and
workers that 95% majority is saying the
king ought to be more benevolent not so
harsh and that's good I agree with that
the King oughta be more benevolent but
of course you can go a little further
and say is the institution legitimate at
all and I don't think it is for the
reasons I discuss so therefore it ought
to be dismantled and workers ought to be
the masters of their own industrial fate
as do we put it and all the rest you
know our way back to Lincoln and you
know back to Aristotle and so on now
it's kind of an interesting commentary
on the way the propaganda system the
doctrinal system has functioned that
ideas that were standard among you know
mill hands and Lowell a hundred years
ago sound unimaginable today I mean they
were saying look the institution's
illegitimate its infringing on our
rights as free men and women
we're not they were not asking the
autocracy to be more benevolent they
were saying it should disappear because
we want to enjoy the rights that we want
in the American Revolution or so they
thought nowadays that's almost
unthinkable and the most that can be
asked for is that the app
Lieut ISM be more benevolent that the
King act a little more nicely well
that's a tremendous victory of a
propaganda system in which educated
sectors have played the leading role
after all we should remember that we're
talking about ourselves and it has very
it's been extremely hard for a hundred
eighty years now there has been an
effort to drive out of people's heads
normal ordinary human sentiment and to
make them think just for themselves you
want things just for yourself you know
instill the new spirit of the age gain
wealth forgetting all of itself you have
no rights either what but you can get on
the market with of course that big
footnote that the rich and the powerful
insist on massive protection from the
nanny state in extreme forms under say
Reagan and Gingrich but always and it's
been a very hard battle to get that
across but it's you know over time it
has worked so now people don't even
think about being free the most they
think about is asking the ruler to be
more benign but to get back to your
question I don't think we should limit
ourselves to that yeah it's important to
ask the ruler to be more benign so for
example I think we should urgently do
something about the fact that we are
facing a major social crisis as the
advocates of a powerful nanny state for
the rich are kicking are continuing a
massive war that they've been conducting
for 15 years against children and
families and women particularly and are
winning it they're going to be out in
the streets hungry the main effect of
the welfare reform and certainly its
purpose is to lower wages for poor
people I mean didn't take a genius to
figure that out
obviously if you force people notice the
assumptions that underlie that as well
the assumption is that women who are
raising children have to be sent to the
workforce the implication it's no work
to raise children that just sort of you
know comes free like
raising children taking care of a home
that's not work you know anybody who's
had a child knows that what's work is
going to the office in downtown Boston
and speculating against currencies to
lower growth rates that's work and you
can sort of prove it because after all
we live in a meritocratic society so you
measure the value of work by the amount
you get paid for raising child you get
paid zero for speculating against
currencies to lower growth rates you get
paid huge amounts so those guys must be
doing real work and now we've got to
take these other people who aren't doing
any work just raising children taking
care of homes and so on we have to make
them work but of course they're gonna
have to work at government subsidized
jobs at below minimum wages which simply
harms the lower sector of the workforce
naturally now you know there's a
principle of law that you can determine
intent by predictable outcome you know
if you can if the outcome is predictable
you can use that as evidence for intent
which means that obviously this was the
intent of the law the intent is to
continue the major battle against
families and children and women and the
poor generally and the same thing abroad
but now also to harm even further the
what's called unskilled labor it sounds
like a small part of the workforce
except that it's 70% of the workforce
and that's proceeding and we should do
something about that so I think that
should be immediately on the agenda make
the autocrats be less brutal and cruel
but I don't think they should have the
right to rule either I think we should
be able to understand what mill hands
and Massachusetts or Abraham Lincoln or
others understood
