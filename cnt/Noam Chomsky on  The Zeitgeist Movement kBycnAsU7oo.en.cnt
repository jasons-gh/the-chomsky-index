as two questions do you think that a
resource-based economy and the venus
project for example or the zeitgeist
movement provide an alternative
structure whereas you say perverse sharp
short-term incentives for maximizing
profits will not end up making otherwise
good people being forced to make bad
choices its pleasant ideas when I read
it I think that would be nice but there
are many other suggestions about what
would be nice for spin am offering with
your favorites yeah my favorite of the
ones I talk about a democratic control
of every aspect of social life the
production consumption distribution
represent political representation long
way to go on that and simply to creating
the expanding sphere of human and in
fact animal rights all that's important
ending there are very specific things
that have to be dealt with which is why
I'm not much interested in these kind of
Airy speculations one of them we've
talked about so the destruction of the
environment which is extremely serious
the other you mentioned it's kind of a
miracle that we've escaped a nuclear war
literally a miracle and you can't expect
that neural googlecontinue so something
quickly and urgently has to be done to
eliminate this purse yeah
