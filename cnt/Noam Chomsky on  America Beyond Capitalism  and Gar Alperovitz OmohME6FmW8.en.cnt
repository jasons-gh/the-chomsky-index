yeah I was wondering if you'd read gar
alperovitz book America beyond
capitalism and if if you have what you
thought of his ideas in the book could
you repeat the title and author of the
book please I common either I was
wondering if he'd read gar alperovitz
America beyond capitalism okay and what
he thought about America apples that's
very important book and the work that
he's doing which described there is
extremely important that's one of the
things that can be done it's very
feasible the book reviews work that elf
ebbets mainly has been involved in for
some years in trying to develop a worker
owned enterprises mostly in Ohio it took
off in Ohio for very interesting reasons
and because it was nineteen
seventy-seven the as part of this change
in the socio economic policy that I was
discussing the US Steel Corporation
decided to close down its operations in
Youngstown Ohio the Youngstown is a
steel town it was built by and around
the you know the steel industry of the
working people the community were
extensively involved in steel production
and all that everything that flows off
of it and manufacturing plants lawns all
sorts of other thing so it was a steel
town US Steel decided sell it off kill
the town instead of just giving up the
workers and the community were called
the stakeholders offered to buy the
plant and run at themselves that could
have been done with enough public
support it could have happened these
were not public issues at the time it
did go to court the court think the
Union took the case to court to try to
get the right to do it they lost in the
court but they could have won and it
could have been carried forward well so
it was a kind of defeat
but like a lot of defeats it wasn't the
end of the story it was the basis for
moving on to something else and what it
spawned was a lot of much smaller scale
efforts to establish worker owned
enterprises a lot of it's called the
Cleveland mom a lot of them around
Cleveland and other parts of Ohio which
are not huge enterprises but there's a
lot of them alperovitz and his book
reviews all of this you can look at it
for detail and these are notice
worker-owned that short of worker
managed that would be another step
towards liberation but it's real and
it's a way of reacting to the kind of
collapse of the productive system for
the 99 percent I just taking it over
actually if you take a look at standard
texts and business economics you know
nothing radical standard texts and
business economics that point out that
there's a no economic principle or any
other principle that says that
corporations should be controlled by
shareholders shareholders incidentally
doesn't mean somebody who you know whose
pension fund has two dollars there's in
the as a share that shareholders are
very narrowly concentrated shareholdings
like top one percent of the population
wasn't it and that means big banks
interlocking directorates and so on
there's no economic principle that says
they're the ones who should determine
investment policy like shipping
production to Foxconn there's no law of
economics incident that should happen it
could just as well be done by
stakeholders by the workforce of the
community perfectly consistent with
anything that I went claims about
economic theory well you know there's no
reason for say the Occupy movement to be
less imaginative and ambitious than
standard business texts so yes
stakeholders could take over parts of
the economy that are being dismantled
that run them effectively and direct
them to different purposes these are
very feasible tasks so for example one
of the things that Obama's praised for
by the kind of left liberal economists
Paul Krugman and others is for having
essentially nationalized the auto
industry and reconstructed it that's
pretty much what happened well once the
auto industry was nationalized just
think what would happen there were
alternatives one alternative was to
reconstruct it and hand it back to the
essentially the original owners not the
same names but same class and banks and
so on that's what was done another
possibility would have been
and the auto industry over to the
workforce and the communities of the
stakeholders and redirected towards
things that the country really needs not
only badly need high-speed rail for
example it's a you know kind of a
shameful situation when you compare it
us or other countries in much poorer
country and it would be a tremendous
economic benefit that it's the human
benefit in all kinds of respect means I
could have got here in two hours instead
of wasting time at the airport for
example literally two hours I happen to
be in France a couple of months ago
giving talks last one I gave was in
southern France and I had to get from
Avignon southern France to the airport
to go airport and of course is praying
that goes directly here and took two
hours it's the same distance as
Washington the boss here it takes her
what eight hours or something but oh
this is these are human costs their
economic loss the things the country
badly needs the skilled workforce at the
in the auto industry could easily be it
could be reconverted to producing things
like this and other things and people
need that could be done under the
ownership and management of the
workforce and the communities well that
was an alternative but getting back to
our orbit this is the kind of thing
talked about that particular case but
it's the kind of case that's coming up
all the time and these are very feasible
things they're not far out in youth
pooping and they could have a big effect
on the society and how paradox is one of
the very few people is really doing very
good work on this the book is certainly
worth reading thinking about what it
describes with rough what options it
suggests but this comes up all the time
i should say but I in Boston that the
Boston this that a year ago this in a
suburb applause and fun they factored in
town there was there was a reasonably
successful a high-technology small
manufacturing plant that was producing
equipment high-tech equipment for
aircraft and they apparently were doing
okay but they weren't making enough
profit for the managers in the
multinational corporation who owned them
so the corporation wanted to just
dismantle it out of the Union United
Electrical Workers wanted to buy the
operation and just run it themselves
well the corporation wouldn't agree I
suspect that they wouldn't agree mostly
on class grounds it's kind of not not a
good idea to let people own and manage
their own workplaces and get the wrong
idea anyhow whatever the reason it
didn't work but if say the Occupy
movement had been around and if it had
been active and energetic enough and had
reached out sufficiently that's the kind
of thing it could have participated in
and supported them maybe gotten it over
the edge well there'd be important in
maintaining say manufacturing in
Massachusetts and that kind of thing
goes on all the time these are options
that are all over the place
so and garl parrots by the way he's also
had a long distinguished career starting
with his book atomic diplomacy about
