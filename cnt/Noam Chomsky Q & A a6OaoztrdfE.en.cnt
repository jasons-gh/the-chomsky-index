okay so we're gonna start a question
announced and we'll start right here in
this mic that question about the the
austerity agenda it seems to me that
elite groups which haven't been targeted
before are now being targeted like the
major media or experienced a lot of cuts
scientific organizations by changes to
National Science Foundation funding
structures are being attacked as well as
major archival organizations like in
Canada our archives and library of
Canada is being dismantled what what is
the motivation behind dismantling these
classic institutions and also
institutions of propaganda the
consequences of the austerity agenda are
free of is there in Europe where they're
being imposed more strictly they're
devastating the societies as a rich
society they're increasing debt as
anticipated they're creating a huge
number of unemployed and the United
States switches in this in this case
more progressive than Europe there's
there being applied but less rigorously
and they're having a milder version of
the same effects it's not because people
want it so like in the United States for
example there's plenty of polls the
general population who considers the
main problem to be unemployment not
deficit and they're right in fact the
deficit is probably a good idea right
now
it's a stimulus to the economy and it's
a way to create more jobs even the IMF
is coming around to accept this so who
wants austerity well bankers rich people
the people who run the world
they want austerity one reason is
you know they're concerned their lenders
so they're concerned that maybe
somewhere down the road invisible now
there might be inflation which is bad
for people who lend and good for people
to borrow so they don't take that chance
and the other is that the austerity
programs have the nice effect of
dismantling the hated welfare state and
that's bipartisan in the United States
Obama's talking about it - you gotta go
after the poor in fact like take my
getting here today okay I flew
well there's one part this sequestration
which is about the deficit not
unemployment the big problem it's got a
kind of a nuanced character to it it
leaves out rich people so one of the
things that's excluded from the by
congressional decision from the
sequester is air air air flying flying
you've got to have enough flight
controllers so that rich people don't
have to wait a little bit when the plane
comes on the other hand poor people who
let's say his kids are being thrown at
headstart and can't get Medicaid well
you know minor problem so it's adjusted
the sequester for and you know who flies
it's not the general population it's
privileged people overwhelmingly and
that's typical that's the way the
country works and it's the way the the
public sees things so this recent
studies came out by good political
science has been Paige and Larry Bartels
in which they just studied attitudes
towards deficit and austerity and the
jobs ranked by income level and it's
exactly is it predict the very top of
the income scale
the problem is deficits so we have to
have austerity
the rest of the population done agree
and we don't have a functioning
democracy we live in a plutocracy about
roughly seventy percent of the
population
lower seventy percent their views have
no influence on policy there that
disenfranchised and you get more
influence as you go up the scale at the
very top that means you know tenth of
one percent you know basically get what
you want well what they want is they
don't care if kids don't have schools or
you know don't get Medicaid or you don't
have headstart they want to make profit
and they want to get rid of this
annoying welfare state and it's even
said you know Mario Draghi is the head
of the European Central Bank and has
been one of the more and forthcoming
about trying to do something about the
crisis that he had an interview with The
Wall Street Journal and which he told
the journal that he said the European
social contract is dead social contract
means you know the welfare states one of
Europe's great contributions to
civilization in the past years they can
now kind of dismantle it he didn't say
he wanted that he just said that's
what's happening you know that's what's
happening
good evening professor Chomsky a lot of
what you described unfortunately sounds
like children playing with very
dangerous toys and a lot of it has to do
with power but I'm curious what you
think about the role of psychological
effects and all this in particular for
example when it comes to the
environmental crisis what do you think
about what many psychologists call the
what to hell effect this conflict
between the present and the future in
which people who hear such bad news
about the environment as we often hear
from scientists just say what the hell
in the in the present I'm not gonna
forfeit all the enjoyment I'm gaining
from all this corporate activity just to
possibly make the future a little better
in a way that will be completely
insignificant on a collective level
that's kind of an interesting question
let me say again that the American
population want
overwhelmingly wants to take strong
measures to deal with the crisis I mean
not everyone of course though there are
sectors of the Republican base you know
the Republicans kind of stopped any
pretense of being a normal political
party decades ago there no lock-step
service to the rich and powerful until a
very strange phenomenon unusual in
parliamentary systems and you can't get
votes that way so they've had to
mobilize a different base and that
includes you know nativists who are
terrified of that the UN's gonna comes
that we have to have of guns includes
evangelical Christians are a huge
population in the United States way off
us is way off the international spectrum
and religious belief always has been
back to the 17th century so that's the
base and that base either doesn't care
and why should they because if there's a
crisis will of all the save souls will
go to heaven or Esther's doesn't believe
it you saw that in the primers very
strikingly the the base had a voice in
the primaries and every time they put
somebody forward the Republican
establishment which was terrified had to
start a huge campaign tons of money to
knock him back down you know and Backman
chained Santorum one after the other and
these people almost all of them deny it
I think Backman was the one who said
well if there is global warming it's
God's punishment for homosexuality so it
takes care of that you know one of them
said that and if you take a look at the
Republican House and Senate Lehrer
member the Republican House is a
minority house the majority of people
are Republicans and majority the votes
went to Democrats but the system is so
perverse and skewed that even that part
doesn't work but they're in control of
the house and it's interesting to look
what they do so for example the house
has three committees concerned with
energy and so there's three chairs
they're all climate change deniers two
of them work for the fossil fuel
industry they're just in the pocket of
the corporate sector and their only
policy is to prevent anything from
happening you know so that's called the
dysfunction in Washington so it's a it's
a it was a but so going back your
question what do people think about this
I mean people who recognize that what
we're doing for our own gratification is
having a serious impact on our
grandchildren maybe a devastating impact
well as far as I know it hasn't really
been studied but I think you can imagine
I suppose that's why most people think
we ought to do something about it
now what about the Alec you know the
guys we're running these programs or the
the corporate campaign to convince
people there's no global warming be
interesting to study them to for with a
psychological effect my guess is if you
studied them you would find that these
people are very much like us they
probably contribute the Sierra Club you
know they're worried about global
warming they don't want their
grandchildren to be underwater and so on
and so forth
but that's in their personal lives what
about in their institutional lives well
in your institutional lives you're you
have to operate within the structure of
the institution's otherwise you're out
if you have a kind of a semi market
society like ours and you're a
participant in it you have to try to you
have to pursue Adam Smith's vile Maxim
otherwise you're kicked out you have to
try to maximize short-term profit and
market share and if that has what's
called an externality in economics you
know which gets a footnote when you're
pursuing your own self-interest in a
market transaction it has effects on
others externality footnotes in this
case the externality is destruction of
species but the market interactions
don't pay attention to externalities
that's the nature of a market system so
if you want to be in it you play that
game on the side you you know you can be
demonstrating against the Keystone XL I
wouldn't be surprised if that's what you
would discover you know something like
that but it hasn't been studied so I
don't know
yeah I was wondering what would you say
to young people who want to be
politically active and politically aware
but are really discouraged by what kind
of seems like every step we take forward
we're pushed two steps back one thing is
to look at history that's always been
the case at every point whether it was
abolitionism or civil rights women's
rights anti-war activities whatever it
is there's always a powerful force
trying to beat it back now that's for
obvious reasons the power is
concentrated and centralized and it'll
defend itself so yes you always have
that however there's been a lot of
progress just over say my lifetime lots
of progress in many dimensions much more
civilized country than it used to be and
that shows in many ways and it's because
people didn't give up the record you got
a record now as young that's that's the
way it's gonna be centers of power don't
say capitulate and say fine you take
over no they're gonna do what they can
to maintain their power and authority
and populations can overcome it and have
repeatedly in the past thank you very
much for taking my question the about a
year ago the renacer Institute came out
with a report called the ten percent
tipping point showing that if you got 10
percent of the population to profoundly
change their I can't remember who his
attitude but something profound that the
rest would follow what do you think of
that and what's your recommendation on
rallying a revolt
tipping points
I'm not giving an argument against
people changing their habits I think you
know they should to the extent that we
can but I just don't believe it
I don't think that's the way things work
you can make a major change and these
are really major issues if you have a
really substantial part of the
population dedicated and committed to
doing something about it what we do
individually is you know it's good but
it doesn't have that much of an effect
Canada it's my opinion how do we start a
revolution
well we go out say power to the people
I mean we have to be serious about it a
revolution that's going to be
constructive that'll lead things forward
instead of going to some other kind of
tyranny can only take place when most of
the population comes to understand that
you can't achieve your goals through
reform that the system doesn't allow
getting things that you really ought to
have by using the methods within the
system and that it's take a look at
again at history and see how that was
has that's been considerably take Karl
Marx for example that he wanted to have
a he was looking forward to a communist
revolution but he argued that in the
more free societies he was thinking
about England it could come about by
parliamentary means because there were
measures that could be used if the
population really got organized and to
some extent that begins to happen here
and there but other bigger powers knock
it down so I end a silly for example was
taking parliamentary steps towards no
not revolution but very significant
change and you know what happened to be
instituted a vicious dictatorship and
same in Guatemala and elsewhere but if
big powerful countries do it like us or
Marxist view England which was at the
time the major power then you're
protected from that and in that case if
these means really do fail and if the
resistance is too great the violence of
those who want to protect their rights
it's too strong then you can move into
talking about revolution but really not
before that
thank you for coming I've been reading
your books since college first book I
read of yours with language in mind and
I still have it I should have brought it
for him to sign one of my favorites too
it didn't convince anybody but I still
think it was right good that's two of us
it's right on my bookshelf I you could
solve an argument that I'm having with
certain people about the virtue of
Hezbollah and what you what your current
thinking or opinion is of Hezbollah
right now and what do you think is the
future for Hezbollah that's all right
now they're in a in a difficult position
within Lebanon they're actually the core
of the major political force I mean if
you take a look at the last presidential
election 2010 there were two coalition's
you know march 8th march 14th the
Hezbollah based coalition actually got
about 53 percent of the vote about the
same as Obama but a minority of the
seats and the reason has to do with the
confessional system that French
occupation left behind it there's a
balance between the different groups and
the Shiites have been our very large
percentage or are underrepresented and
they were conservative elements are
over-represented so there's a little bit
like our house of representatives but
they are the core of the major political
coalition and that remains true they are
also the only deterrent to an Israeli
attack as the Lebanese Army's not a
deterrent for anything it's probably
permeated with Israeli spies and
collaborators of F Isabella's A Serious
Organised Force and they've they
liberated southern Lebanon they drove
the Israelis out after 22 years
occupation and during the last invasion
2006 they held Israel off which was a
very serious blow to Israel and their
base is
complicated story their their
fundamental basis like a lot of the
Islamic parties a social welfare on the
other hand they have religious doctrines
which I certainly don't like and I
suspect you don't they're tied to Iran
in ways which I don't think are good for
anybody on the other hand what others
supported they gonna have no right now
with Syria just under undergoing
something like suicide you know it's
unclear that the site even survived it's
being torn to shreds they're losing the
last source of external support not from
Syria but from Iran through Syria
and that's pretty critical for them
that's why Israel was so ups so why they
carried out that military act a couple
weeks a couple days ago
attacking military installations in
Syria which they said were not Syrian
they were they thought maybe rightly
that those are weapons intended for
Hezbollah which would be a deterrent to
an Israeli attack within you know
unfortunately they one of the major
effects of the US invasion of Iraq all
sorts of horrible effects I mean
monstrous but one effect was that it
instigated Shiite Sunni conflicts which
were not really present in Iraq before
there's a lot of intermarriage people
lived with each other you know same
neighborhoods I mean it's there's
disagreements and conflicts like
everywhere but it wasn't much of a
problem but one of the consequences of
the invasion was it inflamed it into a
huge problem
I'm ear ax being torn to shreds by this
today it take a look at every day's
newspapers you know 20 more people are
killed and them attacking a mosque or
something
that goes both ways but that not only
Tory wracked the shreds it's spreading
through the region so the whole region
is being rent by Shiite Sunni conflicts
which it didn't have before and that's
what part at large part what's going on
Syria the Assad regime is run by a kind
of an offshoot of she is always and the
Sunnis are getting organized and protest
and they're all getting more radicalized
I mean when you have a murderous civil
war everybody goes crazy you know you
killed my cousin and I'm gonna kill your
uncle that's that's the dynamics and it
all over the place as long as the
violence continues is she going to
continue like that now she'll say an
anecdote about 20 years ago I was
traveling in Ireland from Dublin to
Belfast this was right at the peak of
the so-called troubles you know that I'm
a serious terror
I'm the IRA was not a joke it was
practically blew up the British Cabinet
and all sorts of things
the British were violent and brutal you
know killing people all over the place
the my wife and I went we were taken by
a woman who was a civil rights activist
in Belfast Catholics on the Catholic
side but was trying to bring together
the two sides she's now in the Northern
Ireland Parliament in fact government is
a minister a wonderful person anyway she
drove us through areas that were right
you know right in the middle of the
conflict like stop the farm where farmer
Sun had just been murdered by the
British and things like that but one
place she took us to which was quite
interesting was a halfway a kind of a
protected house where there was where
they'd brought in a guy an IRA hitman
who had escaped from a rich prison and
he was in this place with all kind of
guards around and stuff like that
is right in the middle of a war you know
literally and I spent a couple hours
talking to him and I'm basically one
question what do you think you're
achieving you know suppose you kill
something
somebody's British or Protestant and
then he comes back and kills your
friends and so on what's the point and
he said just what I said before I was
actually quoting him they killed my
cousin I'm gonna kill their uncle
they're gonna kill my brother
I'm gonna kill their daughter you know
and that's what it is there's nothing
else this just becomes the psychology of
civil conflict incidentally this guy a
couple years later was on a negotiating
team I think he's now in the government
things can change but but it was you
know that's a dynamic that you see all
the time and it conflicts and it's kind
of understandable horrible but
understandable that's why it's so
important to work to try to dampen down
the cycle of violence so maybe something
decent can come out thank you thank you
everyone for coming professor Chomsky
