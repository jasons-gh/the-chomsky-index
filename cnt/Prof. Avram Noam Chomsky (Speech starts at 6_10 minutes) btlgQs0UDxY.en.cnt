gentlemen ladies and gentlemen welcome
with me our keynote speaker professor
Noam Chomsky who is going to be talking
to us in a couple of minutes once he
negotiates the price and yes you may
actually sort of you know encourage him
to come in with a little bit of applause
as we always do
and of course ladies and gentlemen as
you see on not only you have a great
interest in what mr. Chomsky is about to
tell us and share with us but of course
the press the colleagues that will be
covering both his speech and also do
some interviews later have a great
interest in getting the right photo so
mr. Tommy oh yeah we love that smile
that's absolutely you know I mean when
you have that smile everybody in Germany
will will love you as well I mean we
love you anyway but still you know sorry
um by the way this is this is not saying
that everybody needs to take a photo of
mr. Chomsky now because otherwise he's
going to charge us and you know one
photo 1 euro could become a tad on the
expensive side so I'm very sure ladies
and gentlemen our professional
colleagues our professional colleagues
are coming to grips with the situation
and wouldn't it be much nicer to take a
photo when mr. Chomsky is actually in
action and talking to us so thank you
very much ladies and gentlemen or fine
thank you
okay couldnt ask the colleagues with the
cameras with the iphones with whatever
to let us kick off the keynote because
otherwise the boat will leave without us
so thank you very much right mr. Chomsky
is absolutely wonderful to have you here
I'd would like to have a proper star to
your session so maybe we can start with
some visuals first the billions of
people living on earth want to live
their lives in dignity it's a huge
challenge for the global economy and the
media can play an important role the
future of growth economic values and the
media
the focus of the Deutsche Welle global
media forum 2013 from june seventeenth
to jun 19th in bonn ok and the most
famous keynotes because well as already
in this room as you've seen any of
plotted ladies and gentleman littell you
as a moderator it's the most terrible
thing to introduce somebody that
probably everybody in the room knows
better than yourself so i will stick to
a couple of superlatives that are
connected to noam chomsky he's not just
a world citizen he is a leading
intellectual and he's been hailed so by
a number of newspapers in the US for a
number of years he is called one of the
most famous political activists but
you've also been called a dissident
which in the context of the u.s. is at
least an unusual combination of the two
words and one of the things that we all
admire you for is because you've always
engaged for a more just world and I
think recently are one of the claims to
fame is that you have supported the
Occupy movement all around the globe
ever since its inception with interviews
with your perception of how it goes and
if I may add something to the enormous
amount of positive things being said
about you is I think personally it must
be absolutely fabulous to region age
where you see where your ideas and
thoughts have actually grown seeds and
seeds have started to grow into plants
and some of them have already become
trees so mr. Chomsky we're very much
looking forward to listening to what
you've got to say to us in the next 45
minutes so could I please engage you to
come over to the podium
thank you very much I'd like to comment
on topics that I think should regularly
be on the front pages but are not and in
many crucial cases are scarcely
mentioned at all or are presented in
ways that seem to be deceptive because
they're framed almost reflexively in
terms of doctrines of the powerful in
these comments all focused primarily on
the United States for several reasons
one it's the most important country in
terms of its power and influence second
that's the most advanced not in its
inherent character but in the sense that
because of its power other societies
tend to move in that direction and the
third reason is just that I know it
better but I think what I say Jen well
save generalizes much more widely at
least to my knowledge obviously there's
some variations so I'll be concerned
than with tendencies in American society
and what they portend for the world
given American power American power is
diminishing as it has been in fact since
its peak in 1945 but it's still
incomparable and it's dangerous Obama's
remarkable global terror campaign and
the the limited pathetic reaction to it
in the West is one shocking example and
it is a campaign of international
terrorism by far the most extreme in the
world those who harbor any doubts on
that should read the report issued by
Stanford University and New York
University and actually all return to
even more serious examples than
international terrorism according to
receive doctrine that we live in
capitalist democracies which are the
best possible system despite some flaws
there's been an interesting debate over
the years about the relation between
capitalism and democracy so for example
are they are they even compatible I
won't be pursuing this because I'd like
to speak to discuss a different system
at what we could call a really existing
capitalist democracy our ecd for short
pronounced wrecked by accident to begin
with how does wreck compare with
democracy well that depends on what we
mean by democracy there are several
versions of this one there is again a
kind of a received version its soaring
rhetoric of the Obama of variety
patriotic speeches what children are
taught in school and so on and the US
version its government of By and For the
People and it's quite easy to compare
that with wrecked in the United States
one of the main topics of academic
political science is the study of
attitudes and policy and their
correlation a study of attitudes is
reasonably easy in the United States
heavily poll society
serious and accurate polls policy you
can see so that you can compare them and
the results are interesting in the work
that's essentially the gold standard in
the field it's concluded that forcep
roughly seventy percent of the
population the lower seventy percent on
the wealth income scale they have no
influence on policy whatsoever they're
effectively disenfranchised as you move
up the wealth income a ladder you get a
little bit more influence on policy when
you get to the top which is maybe a
tenth of one percent people essentially
get what they want that is they
determine the policy so the proper term
for that is not democracy its plutocracy
this inquiries of this kind it turn out
to be dangerous stuff because they can
tell people too much about the nature of
the society in which they live so
fortunately a congress has banned
funding for them so we want to worry
about them in the future these
characteristics of wrecked show up all
the time so the major domestic issue in
the United States for the public is jobs
polls show that very clearly for the
very wealthy and the financial
institutions the major issue is the
deficit well what about policy there's
now sequester in the United States cut
sharp cut back and funds is that because
of jobs or is it because of the deficit
well the deficit Europe incidentally is
much worse so outlandish that the even
the Wall Street Journal has been
appalled by the dis
of democracy in Europe a couple of weeks
ago and had an article which all were
concluded that the French the Spanish
the Irish the Dutch Portuguese Greek
slovenia and slovakia ins and Cypriots
after varying degrees voted against the
currency bloc's economic model since the
crisis began three years ago yet
economic policies have changed little in
response to one electoral defeat after
another the left has replaced the right
the right has ousted the left even the
center-right trounced communists and
Cyprus but the economic policies have
essentially remained the same the
government's will continue to cut
spending and raise taxes doesn't matter
what people think that national
governments must follow macroeconomic
directives set by the European
Commission elections are close to
meaningless very much as in third world
countries that are ruled by the
international financial institutions
that's what Europe has chosen to become
doesn't have to well returning to the
United States with situations not quite
that bad that there's the same disparity
between public opinion and policy on a
very wide range of issues so take for
example the issue of the minimum wage
one view is that the minimum wage ought
to be indexed to the cost of living and
high enough to prevent falling below the
poverty line that's eighty percent of
the public support that forty percent of
the wealthy what's the minimum wage
going down way below these levels a same
with laws that facilitate union activity
strongly supported by the public opposed
by the very wealthy disappearing the
same strong national health care the US
as you may know has a health system was
international scandal as twice the per
capita costs of other OECD countries
relatively poor outcomes the only
private eyes pretty much unregulated
system the public doesn't like it
they've been calling for national health
care public options for years but the
financial institutions think it's fine
so that stays stasis in fact if the
United States had a health care system
like comparable countries there wouldn t
be any deficit the deficit would be
erased famous deficit which doesn't
matter that much anyway well the it one
of the most interesting cases it has to
do with taxes for 35 years there have
been polls on what do you think taxes
audibly and large majorities have held
that the corporations and the wealthy
should pay higher taxes they've steadily
been going down through this period on
and on a policy throughout is almost the
opposite of public opinion which is a
typical property of raked in the past
the United States says sometimes kind of
sardonically been described as a
one-party state of the business party
with two factions called Democrats and
Republicans that's no longer true it's
still a one-party state the business
party but don't has one faction the
faction is moderate Republicans who are
now called Democrats there are no
virtually no moderate Republican what's
called the Democratic Party and
virtually no Liberal Democrats and
what's called the Democratic Party it's
basically a party of what would be
moderate Republicans and someone like
Richard Nixon would be way at the left
of the political spectrum today
eisenhower would be
outer space there is still something
called the Republican Party but it long
ago abandoned any pretense of being a
normal parliamentary party it's in
lockstep service to the very rich in the
corporate sector has a catechism that
everyone has to chant in unison kind of
like the old communist party this
distinguished the conservative
commentator one of the most respected
Norman Ornstein describes today's
Republican Party as in his words a
radical insurgency ideologically extreme
scornful effects and compromise
dismissive of its political opposition
serious danger to the society as he
points out well in short without going
on really existing capitalist democracy
is very remote from the soaring rhetoric
about democracy but there is another
version of democracy actually it's the
standard doctrine of progressive
contemporary democratic theory so I'll
give some illustrative quotes from per
group from leading figures in saline on
figures on the right these are all good
Woodrow Wilson FDR Kennedy liberals
mainstream ones in fact so according to
this view of this version of democracy
all quote the public are ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders they have to be put
in their place decisions must be in the
hands of an intelligent minority of
responsible men who have to be protected
from the trampling and roar of the
bewildered heard the herd has a function
as it's called they're supposed to lend
their weight every few years to a choice
among the responsible men but apart from
that their function is to be speck
not participants in action and it's for
their own good because as the founder of
liberal political science pointed out we
should not succumb to democratic
dogmatism 'he's about people being the
best judges of their own interest
they're not we are the best judges so it
would be irresponsible to let them make
choices like just as it would be
irresponsible to let a three-year-old
run into the street attitudes and
opinions therefore have to be controlled
in the benefit for the benefit of those
you're controlling it's necessary to
regiment their minds that's necessary
also to discipline the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young all quotes incidentally and if
we can do this we might be able to get
back to the good old days when Truman
had been able to govern the country with
the cooperation of a relatively small
number of Wall Street lawyers and
bankers this is all from icons of the
liberal establishment the leading
progressive Democratic theorists some of
you may recognize some of the quotes the
roots of these attitudes go back quite
far they go back to the first stirrings
of the modern democracy the first were
in England in the 17th century as you
know the later in the United States and
they persist in fundamental ways the
first democratic revolution was England
in the 1640s there was a civil war
between King and Parliament but the
gentry the people who call themselves
the men of best quality were appalled by
the rising popular forces that were
beginning to appear on the public arena
now they didn't want to support either
king or Parliament quote their pamphlets
they didn't want to be ruled by knights
and gentle
who do but a press us but we want to be
governed by people countrymen like
ourselves who know the people sores
that's pretty terrifying sight and the
rebel has been pretty terrifying sight
ever since actually was long before it
remained so a century after the British
British democratic revolution the
founders of the American Republic had
pretty much the same view about the
rabble so they determined i'll quote
that power must be in the hands of the
wealth of the nation the more
responsible set of men those who have
sympathy for property owners and their
rights and of course for slave owners at
the time and who understand that a
fundamental task of government is to
protect the minority of the opulent from
the majority those are quotes from james
madison the main framers was in the
Constitutional Convention which is much
more revealing than the Federalist
Papers which people read Federalist
Papers were basically propaganda effort
to try to get the public to go along
with the system but the debates in the
Constitutional Convention are much more
revealing and in fact the constitutional
system was created on that basis and all
the time to go through it but it
basically adhere to the principle which
was enunciated simply by John Jay was
the president of the Constitutional
Convention first Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court and as he put it those who
own the country bought a government
that's the primary doctrine of wrecked
to the present they've been any popular
struggles since they've won many
victories the Masters however do not
relent the more freedom is one of the
more intense
are the efforts to redirect the society
to a proper course and the 20th century
progressive democratic theory that I've
just sampled is not very different from
the wrecked that has been achieved apart
from the question of which responsible
men should rule should it be bankers or
intellectual elites or for that matter
should it be the central committee in a
different version of similar doctrines
well another important feature of
wrecked is that the public must be kept
in the dark about what is happening to
them the herd must remain bewildered the
reasons were explained lucidly by the
professor of the science of government
at harvard it's the official name
another respected liberal figure Samuel
Huntington as he pointed out power
remains strong when it remains in the
dark exposed to sunlight it begins to
evaporate Bradley Manning is facing a
life in prison for failure to comprehend
this scientific principle now Edward
Snowden Snowden as well and it works
pretty well if you take a look at polls
reveals how well it works so for example
polls review recent polls pretty
consistently reveal that Republicans are
preferred to Democrats on most issues
and crucially on the issues in which the
public opposes the policies of the
Republicans and favors the policies of
the Democrats the one striking example
of this is that majorities say that they
favor the Republicans on tax policy
while the same majorities oppose those
policies and this runs across the board
this is even true of the far right the
Tea Party types this goes along with in
a
noshing level of contempt for government
opinion about Congress favor of opinions
about Congress aren't literally in the
single digits rest of the government as
well that's all declining sharply well
results such of these which are pretty
consistent illustrate demoralisation of
the public of a kind that's unusual
although there are examples the late by
our republic comes to mind the tasks of
ensuring that the rabble keep to their
function as bewildered and spectators it
takes many forms the simplest form is
simply to restrict entry into the
political system Iran just had an
election as you know and it was rightly
criticized because on the grounds that
even to participate you had to be vetted
by the guardian council of clerics well
in the United States you don't have to
be vetted by clerics and rather you have
to be vetted by concentrations of
private capital unless you pass their
filter you don't enter the political
system with very very rare exceptions
there are many mechanisms they're too
familiar to review and run through them
but that's not safe enough either there
are major institutions which are
specifically dedicated to undermining
authentic democracy one of them is
called the public relations industry
huge industry it was in fact developed
on the principle that it's necessary to
regiment the minds of men much as we
regiment the enormity of regiments at
soldiers I was actually quoting from one
of its leading figures before and
the role of the pr industry in elections
is to specific as explicitly to
undermine you know the school child
version of democracy which you learn in
school is the democracies base are based
on informed voters making rational
decisions and all you have to do it
let's take a look at electoral campaign
and see that the purpose of the penis
they're run by the pr industry the
purpose is to create uninformed voters
who will make irrational decisions and
for the pr industry that's a very easy
transition from their primary function
the primary functions commercial
advertising and commercial advertising
is designed to undermine markets if you
took an economics course you learned
that markets are based on informed
consumers making rational choices if you
turn on the TV set you see that ads are
designed to create irrational uninformed
consumers making irrational choices the
whole purpose is to undermine the
markets in the technical sense that's
and they're well aware of it
incidentally so for example after
Obama's election in 2008 a couple months
later the advertising industry had its
annual conference and every year they
award a prize for the best marketing
campaign of the year and that year they
awarded it to Obama he beat out apple
computer that even a better job and
diluting the public or his PR agents did
if you want to hear some of it turn on
the television today
and listen to the soaring rhetoric and
Belfast but its standard and though they
were interesting commentary on this in
the business press when primarily the
London Financial Times which had a long
article of interviewing executives about
what they thought about the election and
they were quite euphoric about this they
said this gives them a new model for how
to delude the public you know the Obama
model it can replace the Reagan model
which worked pretty well for a while
well the turning of the economy the core
of the economy today is financial
institutions they've vastly expanded
since the 1970s along with a parallel
development accelerated shift of
production abroad there are also been
critical changes in the character of
financial institutions go back to the
1960s were banks you put your kids money
put in the bank it led it to somebody to
buy a house or start a business or
whatever that's a very marginal aspect
of financial institutions today they're
mostly devoted to intricate financial
exotic manipulations with markets and
they're huge in the United States
financial institutions big banks most we
had forty percent of corporate profit in
2007 that was on the eve of the
financial crisis for which they were
largely responsible after the crisis a
number of professional economists Nobel
laureate Robert Solow Harvard's Benjamin
freedom Friedman wrote articles in which
they pointed out that economists haven't
done much study of the in
act of the financial institutions on the
economy which is kind of remarkable
considering its scale but after the
crisis they took a look and they both
concluded that probably the impact of
the financial institutions on the
economy is negative actually there are
some who are much more outspoken than
that so the most respected financial
correspondent in the english-speaking
world is Martin wolf of the Financial
Times he writes that an out the
out-of-control financial sector is
eating out the modern market economy
from inside just as the larvae of the
spider wasp eats out the host in which
it has been laid by the market economy
he means the productive economy there
was a recent issue of the main business
weekly Bloomberg Businessweek which
reported a study of the IMF that found
that the look the big banks the largest
banks make no profit what they earn
according to their and now the IMF
analysis traces to the government
insurance policy the so-called too big
to fail policy the there is a widely
publicized bailout but that's the least
of it the whole series of other devices
by which the government insurance policy
aids the big banks should credit many
other things and according to the IMF at
least that's the totality of their
profit the editors of the journals say
this is crucial to understanding why the
big banks presents such a threat to the
global economy and to the people of the
country of course after the crash there
was the first serious attention by
professional economists through what's
called systemic risk and they knew it
existed but it wasn't much of a topic
of Investigation systemic risk means the
the risk that when you if a transaction
fails all system may collapse that's
what's called an externality and
economic theory is a footnote and it's
one of the fundamental flaws of market
systems and inherent flaw well known is
externalities every transaction has
impacts on others which just aren't
taken into account in a market
transaction systemic risk is a big one
and there are much more serious
illustrations than that I'll come back
to it well what about the productive
economy under wrecked that here there's
a mantra to the mantra is it's based on
entrepreneurial initiative and consumer
choice in a free market and there are
agreements established called free trade
agreements which are based on the mantra
that it's all mythology the reality is
that there's massive state intervention
in the productive economy and the free
trade agreements are anything but free
trade agreements should be obvious just
to take one example the IT revolution
information technology revolution which
is driving the economy that was based on
decades of work and effectively the
state sector hard costly creative work
substantial in the state sector no
consumer choice at all there was some
entrepreneurial initiative but it was
largely limited to getting government
grants or bail
sir procurement that's a under Essex at
by some economists and underestimated
but of our very significant factor in
corporate profit she can't sell
something handed over the government
though and by the after a long period
decades in fact of hard creative work
the primary primary rd research and
development the results are handed over
to private enterprise for
commercialization and profit that's
steve jobs and bill gates and so on it's
not quite that simple of course but it's
that's a core part of the picture the
system goes way back to the origins of
industrial economies but it's
dramatically true since World War two
this ought to be the core of the study
of the productive economy well another
central aspect of rectus concentration
of capital so just in the past 20 years
in the United States the share of
profits of the 200 largest enterprises
has very sharply risen probably the
impact of the internet it seems these
tendencies towards oligopoly also
undermine the mantra of course
interesting topics but I won't pursue
him any further well instead I'd like to
turn to another question what are the
prospects for the future under raped
there's an answer it's pretty grim it's
no secret that there are a number of
dark shadows that hover over every topic
that we discuss and there are two that
are particularly ominous I'll keep those
there are others that one is
environmental catastrophe the others
nuclear war of both of which of course
threatened the prospects for decent
survival and not in the remote future
well I won't say very much about the
first environmental catastrophe that
should be obvious certainly it should be
the scale of the danger should be
obvious to anyone with eyes open anyone
who's literate particularly those who
read scientific journals every issue of
a technical journal virtually has more
dire warnings than the last one and
there are various reactions to this
around the world there are some who seek
to act decisively to prevent a possible
catastrophe at the other extreme the
major efforts are underway to accelerate
the danger leading the effort to
intensify the likely disaster is the
richest and most powerful country in
world history with incomparable
advantages and the most prominent
example of wrecked the one that others
are striving towards leading the efforts
to preserve conditions that in which our
immediate descendants might have a
decent life are the so-called primitive
societies First Nations in Canada
Aboriginal societies in Australia tribal
societies others like them the countries
that have large and influential
indigenous populations are well in the
lead in the effort to defend the earth
or phrase the countries that have
indigenous popular in and dizziness
poppy
relations to extinction or extreme
marginalization are racing forward
enthusiastically towards destruction
this is always one of the major features
of modern of contemporary history one of
those things that ought to be on front
page so take say Ecuador which has a
large indigenous population it's seeking
aid from the rich countries to allow it
to keep its substantial hydrocarbon
reserves underground which is where they
ought to be meanwhile the US and Canada
are enthusiastically seeking to burn
every drop of fossil fuels including
those dangerous kind Canadian tar sands
and to do so as quick quickly and fully
as possible without a side glance on
what the world might look like after
this extravagant commitment to
self-destruction actually every issue of
the daily papers suffices to illustrate
this lunacy and lunacy is the right word
for it that's exactly the opposite of
what rationality would demand unless
it's the skewed rationality of wrecked
well there have been massive corporate
campaigns to implant and safeguard the
lunacy but despite them there's still a
real problem in American society the
public is still too committed to
scientific rationality one of the many
divergences between policy and opinion
is that the American public is close to
the global norm in concern about the
environment and calling for actions to
prevent catastrophe and that's a pretty
high level meanwhile bipartisan policy
is dedicated to bringing it on and the
phrase the george w bush made
famous in the case of Iraq fert
fortunately the corporate sector as is
riding to the rescue to over deal with
this problem there is a corporate funded
organization american legislative
exchange council alec pull its designs
legislation for states need to comment
on what kind of legislation and it's now
institute and big a lot of clout lot of
money behind them so the programs tend
to get instituted right now they are
instituting a new program to try to
overcome the excessive rationality of
the public it's a program of instruction
for the K to 12 kindergarten to 12th
grade schools to as its publicity says
that the idea is to improve critical
faculties certainly be in favor of that
by balanced teaching a balanced teaching
means that if a sixth-grade class
learned something about what's happening
to the climate they have to be presented
with material on climate change denial
so that they have balanced teaching and
can develop their critical faculties
maybe that will help overcome the
failure of massive corporate propaganda
campaigns to make the population
ignorant and irrational enough to
safeguard short-term profit for the rich
it's plainly the goal in several states
have already accepted it well it's worth
remembering without pursuing it that
these these are deep-seated
institutional properties of wrecked but
not easy to uproot now all of this is
apart from the institutional necessity
to maximize short-term profit while
ignoring an externality that's
vastly more serious even than systemic
risk for systemic risk the market
failure the culprits can run to the
powerful nanny state that they foster
with cap in hand and they'll be filled
out as we've just observed again and
will in the future in the case of
destruction of the environment the
conditions for decent existence there's
no guardian angel around nobody to run
through with cap in hand for that reason
alone the prospects were decent survival
under rack dark quite dim let's turn to
the other shadow nuclear war it's a
threat that's been with us for 70 years
it still is in some ways it's growing
that one of the reasons for it is that
under wrecked the rights and needs of
the general population or a minor matter
that extends to security there is
another prevailing mantra particularly
in academic professions the claiming
that governments seek to protect
national security anyone who's studied
international relations theory has heard
that that's mostly mythology the
government's seek to extend power and
domination and to benefit their primary
domestic constituencies in the u.s.
primarily the corporate sector the
consequence is the security does not
have a high priority actually we see
that all the time right now in fact so
take say Obama's operation to murdered
osama bin laden prime suspect for the
911 attack suspect of course he made an
important speech Obama on national
security left last name
23rd widely covered I'm sure it was
covered here but there was one crucial
paragraph in the speech that was ignored
in the coverage Obama held the operation
took pride in an operation incidentally
which is another step dismantling the
foundations of anglo-american law for
back to Magna Carta the namely
presumption of innocence but that's by
now so familiar it's not even necessary
to talk about it but there was another
there's more to it Obama did hell the
operation but he added that it cannot be
the norm the reason is Oh continue to
quote him is that the risks were immense
the Navy SEALs who carried out the
murder might have been embroiled in an
extended firefight but even though by
luck that didn't happen the cost to our
relationship with Pakistan and the
backlash among the Pakistani public over
the encroachment on their territory the
aggression in other words was so severe
that we're just now beginning to rebuild
this important partnership it's more
than that let's add a couple of details
the seals were under orders to fight
their way out as they were apprehended
they would not have been left of their
fate if they had been in Obama's words
embroiled in an extended firefight the
full force of the US military that would
have been employed to extricate them
Pakistan has a powerful military it's
well trained highly protective of state
sovereign sovereignty of course it has
nuclear weapons and leading Pakistani
specialists on nuclear policy and issues
are quite concerned by the exposure of
the nuclear weapons system to jaw
elements could have escalated to a
nuclear war and in fact it came pretty
close and while the seals were still in
the bin Laden compound the Pakistani
chief of staff general kahani was
informed of the invasion and he ordered
his staff and his words to confront any
unidentified aircraft that he assumed it
was probably coming from India the
meanwhile in Kabul General David
Petraeus at the Central Command ordered
in quoting ordered us warplanes to
respond if Pakistanis scrambled their
fighter jets it was that close well
going back to Obama by luck it didn't
happen but the risk was faced with
without notice noticeable concern
without even reporting in fact well
there's a lot more to say about that
operation and its immense cost of
Pakistan but instead of that let's look
more closely at the concern for security
more generally beginning with security
from terror and then turning to the much
more important question of security from
instant destruction by nuclear weapons
well as i mentioned Obama is now
conducting the world's greatest
international terrorist campaign the
drone special forces campaign it's also
a terror generating campaign common
understanding at the highest level that
these actions generate potential
terrorists quote the General Stanley
McChrystal Petraeus's predecessor he
says that for every innocent person you
kill and there plenty of them you create
10 new enemies to take the Marathon
bombing in Boston a couple of months ago
you'll read about probably didn't read
about the fact that two days after them
taunton bombing there was a drone
bombing in Yemen usually we don't happen
to hear much about throwing bombings
they just go on because straight terror
operations which the media aren't
interested in because we don't care
about international terrorism as long as
the victims or somebody else but this
one we happen to know about by accident
one there was a young man from the
village that was attacked who was in the
United States and he happened to testify
before Congress and he testified about
it he said that for several years the
jihadi elements in Yemen had been trying
to turn the village against Americans
get them to hate Americans but the
villagers didn't accept it because the
only thing they knew about the United
States was what he told them and he
liked the United States so he was
telling him it's great place of the jadi
efforts didn't work then he said one
drone attack has turned the entire
village into people who hate America and
want to destroy it they killed the man
who everybody knew and they could easily
lap rien dit if they wanted but in turn
international terror campaigns we don't
worry about that and we don't worry
about the security one of the striking
examples was the invasion of Iraq the US
and British intelligence agencies
informed their governments that the
invasion of Iraq was likely to lead to
an increase in terrorism they didn't
care in fact it did terrorism increased
by a factor of seven the first year
after the Iraqi invasions according to
government statistics right now the
government is defending the massive
surveillance operation that's on the
front pages the defense is on grounds
that we have to do it to apprehend
terrorists if there were a free press an
authentic free press the headlines would
be ridiculing this claim on the grounds
that policy is designed in such a way
that it
the terrorists risk but you can't find
that which one of innumerable
indications of how far we are from
anything that might be called a free
press well it's turned to the more
serious problem instant destruction by
nuclear weapons that's never been a high
concern for state authorities and there
are many striking examples actually we
know a lot about it because the United
States is an unusually free and open
society and there's plenty of internal
documents that are released so we can
find out about it if we like let's go
back to nineteen fifty 1950 US security
was just overwhelming there's never been
anything like it in human history there
was one potential danger ICBMs with
hydrogen bomb warheads they didn't exist
but they were going to exist sooner or
later the Russians knew that they were
way behind in military technology and
they offered the United States say a
treaty to ban the development of ICBMs
with with hydrogen bomb warheads that
would have been a terrific contribution
to us security well there is a major
history one major history of nuclear
weapons policy by written by McGeorge
Bundy the security national security
advisor for Kennedy and Johnson and in
his study he has a couple of casual
sentences on this he said that he was
unable to find even a staff paper
discussing this here comes here's a
possibility to save the country from
total disaster and there wasn't even a
paper discussing it no and care forget
it will go on to the important things a
couple years later in 1952 Stalin made a
public offer to which is pretty
remarkable to permit unit
of Germany with internationally
supervised free elections in which
communists would certainly lose on one
condition that Germany be demilitarized
is hardly a minor issue for the Russians
the Germany alone had practically
destroyed them several times in the
century and Germany militarized in part
of a hostile Western alliance as a major
threat so that was the offer while the
offer was public it also of course would
have led to an end to the official
reason for NATO it was public it was
dismissed with ridicule couldn't be true
there were a few people who took it
seriously James Warburg respected
international commentator but he was
just dismissed with ridicule today
scholars are looking back at it
especially with the Russian archives
opened opening up and they're
discovering that in fact it was
apparently serious but couldn't be
nobody could pay attention to it just
didn't accord with policy imperatives
vast reduction the threat of war of
course let's go on a couple of years to
the late 50s when Khrushchev took over
he recognized that Russia was way behind
economically and that it could not
compete with the United States and
military technology and hope to carry
out economic development which he was
talking to do so he offered a sharp
mutual cut back in offensive weapons the
Eisenhower administration kind of
dismissed it the Kennedy administration
listens inch gaming
paid attention they considered the
possibility and they rejected her chef
went on to reduce to make introduce a
sharp unilateral r addiction at
reduction of offensive weapons Kennedy
administration observed that and decided
to extend expand offensive military
capacity not just rejected that expanded
it was already way ahead that was one
reason why first Jeff paste bet placed
missiles in Cuba in 1962 try to redress
the balance slightly that led to what
historian Arthur Schlesinger Kennedy's
advisor called the most dangerous moment
in world history Cuban Missile Crisis
actually there was another reason for it
the Kennedy administration was carrying
out a major terrorist operation against
Cuba massive terrorism it's the kind of
terrorism that the West doesn't care
about because somebody else's the
victims of didn't get reported but it
was large scale furthermore the terror
operation operation Mongoose was called
the had a plan it was to culminate in an
American invasion in October 1962 well
the Russians and the Cubans may not have
known all the details but it's likely
that they knew this month much that was
another reason for placing defensive
missiles in Cuba and then came very
tense weeks as you know they culminated
on october twenty sixth of the month at
that time b---fifty twos armed with
nuclear weapons were ready to attack
Moscow the military instructions
permitted crews to launch nuclear war
without central control was
decentralized command the Kennedy
himself was leaning towards military
action
to eliminate the missiles from Cuba his
own subjective estimate of the
probability of nuclear war was between a
third and a half that would have
essentially wiped out the northern
hemisphere at that point on October 26
the letter came from Khrushchev to
Kennedy offering to end the crisis how
by withdrawal of Russian missiles from
Cuba in return for withdrawal of u.s.
missiles from Turkey of Kennedy in fact
didn't even though they're worried
missiles in Turkey but he was informed
of that his advisors one of the reason
he didn't know is they were obsolete and
they were being withdrawn anyway they're
being replaced with far more lethal
invulnerable polaris submarines so that
was the offer the Russians withdraw
missiles from Cuba the u.s. withdraw
obsolete missiles that's already
withdrawing from Turkey which of course
a much greater threat to Russia the
missiles were in Cuba Kennedy refused
that's probably the most horrendous
decision in human history in my opinion
he was taking a huge risk of destroying
the world in order to establish a
principle the principle is that we have
the right to threaten anyone with
destruction anyway we like but it's a
unilateral right and no one may threaten
us even to try to deter a planned
invasion a much worse than this is the
lesson that has been taken away the
Kennedy is praised for his cool courage
under pressure it's the standard version
today well the threats continued ten
years later Henry Kissinger called a
nuclear alert 1973 the purpose was to
warn the Russians not to intervene in
the Israel Arab conflict what had
happened
that russia in the united states had
agreed to institute a ceasefire but
Kissinger had privately informed Israel
that they didn't have to pay any
attention to it they could keep going
and Kissinger didn't want the Russians
to interfere so he called a nuclear
alert going on 10 years at Ronald
Reagan's in office his administration
decided the probe Russian defenses by
simulating air and naval attacks air
attacks into Russian naval attacks on
its border well naturally this caused
considerable alarm in Russia which
unlike the United States is quite
vulnerable and had repeatedly been
invaded and virtually destroyed that led
to a major war scare in 1983 we have
newly released archives that tell us how
dangerous it was much more dangerous
than historians had assumed there's a
current CIA study just came out it's
entitled the war scare was for real was
close to nuclear war they conclude that
us intelligence underestimated the
threat of a Russian preventive strike a
nuclear strike fearing that the u.s. was
attacking the most recent issue current
issue of the journal of Strategic
Studies one of the main journals writes
that this almost became a prelude to a
preventive nuclear strike and it
continues I won't go through details but
the bin Laden assassination is a recent
one well there are now three new threats
I'm going to cut back going yeah well
I'll try to be brief but let me mention
three cases that are on the front pages
right now North Korea Iran China are
worth looking at so North Korea has been
issuing wild dangerous threats that's
attributed to the lunacy of their
leaders it could be argued that it's the
most dangerous government craziest
government the world worst government
probably true but if we want to reduce
the threats instead of march blindly in
unison there are a few things to
consider one of them is that the current
crisis began with us south korean war
games which included for the first time
ever i'm quoting a simulation of a
pre-emptive attack in an all-out war
scenario against North Korea part of
these exercises were simulated nuclear
bombings against on the borders of North
Korea well that brings up some memories
for the North Korean leadership for
example they can remember that 60 years
ago there was a superpower that
virtually leveled the entire country and
when there was nothing left the bomb
that the United States turned to bombing
dams some of you may recall that that
was you could get death penalty for that
at Nuremberg that's a war crime and even
if Western it elections and the media
choose to ignore the documents the North
Korean leadership can read public
documents the official Air Force reports
of the time which are worth reading I
urge you to read them they exalted over
the glorious sight of massive floods
quoting that scooped clear 27 miles of
valley below devastated 75% of the
controlled water supply for North
Korea's rice
production sent the commissar scurrying
to the press and radio centres to Blair
to the world the most severe hate-filled
harangues to come from the communist
propaganda mill in the three years of
warfare to the Communists the Smashing
of the dams meant primarily the
destruction of their chief sustenance
rice Westerners can little conceive the
awesome meaning which the loss of this
staple food commodity has for Asians
starvation and slow death hence the show
of rage the flare of violent tempers and
the threats of replies reprisals when
bombs fell on 5 irrigation dams well
like other potential targets the crazed
North Korean leaders can also read
high-level documents which are publicly
classified which outline US strategic
doctrine one of the most important is a
study by Clinton's Strategic Command
Stratcom central's of Cold War
deterrence on quote it's about the role
of nuclear weapons in the post-cold war
era and its central conclusions are us
must retain the right of first strike
even against non-nuclear States
furthermore nuclear weapons must always
be available at the ready because they
cast a shadow over any crisis or
conflict that frightened adversaries so
they're constantly being used just as if
you're you're using a gun if you go into
a store pointing the gun at the store
owner fire but you're using the gun
Stratcom goes on to say planner should
not be too rational in determining what
the opponent values the most all of it
has to be targeted it hurts to portray
ourselves as to fully rational
and cool-headed that the United States
may become irrational and vindictive if
it's vital interests are attacked should
be part of the national persona that we
project it's beneficial for our
strategic posture if some elements
appear to be potentially out of control
that that's not Richard Nixon or George
W Bush it's Bill Clinton again Western
intellectuals and media choose not to
look but potential targets don't have
that luxury well it's also a recent
history that the North Korean leaders
know quite well I'm not going to review
it because of lack of time but it's very
revealing this quote mainstream us
scholarship north Korea has been playing
tit for tat reciprocating whenever
Washington cooperates retaliating
whenever Washington renee's undoubtedly
it's a horrible place but the record
does suggest directions that would
reduce the threat of war if that were
the intention certainly not military
maneuvers and simulated nuclear bombing
well let me turn to the gravest threat
to world peace Obama's words dutifully
repeated in the press Iran's nuclear
program raises a couple of questions who
thinks it's a the gravest threat that
what is the threat how can you deal with
it whatever it is who thinks that the
threat is easy to answer to Western
obsession the US and its allies say its
greatest threat and not the rest of the
world not the non-aligned countries not
the Arab states the Arab populations
don't like it ran but
regards as much a threat they regard the
US as the threat in Iraq and Egypt for
example the US as regarded as the major
threat they face hard to understand why
well what is the threat we know the
answer from the highest level the US
intelligence and the Pentagon they
provide estimates to Congress every year
you can read them global security
analysis of course review this they say
the main threat of a Iranian nuclear
program if they're developing weapons
they don't know but they say if they're
developing weapons it would be part of
the deterrence strategy and the US can't
accept that a state that claims the
right to use force and violence anywhere
whenever it wants cannot accept a
deterrent so they're a threat that's the
threat listen just take the doctrines I
just quoted and understand why well how
can you deal with the threat whatever it
is actually there are ways I'm a short
time I won't go through details but
there's one very striking one we've just
passed an opportunity the last december
of last december there was to be an
international conference under the
auspices of and non-proliferation treaty
UN auspices in helsinki it to deal with
moves to establish a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the Middle East now
that has been that is overwhelming
international support online countries
it's been led by the Arab states Egypt
particularly for decades overwhelming
support if it could be carried forward
it was certainly mitigate the threat
might eliminate it well everyone was
waiting to see whether Iran would
10 early November Iran agreed to attend
a couple of days later Obama canceled
the conference no conference the
european parliament passed a resolution
calling for it to continue the error the
arab state said they were going to
proceed anyway but can't be done okay
I'll be done in a second so we have to
live with the gravest threat the world
peace unless of course now we have to
possibly march on the war which in fact
is being predicted the population could
do something about it if they knew
anything about it but here are the Free
Press enters in the United States there
has literally not been a single word
about this anywhere near the mainstream
you can tell me about Europe well the
last potential confrontation is China
it's an interesting one but time is
short so I won't go on the last comment
I'd like to make goes in a somewhat
different direction i mentioned Magna
Carta that's the foundations of modern
law that will soon be commemorating the
800th anniversary we won't be
celebrating it more likely in Turing
what little is left of its bones after
the flesh has been picked off by ambush
and Obama and their colleagues in Europe
and Europe has involved clearly but
there's another part of the Magna Carta
which has been forgotten it had two
components one is the charter of
liberties which is being dismantled the
other is that was called the charter the
forests of that called for protection of
the Commons from the depredations of
authority the commons this is England of
course the commons were the traditional
source of obsessed
of food and fuel and sub welfare as well
they were nurtured the commons were
nurtured and sustained for centuries by
traditional societies collectively they
have been steadily dismantled under the
capitalist principle that everything has
to be privately owned which brought with
it the perverse doctrine of called the
tragedy of the Commons a doctrine which
holds that collective possessions will
be despoiled so therefore everything has
to be privately owned I mean the merest
glance that the world shows that the
opposite is true it's privatization that
is destroying the Commons that's why the
indigenous populations in the world of
the world are in the lead in trying to
save Magna Carta from final destruction
by its inheritors and they're joined by
others they say the demonstration
demonstrators in gezi Park and trying to
block the bulldozer in Taksim Square
they're trying to save the last part of
the Commons the last part of the Commons
in Istanbul from the wrecking ball of
commercial destruction this is a kind of
a microcosm of the general defense of
the comp of the Commons they've it's one
part of a global uprising against the
violent neoliberal assault on the
population of the world Europe is
suffering severely from it right now the
uprisings have registered some major
successes the most dramatic are Latin
America in this millennium it's largely
freed itself from the lethal grip of
Western domination first time in 500
years and others other things are
happening too well the general pictures
a pretty grim I think but there are
shafts of light as always through
history there are two trajectories one
lead stores suppression destruction and
the other leads towards freedom and
justice and as always adapt Martin
Luther King's famous phrase there are
ways to bend the arc of the moral
universe towards justice and freedom and
by now even towards survival
mr. Chomsky
thank you so much for sharing your
thoughts with us a couple of times
you've been rather critical of us of the
media of the press you've been saying
that the press doesn't look as well we
don't have time for Q&A but I'm going to
ask that one question for all of us and
maybe you can sort of ask you individual
questions the question is really what
would you like the press to do where is
the difference between what you imagine
could be ideal very simple i like the
press this microphone what's work I'd
like the press to tell the truth about
important things
Oh
well it's 10 to seven once you come down
here we actually have to leave for the
boat why don't you come down here yeah
okay Blazey gentleman was this young man
is coming down once everybody is getting
ready the boat is actually leaving in
not too far the future and I know that
all of you who have been here before no
your way are over to the boat which is
sort of on the Rhine of course so the
other way around we'll be seeing each
other tomorrow morning at the latest at
nine-thirty here in the audience hall
and remember at ten thirty one a
half-hour foreign minister universe
develop speak here in the audience hall
so enjoy your evening it's going to be
an absolutely fabulous boat trip and I'm
quite sure that each everybody would
want to talk to mr. Chomsky please
respect the fact that he's actually
taken more than he wanted to take to
talk to us and respect the fact that at
84 he's been sharing all his energy in
all his ideas with us so Nielsen
you
