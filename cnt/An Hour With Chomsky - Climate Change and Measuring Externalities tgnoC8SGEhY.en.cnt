you
the general public in the United States
is not very far from the rest of the
world and supporting significant action
to do something quickly and
significantly about climate change it's
very distinct for policy you know but
policy in general doesn't reflect public
opinion and the corporate system is
worried about it they are organizing
major campaigns to try to eliminate the
threat of scientific rationality among
the general public and one of them that
they have known is for schools k12 to
try to introduce what they call critical
thinking sounds nice that means balanced
education so if you teach something
about the climate you have to teach
climate change denial
that's gives us balanced education
critical thinking and their purpose is
obvious the public's just too reasonable
and we've got to turn the country into a
you know irrational idiots will be
willing to sacrifice their children for
the profits of the you know Exxon Mobil
tomorrow that's hard
takes a lot of work and activists have
to be ready to counter that
takes a the current financial crisis
that's due to an externality what's
called systemic risk the fact that when
say goldman sachs makes a transaction
they consider if they're paying
attention the risk that they're assuming
but they don't care about the fact that
it might bring down the whole financial
system well that's what happened or take
the environmental crisis the fate of the
species is an externality I can't give a
number to the fate of the species but we
have a qualitative answer to how
significant it is to overlook the
externality of destroying conditions for
decent life to make a little more profit
for the koch brothers yeah you can look
into gonna give a good enough measure of
that
