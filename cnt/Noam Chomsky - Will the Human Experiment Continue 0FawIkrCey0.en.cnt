[Music]
we are witnessing
america as a failed social experiment
how do we tell this story in a way that
builds the kind of emotional momentum
that colorblind ideology built
so many young brothers of the younger
generation
find themselves
[Music]
we're really delighted we have an
extraordinary guest with us on the
tightrope
today we have professor noam chomsky who
is an extraordinary thinker and scholar
and
uh we want to really welcome you to the
tightrope
professor chomsky and uh we'll try to
jump right in and have a conversation
but welcome welcome welcome to the tie
rope thank you very much
before we dive into the deep end i just
wanted to ask
um a lot of people out here care for you
and think of you
as you know a very important sort of you
know
figure spiritual leader in a way and
we're wondering how you're doing with
this pandemic
so can you give us a sense of how you're
doing and how you're feeling and is is
everything okay
it's pretty simple staying at home
not seeing anybody fortunately we're in
arizona where land is
given away it's very cheap so
we bought a small house out of town
has a lot of desert behind
no people a lot of rattlesnakes but they
don't carry coven
so we can walk around let the
dogs run a little we're not totally
cooped up
but i'm busier than i've ever been in my
life
it turns out everybody in the world
wants an interview
a talk statement so i'm on this
device constantly not with great
efficiency as you saw
but somehow managing but it's not a big
problem for us
right right well i'm glad i'm sure many
people will be
yeah very happy to hear that no but i
think one of the reasons why
they're coming after your tooth and nail
is that you are an
international treasure bonafide
unadulterated intellectual genius
reforming linguistic cognitive science
in his 20s the syntactic structures
comes
out and the impact is overwhelming
freedom fighter par excellence be it
occupation domination exploitation no
matter what it is there's a
unbelievable prophetic impulse shot
through
the scientific analysis of empire of
capitalism
of authoritarian form of socialism and
so forth
and then there's just this wonderful
gnome i mean just an exemplary truth
teller
always on call always ready
to lend his time his energy and look at
it now
91 years young all the way from
fair hill street east oak lane
northern section of philadelphia strong
as
ever thing brother
yeah good old northeast philadelphia
yeah it's still so humble still so but
but
let let let's look at this present
situation though
this unprecedented moment of
multi-layered catastrophe is the
possibility of the planet going
under be it nuclear or ecological the
wealth inequality the escalating
neo-fascism the
xenophobic resurgences all around the
world
how as an intellectual does one sustain
the vocation that you talked about way
back
in 1967 that february 23rd peace the
responsibility of intellectuals
delivered at the hell out of society at
harvard initially
in mosaic journal and then in the new
york review of books
how do you sustain that and what do you
make of where most of the intelligence
actually resides and habits and rights
these days
easy to sustain there's basically two
three reasons that one reason is just
looking at history
if you look at history it been through
very hard times
a lot has been accomplished in many ways
it's
a much better country much better world
than it was
in 50 years ago 100 years ago not in all
respects but in many respects
the many battles that were fought hard
and one we can just take for granted and
move on
that's one reason another reason is just
seeing the
remarkable impressive dedication and
activism
of lots of people so take
just what happened after the murder of
george floyd
very quickly the most substantial
social movement in american history
developed spontaneously
with enormous public support lots of
solidarity
working hard to change things that are
important with
courage enthusiasm that's another reason
there's a third reason you basically
don't have any choice
you can either say everything's hopeless
i give up help ensure that the worst
will happen
where you can grasp the opportunities
that exist and they do
exist and maybe you can make it a better
world
it's not much of a choice there's three
very easy reasons to sustain
commitment to the extent that you can
and yet most of me so many of our fellow
intellectuals decide to be conformist
and complacent or downright cowardly
there's something else going on that has
been able to sustain you going in the
opposite direction
people make their choices we can make
ours
these are the ones we ought to make
there's good reasons for them
you make them treasure makes them i try
to make them
more that do the better chance we have
for decent survival
then we should recognize that the issues
today
are literally survival it's
kind of remarkable to look at the
massive coverage of the two conventions
and see that the most crucial issues
that have arisen in all of human history
are not mentioned try to find the word
i mean the critical difference between
the parties whatever you think about
them there actually is a chasm
on two crucial essential
issues issues of survival
are we going to be able to address the
growing environmental catastrophe in
time
or are we not that's a question that has
to be answered within
a decade or two and
whatever you think of the democrats
trump is alone in the world
in pressing the accelerator to race to
disaster
if this malignancy is not removed
we may not survive another four years of
this may get to even
irreversible tipping points if not it
will certainly be
much harder to deal with the problems
that remain in the brief period ahead
no virtually no mention the other issue
which is
equally existential
is the threat of terminal nuclear war
it's higher now than it has been
even during the cold war and increasing
i mean to the extent that the doomsday
clock
last january the analyst dropped
minutes moved to second and since then
trump has made it worse dismantling
the last remnants of the arms control
regime which set
some constraints on the threat of
total destruction and
moving to develop new more threatening
weapons and violation of past treaties
which essentially entices others to do
the same
that means limiting the
prospect of survival the darkening the
shadow that we've been living
under for 75 years no mention
lots of talk about other things but not
the two questions that human beings
now face for the first time in human
history
the questions whether the human
experiment will
continue in the short term we're not
talking about
millennia or centuries we're talking
about decades
and nobody's talking about it it's a
shocking
comment on the whole social order
there's many other problems
urgent significant ones but these
if these aren't solved everything else
is moved
you know i wonder i wonder if if
um there's a relationship between that
silence
and the kind of stoking of fear that is
so much a part of the
the public political consciousness in
other words is there a possibility that
they know or we know right that this
that this
is moving toward the end and so
rather than deal with that right we sort
of end up in a
in a state of constant you know
fear-mongering and
you know hate production and a kind of
a terror of the end of the world as we
know it but brought very small right the
end of a social world as we know it in
our neighborhood in our town in our
community
rather than an end of the world as we
know it in a big sense
well fortunately there are people who
are
working hard on it not ignoring it to
take the environmental crisis
uh take sunrise movement
group of young people uh actively
working to try to bring this issue to
the
core of public attention and activism
as you know they sat in on
congressional offices they received some
support from the
young some of the young
representatives who came in on the
sanders wave especially alexandria
or kasia cortez in the support of a
democratic senator senior senator ed
markey he's been interested in the
environment
they managed to put the question of a
new
a green new deal on the legislative
agenda
shortly before lots of ridicule
dismissal who cares about that
it's only essential for human survival
only that and it is some form of grim
new deal
is essential for human survival there
are
forms that are quite feasible that fall
well within our capacities
and unless we implement them within the
next few years
we can say goodbye to each other okay
so these young people succeeded in doing
it
that's exciting then they
have been working with the climate
strike
last last year huge effort of
young people to try to awaken the world
uh the extinction rebellion
uh others the activism that's continued
and compelled the democratic national
committee which
doesn't want any of this that compelled
them to at least
include in the program
uh policies which are not enough
but which could make a significant dent
and our
miles away from the destructive
policies of the incumbent power
okay will they implement those policies
well it's a battle inside the democratic
party
the dnc is
basically clintonite the moderate
republicans
call themselves democrats donor-oriented
then there's the progressive base which
is struggling to do
something about the existential crises
we said
we face and we see the battle
constantly so for example the activists
managed to pressure both biden and
harris
to accept the idea of
ending subsidies to fossil fuel
industries
to stop funding the industries that are
working to destroy us
they agreed to that the dnc
got wind of it cut it out of the program
okay good deal remains but that doesn't
that's the battle internal to the
democratic party meanwhile the
republicans
are racing to disaster
the world is looking at this aghast they
can't hardly believe what's happening
here
but it's happening and we have to deal
with it and we can
we can follow the lead of people like
the sunrise movement
the young activists who carried out the
climate stripe
and those who are working hard now to
try to
implement these programs to force the
democratic party to accept at least what
it has on paper
not to back off in case they win the
election which is no sure thing
but in case they win the election not to
back off and say we have to go back to
the worrying about the deficit which is
totally crazy at this time
but in order to
pressure them it's going to be necessary
to continue
the constant activism and the fact that
this is
that the leadership is being led to
young people
is so unspeakable you
hard to find words for it they're
they're not the ones who should be
taking the lead it's the adult community
should be doing
but in the absence of a committed adult
community
they are doing it calling us to action
and we have the chance to follow that we
can do it
and the same on the other issues
you know this issue of um
wrestling with despair on the one hand
and on the other hand knowing
something must be done and we've got to
be the ones to do it
when i think of uh intellectuals who are
making a difference in a lot of ways but
seem to be much
more uh
wrestling with despair more than what i
see
in your work over these last 70 years or
so i'm thinking of people like
my dear brother chris hedges or brother
paul street or
uh uh even my brother joomla baraka who
i
who's such a major force and he's
probably less wrestling with despair
than the others
how do you look unflinchingly
at all of the suffering and misery in
the world
past and present and still
allow yourself to work
through any kind of despair to be the
kind of truth teller and justice seeker
that you are
you can't succumb to it i mean yes there
are
things that are going on that are just
beyond
horrible uh we can see it in our own
cities not just take things that are
happening right before our eyes
so when the trump administration
decides that now all the
uh significant officials relevant
officials come from the
destructive industries and given free
free
reign so when they decide as they did
recently
to eliminate regulations
on polluting industries
fossil fuel industries polluting
industries
eliminate regulations two effects
one effect is to escalate the race to
oblivion
but there's a local effect who lives
near those polluting industries
not me i live out in the
outskirts of a town i can afford not to
live
next to the polluting industries
other people can't mostly black
puerto rican hispanic you can't live
anywhere else
so this decision is saying i want to
kill you
that's what it says i don't care about
you
i'll increase the pollution that's
killing you
and doing it in the midst of a
respiratory pandemic
which in which pollution radically
increases the already
sharply desperate disparate effect
race class effect of the pandemic
so right in the middle of this i'll make
it worse for you
nobody comments on it i mean
take say trump's he's
carrying out a desperate effort to try
to
cover up the vicious crimes he's
committed against the american people
uh 175 000 people have died mostly
needlessly
let's take a look at other countries
it's not happening it's happening here
because of the malevolence in the white
house
well you can't come forward and say
sorry for killing all of you
so we have to do is find a way to blame
someone else
pure cowardice and disgusting dishonesty
but it has effect so when you decide
to blame the world health organization
and say okay let's destroy it what
happens
things happen countless people
in africa and in yemen and in other poor
places
rely on world health organization
services
simply to survive terrible diseases
that's even before the pandemic so let's
take away that
security and let them die we'll kill
them because that way maybe i can cover
up my crimes
and maybe it'll improve my electability
i mean it's the kind of savagery that
you can't find words for and it's
happening
all over and we act as if it's not
happening
yeah i'm wondering
you know what what you think about the
role of
the complicit members of his own party
you know around this you know there's
been
before trump actually won there was so
much
you know critique of all the
characteristics you're describing
the greed the lying you know the the the
brash
um you know hostility and hatred but
everyone pretty much went quiet and got
in line
you know how do we explain that
level of of shift these are people who
had profound critiques and now
hadn't have nothing to say so there's no
he's just sort of steamrolled over
everybody it's
understandable that when people are in
immediate trouble they may tend to
overlook other things
but it's the job of everyone who
is trying to keep and who is concerned
with the fate of the species and with
the suffering of people in the world
it's their job to keep your eyes keep
ensure that everyone's
eyes are kept on the longer term perils
that are that we are facing so we will
emerge from this pandemic at a terrible
cost
and a needless cost all you have to do
is look at other countries to see that
it's a needless course
china provided all the relevant evidence
on january 10th and sequenced the virus
the genome gave the information to the
world
the countries that cared about their
citizens acted at once
they now have it pretty much out of
control uh
east asia south korea taiwan
uh vietnam new zealand
australia a little later europe delayed
finally
joined many of them have it reasonably
under control
so the germany probably has about maybe
1 50th or so the death rate that we have
rich country similar to us the united
states is the
black global ladder because of the
malignancy in the white house
right there it's not obscure and it goes
back before the pandemic started
it's worth remembering what happened
before
one thing is can't blame on trump goes
back to the whole
neoliberal assault on the society
government is the problem not the
solution
so therefore when the warnings came in
2003
that after sars that were likely to face
a
new pandemic the government which has a
wonderful laboratories immense resources
couldn't step in
to take the actions that could be taken
now that's neoliberalism that's on top
of the fact
that the drug companies couldn't move in
because they are blocked by capitalist
logic
you don't spend your money on things
that don't make profit tomorrow
you don't spend your money trying to
work on a
vaccine that maybe will be useful
in 10 years and we won't make that much
money from it anyway
so capitalist logic says that the hugely
profitable
drug companies with great labs and
resources are blocked out
neoliberalism the plague we've been
living under since reagan and thatcher
says the government can't step in
okay nobody could pick up the ball there
were things you could do
and it's worth remembering that some of
them were done
so when president obama came into office
in his first days in office he called a
meeting of the
presidential scientific advisory council
that had been
set up by the first president bush and
he
requested that they work on a pandemic
response program came back with it a
couple of
weeks later it was put into place
there was a pandemic response program
there were simulations carried out of
what to happen
if pandemic comes someone as late as
last october
there were american scientists they were
working with
chinese colleagues on the very dangerous
but crucial efforts to
identify new coronaviruses in the
caves in southern china where they're
mostly found
that that was working until
january 2017
when donald trump came into office with
his republican psychopaths
what did he do in the first days of his
office
dismantle the pandemic program the
pandemic response program
start cancer started cancelling the
programs with american scientists
working with chinese colleagues so we
shouldn't know what
what's coming in fact he's continued
that up until the last few
few weeks in fact counseling programs
uh defunding the center for disease
control
first act defund the center for disease
control and other health-related parts
of the government
he's tried to do that every single year
in office
astonishingly even last february
pandemic raging the budget comes from
the white house
further defunding of the center for
disease control
other health-related parts of government
that doesn't fit the agenda of serving
the ultra wealthy and the corporate
sector
the one significant commitment
of the president of the party other than
maintaining his own power that's who
they serve
so let's fund anything that could
protect the population
a couple of weeks ago fire the chief
scientist in charge of vaccine
development
in charge of vaccine development why
because he raised some questions about
the quack medicines that
trump is advertising i mean
what's happening before arises as if
some
malicious devil took over the country
and it's not far from true in fact
that's what we're facing
for the election whether to allow this
to go on for four years
or to put a stop to it it's not that the
alternative is great it's not
we should understand i think that we're
not voting
for biden we're voting against
trump now we're going to challenge biden
if he wins and ensure that the
donor-oriented sectors of the party
will not cut off programs that have to
be
carried out and that young people like
sunrise movement are pressing for
all the time in the forefront with us
following behind
we have to make sure to do that that's a
major
task for the immediate future can't be
delayed
very important to understand that the
means to solve these
problems are within our hands
there are very good careful studies
by fine analysts
bob pollan co-author of mine
jeff sachs have worked out detailed
programs which demonstrate how
we can deal with the problem not only at
benefit to the society better world
more jobs less destruction
better lives at a fraction of the
expenses that were used to win the
second world war
it's not these two it's not utopian you
know how to do it
it's not going to happen by itself
it's not going to happen if the
malignancy in the white house stays on
racing in the opposite direction it will
not happen if the
dnc the clinton democrats managed to cut
off
all significant programs but it can
happen we've seen the effects in the
remarkable successes of the sanders
movement
and the tremendous social movement
that's in the streets right now
lived by black lives matter and the
courage and achievements of sunrise
movement
mutual support groups arising all over
the world
the progressive international having its
first
international meeting in a couple of
weeks bringing together
sanders movement in the united states
the m25
comparable movement in europe lots of
voices in the global south
and a meeting in iceland in a couple of
weeks
iceland because the prime minister is
part of the movement
to try to develop a counter to the
reactionary
international that's being constructed
in the white house
and is aiming they wouldn't put it in
these words
that is acting in ways which will
destroy
the prospects for organizing in society
in order to enrich and empower
themselves
okay that's the conflict that's
developing
and we can't let it last there's no
option of not engaging
yeah absolutely no actually i'm going to
be
part of that too my dear brother just
was communicating with brother hadley
with his progressive international
it's multi-racial multinational
internationalism or
extinction i think is your your
formulation of it rightly so
i want to move just briefly again on the
personal thing the precious people
in your life that were formative
it could be your precious parents elsie
and
william it could be the great nelson
goodman my teacher
i think one of the great towering
figures in modern philosophy was
underappreciated i think he's got his
former genius too but how do you relate
to
figures in arts in poetry and literature
who
are the artists past and present who
have made a difference in your life
as scholar as intellectual as
activists as freedom fighter as love of
justice truth and goodness
there are plenty of them like people you
mentioned
the wonderful scholars and great
activists
but the people who at least
really made an impression we're the ones
who
our old friend the late howard inn
called those unknown
people who's this countless
unknown people whose actions
set the stage for the events
that enter history those are the
impressive people
and for me at least that starts pretty
early in my experiences
and some of my earliest memories are
riding with my mother in trolley cars in
north philadelphia going past textile
plants where
women were on strike outside the plant
being
brutally attacked by security officers
that's the kind of memory that sinks in
it was all around
in the later years it was learning about
the
struggles of poor and suffering people
here and around the world you've seen
many of them
the kind of inspiration you can't get
from
anything else people in who
don't give up who are facing the kinds
of
torture repression that we can't even
imagine
but don't give up keep their heads up
keep struggling
win victories that's the kind of thing
that's an inspiration
the way beyond anything you can see at
the university
in the library although there's enormous
riches there from which you can benefit
in terms of the particular
secular jewish tradition that you
exemplify in such a
marvelous way are there resources that
you discern
within the hebrew scripture that
hesset spreading steadfast love to
orphan widow
fatherless motherless is there something
about justice
thou should thou should pursue is there
something about the ways in which your
own
shaping of your identity and this is
very important these days when everybody
talk about their identity
the shaping of your identity has always
led toward this universalism
even though there's still something
distinctively chomsky and
philadelphian american new world
jewish all mixed together in making
your witness what it is it's all in
there
i mean i grew up with uh in a
household that was immersed in
the uh revival of hebrew culture
my father was a great hebrew scholar
i mean my earliest lessons in
linguistics which i ended up with were
reading his dissertation on a medieval
hebrew grammarian when i was
maybe 10 or 12 years old learning about
historical semitic grammar and so on
uh reading the bible i was immersed in
that
the later hebrew literature
[Music]
you can't read the prophets and
not be inspired by the eloquent
calls for justice for mercy
the sharp critiques of the
crimes of the powerful geopolitical
critiques
moral critiques that's one part of the
bible there are
other quite other parts which have a
very ugly message but you pick and
choose
now that's all in the background
one of the places where i learned
about the concept of
self-hating jews very common today
criticize the state of israel your
self-hating jew
you listened to aba aban great
israeli state and statesman revered
statesman
about 40 years ago gave a lecture to
american jews and one of the main
liberal jewish journals in which he said
your task is to
show that there's no difference between
anti-semitism and anti-zionism
where anti-zionism meant support
for his government in israel no
difference between those well you read
the bible you grew up in the bible you
know exactly where he's coming from
go back to kings remember the epitome of
evil in the bible
king ahab called the prophet elijah to
him
denounced the prophet elijah as a
israel a hater of israel
because he was condemning the acts of
the evil king
and that's the origin when you remember
that it
gives you a different perspective on
what's happening today
in fact when you think of the fate of
the prophets
tells you something they were not
treated well
they were imprisoned and driven into the
desert
ridiculed persecuted there were people
who were treated well
the flators of the court many centuries
later
many centuries they were condemned as
false prophets
not at the time that tells you something
about
intellectual history you go back to the
stacks and widener library where i got a
lot of my education
learn about intellectual history you
find that that
message has been relived over and over
again
right to the present and the people who
are calling for
mercy justice concern
for the poor and the suffering they're
the ones who
they're the ones who are attacked we've
seen it
over and over and take say the catholic
church
remarkable institution 1962
pope john xxiii called vatican 2
and had a message let's try to
go back to the lesson of the gospels
the lesson of the gospels is the
preferential option for the poor
it's a message of radical pacifism
let's go back to that that actually was
taken up by the
mostly in latin america some other
places by
bishops priests lay people and went out
to organize
peasants read the gospels see what they
say
follow the message of taking control of
your own lives instead of
suffering from the miserable brutality
of the
murderous governments most of them
installed and backed by the united
states
it's called liberation theology take a
look at the
talking points of the school of americas
it's now renamed but the school of the
americas which trains
latin american officers latin american
killers to be exact
they have advertising points one of them
is
the united states army help
destroy liberation theology
they're saying something true 1962 the
united states government went to war
against the catholic church
that's why you have a host of religious
martyrs all over latin america
that's why you have the martyred
archbishop romero
the six jesuit intellectuals murdered
the jesuit university in 1967
1989 right at the time the berlin wall
filled
by pretty much the same hands by an
elite battalion armed and trained by the
united states
following orders which we know were
given directly by the central command
okay yes the united states army helped
defeat
the gospels help defeat
the teachings of the
of the church okay that should be
front and center in our consciousness
just like the
fate of the prophets and the many others
like them since then
they're the ones who really suffer
okay the ones who bring the message of
honesty integrity uh
support for people who need it
preferential option for the poor working
for the suffering
and the needy changing our societies
so that they are directed to
people's just rights and needs
instead of for maximizing wealth and
profit for a tiny sector
those are the people who are bitterly
attacked
they're the ones who in a famous article
the mcgeorge bundy the
national security advisor for kennedy
and johnson
a former dean of harvard wrote a very
interesting article in 1968
at the peak of the anti-war movement
about how yes we've made some foreign
affairs the main establishment journal
worth reading he said yeah we haven't
been perfect we made some mistakes and
you can it's fair to say
talk about our mistakes but he said
there are also
wild men in the wings
wild men in the wings like all of us
people who say it's not just a mistake
it's a crime
wild men in the wings okay
[Music]
you read the prophets you know where
that's coming from
yes there's a history a lot in between
and
take a look at the dreifus affair the
time when the
modern concept of intellectual came into
general use
there were people who we now honored
the driposaurs amazola
people like him we honor them
not at the time they were bitterly
condemned denounced zola had to flee
france they were condemned by the
immortals of the french academy
the academy frances the how dare you
the writers and the artists
criticize our noble army in our noble
state and claim that they committed a
crime
flee the country before we get here
okay that's a large part of history
if you go back and read
goes back to classical greece as well
then who was the person who had to drink
the hemlock
the person who was corrupting the youth
of essence
by asking too many questions getting
them to think
getting them to question things we don't
want people like that around we don't
want wild men in the wings
that's dangerous to authority and power
and it also carries civilized life
forward all over the place people whose
names nobody knows
how many people know the names of the
young black kids who 60 years ago
sat in a lunch lunch counter that will
worse in
greensboro north carolina segregated
lunch counter
immediately carried off could have ended
it except that others came later
