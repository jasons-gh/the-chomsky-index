referring back to your earlier comment
about escaping from or doing away with
capitalism I was wondering what scheme
workable scheme you would put in its
place me just others who might be in a
position to set it up and get it going
well I mean I I think that what used to
be called centuries ago wage slavery is
intolerable I mean I don't think people
ought to be forced to rent themselves in
order to survive I think that the
economic institutions ought to be run
democratically by their participants by
the communities in which they exist and
so on and I think basically through
various kinds of free association
historically have there been any
sustained examples on any substantial
scale of societies which approximated to
the anarchist ideal there are small
societies small a number that have I
think done so quite well and there are a
few examples of large-scale libertarian
revolutions which were largely anarchist
in their structure as to the first small
societies extending over a long period I
myself think the most dramatic example
is perhaps the Israeli Cupid scene which
for a long period may or may not be true
today really were constructed on
anarchist principles that is of direct
worker control integration of
agricultural industry services personal
life on an egalitarian basis with direct
and in fact quite active participation
in self-management and work I should
think
it's primarily successful a good example
of a really large-scale anarchist
revolution or largely anarchist
revolution in fact the best example to
my knowledge is the Spanish revolution
in 1936 and in fact you can't tell what
would happen that pentakus revolution
was somewhat destroyed the force but
during the period of in which it was
alive I think it was
inspiring testimonies of the ability of
the poor working people to organize
manage their affairs extremely
successfully without coercion control
how far does the success of libertarian
socialism or anarchism is who ever
really depend on a fundamental change in
the nature of man both in his motivation
his altruism and also in his knowledge
and sophistication I think it not only
depends on it but in fact the whole
purpose of libertarian socialism is that
it will contribute to it it will
contribute to a spiritual transformation
precisely that kind of great
transformation in in the way humans
conceive of themselves and their ability
to act to decide to create to produce to
inquire precisely that spiritual
transformation that social thinkers from
the left Marxist tradition from Lexus
Luxembourg say on overthrew
anarcho-syndicalist have always
emphasized so on the one hand it
requires that spiritual transformation
on the other hand the its purpose is to
create institutions which will
contribute to that transformation
