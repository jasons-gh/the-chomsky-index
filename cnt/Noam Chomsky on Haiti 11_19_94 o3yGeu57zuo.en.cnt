hi my name is Melinda man and I'm a
staff person at grassroots international
and also a member of last month's New
England observers delegation to Haiti we
went to witness the restoration of
president Aris feed and also to
accompany Haitian peasant leader
Siobhan Jean Baptiste back to his
hometown of hench in Haiti's central
plateau after he'd been out of the
country for several years in exile
because of the coup I want to welcome
everybody here today on behalf of the
organization's who are sponsoring this
event
those organizations are the Haiti anti
intervention Network the New England
observers delegation the MIT Fissel and
M Pei Pei EDF which is the papaya
peasant movement education and
Development Fund we're honored today to
have with us professor Noam Chomsky
leader a peasant leader
siobhan Jean Baptiste and the members of
last month's New England observers
delegation to Haiti who will be
presenting a report back along with a
slideshow and video of the trip today's
program is entitled building bridges to
Hades movement for social justice it's
intended to provide a forum for learning
about US policy in Haiti the history of
and the current work of Haiti's popular
movement the movement which swept
president air state into office in 1990
and also to discuss and share the ways
that people here in the Boston area can
in our supporting democracy in Haiti as
part of this effort we will be raising
funds for the peasant movement of papai
Haiti's oldest and largest peasant
organization which will be sent directly
to Haiti
before we begin the program I want to
make a few announcements about the
logistics of the day there are
refreshments as you probably all know in
the back this is about a three and a
half hour long program so you're welcome
to go get refreshments discreetly at any
time there's bathrooms out the back and
make a right we will be passing around a
sign-in sheet a little later if you
haven't already signed in would really
like it and Kurt and encourage everybody
to put your name and address down so
that we can keep in touch with you about
upcoming events also I'd like to call
your attention to the packets which you
should have received when you were
coming in the door these packets each
they have a listing of a number of
groups here in Boston working to support
Democratic efforts in Haiti in a number
of ways there's a postcard that we're
going to ask you at the end to all sign
calling for a investigan Gresham Olinda
Gatien into the ways that the US has
supported the coup regime in Haiti which
you'll find out all about today and also
a pledge sheet and an envelope for your
donation to the papaya peasant movement
which goes straight to Haiti if you do
have to leave early I would ask that you
go through the back doors not come down
the front and that you turn in your
envelope with your pledge or donation to
the people at the doors before you leave
also because this program today is on a
very tight schedule I really would like
to ask your cooperation
in making it run smoothly one of the
things that I just mentioned is leaving
through the back and not you know trying
to do things as discreetly as possible I
know there probably be a number of
people coming in and out also please be
aware and respectful of the fact that
our speakers have a very limited time
both for their presentations and for
questions so I'm going to try to cut
things off right on schedule so that we
can continue with the program it's very
packed and very exciting but you know we
want to make sure that everybody has the
app
opportunity to hear what they came for
and to participate as much as possible
okay so welcome this event is being
coordinated in large part by the Haiti
anti intervention network and before we
introduce our featured speaker I'd like
to introduce Jean withers Lee from the
international socialist organization a
very active member of the Haiti anti
intervention Network who's going to talk
about the work of the network's so far
in the last few months so this is Jean
[Applause]
thanks Linda the Haiti anti intervention
and network is a group of organizations
which have come together to support real
democracy in Haiti in the form of the
popular movements and in opposition to
the role the US has played in that
struggle the Clinton administration and
the media try to convince us that the
u.s. is the friend of the Haitian people
kicking out the murderous military and
bringing democracy like a present to
Haiti the truth is that the vibrant lava
last movement which made the election of
father aresty possible is still alive
and strong as a democratic movement in
its own right as people will be
discussing here today the truth also is
that while the US government has created
an opening for the Haitian people to
breathe and to be able to gather
together without being killed it is
really the friend of the tiny rich elite
on the hills of Petionville which
overlooked port-au-prince and not the
friend of the vast majority of peasants
and working people US businesses make
huge profits by paying $2 an hour
wages in Haiti the situation that they
have demanded that air estate allowed to
continue even if US troops pull out of
Haiti by the end of the year as Clinton
has promised the UN troops will remain
with
them being US soldiers and US money will
remain to influence the course of
Haitian society and the threat to real
Haitian democracy will remain so in
addition to putting on this event today
the Haiti anti intervention Network has
held two demonstrations to oppose the
u.s. occupation one on the day of the
occupation October 15th and 1/2 weeks
later and a press conference the day of
the occupation and a teachin to inform
people of the the situation similar to
the one today this work needs to
continue if you agree with what you have
heard here today and you would like to
be part of it please come to our our
meeting December 1st at 7 o'clock
at 25 West Street downtown Boston and
there a sign-up sheets at the back of
the room so we hope to have more of you
you know involved with us and help us to
continue our work as the hey de'aunte
intervention network thanks
[Applause]
thanks very much gene there are a number
of people and organizations who have
played a key role key roles in putting
this event together but to deserve
special recognition for the incredible
amount of work that they've put into
this both into the whole cause of
opposing anti interventive opposing
intervention and standing with the
popular movement in Haiti and
particularly for their work on this
event today and those are the Boston
mobilization for survival and it's
director John Hill and the American
Friends Service Committee and its staff
person Paul Shannon who just ran out to
do something else right now out in the
back but these two people have done a
remarkable job of pulling together all
the logistics doing the planning calling
people making sure that this that this
event happens and it is so thank you
before I introduce our featured speaker
here I also I do want to let you know
this is going to be a remarkable day in
terms of the kind of experience and the
talks and the presentations that we're
going to hear and immediately after Noam
Chomsky we're going to be having Siobhan
Jon batiste who I'll introduce is that
the the leader of Haiti's oldest and
largest peasant movement and as all of
us who went to Haiti last month found
out a remarkable popular leader with
with massive support from people who has
a absolutely brilliant and cutting
analysis of what the US is doing in
Haiti and also an a lot to talk about in
terms of what he sees as a challenges
for the popular movement so I would
really encourage everybody to stay for
the full day if you can and to please at
least really stick around for as long as
you can to watch Siobhan who's an
amazing amazing leader and person so
without further ado I want to say our
first speaker today is well known around
the world and certainly here in this
room not only for his outstanding work
in the field of linguistics but for his
analysis of US domestic and foreign
policy and his critique of global
imperialism he's the author of numerous
books
Flitz articles dealing with these issues
his most recent book World Order's old
and new published by Columbia University
Press is as its title implies an
assessment of the so-called New World
Order and in comparison to the old he is
Institute professor of linguistics here
at MIT and to add to his stunning
achievements he's also been extensively
sampled on an album by the musical group
Bad Religion
so please welcome Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
the pilot is asked to talk about has
certain problems talk about US policy
toward Haiti past present and future but
as all well-educated and well-bred
people know or the United States doesn't
have any policies toward Haiti or
anything else so therefore there isn't
any topic we just have programs of
generalized international goodwill as
historian Arthur Schlesinger explained
while the b-52s were carpet-bombing
South Vietnamese villages and in the
case of Haiti well you can just read the
news columns in the New York Times which
explain that now the Americans are back
again still aspiring to do good works
still unable to comprehend the divisions
in this strange Society following the
model of the idealistic Woodrow Wilson
and if there's no policies other than
international goodwill and aspiring to
do good works then there really isn't a
lot to talk about well actually for
accuracy I should say that it sometimes
recognized that everything wasn't
perfect in the past there were
occasional and then we moved to another
level of discussion in educated circles
at least at that point we moved to the
to looking at errors naivete may be
excessive fears the United States is a
very frightened country it's always
under attack that's why we have to spend
more on the military than the rest of
the world combined because
normally threatened and sometimes people
get you know a little excessive about
their natural fears and then of course
we really can't understand these
backward depraved societies so we do
make mistakes now and then but that's
also doesn't leave us with any topic
because at this point another principle
enters the principle of change of course
which is a standard feature of u.s.
ideology the principle says that well
yeah in the past some things maybe
weren't so good because mistakes or
whatever but we can forget about all
that because now we've changed course
and we're just going on aspiring to do
good work so there's no point harping on
all this old-fashioned stuff people in
Haiti kind of mutter about the Wilson
the marine occupation for 20 years but
we understand that that's behind us
whatever mistakes there might have been
and now we just are going on with our
programs of international goodwill well
that's a pretty useful doctrine in
thinking there's an extremely useful
doctrine for any criminal organization
anywhere because then you don't have to
look at anything that happened in the
past and that makes it possible to
sustain the crucial principle of
intellectual life namely that our
leaders are noble and benevolent though
you know occasionally make mistakes and
so on and so forth the doctrine of
change of course which isn't always
invoked with incredible regularity
sometimes you know every few weeks for
pretty obvious reasons it has another
nice feature it guarantees that nobody
will ever understand anything that's
going on or anything that will go on and
that's useful too because you don't want
the rabble to get too much insight into
what you know there what's happening
before their eyes and what in fact
they're inadvertently or not are
supporting the only way to instrument
policy's flow from institutions
institutions are pretty stable
consequently policies are pretty stable
and if you want to understand them you
have to look at their institutional
source and how that's played itself out
over the years and if the whole past is
always wiped is that every point wiped
out as irrelevant you have a guarantee
that that won't happen so that concern
of about possible insight into the real
world is therefore obviated and again
that's a very useful feature of an
advanced educational system that few
have gone to good colleges and you've
gotten into the professions and so on
you can understand the significance of
maintaining that doctrine
otherwise you might have to learn
something from the past and also learn
something about the present since these
institutions remain the same then the
policies remain the same the if you you
this way you can avoid looking not only
at the history of everything that's
happened but also at the very explicit
planning record that tells you why it's
not that planners are you know reticent
about it
I mean it's mostly classified but free
society so it gets opened up after 40 or
50 years and if you look back you find
policies outlined with great specificity
that tell you almost exactly everything
that's going on they from from both the
policies and the way they've played
themselves out you pretty well deduce
what's going to happen next
so it's therefore very important not to
look for example if you if you look
you'll discover that our poet that our
our policies with regard to Latin
America at the highest level you know
quite consistently we're based on the
principle that the major threat to US
interests um virtually quoting is
nationalistic regimes which are
responsive to pressures from the masses
of their population for for improvement
in low living standards and
diversification of production for
domestic needs this was part of a bigger
problem which the State Department
called the philosophy of the new
nationalism which was sweeping over
Latin America after the Second World War
according to the philosophy of the new
nationalism the prime beneficiaries of a
country's resources should be the people
of that country and furthermore
development of those countries should be
not only for domestic needs but should
be egalitarian and so on
and that obviously won't do the u.s.
position was that this form of
nationalism must be destroyed in all its
forms and at hemispheric meetings
starting in February 1945 the u.s. in
fact used its power to undermine the
philosophy the new nationalism and to
instill the right principle that the
prime beneficiaries of a country's
resources are the investors from the
United States and that development that
is responsive to the needs of the
population is not to be permitted
development has to be complementary the
US needs not not conflicting with it the
and and that's in these various testing
areas for scientific methods of economic
development that the US has been
carrying running throughout Latin
America that's indeed what was followed
with the consequence that you discover
for example in Latin America has the
highest rate of inequality of any area
of the world and that it's mostly a
disaster area the check back to the
original policies you see exactly why
and you also see why there has been
regular violent intervention when
something got out of hand so for example
the NSC document that I was quoting
before on the threat to our interests
from nationalistic regimes that was
right after the overthrow of the
parliamentary democratic government in
Guatemala when they were said well we
got rid of that
now let's make sure it doesn't happen
again and it hasn't I mean it's a horror
chamber with hundreds of thousands of
people slaughtered right up to the
present day
the there are some consequences to this
namely the methods are required to
ensure that the that these problems
don't arise and the obvious methods were
hit upon very early in the late 1940s
namely the United States must develop
close and intimate relationships with
the military in every country in order
and give them military aid in training
in order to increase the understanding
of and orientation towards u.s.
objectives on the part of a Latin
American military Irish they've got to
understand our principles that the prime
beneficiaries of a country's resources
are u.s. investors not the local
population and so on and these programs
were indeed rapidly expanded
particularly by the Kennedy liberals who
were more sophisticated and knew things
about you know culture and civilization
and so on so they pointed out a
discussion between McNamara and Bundy
through the big deal intellectuals that
former Harvard Dean you know and so on
that in the Latin American cultural
environment the military must be
prepared to remove government leaders
from office whenever in the judgment of
the military the conduct of these
leaders is injurious to the welfare of
the nation and of course once the leave
the military leaders have gained the
proper understanding of an orientation
toward u.s. objectives it therefore
follows that they will do what has to be
done in the Latin American culture
namely overthrow of civilian governments
that don't have a proper orientation
towards u.s. objectives and so on well
that's what the that's what that's the
core of what the record shows there
another side point that ought to be
stressed and that and that is that the
biggest threat has always been not just
a nationalistic regime but one that
looks as if it's successful if it's
successfully carrying out some form of
social and economic development then
it's a real danger
it's what Dean Acheson called a rotten
apple that might spoil the barrel or
what Henry Kissinger called a virus that
might infect others so the end a regime
in Chile was Kissinger described as a
virus which might spread the infection
all the way to southern Europe no
Kissinger is kind of not very bright but
even he understood that the Chilean army
wasn't gonna land in Rome you know what
he was worried about was something
actually rational that people would get
the idea that the democratic socialism
and the development for your own needs
might work and that would just send the
wrong message to Italian voters so a
virus you really have to stop right off
and there's nothing new about this with
regard to Haiti certainly this principle
goes back 190 years at least to the time
when the French diplomat Pelerin wrote
to James Madison the following that the
existence of a Negro people in arms
occupy occupying a country not theirs of
course occupying a country it has soiled
by the most criminal acts is a horrible
spectacle for all white nations
particularly white nations like England
in the United States and France that
were entering into their industrial
development thanks on the basis of the
cheap cotton kept cheap not by market
principles but by extermination of the
native population and bringing in slaves
so that was really a horrible example
and the Haitian Revolution put the fear
of God through everyone it was the first
revolution that called for freedom
briefly the French Revolution did but
they
off from that and the American
Revolution never did so this was the
first revolution that called for freedom
and in particular you had the you know
these Negro people occupying a country
horrible spectacle not only for white
nations but for others who might get the
idea why shouldn't we be free so
therefore they had to that virus had to
be quickly destroyed and in fact a large
part of the history the last 20 years is
the story of that playing itself out
including what happened during the seven
months of air speed well I think these
things through and nothing that's going
on comes as very much of a surprise you
can be aware of what's going to happen
next other the framework is obvious the
basic themes haven't changed literally
for centuries they're adapted to
contingent different contingencies but
they remain about the same because these
structures from which they arise remain
about the same and therefore for those
of you who are going into academic or
scholarly work it's extremely important
to understand that nobody should be ever
allowed to look at the history or the
documentary record or anything else
because they just might understand too
much and that's not allowed we have to
have this principle of generalized
goodwill and aspiring to do good works
over leaders and so on and so forth well
it's not that there's I have to add one
further qualification there is a version
of history that were allowed to look at
and in fact repeat endlessly it was
presented in fact by this sort of big
thinkers in the major journals as the
American forces landed us over there was
an article on historical perspective by
RW Apple of the New York Times who
explained that for two centuries
political opponents in Haiti have
routinely slaughtered each other backers
of President Aris teed followers of
General cedrus and the former con tomate
could retain their homicidal tendencies
to say nothing of their weapons
didn't mention that the backers of
President are speed or kind of sly types
and they've somehow concealed their
weapons whereas the others have them out
but they've they're holding on to their
weapons and of course their traditional
homicidal tendencies he then went on to
give further historical depth he said
like the French in the 19th century like
the Marines who occupied Haiti from 1915
to 1934 the American forces who were
trying to impose a new order will
confront the complex and violent society
with no history of democracy well you
know one has long ago abandoned hope
that well-educated Americans will be
able to deal with the US intervention
under Wilson in anything remotely like
what it was you know vicious murderous
races destroyed democratic system I mean
just a monstrosity that obviously is
beyond the pale I can't talk about that
so that becomes sweet charity
automatically but there's a kind of an
innovation in the reference to Napoleon
to refer to Napoleon's invasion which is
one of the most gruesome acts of not a
very pretty era as an effort to impose
order on this violent society that does
break some new ground and I presume that
that's part of the general project of
revising the whole history of
colonialism so as to prepare people
better for the next phase that's coming
along since these things don't change
well that's the New York Times in the
Washington Post a major newspaper there
big thinker David Broder warned that the
real danger is that US troops may be
caught in an ongoing civil war between
heavily armed gangs bent on revenge or
determined not to yield power so we sort
of stand in between them kind of
uneasily rather like Napoleon's general
Leclerc who warned Napoleon that he was
going to
murder every Negro in the country in
order for the forces of light to prevail
now this this situation that we're in
you know facing these hostile armed
gangs and homicidal maniacs and so on
it's not entirely novel there are other
cases so like when the Soviet troops
invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 they had
the same kind of problem I mean on the
one hand with a Stalinist army and
security forces on the other hand
peaceful demonstrators you know calling
for freedom and democracy here were
these Russian troops kind of deal with
these two homicidal gangs and so on or
for that matter when the American troops
liberated Buchenwald and I had Gestapo
and SS forces and Einsatzgruppen on one
side and half starved skeletons on the
other and the American troops are kind
of stuck between trying to get them to
you know try to deal somehow with the
homicidal tendencies of these is it
heavily armed gangs on both sides so
it's not really a novel problem but it
you know it you can see with it it's a
really hard one Broder goes on to say
that Clinton has followed the idealistic
president would Woodrow Wilson in
sending American forces to Haiti but we
should remember that Wilson Wilson and
the Americans tried for 19 years to
create a Democratic Society and they
failed and that shows it's really hard
one of the ways in which they tried to
create a Democratic Society apart from
slaughtering thousands of people and
restoring virtual slavery and so on one
of the ways they did it was by
disbanding the Parliament by sending in
the Marine Corps to kick out the
Parliament because they wouldn't vote
for a constitution which authorized US
corporations to buy up Haiti's land that
was called a progressive they refused to
accept progressive measures as they put
it in those days so they had to be
disbanded by
genuine marine core measures as the
Marine general put it and that defect
was taken care of by a marine run
referendum in which a mere 99.9% of the
population voted for the US Constitution
with about 5% of the population
participating and then just to make sure
there were no problems with democracy it
was 12 years before the Parliament was
even allowed to reconvene that's how we
tried to institute democracy but you
know what do we do in this country with
no tradition of democracy we always face
these terrible problems well that's the
kind of history we're supposed to
remember and now we're back again still
aspiring to do good works and unable to
comprehend the divisions in the society
there's also a version about the more
recent period that you've got to learn
how to memorize and repeat that version
for the aresty period is that it was a
complete failure that our state failed
politically and economically and the
reason was various reasons he was it a
couple of words from oppressor
doctrinaire monomaniac an ideologue
rabble rouser he was calling for a
minimum wage and other interferences
with market flexibility I mean obviously
really bad guy so it was an economic and
political failure that's uniform the New
York Times
laments that what they call our steeds
inability to guide the country's economy
during his seven months in office
Laurence pezzulo who was the point man
for the Clinton administration until he
was forced to resign after he lied to
blatantly to Congress incidentally that
doesn't affect his reputation at all he
adds that our steed failed politically
while in office and his big problem was
that he was unwilling and still is
unwilling to at the time estuvo gave his
interviewed of times unwilling to
broaden his political base beyond the
huge majority
population and it was as he fethullah
ads it was his estrangement from the
elected parliament coupled with his
chilly relationship with business
leaders in the military that led to his
overthrow obviously pretty bad character
the elected parliament was in fact
business in the military for the simple
reason that the popular organizations
who had developed in have the resources
to contest the parliamentary elections
so they were the traditional business
leaders in the military so knocking that
out it was his failure to deal with the
business leaders like that what's called
the middle class in Haiti it's about 1%
of the population that owns half the
wealth the middle class and the military
couldn't deal with them
he just had was trying to ride to power
on the wave of support of whelming
majority of the population so obviously
that's a political fit but you know
after all what can you expect in a
country with no democratic traditions
just what America's watch described as a
vibrant lively civil society that had
enabled the population to play for the
first time to play a major role in local
and even in national affairs and created
the foundations for actually functioning
demography democracy in which the rabble
could actually have a role which of
course aroused horror here we don't
allow any such such things and he had to
go the crucial elements of this story
are that it was a political and economic
failure and in order to maintain that
you have to you have to overlook a few
things for example you have to overlook
the fact that it was described by the
State Department in a secret leaked
document in February 1992 as a
surprisingly successfully they refer to
the surprisingly successful efforts of
the rsd government quickly reversed
after the coup and you all that was
leaked but it was fortunately
by the press so you can see it unless
you read marginal journals you also have
to suppress the conclusions of the
international lending associations like
the inter-american Development Bank on
how our STD successes were welcomed by
the international financial community
which gave him substantial assistance
further frightening Washington and even
you have to suppress the conclusion of
the World Bank Haiti office that his
policies were remarkably conservative
and also quite successful but not
conservative enough you know
conservative whatever that means for
American investors and on the Haitian
middle-class that 1% who's supposed to
run things the the the the other aspect
of this story is that this ideological
monomaniac tan rabble rouser and so on
has learned some lessons while he was in
Washington so one of his main supporters
Robert White who actually has
consistently supported the electric
elected government said I you know a
couple of weeks ago said I think the
best thing that's happened to our Steve
in his administration in exile is that
they have had a crash course in
democracy in capitalism and they've come
to understand that too much revolution
scares away investors small countries
can't afford too much social
experimentation like say minimum wage
laws and things like that the the fact
that he's been given a crash course in
democracy and capitalism is true in the
US sense of democracy and capitalism
democracy means that you do what you
told and you shut up about it
or better express your gratitude and you
serve the powerful and the rich and
capitalism means the same thing and
these
social experimentation that went too far
are the programs that were hailed by the
US State Department as a surprising
success much irritating them and by the
international lending institutions and
so on but you know not enough for the
Haitian rich or for investors or the US
government and worse it was a potential
virus it was precisely the successes
that made it dangerous because and that
goes way back you know we're back to
tell Arendt it's the successes of these
deviations nationalistic regimes that
begin to respond to pressures from the
population if they succeed there are
much it's a much bigger crime if they
succeed than if they fail so the
reaction is kind of understandable and
the logic of that is pretty
straightforward if they fail and well
okay you know one little spot who cares
but if they succeed the rot may spread
you know the virus may infect others
others may try that's the same thing
pretty soon the whole system of
domination begins to unravel so
successes the problem white is not the
only one who was expressing his hope
that our seed had been tamed and learned
lessons in capitalism and democracy the
press took the same view the thicker in
the New York Times main diplomatic
correspondent Alain Ciolino had a big
article headline Robespierre to Gandhi
expressing the hopes in Washington that
this maniac this rogue spear had finally
become the kind of Gandhian that we
approve of you know we're complete
pacifists and absolute Gandhi ins but
and we're just pains us enormous ly if
everyone anyone doesn't rise their level
but they were hoping that maybe he had
sort of in Washington you know become
what's called pragmatic pragmatic it's
another one of those terms like
democracy and capitalism pragmatic means
that you sort of shuffle along with a
pleasant smile
you know thank NASA for allowing you to
survive that's pragmatic know maybe he
had learned to be pragmatic at least
that's the hope and you know there
others like sulo don't think it's really
learned and you know you really have to
hit him over the head some more but some
think that that it worked well without
without proceeding there is an official
history which is kind of like Stalinist
history and that history were allowed to
tell but the real history including just
a simple history of what happened during
those seven months of office that has to
be suppressed and suppressed completely
the that's you know if anybody brings it
up it's old hat or boring or you know
shrill or strident or maybe even Adi
American you know there's all sorts of
words to deal with people who keep
bringing up this nonsense so let's put
history aside and just go back to the
last few years starting in the nineteen
seventies in the 1980s US aid put
considerable effort into trying to turn
Haiti into what they call the Taiwan of
the Caribbean really ought to be one of
these big experiments it's really going
to work
the idea was to destroy Haitian
agriculture to drive the peasants to
urban slums to create markets for us
agribusiness to create export industry
where you could say have women making
softballs for five to ten cents an hour
at the 12-hour days no facilities
dipping their hands into toxic materials
so that the manufacturer can advertise
that the softballs are bonded for
maximal strength and so on that's the
Taiwan of the Pacific they die after a
couple of years but you're driving so
many people off the land that doesn't
matter
that much there'll be more of them and
you can see why we have to stop this
business about minimum wages and other
interferences with labour flexibility
because of course that'll have found the
huge profits which are enormous
meanwhile the terror just continued
there was a little bit of a problem in
1986 when the dictator was overthrown in
the u.s. had to sort of mouth' some
words about democracy for a few weeks
but the terror picked up again in fact
it increased and so did US aid and so it
went on until a mistake was made the big
mistake in the dissent and they're now
trying to rectify that mistake the
mistake was that in December 1990 they
allowed an election now it didn't look
like it should be a big problem
the nobody was paying any attention to
what was going on in the slums or the
hills and so on they were just looking
at the rich folk and there everything
looked fine you know the the US had its
candidate a World Bank official had all
the resources should have just walked it
you know walked away so it didn't look
like there was a big risk but all of a
sudden out of nowhere came this
grassroots vibrant lively civil society
that nobody had looked at and swept
their own candidate into office
well the plague of democracy had
actually reached Haiti and no one knew
about it and obviously had to do
something about that the only question
at that time was what is the United
States going to do to ensure that it you
know to reverse the situation back to
pre December 1990 which is incidentally
pretty much where we now are
well the efforts to undermine our
state's government began right away US
aid no longer turning it into the Taiwan
of the Caribbean US aid stopped accept
aid to the business community to set up
groups counter to our esteem the
National Endowment for the democracy for
democracy this bipartisan out
moved in they suddenly decided that
Haiti needs a more decentralized
government this centralization of
government never bothered anyone before
but all of a sudden we have to dismantle
the centralized government because we've
lost control of the center so the now we
were going to democratize the place by
setting up competing groups and
institutions like human rights groups
and labor unions and so on by the
sheerest accident these happen to be the
ones that survived the coup while all
the actual ones that had developed
without the assistance of the National
Endowment of democracy were destroyed
and decimated that's another one of
those things you're not supposed to draw
any conclusions from the as I mentioned
the seven months were remarkably
successful despite the efforts of the US
under my lemon were so recognized even
by the State Department but it was a
political and economic failure it was a
political failure because power wasn't
completely in the hands of you know a
couple of rich families and the foreign
investors so it was a political failure
and it was an economic failure because
it looked as if there might be a basis
for independent development of the kind
we simply do not tolerate I wasn't
happening yet but it might have so it
was an economic thing well then along
came the coup we go to the next stage
the media reaction of the coup was
interesting there's a Boston media group
which many of you know that did an
analysis of media coverage after the
coup and it was very revealing there was
a lot of right after the coup starts
huge atrocities during the period of
seven months in office trustees cut down
to virtually nothing except the handful
by the army the refugee flow had stopped
in fact was reversing narco trafficking
and stuff after the coup slaughters
began all over the place and the media
were indeed focusing on atrocities
namely alleged atrocities during the RCD
period so the majority of media coverage
while the security forces and their
power
military associates were slaughtering
hundreds and thousands of people the
majority of me coverage was actually on
alleged atrocities during the rsd period
and a lot of bemoaning the fact that he
wasn't as you know committed a Gandhian
as we hoped and so on and so forth well
that was the media a couple of days
later an OAS embargo Organization of
American States embargo was announced
the Bush administration very quickly
made it clear that it was not going to
that we were not going to support it you
know nothing happens around this region
at least unless the US is behind it and
the Bush administration made it very
clear that didn't want the embargo to
work in fact it made it explicit a few
months later there was what was called
an exemption firms that had any
connection with either American owned or
using American owned products or
whatever were able to continue exporting
that was called by the New York Times
fine tuning the embargo out of our
compassion for the Haitian people who
somehow are only benefited when US firms
continue breaking the embargo not when
other ones do the most interest the
crucial part of any embargo is always
fuel and that's a very interesting story
which we know a lot about now at least
you know a lot about if you're not stuck
with English papers it was known all the
way through that oil was continuing to
flow question you just see you know like
the biggest the richest mother is just
families there may be near itches the
Mavs fan Li was building a huge fuel you
know a farm and so on they were
obviously getting oil from somewhere and
you could see that it was coming however
the detail I should say incidentally
just before getting to oil but the trick
US trade with Haiti did decline in 1992
the first year of the embargo but not
all that much when Clinton took over
trade with Haiti increased in fact it
increased by about 50% including even
exports of fruit from this starving
Island they fell under the exemption
because one of the big mango growers
pointed out that some of the branches in
a you know mang of a tree that he had
was using were grafted from an American
source so therefore you know there's
American the u.s. owned stuff inside it
so therefore they can export the fruit
the and this simply went on as far as we
know it went on till the end
no it's turned of oil well the oil was
flowing that was sure there were three
major oil companies shall Exxon and
Texaco in the case of Shell and Exxon
the official US argument was that they
had subsidiaries elsewhere so we
couldn't do anything about it you know
the United States is absolutely
powerless when to use pressure and so on
and if anyone's doing something offshore
so we couldn't do anything with that
but Texaco is the interesting case
Texaco didn't have an offshore
subsidiary and the day before the US
troops landed that's Sunday you know
while President Carter was having dinner
with general cedrus and his Slim
attractive wife and oh that's that the
AP wire started coming along with a very
interesting story in fact what was
obviously the major story of the week if
we had anything like a newspaper in the
country that would have been the major
story of the next week there was a leak
from the Justice Department obviously
just part of your seminary publish they
leaked it to Associated Press and the
leak said in effect that the Clinton the
Bush and Clinton administration's at the
highest level at the Treasury Department
level had authorized Texaco to keep
sending oil what had actually happened
denied the details in an article if you
would actually happened is the they got
an official cease and desist order from
the Bush administration because it was
illegal but they were also informed the
same day by the Treasury Department that
it wouldn't be enforced Texaco then went
to the Justice to the Treasury
Department which is
possible with a put with an idea they
said they wanted to stay thought they
could set up a blind trust which they
could use as the cover for diverting oil
and they asked for a legal opinion they
waited 11 months before they got a legal
opinion and then they were told no it's
illegal but go ahead and do it anyway
because we're not going to do anything
about it and this went right up till the
end so there we have the biggest story
of the week the day before the US troops
land there never were any sanctions
because the bush and the Clinton
administration explicitly determined and
authorized the oil companies that they
could continue to violate the embargo of
will as indeed they did enriching the
rich families and so on and so forth
well out of curiosity I did a nexus
search couple days later and the Monday
nothing was reported but you know and
they does too early Tuesday when
certainly every newspaper in the country
had it on their news desk it was
actually reported in one newspaper in
the United States a plats oil grant
which deals with the oil industry and
they mostly quoted the Texaco denials
the next day there were a couple of
lines hidden somewhere in the Wall
Street Journal and some of the smaller
journals around the country where
editors aren't too sophisticated and
don't know what to suppress you know in
Ohio and so on
they ran small stories on inside pages
today this day it hasn't appeared in The
New York Times The Washington Post the
Boston Globe they all know it you know
of course everybody knows it happy you
miss I mean first of all it's given for
them explicitly but quite apart from
that you cannot miss the biggest story
coming over the AP wires I know if
you've ever been in a news office but
you can't miss it and this was plainly
the big story the week the first
coverage of it that I've seen was in the
Miami Herald on October 23rd that's over
a month after it was released and they
added it they didn't give most a story
incidentally but they did add a few new
details for example they also pointed
out that the Clinton and Bush
administration's had not been enforcing
any of the other sanctions either so for
example a Clifford grant whose
you know one of the rich who supporters
from the other big rich family along
with the meds last May he went to Miami
to buy himself a fifty thousand dollar
Cadillac
well his assets had been frozen so you
know something going on couscous
other ku supporters were buying house it
wasn't a single house attached nothing
was attached nothing was done the they
finally did go after the assets of the
major coup supporters like the chief of
staff general Giambi but they waited
there a long time so that he could move
if they could all move them somewhere
else when they got to general BM B's
assets according to the Miami Herald
there was five dollars and seven cents
left so you know we're guys really
suffering well that's that's the way the
sanctions work were imposed in fact
there weren't any because the US was
essentially telling the generals and the
rich families look you guys have certain
amount of time a couple of years to
clean up the story you know kill off the
leaders intimidate people murder who you
want and then when it's done will tell
you it's done and you don't have to
worry about any punishment because
there's complete impunity and you'll go
off somewhere and live happily ever
after
which is exactly what happened that's
the story the press all knows that they
have all the evidence but maybe in 50 or
60 years you know somebody else write
about it somewhere outside the
peripheral journals well there certainly
are some people who know it like for
example Fritz meds who's the spokesman
for the richest family they're the mavs
family he's the biggest confusius for
the intervention in fact he's running
around port-au-prince putting up tens of
thousands of posters you know
greeting our steed and thanking the
Americans and so on the reason is he's
not an idiot he didn't have to wait for
the AP stories to come along to tell him
that the u.s. was authorizing oil
shipments to Haiti because he was
building a facility to to store the oil
and sell it like the American Embassy
so he now knows the background he's also
smart enough to read the economic plan
that was rammed down our state's throat
the core which again you wait a while
before you see this in the press press
hasn't found it yet
but the economic plan said the core part
you know it says that the renovated
government the new government in Haiti
will focus its energies on civil society
particularly the private sector and
foreign investors okay that's Haitian
civil society like us investors our
Haitian civil society but not the guys
up in hills you know or not the people
down in the slums well he can read that
and he knows that he can also listen to
axel quicker the were head of the World
Bank the guy at the World Bank Haiti
desk who explained that when this plan
was released that the plan is aimed at
the interests of what he called the
enlightened sector of the business class
the enlightening sector of the business
class are the guys who don't like it
when they're driven in their limousines
and korto press and they see you know
corpses lying around it's kind of fun
pleasant they'd rather have people
starving to death somewhere else or
maybe working in factories for five
cents an hour and so on that's the
enlightened sector of the business class
and the plan is directed to their
interests the government has also been
broadened so that they're going to run
things that's called democracy the
Quaker also pointed out that there is no
more there's not going to be any more
talk about a minimum wage or other
welfare none of those things are on the
agenda
just welfare for civil society private
sector in Haiti and the private sector
in the United States Haitian civil
society that's what the money will go
for and everything will be fine so the
government has at last yeah broaden
properly we've got it's reaching out to
the middle classes the meds you know
that 1% of the population who own the
place and we have real democracy run by
the meds and the brand some of the US
investors and so on and so forth it's a
Haitian civil society in other words
well just to make certain that nothing's
gonna go wrong
Irish deed is not being allowed to
finish his term the Clinton speech
announcing that you know what was going
to happen always great stuff the
centerpiece of it which he emphasized
was that hey that our seed had really
proven himself to be a real Democrat he
was going to step down when the
Constitution required in December 1995
so it means he'll be there for a couple
of months in a box and we don't have to
worry about it well you know you had to
go north of the border to Canada as far
as I know to find the obvious comment
about this there's nothing in the
Constitution that says he has to step
down in December 1995 the Constitution
says he is to serve a five-year term it
doesn't deal with the question of what
happens if three years of that term are
spent in exile
while u.s. trained forces are you know
slaughtering and supporters incidentally
yeah u.s. training of military forces
continued in Haiti at least for eight or
ten months after the coup and for all I
know right up till the end the
Constitution says nothing about that and
then you can interpret it either way if
you have a sort of a lingering taste for
democracy
you'll interpret it as meaning that he's
got four and a half years to serve
meaning the population who voted
for him have a president that they voted
for for four and a half years if you
really despise democracy with a passion
you conclude that he's got to leave in
December 1995 now as far as I know as
far as I can find out it's a hundred
percent despising democracy with a
passion in the United States as I say
you go north of the border and people
point out that this decision which has
nothing do with the Constitution is a
partial legitimation of the coup which
of course it is it's a partial
legitimation of the coup exactly as the
Canadian Kris say well Clinton is being
much praised for his successes and
that's correct
in effect they've restored the situation
pre-1990 with one difference this
infection you know this vibrant lively
civil society has been seriously which
nobody was noticed back then has been
certainly damaged apparently not
destroyed but severely weakened
although amazingly it hasn't been
destroyed they don't seem to give up as
quickly as people around here do and in
fact we have some lessons to learn from
the Haitians not only about democracy
but also about other things though
learning about democracy might be a
pretty good beginning well one last
comment if you look at the history of
Haiti over 500 years the thing we're not
allowed to look at it's almost like a
parable of of the European conquest of
the world and just encapsulated in the
most dramatic fashion when Columbus
landed in Haiti he regarded as a
paradise it was maybe the richest place
in the world with Santa Ming you know
the two places probably the richest
place in the world maybe the most
populous completely peaceful he was just
astonished actually the British reacted
about the same way when they landed in
what is
Bangladesh which also suggests something
the the the native population was wiped
out within a couple of years they then
brought in slaves and then you know Rob
the place blind Haiti was the richer
part a large part of France's wealth
can't come straight from robbery of
Haiti it was the richest colony in the
world in the 18th century after the you
know this horrifying event calling for
freedom it was punished badly punished
mostly by the war by the US than anyone
else who u.s. had more to fear from
place calling for freedom for blacks
obviously the by the time that Wilson's
Marines were ready to invade in 1915
Caribbean specialists were still
describing Haiti as a country of
enormous resources and potential that's
1950 well by the time the Marine
occupation was over you know nothing
much left of that a lot of and then we
go into the period that I've just
described the if you look at the place
now some Haitian specialists think that
if things continue as they are it may
turn into a desert within our lifetimes
so within our lifetimes the richest most
populous part of the world from on the
basis of which Europe gained an awful
lot of its will may be uninhabitable
well again that's the kind of thing that
you're not supposed to learn anything
about from if you are proper properly
well educated it doesn't have to happen
people in Haiti are struggling to
prevent it from happening but alone
they're not gonna win they're gonna have
to have support from here
[Applause]
thank you very much we actually have a
few minutes here about 15 minutes for
questions
I should have announced this earlier it
probably makes the most sense that
everybody in the room can hear the
questions for people who have questions
to come down here and speak in this mic
so those of you who have questions
please come down here if we would like
to start from one I know people over
there are in the far side of the room
might not be able to get to it that
quickly but if there's somebody over on
that side of the room that has a
question you can raise your hand I'll
call on you and we can start that way
but then other people if you could come
down here at the mic that would be good
anyone over there who does question No
okay well this this person right here is
ready so
a little closer to the mic well actually
aid for investment stopped I mean I
don't know if it was that minute but it
stopped very quickly an aide continued
but it was through the business
community that set up to support the
business community in defending itself
against the threat that arts are Steve
might Institute social reforms that aid
continue why did they have to justify
anything is anybody asking too many
questions
is anybody asking the many questions to
whom would that they would have to
justify it if reporters were saying why
are you doing it but they don't have to
worry about that aid didn't resume after
the coup at least officially although
you know it's a mixed story because as I
say right after that within a couple of
weeks after the coup after after the OAS
embargo the US did grant an exemption
for US owned firms or firms with us
connections and that meant that things
went on not all that different from
before but there was no I assume there
was no official US aid though there was
official us there was US military train
the AP story the only place I know is an
article of mine in V Magazine this month
it did I sent it around to a lot of
journalists when I read it and some of
the people in sort of you know
peripheral journals used it so there's a
few things around but the first story
I've seen anywhere near the mainstream
is the Miami Herald story
[Music]
he's allowed to go back as long as he
fumbles under your noses his boss and it
goes along with the World Bank 9ms and
you have three things to say that
lecture precisely one was if he wants to
he also said to me about working for the
CIA that fact he was only working
through the CIA as an informant and he
tried to suggest that there was a
difference in CIA operations between
those who are gathering and reporting
information and those who are operations
that just certainly passing this part of
the discussion that now AI D and the
National Democratic accuracy are doing
much well first of all you the National
Endowment for democracy is fairly recent
you know just last ten years or so so
yeah they're taking over some of the USA
it always did uh and I don't you know I
wouldn't particularly demonize the CIA
the CIA is just the you know it's just
the branch of the it's the part of the
executive branch of the government that
carries out operations that the White
House doesn't want to acknowledge and
pretty much that's what it does and
that's true here too so for example when
Brian look tell the chief CIA
specialists in Latin America it was
testifying before Congress through the
two years about how rst was a lunatic
and a monster and said dress was this
kind of nice guy and there were no human
rights violations it's impossible but
that was done without the authorization
of the Clinton administration I mean
they can certainly control what the
leading CIA specialist says to Congress
they don't like it they throw them out
so that's the you know that's the way in
which the government the White House
preserves deniability that's the CIA as
to the crap constant here's the guy who
was the head of the paramilitary live
taunt on that couch you know the the big
killers our military killers he was the
head of it and it turns out he was on
the CIA payroll as an informant but we
separate that from the actions that he
was carrying out
work that match so as for an in fact
right after the coup he you know the US
was setting up interviews for them and
so on and so forth in fact chances are I
mean we'll know this soon I suspect
others here may know more and will tell
you that it's very likely that US aid
and crap are setting up alternative
structures right through Haiti to try to
undermine the popular organizations
that's kind of Guatemalan style
insurgency what you do is you know you
first you master anyone who's got the
wrong ideas and frighten them and then
you come along security forces come
where the terrorists come along with
let's say a clinic and they're
well-funded best us will fund them and
they say look you know you're living you
want your kid to get some medicine you
better come to our clinic and that's the
only place you're going to get it and
when you come their clinic you better be
properly obedient and follow us along
after a while that kind of counter
insurgency which probably with the
Guatemalans under us Direction developed
more actively than anyone else that's
successful you know it it works
and I imagine that that's what they're
doing in Haiti right now others who know
Haiti a lot better than me can say as to
our stage doing this voluntarily yeah
sure I mean he could choose to commit
suicide if he prefers I mean the u.s. is
always telling people they can do things
voluntarily but voluntarily means you
know when the biggest Maffei done on the
block's as well you know you don't have
to pay your protection money it's
voluntary it's true you know you don't
have to pay it you know you'll end up in
a concrete slab at the bottom of the
river next but it's voluntary it's like
when the US imposes what are called
voluntary export restraints the Reagan
administration is very much in favor of
a free market as you recall but they
actually doubled they were the most
protectionist government in post-war
American
in fact more protectionist than all and
what all combined but it was all
voluntary they didn't raise tariffs they
just said you're gonna have voluntary
export restrictions voluntary or else no
and the u.s. is so powerful and so rich
that other people voluntarily agreed to
do what the boss tells them or else you
know that's how the US was able to
reconstitute its auto industry and steel
industry and chip industry and so on if
we if the US had believed in market
principles they'd all be run by Japan no
but they were told to voluntarily not
interfere with us
reconstruction subsidies for you know
failing us industry and yeah they
voluntarily agreed that's I'm a little
surprised that Mort Halpern would say
that he's smarter than that but in a way
it's true
yeah
okay getting that consistency
ah what do I make up a debate on the
left I don't know I mean perfect
perfectly frankly I was ambivalent
myself I mean I don't know what to say
in fact the day before the intervention
I was quoted and the Boston Globe is
being in favor of it and quoted in the
New York Times being against it the New
York Times the quote was just invented
the quote in the Boston Globe was sort
of more or less accurate but isn't quite
get the tone across my feeling was sort
of like this I mean they suppose I'm
watching a torturer apply electric
torture to somebody and he turns to me
and he says would you like me to cut
down the current a little bit well you
know chances are I'd probably say yes
cut down the current and that's
essentially what the issue is I mean
it's you know that how do you can't make
a decision I'm there's no decision to
make about such things other than well
okay if these guys are running the show
and they're willing to cut down the
current I suppose that's better than
keeping the current high and not you
know I don't see why there should be a
debate about it I mean that seems to me
like sort of the right in my view at
least that's the right position to take
I mean others disagree but it's not that
thing if if the US had not sent the
truth I mean the u.s. told in effect
told The Killers you've got a certain
amount of time to do your work then
you're going to go and we'll move in and
restore the status quo ante the former
status quo and well you know when they
decided it's time to restore the former
status quo I suppose it's better than
continuing the torture it does somebody
said before at least leave openness I
mean it makes possible people survive a
little bit and it leaves open the
possibilities of
organizing and development then it gives
us possibilities of doing things that
you can very well do drink OOP imma take
somebody likes a koala farmer we all
know during the last part of the coup
years he simply could not go back to his
rural clinic and be killed no all right
now you go back he won't be killed as he
in favor of the intervention I'm furious
any more than in the sense that I'm in
favor of turning the cart down
David Whitehouse
like I think it is hard from the basic
village of political education and needs
to learn about these stats and the
purpose of US intervention over the
years the governmental
the corporation in Haiti and I think the
kind of things that you're trying to
make into the basic education political
education is meditation but I think
there's there's one effect that this
learning has upon people to learn the
dance the US efforts to repress
democracy in places like Haiti is that
people learning about this begin to over
estimate the strength and coherence of
the u.s. autopsy and fail to see the
opportunities for people in actually to
fight back actually when you're saying
that US gave a certain amount of time to
do their work to get rid of them I think
maybe that doesn't overstate the extent
which the u.s. controlled the course of
events and we ought to focus more on the
event such as 1980 1986 when events got
out of the US control and focus on what
week at the park or Japan archive
hey and the forest in the United States
need to do because this model is an
estate you know it's not infallible
can't be beat I want to know well I
don't think the real issue at this point
is getting US troops out of Haiti I
think it's supporting popular
organizations in Haiti which is a
different thing we should be working
support popular organizations in Haiti
to try to set up counter forces to the
World Bank US aid meb's Brandt style
development and we should also be
working here to try to change US policy
now it's certainly true that you know
the US isn't all-powerful but you know
relative to Haiti I mean the power is
just overwhelming and unless there's
significant internal disruption here and
significant changes here they don't have
a lot of space so sure the change you
know they'll try to do it they can but
they don't have a lot of space with a
normal amount of help from here that
means just plain solidarity work on the
one hand so assisting organizations
which are not going to get us aid
funding or world bank funding like a
peasant organization you know the you I
think US aid is never given them a cent
as far as I know although it's a peasant
country and they're the leading peasant
organization in the country but you know
after all this is a rich country a lot
of other people can give them money not
just US aid so one thing is that support
for the popular organizations which
solidarity works needed not only in
Haiti but in Central America and
everywhere more probably more than ever
but the other thing is always the same
thing we've got to change our own
country until this country gets
democratized and freed up the world is
going to be in bad
[Music]
[Applause]
this is the portion that I really
haven't formulated very much but it was
just in the responses I was thinking
about what you're talking about
exporting as an organization but often
we are organizing and solidarity the
level at which you can support these are
organizations that a much lower level
than what you're talking USA
or how many American citizen organized
ourselves
of this country or those countries well
you know USA it is technically speaking
under the control of US citizens and if
we could develop here some counterpart
to the civil society that developed in
the Haitian slums we could advance that
far toward democracy we could change US
aid policy now look if they can do it in
the slums of Haiti and the hills of you
know the in the devastated peasant
community the fact that we can't do it
is kind of sick so
[Applause]
but if the person mentioned earlier I
think that crosses the discussion around
Haiti
even though it does take up the
questions of what is developing and he
distortedly and today that for us here
the big question that we had to sort
through a continuous or through and it's
come up in many meetings around baby
that I think is the question around the
u.s. occupation and that if you use your
point that you made earlier about
turning down the electricity a little
bit if anything today in Haiti
electricity is being turned up it is
being turned up where were 20,000 total
workers are set to be laid off as part
of the austerity measures and deals with
the IMF and World Bank for example the
the privatization in port-au-prince the
airport the utilities all of these
things are beginning to take shape under
the same policy of the US government
which led them to intervene and occupy
Haiti in the first place if we don't see
the direct correlation you kind of that
that we really do underestimate what our
job is here I disagree I think that it's
an important question and what we were
able to do here although the people of
Vietnam were able to defeat the US
policy in Southeast Asia the role in the
millions that we played here in that US
intervention became paramount to what
unfolded in terms of the u.s. policy
withdrawal from Southeast Asia
so there's many there's many examples
historically over this and if we don't
learn the lessons of what this
government and others like it have done
in the world throughout the world
historically then we will repeat I think
if someone is the power between the
errors around around
opposed unconditional US military
invasion and occupation it's around
around
aresty it's a big debate unfolding again
it's not just a question in my opinion
of falling under the pressure its
decisions that you make because you have
bug locks and the popular organizations
that you can turn to the role the life
of change the direction of policy which
i think is important but if you if you
don't stand up to the attempts of
turning up the electricity one you're
proposing a gano subservient regime to
the US government's wishes and once
again we're back with not just an
occupation of Haiti but Haiti we treated
from 1986 yeah well I disagree with most
of what you've said I think that the
talk about you know US forces get out
it's kind of a slogan maybe it makes
people here feel good I don't think it
has much to do with Haiti the US forces
will get out fairly soon as for the fact
that electrical workers are being fired
yeah that's true
but I call that turning down the
electricity still tortured but it's not
it's not being cut to pieces and left on
the street that's cutting down the
tortured the and you know the the
changes that we ought to institute are
not something like you know US troops
out somebody else in but US policy
different that means a different form of
development policy I don't care whether
you're US troops are there are UN troops
or anything else
as for rst you know maybe it feels nice
here to say okay he ought to do
something else but you know I think this
is really cheap second guessing you
can't just I mean he he is in no
position to say okay I'll call for lava
loss to come out in the streets
those are slogans of you know left-wing
sects in the United States in my opinion
but they don't mean much in a terrorist
stated as to the US you know the people
of Vietnam defeating the United States
that's another slogan that didn't happen
it didn't happen at all in fact the u.s.
want a partial victory in that war and
what's more the US business community
knew it they knew it by the early 70s at
the latest the big problem in the the
war was fought in Vietnam I the war was
fought in Vietnam in order to prevent
the virus effect they were afraid of the
you know the threat of successful
independent development by the time they
had finished up with Vietnam there
wasn't gonna be any successful
independent development and they knew it
twenty-five years ago you know like the
International Business press was well
aware that's one of the reasons why they
didn't mind that much pulling out the
troops they'd already wiped out the
place it's not going to develop and you
can see what's happening right now now
as for the u.s. opposition here that was
really important but I don't think that
that has any relationship to Haiti I
mean in in Vietnam the United States was
carrying out you know a mass slaughter
and destruction of the country okay
that's what the US was doing and it was
entirely proper to work as hard as we
can to get them to stop that we didn't
do enough you know so in fact they want
a partial victory anyway not surprising
when you look at the relation of forces
in Haiti it's just a different situation
I mean the slogans don't carry over to
other cases you got a look at them in
each particular case
[Music]
[Applause]
and wanting to let us know what picture
isn't really which is quite the country
of states but according to your own
analysis knowledge and insight of this
situation what do you see is the future
of Haiti that seems to be caught between
what in the national yeah well my guess
is here I would tend to agree with some
of the Haitian historians and analysts
have written about this who have pointed
out that and I think plausibly that as
things are going Haiti may disappear in
another couple of decades it's losing
its forest cover it's losing its water
desertification is expanding there may
not be anything there you know may be
unlivable the and if you know I don't
know if it'll be twenty years or you
know fifty years or something but that's
certainly the direction which things are
going instantly the same is true of a
large part of Central America I should
say the selected Nicaragua they're
basically losing their water supply
that's the result of us depredations
know as for the people of Haiti well you
know they said what they want it I mean
when they got their own government of
the power they were saying what they
want it they can't achieve it without
without changes inside the United States
significant changes inside the United
States and really only people who can
carry out changes in the United States
so it seems to me again that what's left
for us is essentially two things try and
they're in parallel you know one of them
is just give whatever kinds of support
are possible and develop whatever kind
of organization you can do to simply
give assistance to popular organizations
in Haiti and the same is true throughout
the region you know for that matter in
the Philippines
everywhere give them as much support as
they can you know we have access to
resources not on the scale of the
Pentagon but you know access to
resources and that can make a difference
help them you know along the other thing
is to change American policy and that
means carrying out a you know serious
democratization of American society it's
gonna be a big problem
you know it's an unless that is done
it's not only Haiti but most of the rest
of the world is gonna suffer very
bitterly and though as far as I can see
those are the two things we have to talk
about the question of you know where the
troops are there or not for another
couple of months seems to be a minor
question
[Applause]
so much mr. Chomsky okay wow that was
wonderful
now we're moving on into the portion of
the program that concerns the recent New
England observers delegation to Haiti
and particularly one of the people who
we were fortunate enough to accompany to
Haiti a Haitian who's been outside Haiti
for the past few years because of the
the danger they're unable to go back I
work for an organization called
grassroots international and for the
last three years we've been sending cash
grants and material aid to various
community-based groups in Haiti
one of the main partners we have
mentioned
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
time over you know make is that is
people in welcome and how much people
were so nice you know but it wasn't
because they know that ice was very
strong with the support of the people
but you know imposing you know this
virtual address men like people did too
much structural adjustment but it is
sweet now before the winds you can hear
people are saying you know I you know
put the price of the castle in it you
know because instead of keeping the
fighter under said thirty eight thirty
is still a simple down to thirty is very
very rising because of that so now it's
easier to for them it's a little pocket
to impose the structural adjustment
which is the portion for funny
for the Haitian people now the way you
know they will kill is you know what
we're doing here is to prevent the
popular organization so organizing to
try to dismantle them and we know that
we want the troops to be our probably in
a few weeks that controls the said what
do you see hands will you know push for
the truth to come back but we know that
we will
occupation with all the invisible forces
in need so now this is structural
adjustment doctor you know we don't have
to talk about it but it's really a
deadly cocktail for the Asian people if
they have to trick you
so it's going to be a big fact of real -
how's your foot you know it's one of our
friends in the US to help the Asian
people in this trouble so like I said we
weren't the US the troops the US forces
to be you know not just the visible
mostly troops but also all the invisible
forces which are trying to disappear
organization trying to influence you
know the politics like the election so
that they can elect the u.s. can't let
you know that all candidates and we what
we were once again want to ask for your
support in this struggle that hated
people will have a to a do you know
becoming once within your support
because without this one you know it's
going to be more difficult for for the
people to implement the kind of change
that what they want to implement the
kind of democracy a one not a democracy
that
but the Democrats that people think -
movie sign thank you
okay and thank all of you for being here
we actually have a great video footage
that's been put together now that we're
going to they're going to show here sort
of summarizing the whole doing with
observers delegation that may be the
fourth delegation that we went on we've
someone wants to get the lights and then
afterwards I have we are going to confer
a lot today about the need to to help
the popular movement and to help hearing
so for mobilization our survival s
minute talks a little bit about what
people can do locally so if anybody can
stick around and clean up that would be
great

[Music]
so after we attended the mass and the
demonstration in grande hua we then went
to tea guav to speak to the US Special
Forces soldiers there we encountered one
Special Forces soldier who was the head
of the intelligence operations there in
tea guava and in the ground guava area
he first agreed to speak to us only
off-the-record and what he said to us
among other things was that the real
problem in the area was the street
and so we said what do you mean that the
street and he said you know the
real problem here is the Lava law I
guess all these US soldiers have been
given a briefing where they're not said
it's not lava loss which is the correct
term but they're told lava law and so
they're all saying it lavalla the real
problem here is the lava law it's the
unemployed the people on the streets the
students they want something for nothing
and the people that are really there
good people here the people that are the
professionals the farmers the people
that have jobs that really know what
they
that's the from and when we first came
here in fact we asked people to give us
a list of their members went ahead they
turned us over a list of all their
members I can see that they're all
professional people in the area but the
people that loved a lot of people the
OPL people those are the sneaky ones
they didn't want to give a list of their
membership and this was what this guy
was saying again who was the head of the
intelligence for the special forces in
the area he also talked about the
violence over the past three years that
the violence when we asked him what was
going on during the past three years if
the real problem was was the lot a lot
of people I mean what about all those
killings and he said again the only
people that have to worry are those that
are looters people that are not looting
don't have anything to worry about we
also asked about the question of
disarmament and he said well we were
talking about frappe and he was again
staying trapped there the property
owners they're businessmen they're
people have something to lose I met with
them at the beginning when I came in I
told them to stay home lay low and we
asked did you disarm them and he said of
course not
people are entitled to keep their
weapons just lay low these are the
people who care these are the people who
have something to lose and it's lava
loss that's going to take it away from
them so this this was basically the
essence of oh he also said this was when
he was talking off the record he then
when he went on the record he really
changed his story a lot we said before
when we had asked what we thought of
what he thought of our seed he said Oh
RSD just a real human rights violator
he's a real communist and then when he
was on the record he said oh I don't
think about our see that much but later
on he went back on the record with
journalist Amy Goodman and he said he
kept talking about stone communists and
Amy asked Amy Goodman asked what do you
mean stone communists I said da la da la
and the guy in the palace stone
communists they're a bunch of unemployed
and students they want something for
nothing and that's what he's promising
stone communists so again this is the
this is the kind of operation that is
happening in places like T guav and
places out in the countryside where the
special forces are there's a lot of
tension obviously
when these people think this about about
the very people that elected rst to
power and I just noticed in this past
week's newspaper coming out of the
Haitian community up here that the very
organizations that were organizing the
mass and the demonstration and
commemoration of varsity's return in
memory of the victims of the coup and
then demonstrations against the
collaboration between the US military in
the Haitian military this grassroots
organization called kumbhak o mio foe
well they have been recently the target
of house searches by the US military
working with the Haitian military that
has gone just this past week to the
homes of the leaders of the people in
combee comeo foe trying to arrest them
so this struggle is going to continue
okay also because this program today is
on a very tight schedule I really would
like to ask your cooperation in making
it run smoothly one of the things that I
just mentioned is leaving through the
back and not you know trying to to do
things as discreetly as possible I know
there probably be a number of people
coming in and out also please be aware
and respectful of the fact that our
speakers have a very limited time both
for their presentations and for
questions so I'm going to try to cut
things off right on schedule so that we
can continue with the program it's very
packed and very exciting but you know we
want to make sure that everybody has the
opportunity to hear what they came for
and to participate as much as possible
okay so welcome this event is being
coordinated in large part by the Haiti
anti intervention network and before we
introduce our featured speaker I'd like
to introduce Jean witters Lee from the
international socialist organization a
very active member of the Haiti anti
intervention Network who's going to talk
about the work of the networks so far in
the last few months so this is Jean
[Applause]
thanks wonder the haiti anti
intervention network is a group of
organizations which have come together
to support real democracy in Haiti in a
form of the popular movements and in
opposition to the role the US has played
in that struggle the Clinton
administration and the media try to
convince us that the u.s. is the friend
of the Haitian people kicking out the
murderous military and bringing
democracy like a present to Haiti the
truth is that the vibrant lava last
movement which made the election of
father aresty possible is still alive
and strong as a democratic movement in
its own right as people will be
discussing here today the truth also is
that while the US government has created
an opening for the Haitian people to
breathe and to be able to gather
together without being killed it is
really the friend of the tiny rich elite
on the hills of petionville which
overlooked port-au-prince and not the
friend of the vast majority of peasants
and working people US businesses make
huge profits by paying $2 an hour
wages in Haiti a situation that they
have demanded that era state allowed to
continue even if US troops pull out of
Haiti by the end of the year as Clinton
has promised the UN troops will remain
with half of them being US soldiers and
US money will remain to influence the
course of Haitian society and the threat
to real Haitian democracy will remain so
in addition to putting on this event
today the Haiti anti intervention
Network has held two demonstrations to
oppose the u.s. occupation one on the
day of the occupation October 15th and
1/2 weeks later and a press conference
the day of the occupation and a teachin
to inform people of the situation
similar to the one today this the work
needs to continue and if you agree with
what you have heard here today
and you would like to be part of it
please come to our meeting December 1st
at 7 o'clock at 25 West Street hi my
name is Melinda man and I'm a staff
person at grassroots international and
also a member of last month's New
England observers delegation to Haiti we
went to witness the restoration of
president airspeed and also to accompany
Haitian peasant leader
Siobhan Jean Baptiste back to his
hometown of hench in Haiti's central
plateau after he'd been out of the
country for several years in exile
because of the coup I want to welcome
everybody here today on behalf of the
organizations who are sponsoring this
event
those organizations are the Haiti anti
intervention Network the New England
observers delegation the MIT Fissel and
the M Pei Pei EDF which is the papaya
peasant movement education and
Development Fund we're honored today to
have with us professor Noam Chomsky
leader a peasant leader
siobhan Jean Baptiste and the members of
last month's New England observer's
delegation to Haiti who will be
presenting a report back along with a
slideshow and video of the trip
today's program is entitled building
bridges to Hades movement for social
justice it's intended to provide a forum
for learning about US policy in Haiti
the history of and the current work of
Haiti's popular movement the movement
which swept president air state into
office in 1990 and also to discuss and
share the ways that people here in the
Boston area can in our supporting
democracy in Haiti as part of this
effort we will be raising funds for the
peasant movement of papai Haiti's oldest
and largest peasant organization
which will be sent directly to Haiti
before we begin the program I want to
make a few announcements about the
logistics of the day there are
refreshments as you probably all know in
the back this is about a three and a
half hour long program so you're welcome
to go get refreshments discreetly at any
time there's bathrooms out the back and
make a right we will be passing around a
sign-in sheet a little later if you
haven't already signed in would really
like it and Kurt and encourage everybody
to put your name and address down so
that we can keep in touch with you about
upcoming events also I'd like to call
your attention to the packets but you
should have received when you're coming
in the door these packets each they have
a listing of a number of groups here in
Boston working to support Democratic
efforts in Haiti in a number of ways
there's a postcard that we're gonna ask
you at the end to all sign calling for a
investigan gresham investigation into
the ways that the US has supported the
coup regime in Haiti which you'll find
out all about today and also a pledge
sheet and an envelope for your donation
to the papaya peasant movement which
goes straight to Haiti if you do have to
leave early I would ask that you go
through the back doors not come down the
front and that you turn in your envelope
with your pledge or donation to the
people at the doors before you leave and
if you want to understand them you have
to look at their institutional source
and how that's played itself out over
the years and if the whole past is
always wiped is that every point wiped
out as irrelevant you have a guarantee
that that won't happen so that concern
of about possible insight into the real
world is therefore obviated and again
that's a very useful feature of an
advanced educational system that few
have gone to good colleges and you've
gotten into the professions and so on
you can understand this
of maintaining that doctrine otherwise
you might have to learn something from
the past and also learn something about
the present since these institutions
remain the same than the policies remain
the same the if you you this way you can
avoid looking not only at the history of
everything that's happened but also at
the very explicit planning record that
tells you why it's not the planners are
you know reticent about it I mean it's
mostly classified but free societies it
gets opened up after 40 or 50 years and
if you look back you find policies
outlined with great specificity that
tell you almost exactly everything
that's going on they from from both the
policies and the way they've played
themselves out you pretty well deduce
what's going to happen next
so it's therefore very important not to
look for example if you if you look
you'll discover that our poet that our
our policies with regard to Latin
America at the highest level you know
quite consistently were based on the
principle that the major threat to US
interests them virtually quoting is
nationalistic regimes which are
responsive to pressures from the masses
of their population for for improvement
in low living standards and
diversification of production for
domestic needs this was part of a bigger
problem which the State Department
called the philosophy of the new
nationalism which was sweeping over
Latin America after the second world war
according to the philosophy of the new
nationalism the prime beneficiaries of a
country's resources should be the people
of that country and furthermore
development of those countries should be
not only for domestic needs but should
be egalitarian and so on and that
obviously won't do the u.s. position was
that this form of nationalism must be
destroyed in all its forms and at
hemispheric meetings starting in
February 1945 the u.s. in fact used its
power to undermine the philosophy the
new nationalism and to instill the right
principle that the prime beneficial
areas of a country's resources are the
investors from the United States and
that development that is responsive to
the needs of the population is not to be
permitted development has to be
complementary the US needs not not
conflicting with it the and and that's
in these various testing areas for
scientific methods of economic
development that the US has been
carrying running throughout Latin
America that's indeed what was followed
with the consequence that you discover
for example at Latin America has the
highest rate of inequality of any area
of the world and that it's mostly a
disaster area the check back to the
original policies you see exactly why
and you also see why downtown Boston and
there a sign-up sheets at the back of
the room so we hope to have more of you
you know involved with us and help us to
continue our work as the hey de'aunte
intervention network Thanks
[Applause]
thanks very much gene there are a number
of people and organizations who have
played a key role key roles in putting
this event together but to deserve
special recognition for the incredible
amount of work that they've put into
this both into the whole cause of
opposing anti intervention opposing
intervention and standing with the
popular movement in Haiti and
particularly for their work on this
event today and those are the Boston
mobilization for survival and it's
director John Hill and the American
Friends Service Committee and it's staff
person Paul Shannon who just ran out to
do something else right now
he's out in the back but these two
people have done a remarkable job of
pulling together all the logistics doing
the planning calling people making sure
that this that this event happens and it
is so thank you before I introduce our
featured speaker here I also I do want
to let you know this is going to be a
remarkable day in terms of the kind of
experience and the talks and the
presentations that we're going to hear
and immediately afternoon chomsky we're
going to be having Siobhan Jon batiste
who I'll introduce is that the the
leader of Haiti's oldest and largest
peasant movement and as all of us who
went to Haiti last month found out a
remarkable popular leader with with
massive support from people who has a
absolutely brilliant and cutting
analysis of what the US is doing in
Haiti and also a lot to talk about in
terms of what he sees as a challenges
for the popular movement so I would
really encourage everybody to stay for
the full day if you can and to please at
least really stick around for as long as
you can to watch Siobhan who's an
amazing amazing leader and person so
without further ado I want to say our
first speaker today is well known around
the world and certainly here in this
room not only for his outstanding work
in the field of linguistics but for his
analysis of US domestic and foreign
policy and his critique of global
imperialism he's the author of numerous
books
Flitz articles dealing with these issues
his most recent book World Order's old
and new published by Columbia University
Press is as its title implies an
assessment of the so-called New World
Order and in comparison to the old he is
Institute professor of linguistics here
at MIT and to add to his stunning
achievements
he's also been extensively sampled on an
album by the musical group Bad Religion
so please welcome Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
the pilot is asked to talk about has
certain problems talk about US policy
toward Haiti past present and future but
as all well-educated and well-bred
people know the United States doesn't
have any policies toward Haiti or
anything else so therefore there isn't
any topic we just have programs of
generalized international goodwill as
historian Arthur Schlesinger explained
while the b-52s were carpet-bombing
South Vietnamese villages and in the
case of Haiti well you can just read the
news columns in the New York Times which
explain that now the Americans are back
again still aspiring to do good works
still unable to comprehend the divisions
in this strange society following the
model of the idealistic Woodrow Wilson
and if there's no policies other than
international goodwill and aspiring to
do good works then there really is a lot
to talk about
well actually I for accuracy I should
say that it sometimes recognized that
everything wasn't perfect in the past
there were occasional and then we moved
to another level of discussion in
educated circles at least at that point
we moved to the to looking at errors
naivete may be excessive fears the
United States is a very frightened
country it's always under attack that's
why we have to spend more on the
military than the rest of the world
combined because
enormous Lee threatened and sometimes
people get you know a little excessive
about their natural fears and then of
course we really can't understand these
backward depraved societies so we do
make mistakes now and then but that's
also doesn't leave us with any topic
because at this point another principle
enters the principle of change of course
which is a standard feature of US
ideology the principle says that well
yeah in the past some things maybe
weren't so good because mistakes or
whatever but we can forget about all
that because now we've changed course
and we're just going on aspiring to do
good work so there's no point harping on
all this old-fashioned stuff people in
Haiti kind of mutter about the Wilson
the marine occupation for 20 years but
we understand that that's behind us
whatever mistakes there might have been
and now we just are going on with our
programs of international goodwill well
that's a pretty useful doctrine in
particular is an extremely useful
doctrine for any criminal organization
anywhere because then you don't have to
look at anything that happened in the
past and that makes it possible to
sustain the crucial principle of
intellectual life namely that our
leaders are Noble and benevolent though
you know occasionally make mistakes and
so on and so forth the doctrine of
change of course which is always invoked
with incredible regularity sometimes you
know every few weeks for pretty obvious
reasons it has another nice feature it
guarantees that nobody will ever
understand anything that's going on or
anything that will go on and that's
useful too because you don't want the
rabble to get too much insight into what
you know they're what's happening before
their eyes and what in fact they're
inadvertently or not are supporting the
only way to in stays flow from
institution
institutions are pretty stable
consequently policies are pretty stable
