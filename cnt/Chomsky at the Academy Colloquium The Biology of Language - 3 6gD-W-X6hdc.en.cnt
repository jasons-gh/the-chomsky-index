behavior and so on I had to do with the
ability to think it's it's and as you
say there's no way to resolve it nope
possible means that a man those to try
to resolve this also notice it doesn't
you know from the point of view of
origin of language doesn't really make a
lot of difference I mean it comes out
about the same except for timing we
still have that what seems to me the
fact that the first development is a
comp a perfect computational system
which is linked to the conceptual
interface we first have that somehow and
again this is total mystery at the
atomic elements the meaning bearing
elements appear when how we have the
slightest idea but they had to be there
and this is also true of some other
things like say for example the actor
action schema notions like predication
and so on and maybe these have earlier
roots but at some point they became
available are recruited by the system
that had to happen first later came
externalization matin which i think may
not involve evolution it may be just
solution of a cognitive problem that's
consistent with at least the apparent
fact that the massive diversity and
complexity of language and its
malleability subject to change seems to
lie overwhelmingly in this
externalization process which makes it
look like just a cognitive problem you
can solve in many different ways that's
but but the core parts of language the
structures that exist in them in the
mind and the somatic interpretation of
them the conceptual the mapping the
conceptual interpretation that look
could turn out that that's
really fixed that it happened once and
done no more evolution to beyond what we
can establish today but not beyond what
we can imagine to be true and then comes
the question that in tattersall is
mentioning at what what are the timing
of these two events the one of them
could be at the appearance of the speak
the first one could be at the appearance
of the species lying fallow 400,000
years or so until the externalization
takes place alone with the tea in the
archaeological record this kind of you
know great leap forward sometimes called
or it could be that the ability to think
appear at that point and that looks like
an irresolvable question for pretty much
dick London's reasons which I think are
not taken seriously enough so to come
back to the the mysterious atomic
elements you said that I mean you said
you speculated that much might have
appeared several times but there's
nothing to work on so are you saying
that you need atomic elements for merge
to work but then could it be the case
that the atomic elements are like a fuel
for the system and that they are
generated by the functioning of the
system once it gets going you know I
don't I mean either as possible I don't
see how to resolve it and we know that
the atomic arms are there any
computational system is going to have to
use some atomic elements otherwise you
can't function at all and we can ask a
question whether the system existed the
computational system using computation
using atomic elements that don't link to
thought and therefore useless and then
somehow the ones that do link to thought
emerged the one
after you have and that kind of you know
gave us language that's a possibility
but now we're in the realm of the kinds
of speculations that fall under lewontin
strictures doesn't it be any way to
resolve it yes very best to stay away
from it more questions yeah the greenie
is raising this hand I know my question
and concerns maybe another puzzle the
functional features so atomic elements
the emergence of atomic elements is a
big puzzle the emergence of merge is a
puzzle but won't be simple but in order
for the vs. them to apply and in order
for the mercy seem to come up with let's
say expressions that can be that are
readable for the full of the semantics
these expressions must be labeled for
labeling you need features so my
question is have you any idea where the
features come from how they fit in
because merge without without operating
on features seems hopeless business and
second do you have any ideas about
constraining these features I mean they
are very limited well you're asking
question about the emergence of the
features they enter into functional
features don't necessary for four hours
to come up with a well-formed expression
that's like for example the assuming
that the approach is correct the
categorical features that determine
whether a root is a noun or a verb or
something or the things like inflection
and so on not a clue I mean it seems to
me all in this mysterious domain but
they are very important right 40 the
very important yeah in fact they make
the system work yes as your own another
there's another mystery yeah but I think
but notice that too at the level of and
this has to the level of kind of
semantic interpretation of the
Lee and everything in that domain is a
mystery it's a mystery how a child ever
learns it because there's no evidence
for semantic interpretation is virtually
zero evidence even in simple cases like
the ones I mentioned and the
evolutionary problem is dramatic that
doesn't seem to be anything similar in
animal communication systems if the
discontinuity that Eric Lindenberg
talked about you know half a century ago
seems to have been established more and
more fully also the kinds of
discontinuity that Susie Curtis talked
about the the this the dissociation
doubled associations with other
cognitive capacities which is just
constantly overlooked in the literature
in this strange subject as if you can
you know somehow by magic language comes
out of cognitive capacities from which
its associated but I think you're right
these are just complete mysteries and if
lewontin is correct will remain so you
remember that he ends the second of his
articles on this subject by saying tough
luck okay thanks the next question is
from Star islas de Hannah hello I would
like to ask you a question about the
modularity or on capsulation of the
system you're describing I thought I
understood initially by reading your
your early writings that you were
talking about the system of language
that had very specific properties very
specific quirks that made it quite
unique but hearing you today had a
feeling that you were thinking more and
more in terms of a system there was a
really a system of thought and I was
wondering whether you think that the
same system for building trees who merge
also gave us at the same time in
evolution the ability to develop tree
structures in other domains outside of
which domains such as mathematics for
instance and also provided I didn't
catch the last fridge I was I was
wondering whether the system that allows
us to be treason language is the same
system that allows us to build tree
structures in mathematics mathematics
also perhaps in the domain of action
planning of tool-making which are all
faculties that seem to have emerged with
the certain degree of convergence in
human evolution so well on the first
point the let me stress again that the
earliest work from the 1950s right
through the 80s did assume a very rich
notion of ug ok and it did so for simple
reasons the as soon as the efforts were
made to construct generative grammars
immediately a huge amount of evidence
emerged that nobody had any we had
noticed and it was very complex and very
diverse and it seemed necessary to
construct complex theories of ug to
account simply to be able to describe it
ok that's the first task it was
understood right away that that can't be
right because a complex ug cannot have
evolved so the go back to say my own
undergraduate thesis in the late 1940s
it's mostly concerned with simplifying
phonology those unmoor fala G was mostly
concerned with that how can we simplify
it since the complexity that appears
superficially necessary can't be right
if you look at all the work that
followed won't run through it all of it
was an attempt to reduce the complexity
finally reached the point by the early
90s where it seemed to me at least and a
number of other people that we'd reached
a level of understanding where we could
postulate the thesis that it really is
simple and work on the base of that
that's the reason for the changes it's
commonly believed many commentators have
claimed that this is a total shift and
the approach to language it isn't it's
the single effort from the beginning to
try to develop a theory of ug simple
enough so that it could so that first of
all it provides deeper explanations
because that's what simplicity means and
secondly so that it could ultimately
meet the condition of evolvability now
as far as of mathematics and theory of
action are concerned let's begin with
mathematics I mean as you know it was a
big problem for Darwin and Wallace that
people had arithmetic epatha T as
Wallace pointed out it couldn't have
evolved by natural selection since the
capacity was never used and you know
they had a famous debate about where it
came from and it is a problem the the
only plausible account of this of the
evolution of eric is basically
arithmetic or competence you know the
rest of mathematics is different how
could this have evolved it's possible
and it's an old idea that it is an
offshoot of language and in fact you can
get a model of arithmetic from merge
simply for merge if you restrict the
lexicon to a single element that gives a
model for arithmetic there's a
counter-argument to this famous one of
the dissociations so you know there's
dissociations between arithmetic and
linguistic competence but that doesn't
necessarily show anything as Luigi Ricci
pointed out years ago because what
you're testing always is performance and
it could be that the systems are
anukul but that the ability to use them
involves separate systems yielding the
dissociation although at the core the
systems are the same I mean rich he gave
the analogy of speech and reading their
dissociated but nobody thinks there's an
independent the reading module in the
brain it's the same system but the way
it's executed involves different systems
this is the crucial distinction between
competence and performance that is often
overlooked but it's very crucial so that
could be the answer for arithmetic as
far as the theory of action is concerned
and my own feeling is that the
literature on this is pretty confused
for reasons that under a morose pointed
out I mean it's true that there are you
know action does involve hierarchical
structures but they're nothing like
language absolutely nothing but you
don't have dependencies the reason for
example it goes back to the 50s why find
out automata Markovian sources can't
work for languages had been generally
soon to be the cases of time is because
of dependencies you know if then either
or that sort of men are and so on which
can be arbitrarily remote and can be
embedded in usage there's a ton of
misunderstanding about this in the
literature I mean it was shown fifty
years ago George Miller and I showed
that you a person we can relatively
easily easily understand nested
dependencies up to short-term memory
roughly seven of course we don't use
them because they're too complicated and
many researchers the founders of
connectionism many others have said well
we don't use them beyond tues they don't
exist that's total misunderstanding we
don't use them because they're complex
but we can't understand them it's kind
of like saying
erith medical confidence doesn't exist
because can multiply big numbers in our
head a total misunderstanding the
capacities in your head it's a kind of a
Turing machine system you have the
capacity you have external memory and it
goes down indefinitely and as we know
simple perception without external
memory it goes up to about 7 which is
the limit of short-term memory exactly
what you expected but now turning to
action you just don't have those
dependencies I mean it looks
superficially as if you do like for
example I can you know walk into the
kitchen make a sandwich walk out of the
kitchen and it looks as if walk into a
kitchen and walk out of the kitchen or a
dependency but they're not I can just as
well walk into the kitchen eat a
sandwich and there's been the rest of my
life there that's possible too there's
no dependency and I think that runs
right through the theory of action yeah
there's hierarchical structure but
nothing remotely like what you see in
language so I think that these analogies
just don't mean anything arithmetic is a
different story that has a definite
structure and we do have to ask I mean
your work is crucial in this respect how
the these structures evolved even though
they were never used Wallace's question
and a possibility is offshore of
language can I make a short response to
that I think you may be right that it's
not always needed to describe actions in
terms of a nested structure but I think
this may be the way in which we
interpret it nevertheless so we may have
the capacity to project on somebody
else's action a nested structure just
because we have this representation or
capacity so that's that's one small
reflection I I do think that we think of
action as be
hierarchically organized whether it is
the correct description or not that's
that's how humans think about it and the
second statement I like to is just a
hypothesis that I am considering very
seriously in my work at the brain level
to try to understand what was unique
what changed in the human brain one
possibility that i would consider very
seriously is that there are many
parallel loops in the brain for instance
loops linking the basal ganglia with the
cortex and that it could be that some
parameter of these loops changed
simultaneously for all of these loops
that some of them are involved in
language some of them are involved in
mathematics some of them are involved in
action such that the human brain would
have been endowed with the ability to
create three structures in his different
domains and yet they would remain the
Sochi abilities because there is not a
single brain structure which is able to
create tree structures but is in fact a
duplication of multiple systems that are
all able to collect I structures so I
don't know if this hypothesis make sense
to you know his own explanation well on
the first point I agree we do interpret
what people are doing in terms of nested
structures but that's our interpretation
and that interpretation probably comes
from the fact that we are interpreting
them in language which does have nested
structures so what we see we tend to
impose an interpretation based on our
own systems but that doesn't mean that
that's the way they've organized so
that's why i think that the analogies
that are drawn actually in the
literature again andrea was over there
has written critically of this and
friends and cognitive science quite
accurately i think these things are just
our misinterpretation of what's actually
happening the misinterpretation that's
natural from the point of view of how we
describe things on the second point
you know they're the three things that
you're connecting your language
mathematics and action seems to me that
action is entirely different from the
first two it just has completely
different properties like for example it
doesn't have structure the structural
properties of mathematics or the nesting
properties of language and so on Justin
have them mathematics and language are
is an interesting question and really
it's not mathematics it's arithmetic the
rest of mathematics you know is a
different matter of you remember chronic
errs famous statement that God created
arithmetic and man created the rest I
think a way of interpreting that is that
evolution of humans created arithmetic
and our cognitive capacities then
created the rest of course they're
constrained by gilliam our genetic
capacity but that's different matter a
writ with regard to arithmetic I don't
see how it what your hypothesis is
different from the one that suggests
that meth arithmetic is simply language
restricted to a lexicon with the same
vanilla and of course with no interfaces
that season is essentially the same
thing yeah the next question is from
Peter hago eating's like this on the
evolution of language we also see
cross-species comparison so for instance
we hear about birdsong or about the
capacities of other species to handle
sequences and so on likewise we see
cross-species comparisons in terms of
the infrastructure of the brain do you
see any users usefulness of these cross
species comparisons for understanding
the evolution of language and if so what
is its usefulness well the bird song is
very interesting case and has a lot of
interesting
properties but the similarities that
you're pointing to have to do with
external ization so forming a you know
birdsong has a sequence of you know
terps and they go in a particular order
they're arranged in a certain way and so
on that's similar to you know whether
it's analogous to that's another
question but at least has some
similarity to externalize ation of
language I don't see any similarity to
the internal structure of language the
kind that I've been discussing there are
similarities some similarities at the
level of external ization and that's not
too surprising because there just aren't
a lot of ways to externalise things you
know if you look at the apparatus the
sensory apparatus for external ization
it is pretty well restricted to putting
things in order you know strings on a
bead I doesn't have a lot of
alternatives you know you can't speak in
parallel birds can't either you can't
produce structures the sensory apparatus
doesn't lock doesn't allow it so there
aren't going to be a lot of ways for
external ization to take place now how
much you know if what I suggested is
correct the external ization properties
of language are peripheral to it and in
fact might not involve the evolutionary
processes if that's correct then there
wouldn't be any interesting connection
to say birdsong thank you are there any
more questions rainy you're often stated
that it's hard to imagine how a
recursive system could have evolved
gradually now that's an important
statement seems to me but the statement
hasn't been picked up in the evolution
of language studies it seems to me could
you elaborate a bit on why it is hard to
imagine
a gradual evolution is story for a
former 44 40 of course a system for
marriage 44 well we have to be careful
for an infinite digital recursive system
yeah well they're just it's no way to
reach infinity in small steps I mean
takes a arithmetic which is unconscious
I don't think language should be
contentious but it is arithmetics
unconventional every normal child has
the comprehensive some age that the
numbers can go on forever okay no other
animal does now that capacity can't
develop step by step I mean you can get
22 then seven then 83 at some point yet
so it goes on forever and you might as
well have that at the first step nothing
is gained by imagining the intermediate
steps this is this enters in the
discussion of proto-language like the
early proposals about proto-language the
word that like it had short sentences
and then it developed into language well
that can't be if take a look at Derek
pick curtains recent book his latest one
that just came out he very angry about
this he says it's a canard to say that
proto-language only has support sentence
as he said it could have indefinitely
long sentences okay where'd they come
from how did you get the operation that
gave you indefinitely long sentences
each of which has an interpreter
pretation take a look at his explanation
turns out to be magic you know and it's
it's going to be like that you can't
build up to develop that's
a digitally infinite system by small
steps just as a matter of logic thank
you all the questions yes Williams Adama
thanks so I have the opportunity to ask
my second question so my second question
is about focal learning so I think many
people in the field of evolution of
language are sort of converging on this
idea that that focal auditory learning
is one very important prerequisite for
language and music and something
unfortunately is shared with a couple of
other species so that that might
actually help us to to build up and
constrain evolutionary scenarios so is
there any any way that you're that
you're what's your take basic you want
it I guess that's my question I didn't
catch the fruit were you saying verbal
learning no folk folk vocal learning so
vocal imitation vocal imitation learning
vocal imitation well it's you know it's
possible but I think a question is how
come sign is just as usable as n
develops exactly the same way I mean
it's it's true that the articulatory
auditory modality has some advantages
like you can talk to each other in the
dark for now but a sign we now know it
wasn't known 50 years ago but that's by
now pretty well known that the
acquisition and use and structure of
sign and probably even its neural
representation is essentially the same a
spoken language so that doesn't seem to
have anything to do with you know with
a verbal invitation you can have sign
imitation in fact why didn't I mean Apes
can sign perfectly well what they
developed sign language the way human
infants do spontaneously even without
external you know by now their case is
known many of you know the sign
languages that have been developed by
our children is simply by interaction
with each other no external inputs okay
thanks so much I'm just looking around
whether any more questions remaining yes
Ian Roberts would like to thnkx hi I
have a question actually concerning
again the externalization systems
because from what we know from the study
of phonology there are a number of
similarities with with the core system
in the sense that it's a digital
computational system there's evidence
for cyclic rule application of various
kinds particularly in metrical phonology
and also of course we know that sign
language shows phonological properties
as well which are very similar to the
other modality so I was wondering to
what extent do you think that these
properties stem from the core system or
is it are these just accidental
superficial relationships or is there
may be some overarching reason why the
systems are in certain respects similar
yeah there are several possible answers
actually as you know my own work and
work with marsala and others on cyclic
rules actually tried to unify the
syntactic and the phonological systems
back from the 1950s and that Andrew
Nevins is work you know it illustrates
another kind of connection between which
agreement systems in syntax and
morphology and harmony in
well harmony and so on spoken language
and there's plenty of similarities so
what did they mean well if you accept
the speculation that I've been
presenting what they could mean is that
when the task of external ization was
undertaken it made use of the properties
of language that were already there and
applied them to this new test that's one
possibility another possibility which is
perfectly conceivable is that there's
some deeper reason you know in neural
structure cognitive structure or why
this kind of operation should take place
let's say sick Lissa T or you know
harmony or something and at the moment I
don't see how we can choose between
hypotheses like these but they're real
ones maybe there are ways to look into
them okay thanks very much just one look
last look into the audience is the
question in the back if you come forward
of it you can see you thank you my
question goes back to the discussion of
computational efficiency because it's a
notion that you use several times in
your talkin it's also been discussed in
the previous days in the previous
presentations and then in this
colloquium and it seems that there's
there's not a uniform consider what
computational efficiency actually is so
you had the example with which book will
he read and you said that there's a high
computational load in maintaining the
lower copy of which book I assumed
that's not really within narrow syntax
but more at the sensorimotor interface
but but would it for instance actually
be more useful say for the computer for
the conceptual intentional interface
that the that the lower copy of which
book actually remain and and overarching
Lee do we do we really have an objective
benchmark for what is computationally if
and what isn't well I think it is that
the narrower question is it more
efficient for the conceptual and
conceptual intentional interface to have
both pronounced the answer is yes
because that gives the interpretation we
don't get the right interpretation of
the ones now that's why you have these
very elaborate systems of trying to
determine the interpretation of
sentences in approaches that a bar the
transformational rules or displacement
rules you can kind of build up something
they'll give you the interpretations but
it's extremely complex and it's given
directly there in a rich variety of
cases if you simply assume things work
in the simplest possible way so I think
that's that part is pretty straight on
the nature of computational efficiency
you're perfectly right it's not a a
priori completely clear notion by any
means however the cases that are
involved in the discussions of the kind
of hat and in the literature use notions
of elementary of computational
efficiency so elementary that any future
development of our understanding of the
notion will certainly accommodate them
like to note the idea that less is
better than more okay but fewer
computations are better than more
computations that minimal search is
better than long search you know as long
as you keep the notions that simple you
can be pretty confident that any future
understanding of the notion of
computational efficiency it will
accommodate these results I mean
conceivably it'll turn out otherwise but
it does look very plausible furthermore
you know the notion of computational
efficiency that will be developed maybe
someday for biology will not be
necessarily an a priori
notion like that quantum physics might
use a different notion there are going
to be constraints coming from the
systems that are discussed as to what
counts as efficiency within those
systems that's to be expected another
way of putting it is that our
understanding of computational
efficiency the concept itself will
develop as we proceed in explaining
facts about the phenomena of the
biological phenomena give you a concrete
example a work of about mountain work
and others about say fifteen years ago
assumed that the length of derivations
was a factor in computational complexity
it looks now as if it probably isn't
okay well that's move towards an
understanding of the way computational
efficient either could be true the way
computational efficiency in fact works
in the biological system language and
mate whether how much this extends to
biology generally is pre unclear one
reason is that in the biological world
it is very hard to find examples of
digital infinity I mean you just don't
find many such examples it takes a
animal communication vervet monkey let's
say has whatever it is half a dozen
calls its finite takes a the waggle
dance you know be communication it's
basically a continuous system not a
digital system insofar as a physical
system can be continuous it's and you
don't seem to find anything in between
there are continuous systems there are
finite systems but to try to find a
digitally infinite system it's very
difficult maybe there aren't any beyond
the level of maybe DNA in that case the
language would be extremely unusual
biological system with
just no counterparts and that looks
pretty much like it's the case if so
then the the concept of computational
computational efficiency in language may
not generalize easily to other
biological systems because there's
language is so unique in this formal
respect okay thanks very much thanks to
all the question is we've reached more
or less the end of this session thank
you very much no of course it's very
it's a great pity that would be here
with us today but this is the next best
thing thank you very much for your
effort of going to the studio and
talking to us today thanks very much and
bye bye thank you
