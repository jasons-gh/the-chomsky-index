I wanted to ask how you can possibly
turn to the UN as some sorts of moral
authority it seems to me I don't see
actively regarded as anything other than
a totalitarian instrument of the same
corporate elites you claim whose
interest you claim to oppose well the UN
is first of all the UN remember can do
nothing beyond what the great powers
primarily the United States allow it to
do so it operates within a framework set
by great power interests nevertheless it
does represent a wider range of
interests and concerns than any
particular country I don't say it's a
moral authority and they were called it
that but the UN has can become and to
some extent has been a important and
effective instrument for doing many good
things in the world it cannot do so
beyond the limits of what the great
powers will permit
