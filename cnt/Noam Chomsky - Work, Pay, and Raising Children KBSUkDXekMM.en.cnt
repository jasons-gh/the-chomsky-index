let me go to you yeah
forcing
vagrants forcing vagrants to go to work
to keep inflation down that's the other
way around first of all the idea of
forcing vagrants to go to work is a
funny idea there's some extremely stiff
as soon as one begins to look at these
issues there's many many questions that
ought to be raised for example take the
idea that wealthier mothers have to be
driven to work first of all they're not
vagrants you know the idea that welfare
mothers have to be driven to work that
you know you're not allowed to question
that supposed to be a consensus what
does that mean that means if you're
raising a child you're not working I
mean how many I don't know how many
people around here the fundamental
assumption is that if it's the kind of
work that women are do it isn't work
okay no you know on that's in if you
think it through it leads in interesting
directions this is supposed to be a
meritocratic society we're very proud of
it so you measure the value of work by
the amount of pay you get well if you're
raising a family and raising children
and keeping it going and so on the
amount of pay you get it zero okay so
that is totally worthless you know that
is raising children and keeping families
alive and so on and so forth that is
worthless and there's as a demonstration
of that you don't get paid anything for
it it's a meritocratic Society well what
is work well work is the stuff you get a
lot of money for so like it's driving to
your office and Wall Street and
speculating against currencies in an
effort to drive down growth rates that's
when you get a huge amount of money for
that so that must be a really valuable
work so those guys don't have to be
driven to work because they're already
doing extremely valuable work but
somebody who's a raising a child has to
be driven to work because they're not
doing any work that's the tacit
assumption that underlies all of these
things well you know sort of begin
following through on those assumptions
and
lots of interesting consequences follow
so the idea that anybody has to be
driven to work is I mean you can't even
discuss the topic because it begins with
utterly outlandish premises about what
work is and I should say even if you
pick the craziest University of Chicago
hypothesis that doesn't make any sense
even on those grounds I mean everyone
agrees every economist agrees that if
you want to be serious you can't talk
about human beings as if they're
creatures with rights and so on you have
to talk about them as capital so there's
something called human capital you know
which means how much a human being can
contribute to growth let's say that's
called human capital like you have
enough to eat strong enough to get out
of bed in the morning and so on and so
forth ok if all that stuff increases
you're increasing human capital if you
want to be serious you have to talk
about it this way all right so what
increases human capital well you know
mothers raising children
that's what increases human capital
what's the biggest factor in growth
human capital so in fact you ought to be
paying welfare mothers a high salary to
try to improve
because pressure the work figure I mean
anyone who had a child or thinks for a
second knows that it's work you know
doesn't come free the and that's only a
piece of it of course in fact the whole
story unravels completely as soon as you
begin to look at it seriously so that
you can't even enter into the discussion
about with about driving people to work
however on the narrow point that you
mentioned with regard to inflation it's
supposed to have the opposite effect
here there's an intern serious internal
contradiction in the whole story there's
a thing called the natural rate of
unemployment something like that the
idea is you know there's some mythical
number and he's changing depending on
what purposes you're trying to achieve
but when employment goes above this
mystic number inflation is supposed to
go up this good question about whether
it's good or bad for inflation to go up
but let's say it's bad for the moment
that means you have to keep that you
have to keep unemployment up to that
number well there's another reason for
paying people to stay off the labor
market because when they go into the
labor market what they do is drive that
number down and that's bad because that
undermines the natural rate of inflation
and so on the whole thing is such an
issue of internal contradictions and
--'tis and so on that it's really hard
to discuss and i frankly think that you
shouldn't be trapped into entering into
the discussion on the premises in which
it is pursued like the premise that says
if somebody's raising a child they're
not working on the other hand if you're
speculating against currencies and
making a mint you are working even
though the effect is extremely harmful
effect is it precisely to drive down
growth rates that's the point okay and
that's just one example
