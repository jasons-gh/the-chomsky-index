the reagan administration came into
office 20 years ago declaring that the
war against international terrorism
would be the core of our foreign policy
describing it in terms of the kind they
just mentioned and others and it it was
the core of our foreign policy the
Reagan administration responded to this
plague spread by depraved opponents of
civilization itself by creating a
extraordinary international terrorist
network totally unprecedented and scale
which carried out massive atrocities all
over the world primarily well partly
nearby but not only there I won't run
through the record and you're all
educated people so i'm sure he learned
about it in high school but i'll just
mention one case which is totally
uncontroversial so we don't you about it
by no means the most extreme but
uncontroversial it son controversial
because of the judgments of the highest
international authorities the
International Court of Justice the World
Court and the UN Security Council so
this one is uncontroversial at least
among people who have some minimal
concern for international law human
rights justice and other things like
that and now I'll leave you an exercise
you can estimate the size of that
category by simply asking how often this
uncontroversial case has been mentioned
in the commentary of the last month and
it's a particularly relevant one not
only because it's uncontroversial but
because it does offer a precedent as to
how a law-abiding state would respond to
did respond in fact to a case of
international terrorism which is
uncontroversial and was even more
extreme than the events of September
11th I'm talking about the Reagan US war
against Nicaragua which left tens of
thousands of people did the country
ruined
perhaps beyond recovery it nicaragua did
respond they didn't respond by setting
off bombs and washington they responded
by taking it to the World Court
presenting a case they had no problem
put any other evidence the World Court
accepted their case ruled in their favor
ordered the condemned what it called the
unlawful use of force which another word
for international terrorism by the
United States ordered the United States
to terminate the crime and to pay
massive reparations the United States of
course dismissed the court judgment with
total contempt and announced that it
would not accept the jurisdiction of the
court and henceforth the Nicaragua then
went to the UN Security Council which
considered a resolution calling on all
states to observe international law no
one was mentioned but everyone
understood the United States vetoed the
resolution it now stands as the only
state on record which has both been
condemned by the World Court for
international terrorism and has vetoed
the Security Council resolution calling
on States to observe international law
it nicaragua then went to the General
Assembly where there's technically no
veto but a negative us vote amounts to a
veto it passed a similar resolution with
only the United States Israel and El
Salvador opposed the following year
again this time the United States could
only rally Israel to the cause so two
votes supposed to observing
international law at that point
Nicaragua couldn't do anything lawful
had tried all the measures then a work
and our world that is ruled by force
this case I'm say is uncontroversial but
it's by no means the most extreme it's
also very we gained a lot of inside
into our own culture and society and
what's happening now by asking how much
we know about all this and how much we
talk about it how much you learn about
in school you know how much it's all
over the front pages and this is only
the beginning the United States
responded to the World Court on the
Security Council by immediately
escalating the war very quickly and that
was bipartisan decision incidentally and
the were the terms of the war were also
changed for the first time there were
official orders given official orders to
the terrorist army to attack what are
called soft targets meaning undefended
civilian targets and to keep away from
Nicaragua no army they were able to do
that because the United States had total
control of the air over Nicaragua and
was able to the mercenary army was
supplied with advanced communication
equipment it wasn't a guerrilla army in
the normal sense and could get
instructions about the disposition of
Nicaraguan army forces so they could
attack agricultural collectives health
clinics and so on soft targets with
impunity those were the official orders
what was the reaction it was known and
there was a reaction to it the policy
was regarded as sensible by left liberal
opinion so Michael Kinsley who's
represents the left in mainstream
discussion wrote an article in which he
said that we shouldn't be too quick to
criticize this policy as Human Rights
Watch had just done he said a sensible
policy must meet the cost of the test of
cost-benefit analysis that is and I'm
quoting now an analysis of the amount of
blood and misery that will be poured in
and the likelihood that democracy will
emerge at the other end democracy as the
u.s. understands the term which is
graphically illustrated in the
surrounding countries notice that it's
axiomatic that the United States US
elites have the right to conduct the
analysis and to pursue the project if it
passes
tests and it did pass their tests it
worked when Nicaragua finally succumbed
to superpower assault commentators
openly and cheerfully lauded the success
of the methods that were adopted and
described them accurately so quote Time
magazine just to pick one lauded the
success of the methods adopted direct
the economy and prosecute a long and
deadly proxy war until the exhausted
natives overthrow the unwanted
government themselves with a cost to us
that is minimal and leaving the victims
with wrecked bridges sabotage power
stations and ruined farms and thus
providing the u.s. candidate with a
winning issue ending the impoverishment
of the people of Nicaragua the New York
Times had a headline saying Americans
United enjoy at this outcome that's the
culture in which we live and it reveals
several facts one is the fact that
terrorism works it doesn't fail it works
violence usually works that's world
history secondly it's a very serious
analytic error to say as is commonly
done that terrorism is a weapon of the
weak like other means of violence is
primarily a weapon of the strong and
overwhelmingly in fact it is held to be
a weapon of the weak because the strong
also control the doctrinal systems and
their terror doesn't count as terror
that's close to universal I can't think
of an exception historical exception
even the worst mass murderers viewed the
world that way so take the Nazis they
weren't carrying out terror and occupied
Europe they were protecting the
population from the terrorism of the
partisans and like other resistance
movements there was terrorism the Nazis
were carrying out counter terror
furthermore the United States
essentially agreed with that after the
war the US Army took
it didn't extensive studies of Nazi
counter-terror operations in Europe and
first I should say that the u.s. picked
them up and began carrying them out
itself against often against the same
targets the former resistance but the
army the military also studied the Nazi
methods published interesting studies
sometimes critical of them because they
were inefficiently carried out so the
critical analysis you know into this
right into that right but those methods
with the advice of their mouth officers
who were brought over here became the
manuals of counterinsurgency of
counter-terror of low-intensity conflict
as it's called and are the manuals and
are the procedures that are being used
so it's not just that the Nazis did it
it said it was regarded as the right
thing to do by the leaders of Western
civilization that is us who then
proceeded to do it themselves terrorism
is not the weapon of the week it is the
weapon of those who are against us
whoever us happens to be and if you can
find a historical exception to that I'd
be interested in seeing it well an
interesting indication of the nature of
Agriculture our high culture is the way
in which all of this is regarded one way
it's regarded as just suppressing it so
almost nobody's ever heard of it the and
the power of American propaganda and
doctrine is so strong that even among
the victims it's barely known I mean
when you talk to this about this did you
know people in Argentina you have to
remind them before they say oh yeah that
happened we forgot about it it's deeply
suppress the power
the pout the sheer consequences of
monopoly of violence can be very
powerful in ideological and other terms
well one illuminating aspect of our own
attitude toward terrorism ours is the
reaction to the idea that Nicaragua
might have the right to defend itself
actually I went through this in some
detail with database searches and that
sort of thing the idea that Nicaragua
might have the right to defend itself
was considered outrageous there is
virtually nothing in common too
mainstream commentary indicating the
Nicaragua might have that right and that
fact was exploited by the Reagan
administration and its propaganda in an
interesting way those of you who are
around at that time will remember that
they periodically floated rumors that
the Nicaraguans were getting meek jets
jets from Russia at that point the hawks
and the doves split the hawk said okay
let's mama the Doug dove said wait a
minute let's see if the rumors are true
and if the rumors are true then let's
bomb them because they're a threat to
the United States why incidentally were
they getting MiG's well because the
United State they try to get jet planes
from European countries but the United
States put pressure on its allies so
they wouldn't send them means of Defense
because they wanted the them to turn to
the Russians that's good for propaganda
purposes then they become a threat to us
and you remember they were just to my 22
days march from Harlingen Texas we
actually declared a national emergency
in 1985 to protect the country from the
threat of Nicaragua the and it stayed in
force but so it was much better from the
get arms from the Russians well the why
would they want jet planes well for the
reasons that I already mentioned the
United States had total control of their
airspace was over flying it and using
that to provide instructions to the
terrorist army to enable them to attack
soft targets with
running into the army that might defend
them so therefore but when and everyone
knew that that was the reason you know
then not going to use their jet planes
for anything else but the idea that
Nicaragua should be permitted to defend
its airspace against a superpower attack
that is directing terrorist forces to
attack undefended civilian targets that
was considered in the United States
outrageous and uniformly so exceptions
are so slight you know I practically
list them I don't suggest that you take
my word for this have a look includes
their own senators incidentally and the
another illustration of how we regard
terrorism is happening right now there's
a the US has just appointed an
ambassador to the United Nations to lead
the war against terrorism a couple of
weeks ago who is he well his name's John
Negroponte II he was the US ambassador
in the fiefdom which is what it is of
honduras in the early 1980s there was a
little fuss made about the fact that he
must have been aware as he certainly was
of the large-scale murders and other
atrocities that were carrying being
carried out by the security forces and
honduras that we were supporting but
that's a small part of it in as
proconsul of honduras as he was called
there he was super he was the local
supervisor for the terrorist war based
in Honduras for which his government was
condemned by the World Court and then
the Security Council in a vetoed
resolution and he was just appointed as
the UN Ambassador to lead the war
against terror another small experiment
you can do is check and see what the
reaction was to this will tell you what
you're going to find but find it for
yourself that tells us a lot about the
war against terrorism and about
ourselves after the United States took
over the country again under the
conditions that were so graphic
