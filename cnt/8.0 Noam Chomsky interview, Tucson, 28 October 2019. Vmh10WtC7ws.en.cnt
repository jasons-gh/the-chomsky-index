the present interview with Professor
Noam Chomsky was recorded in his office
at the University of Arizona in Tucson
on 28 October 2019 the interviewer is
Thomas bogie professor Chomsky you have
spent over seventy years analyzing
politics and seeking to change it
looking back on this time what do you
see as some of your most significant
successes and failures well I suppose
one success that I never anticipated was
in connection with the worst slaughter
relative to population since World War
two
the Indonesian invasion of East team
were strongly supported by the United
States over Western powers it could have
been stopped at any moment it looked
like a totally hopeless effort went on
there were a small number of mostly
young people organizing finally after 25
years it was possible to put enough
pressure on the United States sit for
the President to do what he could have
done for 25 years and just hold off
until almost a third of the population
had been wiped out it's one of the most
unequal conflicts that I can imagine a
tiny country of 600,000 people fighting
off major power Indonesia backed by the
United States and European powers
finally succeed
that was an unexpected success failures
there's too many to mention
in fact almost everyone failed in some
respect I so for example I spent a huge
amount of time and effort opposing the
u.s. words in the end of China was
involved in resistance his long jail
sentence finally after many years there
was a kind of a settlement but not until
the countries were practically ruined
they never recovered so it's very
partial success and substantial failure
there are others which could have had
success but it has almost completely
failed like trying to preserve some
rights for the palestinian population
it's really occupation that's and it's
one that shouldn't be hard to resolve
known for many years but the resolution
should be there's just no way of
compelling the United States to take the
steps that are required living over the
years
domestically there has been quite a lot
of progress I mean the civil rights
movement had some successes they were
limited but significant the feminist
movement which I wasn't particularly
involved in has had substantial success
the environmental movements have gone
from non-existent to being considerable
significance the movements in other
cases it's kind of a partial success so
I was very much involved in the
opposition to the
- brigands terrorist wars in Central
America the opposition was not only
strong but unique in history this is the
first time in the history of imperialism
that citizens of the Imperial power not
only protested which is river enough but
actually went to live with the victims
to try to help them to try to provide
what protection of white face might give
in the face of the state there are
thousands of people from Middle America
event Jellicle Church is very much
involved in that so was it I mean hard
to know whether it's a success or
failure couple hundred thousand people
were killed countries erect correctly
barely viable today but it wasn't like
Vietnam the government was prevented
from doing the kinds of things that John
F Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson did was no
protest chemical warfare just got to
destroy crops and livestock vast ethnic
cleansing driving people into
concentration camps but b-52 bombing of
heavily populated areas that wasn't
would have been I think it hasn't been I
think you can't even say the same about
the war in Iraq a war in Iraq would kind
of been much involved in was the first
time in the history of imperialism that
a major war of aggression was massively
protested even before it was officially
launched took place anyway enough
many consequences including Isis and
others but again the Bush administration
and successors could never dream of
doing what the English government did
with complete impunity in Indochina for
many years so but did you say there's
some I can't point to something that's a
total success by any means they're
partial successes failures to achieve
now I want to get a little more deeply
into what one can learn from the
successes and the failures so in the
last seventy years we have certainly
seen some improvement as you pointed out
we have also appalling conditions in
many other respects including a lot of
poverty a lot of ecological destruction
of our planet violent conflicts
engendering millions of refugees threats
of weapons of mass destruction other
dangerous technologies in the context of
a fiercely adversarial state system and
of course mounting inequality with
adverse effects on democracy there is
widespread political and corporate
corruption facilitated by a mighty
network of tax havens shark companies
sleazy lawyers accountants bankers and
financial advisors and in the face of
these large problems and others we have
of course practical reason to be
optimistic and to tell ourselves and
each other that a better world is
possible if only we work hard enough to
promote it but if you look at the human
world soberly from the standpoint of a
seasoned analysts of human affairs
how much trance do you see of a bright
future for Humanity how likely is it
that humanity will ever realize the kind
of decent global political order that we
seek and that we believe to be possible
well actually there's a prior question
that has to be asked how much chance is
there for a future for Humanity bright
or dark it's the first time in we have
to face the fact that for the first time
in human history decisions that will be
made within the next few years will in
fact determine whether an organized
human society can survive in anything
like any form that we environmental
crisis is extremely severe just happened
to read an article a couple of weeks ago
by one of the leaders of the IPCC report
and The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists
major along these issues which starts by
saying let's not mince words it's time
to panic now we don't have any time to
waste we have a few years in which we
can try to deal with these issues after
that it's finished if you take a look at
the other major threat which has been
hanging over our heads for 75 years
since August 6 1945 a day I'll never
forget if you look at the record just a
miracle that we survived
unfortunately the record is not very
much done thank you William Perry former
Secretary of Defense recently said that
he's terrified doubly terrified first by
the enormity of the threat that's
developing secondly by the fact that
there's an almost no attention being
paid to get a third reason to be
terrified namely that people who
understand very well what they're doing
are consciously escalating through to
the point of major disaster
just take what happened a couple of
weeks ago the Trump administration
celebrated Hiroshima day by pulling out
of the INF treaty Gorbachev Reagan
treaty which did preserve a modicum of
peace and stability for 20 years
short-range missiles in Europe could
easily explode massive nuclear war
terrible award they were under pretty
the Reagan administration was under
pressure this was back to the early
question from very substantial popular
mobilization that I did isn't it should
lead the basis for making movies towards
disarmament Trump administration this
man dismantled it and almost pleaded
with the Russians to respond by doing
the same
immediately after leave pulling out of
the agreement the Pentagon tested a
missile obviously wanted preparation
which explicitly violated the Accord
saying okay please come along and do it
the military production companies and
corporations of interests excited huge
funding for developing new exotic of
weaponry hypersonic missiles no way of
defending against resulting therein
thinking beyond to the further contracts
that they're gonna get to try to find
ways to try to prevent the destruction
from the systems that are now developing
and we could be certain that the
Russians will be doing the same probably
others that lowers the threshold for
terminal destruction quite significantly
so we have three reasons to be terrified
expanding on Perry one the growing
nature of the threat to the almost total
lack of attention to
three the conscious very conscious
escalation of the threat by people that
know precisely what they're doing and
the same is true of environmental
catastrophe I think the threat is very
real
there's degree of protest developing
finally mostly from young people but to
people who understand precisely what
they're doing are racing to escalate the
threat famous example is Exxon Mobil
it's well researched it's scientists
were in the lead in the 60s 70s in
studying global warming and its
catastrophic effects producing the most
advanced papers in the subject obviously
went to management and finally in the
late 80s when the issue began to reach
the public audience mainly with James
Hansen famous speech in 1988 the
management did react namely by pouring
money into denial is not specific to
nihilism but they didn't want to say
things that could be immediately refuted
but the more clever strategy of just
sowing doubt how do we know studied
cloud cover we can appeal to economists
who tell us that there are many
including any record in the world
tell us makes more sense to just that
the economy's growth sooner than Richard
societies will be able to take care of
it which is kind of analogous to a man
falling off a skyscraper waves to a
friend on the 50th floor is going great
it's always worked in the past let's
keep that's the nomination the
the government particularly the United
States government under krump the
arch-criminal of human history literally
even Hitler didn't dedicate himself to
destroy organized human life of work but
it's exactly what they're doing and they
know it so for example one of the most
astonishing documents official documents
probably in human history came out about
a year ago from one of the Trump
bureaucracies the National
Transportation Administration 500-page
environmental assessment predicted that
by the end of the century the
temperature would have risen four
degrees centigrade that's what the World
Bank describes as cataclysmic what
scientific community citizens about
twice as high as any hope for organized
human life and after reaching this
conclusion they threw a decision we
should do nothing to cut back on
automotive emissions
okay the argument is quite sound it's
all over anyway so let's have fun and
make profit from the few years can you
think of anything like that in human
history
anything remotely like but here we come
to the triple terrified again what they
describe is terrifying
the response was practically zero a few
articles in the press and forget about
it
and those who know what they're doing or
racing ahead to achieve that end we sir
take say the big banks JP Morgan Chase
biggest bank its CEO Jamie Dimon knows
everything that we do about educating
the person
how is he reacting pouring money into
develop anding
expanding the fossil fuel extraction
including the most dangerous fossil
fuels like Canadian tar sands knowing
exactly what the consequences are I
wouldn't be surprised if it in his
private life he's supporting the Sierra
Club but in an institutional role let's
race towards disaster because we make
profit that way
Exxon Mobil is actually it's announced
that its business program is to maximize
fossil fuels not waste any money on
sustainable energy even though it's
profitable without a problem and they
were bracing well that's one part of the
world we face the other part of the
world is groups like extinction
rebellion Sun Rise movement which made
an actual spectacular achievement a
small group of young people protesting
and also acting to try to achieve some
gains in climate change they said in a
congressional offices received some
support from some of the young women who
recently came into office on kind of on
the swelling wave of the Sanders
movement Alexandria Kasich of Cortes
mainly and they succeeded in putting a
green new deal on the legislative agenda
some form of green new deal is just a
prerequisite for survival two years ago
if they heard of it just left now that's
on the legislative agenda there are
plans to maybe not mat form some floor
so there are genes and there are these
two contending courses one of them they
look very unequal I like East Timor one
is young people that want to survive the
other is
the major institutions of the society
which want to put more dollars into
their overstuffed pockets whether we
survive or not that's fundamentally the
conflict very unequal but it's kind the
same is true on the way even more
exaggerated on the nuclear weapons issue
because the popular movements are so
meager at this point they were huge in
the early eighties dwindled since
there's a little knowledge about them
and not many people know anything about
the guy and after a year what it means
the u.s. if you look back the u.s.
claimed that it was pulling out of the
treaty because the Russians had violated
the Russia that's reported all over the
place not reported is the fact the
Russians have claimed for years that the
United States is violating their claims
are taken seriously by American
specialists so again the bulletin of
Atomic Scientists recently had a lead
article by one of the leading American
specialists on these issues which ran
through the Russian claims and argued
they're pretty credible the ABM
installations right on the Russian
border which are already a threat they
were placed there on the ludicrous claim
that it's got to defend Europe from the
rannian non-existent missile can't even
laugh but there it's very well
understood not all size that a B ends
are not a defensive weapon or a
first-strike weapon it's inconceivable
that they could affect a first strike
but conceivably they might limit a
retaliatory strike
so essentially their first strike weapon
sitting right on the Persian quarter
turns out to be
according to post analysis that the
technology in them as basically dual use
could easily be modified for offensive
weapons and in fact that's kind of
verified by the reason
missile test turns out the technology
that used the recent one in August
violating the INF treaty does in fact
use much of the same technologies in the
ABM systems so here we have two great
powers at each of which is arguing that
the other has violated a crucial treaty
in a sane world it's obvious what would
happen they would move towards
negotiations they get out so I did
dependent experts try to see what the
facts aren't resolved it's not our world
in an insane world desires what they do
is let's break the treaty and try to
create more destructive weapons anybody
paying attention that's our world and
unfortunately we're back to the second
and the third reason to be terrible
little attention and the people involved
are racing ahead consciously including
the ones who were pretty much respected
like Jim Mathers resigned from the Trump
administration because couldn't stand
the policies any longer than is regarded
almost with the reverence as the one
serious adult in the room he was the one
who was behind the new national security
strategy which is virtually insane I'm
at the goal of the national security
strategies to place the United States at
a position where it can win two nuclear
wars simultaneously against China and
Russia that's beyond insanity if you had
even the beginning of one nuclear war
everybody'd be dead just for the effects
of nuclear winter was carried out for
destroyed so we're working we're
devoting ourselves to finding a way to
destroy the world 50 times over
I mean it's hard to know what to say
about this and he's respected well
that's the problem on the institutional
level on the human level popular though
we do have popular movements push the
gun thing not so much on the nuclear
issue and when you turn to the problems
of it's kind of interesting that the you
know as you know the bulletin of Atomic
Scientists has a Doomsday Clock they
said every year last year for me they
said it is as close as it's ever been to
midnight two minutes to midnight which
they called the new abnormal and they
added to the reasons they've used in the
past in the past it was of course the
nuclear threat recent years the
environmental threat that this time they
had agathor agrees that basically the
deterioration of destruction of
democratic forms sounds a little
different but it make sense that's the
only possibility for dealing with the
first two issues and if they decline and
deteriorate what they talk about
particularly it was the collapse of
information systems with the flooding of
so-called information systems but
purposely false news in perfect
totalitarian technique flood the
information system with so many lies
that people don't even know if there's a
difference between true and false you
eliminate the possibility of having a
rational deliberative popular decisions
that might confront the problems that we
face and this makes good sense it's
accessible tactic on the part of those
who want to maximize profit and power
don't care what happens in the future
and are perfectly happy to destroy
democratic forms actually that's pretty
much implicit in the neoliberal policies
in student generation ago
reagan-thatcher
pretty much everyone seems to take a
genius to have forecast exactly what
happened they would lead to high
concentration of will our concentration
the United States now 0.1% of the
population have over twenty percent of
the world half the population of
negative Network is that's an immediate
consequence of these policies extreme in
the United States for all sorts of
reasons but happening everywhere
stagnation for a majority a decline of
democracy is almost immediate corollary
from the concentration of wealth to Rea
overwhelmingly influences policy and
more so with concentration decline of
benefits leaving people naturally angry
resentful full of contempt for
institutions see this in every election
with centrist parties collapse and
that's very fertile territory for
demagogues who can try to mobilize
populations who are angry and resentful
to try to focus their attention and not
on these sources of the problem but that
said I put on scapegoats people even
more vulnerable than they are immigrants
blacks so on that's a very dangerous mix
it's a kind of mix that led to the cars
fascism I should say that you said here
I spent what 70 years on this actually
eight years in the first vertical erode
1939 was on the spread of fashion which
looked inexorable the time
it's a very deep inside ten-year-old
picture of it that was pretty obvious
what was happening it looked hopeless
this was right right after the fall of
Barcelona which ended the Spanish
Republic Austria had been take it over
and we're sort of back to that some bit
please you know Trump is not Hitler by a
longshot
doesn't have the ideology or the gold
but listening to his public rallies does
bring back memories from childhood
listening to Hitler's over the radio not
understanding the word passion if it was
frightened you see it again
I think we're moving into in that area
too
with political and economic closely
related moving into very dangerous
territory fortunately again there is
opposition in the United States
Bernie Sanders and the movement
organized as had big effect a large part
of the population now really wants to
move at least to traditional social
democratic New Deal style policies which
would be a big change much improvement
that undermine much of what's happening
in the same is true in Europe it's gonna
be a long battle on almost every front
of this kind of confrontation it's not
for the first time this is basically
glass war which goes for back in history
any other mixtures but it's taken on at
this moment a particularly threatening
character because of the enormity of the
problem
and you can't overestimate that it's
literally the case that this generation
is going to have to determine whether
organized human society versus it's
nothing short of that are we going to be
able to stop it well let's just go back
to my 10 year old prediction to me at
that point it looked unstoppable I
didn't know it at the time of course but
the US government felt pretty much the
same we didn't know then we know now
that in 1939 the State Department and
the Council on Foreign Relations made
extra governmental would mainly
corporate Association dealing with
foreign affairs the two of them had set
up a study group to try to deal with
what would be the post-war world war
Peace Studies food was cold and very
detailed studies 1939 they assumed that
they did assume that the United States
would end the war very powerful
victorious that wasn't a question
but they assumed that there would be
another great power the Germans that the
world would be divided between a
us-run region and a German run region
pretty much what I guess there's a young
kid and that was in fact there the u.s.
area which they called the ground area
would include of course the Western
Hemisphere former British Empire which
the US would take over living the Middle
East of course and Asia Asia the Germans
would run the rest of the Eurasian and
that lasted pretty much until first
Stalin broadened and the tremendous tank
by the Lakers which
in 43 which made it pretty clear that
the Russians would defeat the Germans
with the Americans little british
hovering around we just pretty much what
happened at that point they switched and
still gonna be two worlds with a
different enemy and in fact the british
particularly churchill himself were
already thinking about how we could
organize a war against russia that
Churchill had an incredible plan which
came from the British military staff to
try to save the bear market and a German
industry for a immediate war against
Russia soon as the war was over that was
knocked down but that's the kind of
thinking that was going on so and in
fact many of the programs of the war
peace stage later formulated in the
State Department policy planning Bureau
and pretty much implemented remaining
that leads us right into the post-war
world and it goes on like that so as the
Soviet Union collapsed there were
illusions that ok now I'll have a period
of peace peace dividend on budget on
combat and so on if anybody had bothered
to look at the public documentary record
they would have never thought that for a
minute as soon as the Soviet Union
collapsed the Bush administration was
the first Bush released first of all the
new defense budget also a plan added a
security planning document and these
made very interesting reading nobody
looked at the development they said
basically we have to keep up the
military budget
as pretty much as before no brochures
but and the reason is because I'm I'm
not making this up because of the
technological sophistication of
third-world powers
that's why we have to have this immense
machine which can blow up the world in
five minutes
did anybody laughs them and said we have
to we're going to be fighting wars but
these are going to be Moors against much
weaker enemies now we have to defeat
them quickly and decisively or it'll be
have a negative they talked about the
Middle East where us main place where
you isn't there and intervention forces
are focused under the quarter before and
they said we have to maintain
intervention forces aimed at the Middle
East and then came this interesting
phrase where the threats to our
interests could not be laid at the
Kremlin store in other words sorry folks
we've been lying to you for 50 years
that it wasn't the Russians at all it
was they called radical nationalists
independent nationalism that doesn't
conform to our goals so that's why we
have to keep these intervention forces
for this which of course was always true
but at every single action for the
preceding
60 years had been the Russians are
coming
so okay you made a mistake can't be late
at the chrome store now that there's no
Kremlin but we have to keep doing
exactly what we're doing and it happens
exactly like that a couple of weeks
after the fall of the Berlin Wall the
u.s. invaded Panama pretty standard
imperial intervention killed thousands
of people most important people the goal
was to kidnap a guy who was indeed a
thug but I thought the u.s. introduced
Noriega he was introduced and supported
by the United States as ported in
through fake elections he made a mistake
he started disobeying orders okay don't
take that kind of thing this is the
Massey after all I start disobeying
orders cut off his head so invaded
Panama mash to kidnap and take him back
to the trial did anybody write you a
couple of months later I said I'm
Hussein invaded Kuwait he actually had a
reason claimed that the wait was
stealing Iraqi oil Iraq had defended the
Arab world against Iran in this long
battle now they were robbing the record
not a justification for the baby
but much more serious argument his
invasion did kill people according to
Human Rights Watch about 800 people
considerably less the u.s. saw an
opportunity now we can really show our
force within weeks of the invasion
Frizzles a lot of fakery about invading
Saudi Arabia you know fabrication but
within weeks of the invasion was clear
that Saddam under sitting made a mistake
started making offers to negotiate and
we throw under some conditions all of
this was known actually there were leaks
from the State Department reporting
press wouldn't retching tell you
personal anecdote I didn't print at that
time I was pretty close to the editors
of Boston Globe paper in the country at
the time it's
I asked them could I publish an op-ed
about the State Department leaks which
indicate that there could be a
negotiated settlement quite friendly at
the time they said yeah you can do it
but you have to adapt in the u.s. videos
so in fact they did publish the article
the right after the invasion these are
the kind of this is right after the fall
of the Soviet Union nothing changed in
fact it's even more extreme a couple of
days after the fall of the Berlin Wall
in El Salvador a an eight lead a
battalion Kabul battalion which had been
responsible for massive atrocities
trained armed by the United States just
came from renewed training by US Special
Forces broke into the Jesuit University
murdered six leading the Latin American
intellectuals as in priests their
housekeeper until order to make sure
that no witnesses turns out this was
Annika on the orders of the Salvadoran
government the government that we
supported which the US Embassy was in
close contact can anybody remember their
names I mean if this had happened in
Eastern Europe the massive protests but
when we murder six leading Latin
American intellectuals kids and priests
who knows this was a couple days they
have to perform the religion nothing no
and it's not an isolated incident this
kind of closed off the decade of the 80s
which opened was the murder of an
archbishop leading man
same hands basically us sporting it all
the way anybody know
I mean much lesser incidence in Eastern
Europe were just the front page had
blaring headlines so if it happens among
enemies you know multiplying if we do it
you can give case after case take
Trump's recent betrayal the current
betrayal of the Kurds is practically a
qualification for all of us in the
United States every president one after
another take
Ronald Reagan when his friend Saddam
Hussein who the US was supporting and
carried out chemical warfare attacks
against Iraq occurred I love Joe
massacre and others human atrocities how
did government react well Congress tried
to protest every envita Reagan and his
administration tried to blame it on Iran
I protected from Saddam Hussein later
when they wanted to invade Iraq they
brought that up as a reason why we have
to innovate Iraq you know I mean this
goes on without change it's it's just
almost fixed understand it in 1939 but
basically that's what we've been seeing
since there are blips I think when the
Soviet Union collapsed there's slight
changes in strategy but fundamentally
nothing dude well on the other hand
that's one side on the other the
anti-war movement in Indochina took many
many years to develop waited far too
long but it finally did grow to the
point where it's limited probably
terminated
Everage escalate the war but now the the
time that we had left is very limited
from what we had said earlier we have
little time and now we have almost no
time yeah and so ours or I mean the
destruction of Indochina was bad enough
but now we're talking about the survival
of human society that's in our hands
right now and it's utterly scandalous
that the lead is struggling against this
his teenage Kings where's the rest of us
December marvelous person but why a 16
when she testifies UN everyone nice so
again the question how optimistic are
you that humanity can actually overcome
these problems or will overcome these
problems yeah it's really another not
the right question I mean you have two
choices you can decide it's all hopeless
give up and make sure that the worst
will happen or you can try to grasp what
opportunities there are and they do
exist and dedicate yourself to that
maybe like a better world
there's the good so then I come to the
next one learning from the last 50 years
of progressive politics what advice
would you give to the next generation
how can they be more successful than
your generation has been should they aim
to build a more focused movement that
attacks the great political evils in a
certain plausible order if so what is
the essential problem on which
progressive political energies should
now be focused I think
there are dangers there's always the
tendency towards adventurism not
thinking through the consequences of
what you're doing but doing it because
you think that the problems are so
terrible we just have to act out so for
example that takes a the Weathermen the
young kids nice kids I know a lot of
them horrified about the war feeling
this is so awful we've just got a march
down Main Street brick windows and tag
banks and so on the Vietnamese were
horrified
remember meetings with Vietnamese saying
you've got to talk them out of doing
this what they wanted was mild protests
so mild that the peace movement laughed
at them because the Vietnamese didn't
care how Americans felt they wanted to
survive and they understood that if you
carry out whether men style activities
you're just increasing support for the
war so maybe you'll feel good but we
won't we'll be killed that happens all
the time and those are through it's very
easy particularly among young people
really upset to do something you have to
think through carefully through the
consequences of the tactics you adopt
the choosing tactics is not a trivial
matter that's what human consequences
depend on your choice of tactics and you
can find case after case right now where
that's not considering thoughtfully and
properly second thing to watch out for
is infiltration so in the anti-war
movement in the 60s we learned very
quickly that almost every group was
infiltrated by government agents and
they weren't very hard to pick out so if
somebody was dressed
the Hollywood version of what a hippie
looks like am I saying it lets off the
cops
you could be pretty sure that he'd show
up at a trial testifying for the
government but nevertheless you had to
be careful about and in fact when we
were doing anything sensitive with human
lives at stately helping deserves out of
the country or something we always
didn't know that any groups groups of
people just knew each other and because
there was no way of being sure who the
infiltrators are they're gonna be there
I'm sure they're there now when people
the protests are you know not getting
violent I immediately get suspicious
this is always in the past in an effort
by official sources to try to raise the
level of violence and discredit the
popular movements and build up
opposition to them and shift debate and
discussion to the arena of violence
which is where the powerful win so those
are things to watch out for another
thing is the I mean what's called
identity politics makes perfect sense
there are serious issues but they have
to be integrated with others people who
are dedicated to one particular concern
say police brutality and black kids have
to be able to work with others who have
other concerns what's sometimes called
intersectionality and work for common
causes and maybe compromising your own
and the interests of others when it's
necessary to lose that but these are all
kind of pitched for the kinds of
pitfalls that occur and all sorts of
active
but they can be overcome and the main
the main it's also another head fall is
what the government is hold and the
establishment of all together is always
trying to get you to do reduce your
political activism to pushing a button
every four years and then go home take a
look at the media coverage the liberal
media coverage of Bernie Sanders it's
pretty striking they hate it and so for
example the New York Times recently a
couple days ago had a article on the
Democratic establishment and how they're
not sure that their candidates are
really the right ones
maybe they should bring in Hillary
Clinton or somebody else and they go
through the top democratic candidates
Joe Biden Elizabeth Warren Pete loogie
somebody missing yeah he's a nassima and
it's not because of his policies because
he made a real error he organized the
popular movement a popular movement that
doesn't just focus on every four years
but is acting constantly like the ones
who broke into the congressional offices
and magic at the you the renewed deal on
the agenda that's not what people are
for this goes way back in history
framing in the Constitution the British
Civil War British Glorious Revolution in
17th century the rebels they recalled
have their place
there are spectators not participants
that's in fact liberal democratic theory
founders of political science and so on
you know your place it's not your
business to run things that's for us
and breaking that is a very important
thing
if popular movements are going to be
effective they're going to be constant
now you know there's nothing wrong with
participating in electoral politics but
that's pretty marginal part of it it's
the other things you do that matter and
that's another it's full wearing them on
the other hand the advice is just
obvious there are a substantial issues
that just have to be in the forefront
if they're not settled nothing else is
going out so unless we end the threat of
nuclear war and mitigator hopefully end
the threat of environmental catastrophe
it's not going to matter what else
happened a couple of decades so those
have to be friends and then everything
else as the Doomsday Clock you said the
Doomsday Clock pointed out the
deterioration of democratic structures
and the collapse of information systems
is a major problem that's a powerful
totalitarian device which is going to
block effective action to deal with the
major issues so that has to be overcome
the problem of the massive inequality in
Europe where it's really extreme where
the policy choices have almost been
taken out of the hands of populations
it's all in the hands of an unelected
bureaucracy in Brussels that's part of
the European Union structure at this
point no wonder people are angry and I'm
said this is everything's taken out of
their hands anyway along with the highly
destructive austerity programs which had
no serious economic basis and they're
just devastating society and still reach
societies
lots of protection from their
traditional social structure but it's a
battering away out the United States
it's worse because the structure is much
weaker but all these things have to be
addressed at the same time as you know
problems of sexism misogyny
anti-immigrant history of children and
concentration camps along the border not
very far from us and all these things
and they all have to integrate they all
interact with one another where you put
your energy depends on your personal
tastes concerned what strikes you what
you think you're good at it has to be
done with an eye to the validity of
parallel concerns on the side between
hope to interact with it's not an easy
task and it's again scandalous burdens
placed on teenage kids so impact it's
obviously one very important
consideration impact Beck and I have the
most impact on history and but there are
other considerations as well sort of the
ends don't always justify the means you
might say and you have spent a
considerable amount of time as a kind of
witness to history collecting
information and evidence showing what
actually happened setting the record
straight even when the victims in the
particular case that you were focusing
on could no longer really benefit from
that so how do you trade off these
concerns what do you think are the
standards by which she have oriented
your political life and there are some
standards which are virtual truisms like
the major a substantial concerns always
have to be in the forefront but wouldn't
for a particular individual what he or
she does depends on
individual characteristics what issue
strikes you as the kind of thing you can
do something about maybe it's fixing
things in the local community where you
live okay and do that there's no general
principle we can't be the laces I mean
for you personally
how have you resolved these things it's
very hard to say like why say pick out
East Timor and you know what because I
didn't even I barely knew there was
nothing but there were two or three
young people as usual have to be
graduate students and an East Asian
Studies program the best one Cornell
students of George came he was gone
learned about the East Timor situation
were both armed Colin was the main one
should get ten Nobel prizes if they met
anything and began to try to organize
support for contacted me meetings
he's almost unknown but he's personally
as most of the responsibility for the
fact that it finally ended he purposely
kept quiet my first one of these things
no matter what it is they're so dramatic
as I've done to a poor village in
southern Colombia you know hours away
from the pan-american highway so I get
the River acid small cemetery with some
wooden crosses were people in the
village were wiped out by
respect paramilitaries and get into the
village he talked to the people and
after that you just people who were
trying to protect the mountain near
their village from being taken over by
Canadian mining corporations which will
wipe out their agriculture their water
supply and so on I just spend a couple
hours like that and you're just immersed
in that problem and the same is true
almost every go downtown and I spent
some time with homeless people okay
anywhere you look there's problems so
gripping dramatic that you just can't
help it's just a choice you can't you
know one thing that you already
mentioned is this inexorable rise in
inequality wealth inequality you
mentioned you also mentioned how that
corrodes democracy and any kind of
political equality is there any way that
or how could that possibly be rolled
back how can we get to a world which
blood it was they're not first very
mysterious so for example a wealth tax
not in the way it was done in Europe
which didn't work there were too many
invasions but it can be done without all
of the invasives and structure then I
think it's a very concrete plans for
them now would make a do quit if we pass
politically footage get through that
confidence on the strength of popular
movement anything could be best if you
have enough popular support for well if
you're banging on the doors of the
members of Congress no matter how much
they're being paid off that they have to
be elected okay so that's
that can be best and won't be easy
financial transaction tax would make a
lot of sense bring in plenty of money it
would cut back the operations of the
financial institutions which are simply
destructed and predatory like whether
you can make a trade you know a
microsecond before the guy across the
street
anything they taxable or something where
public opinion has been very strong for
years for about forty years I guess
polls have been taken on the United
States on taxes basically two questions
asked do you think your taxes are too
high
yes do you think taxes on the rich or
because low everybody says yes take a
look at this couple of papers on this
and political science literature you
take a look at the media reports they
already caught the first my taxes are
too low I think that's a very
interesting result that's kind of a
measure of whether democracies function
if you had a functioning democracy
people would celebrate the day when they
paid their taxes great this is the day
when we've made decisions about what has
to be done in the society and how much
everyone should contribute now these
decisions are being implement let's
cheer the more taxes are opposed and
fear the more you know democracy isn't
functional slogan there's nothing you
can get away with about except S&T you
can't get away with a dozen taxes that's
telling you we don't
it said it's a very simple measure and
the fact that people think their taxes
are comply is telling you we don't
believe with anything that's being done
with those guys up there are making
decisions we don't have anything to do
they're stealing from us okay we have to
move towards a society where you
celebrate your joint decisions about how
to keep your society is running I'm glad
I went out of my school's right I like
that it's a great given globalization of
course the problem in equality is even
greater because rich people can play off
different countries against each other
and can basically take their money out
get a difference it is enjoyable that
that was the problem with the European
world touch
yeah it was set up in such a way that
somebody in France could pretend to be
in but that's not necessary
you can have the constraints against
them so for example in the u.s. system
theoretically it's not implement a
person is text you as citizens text
marries and you can know somebody could
say okay I'll give up my citizenship but
not money the tax havens are instituted
by policy that's not a law of nature
they take trillions of dollars by some
estimate we need 20 trillion dollars
like Apple computers because
corporations its corporate headquarters
are in Ireland where they probably had
an office about this size it's not
breathing in stone all of these things
you can build but it certainly just
won't be buried just like
talked about before and the exorbitant
protectionist principles that are
written into the World Trade
Organization radically anti free trade
agreements the intellectual property
rights the patent rights way beyond
anything in the past if they had been a
part of the international system 200
years ago the United States would be
exporting a petition for impossible to
develop they shouldn't exist there's a
lot of bipartisan protest here in the
United States against China because it's
not observing intellectual property
rights the population should be cheering
who gains from the fact that there's
exorbitant patents on pharmaceuticals
not people who suffer from said the
pharmaceutical corporations make even
more astronomical profits than they
would if you had reasonable regime all
of these things are under control these
people understand them
in fact the attack on China is extremely
interesting the main theme is China's
taking away our jobs think about it for
a second is the Chinese government
holding a pistol to the head of the
Apple corporation saying you've got an
investment or bullying or an IBM for him
it's the guys who are taking away our
jobs or the bankers and investment
managers in New York and Chicago to run
the corporations so let's go after them
after China all of these things are
elementary you know as soon as you point
them out everybody understands so what
you have to do is just take away this
sin cover of the deceptive profit
and let people look at the world and I
think that they understand very little
of there are many things you can do good
I think we have to come to a close I
want to thank you very very much for
giving us the time and giving us your
responses to these questions and with
luck we can have a little bit of a
discussion on the day of the event
you'll see unfortunately I have to go
finish yeah that's okay thank you
