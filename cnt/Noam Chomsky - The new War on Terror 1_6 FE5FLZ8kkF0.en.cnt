everyone knows it's the TV people who
run the world I just got orders that I'm
supposed to be here not there from well
the last talk I gave it this forum was
on a light pleasant topic it was about
how humans are an endangered species and
they're given the nature of their
institutions they're likely to destroy
themselves in a fairly short time so
this time there's a little relief and we
have a pleasant topic instead the new
war on terror or fortunately the world
keeps coming up with things that make it
more and more horrible as we proceed I'm
going to assume two conditions for this
talk the first one is just what I
assumed to be a recognition of fact that
is that the events of September 11th
were horrendous atrocity probably the
most devastating instant human toll of
any crime and history outside of war the
second is has to do with the goal second
assumption as do with the goal I'm
assuming that our goal is that we are
interested in reducing the likelihood of
such crimes whether they're against us
or against someone else if you don't
accept those two assumptions then what I
say will not be addressed to you if we
do accept them then a number of
questions arise closely related ones
which merit good deal of thought one
question and by far the most important
one is what is happening right
now implicit in that is what we can do
about it second has to do with the very
common assumption that would happened on
September 11th is a historic event one
which will change history I tend to
agree with that I think it's true it was
a historic event and the question we
should be asking is exactly why a third
question has to do with the title the
war against terrorism exactly what is it
and there's a related question namely
what is terrorism fourth question which
is narrower but important has to do with
the origins of the crimes of September
11th and the fifth question that I want
to talk a little about is what policy
options there are in fighting this war
against terrorism and dealing with the
situations that led to it say a few
things about each glad to go beyond in
discussion or don't hesitate to bring up
other questions these are the ones that
come to my mind as prominent but you may
easily and plausibly have other choices
well let's start with right now so the I
will talk about the situation
Afghanistan I'll just keep to
uncontroversial sources like the New
York Times according to new york times
there are seven to eight million people
in afghanistan on the verge of
starvation that was true actually before
September 11th right they were surviving
on international aid on September 16th
The Times reported I'm quoting it that
the United States demanded from Pakistan
the elimination of truck convoys that
provide much of the food and other
supplies to Afghanistan civilian
population as far as I could determine
there was no reaction in the United
States or for that matter in Europe I
was on national radio all over europe
the next
a there was no reaction in the United
States or in Europe to my knowledge to
the demand to impose massive starvation
millions of people the threat of
military strikes right after SAT around
that time forced the removal of
international aid workers that crippled
the assistance programs actually I'm
quoting again from the New York Times
refugees reaching Pakistan after our
edge of his journeys from a guess and
are describing scenes of desperation and
fear at home as the threat of
american-led military attacks turns
their long-running misery into a
potential catastrophe the country was on
a lifeline and we just cut the line
quoting evacuated aid worker in the New
York Times Magazine the World Food
Program the UN program did which is the
main one before they did were able to
resume after a couple three weeks in
early October they began to resume at a
lower level resume food shipments
account they don't have international
aid workers within so the distribution
systems hampered that was suspended as
soon as the bombing began they then
resumed but at a lower pace while aid
agencies level scathing condom nations
of US air drops condemning them as
propaganda tools which are probably
doing more harm than good that happens
to be quoting from the London Financial
Times but it's easy to continue after
the first week of bombing the New York
Times reported in a back page inside a
column on something else that by the
arithmetic of the United Nations there
will soon be 7.5 million afghans in
acute need of even a loaf of bread and
there are only a few weeks left before
the harsh winter will make deliveries to
many areas totally impossible continuing
to quote but with bombs falling the
delivery rate is down to what one half
of what is needed
casual comment which tells us that
Western civilization is anticipating the
slaughter of well do the arithmetic
three to four million people something
like that on the same day the leader of
Western civilization dismissed with
contempt once again offers of
negotiation for delivery of the alleged
target Osama bin Laden and a request for
some evidence to substantiate the demand
for total capitulation was dismissed on
the same day the Special Rapporteur of
the United Nations in charge of food
pleaded with the United States to stop
the bombing to try to save millions of
victims as far as I'm aware that was
unreported it was Monday yesterday the
eight major aid agencies Oxfam and other
Christian Aid and others joined in that
plea and find a report in The New York
Times there was a line and the Boston
Globe hidden in a story about another
topic Kashmir well I could easily go on
but all of that first of all indicates
to us what's happening looks like what's
happening is some kind of silent
genocide it also gives a good deal of
insight into the elite culture the
culture that we're part of it indicates
that whatever what will happen we don't
know but plans are being made and and
programs implemented on the assumption
that they may lead to the death of
several million people in the next in
the next couple of weeks very casually
with no comment no particular thought
about it that's just kind of normal here
and in good part of Europe not in the
rest of the world in fact not even in
much of Europe so if you read the Irish
press or the press in Scotland say that
close reactions are very different
well that's what's happening now up to
what's happening now is very much under
our control we can do a lot to affect
what's happening and that's roughly it
let's turn to the slightly more abstract
questions forgetting for the moment that
we're in the midst of apparently trying
to murder three or four million people
not Taliban of course they're victims
let's go back turn to the question of
the historic event that took place in
September 11th and as I said I think
that's correct it was a historic event
not unfortunately because of its scale
unpleasant to think about but in terms
of the scale it's not that unusual I did
say it's the worst probably the worst
instant human toll of any crime and that
may be true but there are terrorist
crimes with effects a bit more drawn out
that are much more extreme unfortunately
nevertheless it's a historic event
because there was a change the change
was the direction in which the guns were
pointing that's new radically new so it
takes a US history the last time that
the national territory of the United
States was under attack or for that
matter even threatened was when the
British burned down Washington in 1814
there been many comment it was common to
bring up Pearl Harbor but that's not a
good analogy the Japanese whatever you
think about it the Japanese bombed
military bases in to us colonies not the
national territory colonies which had
been taken from their inhabitants and
not a very pretty way this is the
national territory that's been attacked
on a large scale find a few fringe
examples but this is unique during these
close to 200 years we you know the
United States
expelled or mostly exterminated the
indigenous populations many million
people conquered half of Mexico carried
out depredations all over the region
Central America and sometimes beyond
conquered Hawaii and the philippines
killing several hundred thousand
filipinos in the process since the
Second World War its extended its reach
around the world in ways I don't have to
describe but it was always killing
someone else the war the fighting was
somewhere else it was others who are
getting slaughtered not here not the
national territory in the case of Europe
the change is even more dramatic because
its history is even more horrendous than
ours we are an offshoot of Europe
basically for hundreds of years Europe
has been casually slaughtering people
all over the world let's say they
conquered the world not by handing out
candy to babies during this period
Europe did suffer murderous Wars but
that was a European killers murdering
one another the main sport of Europe for
hundreds of years was slaughtering one
another the only reason it came to an
end in 1945 was had nothing to do with
democracy is not making war on each
other and other fashionable notions it
had to do with the fact that everyone
understood that the next time they play
the game it's going to be the end for
the world because the Europeans
including us had developed such massive
weapons of destruction that that game
just has to be over the it goes back
hundreds of years I mean in the 17th
century about you know probably 40
percent of the population of Germany was
wiped out in one war but during this
whole bloody murderers period it was
European slaughtering each other and
European slaughtering people elsewhere
the Congo didn't attack Belgium India
didn't attack England you know Algeria
didn't attack France it's uniform and
the firt there are again small
exceptions but pretty small and ski
LLL certainly invisible on the scale of
what Europe and us we're doing the rest
of the world this is the first change
and the first time that the guns have
been pointed the other way and in my
opinion that's probably why you see such
different reactions on the two sides of
the IRC which I've noticed incidentally
in many interviews on both sides
national radio on both sides the world
looks very different depending whether
you're holding the lash or whether
you're being whipped by it for hundreds
of years very different so I think the
shock and surprise in Europe and it's
offshoots like here is very
understandable it is a historic event
but regrettably not in scale in
something else and a reason why the rest
of the world most of the rest of the
world looks at it quite differently not
that lacking sympathy for the victims
the atrocity are being horrified by them
that's almost uniform but viewing it
from a different perspective something
we might want to understand well let's
go to the third question what is the war
against terrorism and side question
what's terrorism the war against
terrorism has been described in high
places as a struggle against a plague
cancer which is spread by barbarians by
depraved opponents of civilization
itself that's a feeling that I share the
words I'm quoting however happened to be
from 20 years ago those are that's
President Reagan and his secretary of
state
