we could start with the famous Delphic
Oracle know thyself we can ask to what
extent all of us virtually are
susceptible to groupthink so look across
the whole media landscape major media
political landscape let's see if you can
find someone who questions some of the
verities that are taken for granted and
very serious ones I'll just pick two
because they might lead to major
terminal wars one of them is Iran is the
greatest world threat we have to do
something about Iranian nuclear weapons
does the world agree with us on this the
world thinks we're insane you know and
there are very simple ways to deal with
the problem of potential Iranian nuclear
weapons like for example establishing a
nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle
East is that hard to do well the Arab
states are in favor of it
Iran is strongly in favor of it the
non-aligned countries which most of the
world are in favor of Europe's in favor
of it perhaps in one country two
countries that block it
most recently Obama namely the United
States in Israel because if you had a
nuclear-free zone in the Middle East the
United States would have to acknowledge
what it knows but can't say that Israel
has nuclear weapons which automatically
means cutting off all aid to Israel and
inspecting Israeli weapons so for that
reason we have to have a nuclear weapons
threat in Iran does anybody say this
well trickles here and there but let's
take the other major one North Korea
there right now is uniformity across the
press as far as I can see
that Trump walked away from a bad deal
what was the bad deal that North Korea
would partially denuclearize and we
would partially reduce sanctions that
are strangling the country you might ask
the question whether there's any
justification for the sanctions but
we'll put that aside
oh that's uniformly regarded as a bad
deal there's anybody question is it a
bad deal would it be a step towards
moving towards resolving one of the
worst threats that in the world for many
years is it what the Koreans want well I
think they told us what they want to
move step by step towards
denuclearization and integration on
their own accord without interference
that was the declaration in April 2017
important declaration is anybody raising
this question I mean the fact of the
matter is we go case-by-case we all
subject ourselves to groupthink on issue
after issue of extreme importance and I
think there's a kind of a good rule of
thumb that's worth keeping in mind if
anything is accepted almost universally
and the issue is significant and might
have two sides that we should worry
about it we should be recognizing that
we're subordinating ourselves to very
dangerous group thing it's not just the
others it's all of us
