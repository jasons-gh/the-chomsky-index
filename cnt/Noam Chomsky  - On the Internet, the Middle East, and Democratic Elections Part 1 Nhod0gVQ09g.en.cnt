norm Chomsky is here he is a political
activist he's a writer and his professor
at MIT he is written exclusively and
lectured around the world on linguistics
philosophy and politics he is widely
credited with having revolutionized
modern linguistics he is the author of
numerous books including American power
in the new mandarins and also 911 here
is hedge money our survival his newest
book I am pleased to have him on this
program for many reasons including the
fact that I get more emails about please
have mr. Chomsky on this program than
anyone can ever imagine how do you
explain this phenomenal connection
between you and certainly an audience of
people who are user friendly with the
internet it well I think people who are
there's an enormous number of people who
are involved in a informal disorganized
activist dissident culture and they tend
to make their own connections outside
the major institutional channels which
are not not hospitable to them and the
Internet has been has become a major
form of interconnection organizing not
just in the United States everywhere I
mean in South Korea for example they
recently elected a president using the
internet for organizing and
communication and getting around the
strong opposition of the media and the
concentrated power to the popular
candidates we happen to be very wired up
society at Broadway and I think as a
higher penetration is South Korea
perhaps more than any other country
except Singapore but it's happened that
takes a Indonesia when the support the
dictatorship was overthrown in 1998 a
lot of the organizing a lot of it was
student activism and they it was very
harsh brutal society but they did
succeed through internet inter
connections to organized political
actions demonstrations other activities
and it was a major factor leaving the
leading to the overthrow
the dictatorship well Howard Dean I
suspect would say that one of the
primary reasons you've been able to get
to this commanding position in the
Democratic race for the presidency is
the internet lobbying both communicate
and to raise money yeah it's had I'm
it's a sort of a can also be a lethal
instrument but legal in what way well
I'm sure you get I don't don't want to
guess how many emails you get better you
can be yeah it can be overwhelming not a
lot of material exert that one of the
problems with the internet I mean it's
the good part of it is it's free and
open right exactly of course that has a
downside that means that things go up
that have no review and there are you
know supporting the clock in a clock
this is they clog the system and so it's
a mixture but it's it certainly has been
an extremely effective way of allowing
people to participate actively in in
even in everything from industrial
societies very repressive society so
take say the world Social Forum which is
a huge enterprise 100,000 people last
year it's mostly internet organized
there's just no other meanings of inter
communication among highly diverse
people most of them somewhat you know
out of the power centers in their own
societies and this provides them the
means of organizing exchanging
information interaction that gives an
access to a far wider range of sources
of information and analysis than they
would get by picking up the newspapers
at the newsstand and major faiths do you
think regimes around there were a lot to
be frightened of the possibilities of
the Internet I'm sure they are including
our own government since the the
internet was like most modern technology
came out of the state system right they
have a very a lot of the economy relies
on a dynamic state sector the internet
was developed in the Pentagon or
somewhere well it was actually places
like MIT came yes came out of Pentagon
funding and that the Advanced Research
Project agency depending on about
early 60s and remained inside the state
system until the mid-90s I think 1995 it
was privatized and since then it's
changed I mean it before that it was
considered to affect was called usually
an information highway after that it's
mostly called the e-commerce right and
the character of it changed but there
has been a lot of concern in power
centers all over the world that it's
just too free and open and the question
is how can you shape it and modify it so
as to lead people in preferred
directions no away from say organizing
the little social forum but yeah exactly
what for example the Chinese doing about
it do you know in China I think internet
access is quite restricted as well and
highly censored I don't know how much
even limited access there is but it's a
very hard medium to control exacts s
they can do all sorts of things so the
the means of controlling it I that are
being considered as far as I understand
are mostly trying to lead people in
particular directions so you when you
enter an internet portal you know you'll
be sort of drawn off let's go to hear
about that ring and therefore you'll
have to I think opening up it'll take
you somewhere and the idea is you'll
have to use you know energy and
initiative and commitment and what
you're looking for or if you want to go
and the in the direction is less
preferred by power centers which is it's
a terrain of struggle right now there's
a lot of pressure from popular and
activist groups to make it leave it
entirely open not controlled if you were
if this would be your last day on earth
not that far from well you're 475 yeah
yeah would would your would you like
what's said about you to be your
political arguments or your contribution
to the theory of linguistics
they the honest truth I really don't
care you know I'm I'd like to see people
follow up on the things that are
interesting and important than
productive and forget about the things
that were byways and mistakes and so on
but if I my name is attached to it or
not what would you characterize is most
important in your judgment if you are
well I mean I played a certain role in
reshaping the fields concerned with the
human intellectual faculties cognitive
sciences in particular linguistics some
of it has been extremely productive not
me it's cooperative Enterprise and
that's often running on its own right in
the political domain and you know I
would like to see people energized and
participate thinking for themselves not
subordinating themselves to systems of
discipline and propaganda either in the
structure of life and there's play of
that or in the doctrinal domains so if
people can be can come to use the
capacities that they in fact have and
the opportunities in fact have to
overcome systems of authority
illegitimate Authority domination
hierarchy free themselves think through
issues for themselves not the way
they're taught to conform and do
something about it that's the best
legacy I can imagine as I said you and
you said that I know nothing about
linguistics one of many subjects I know
nothing about but especially linguistics
if there is there one question in the
air in that whole realm though that you
would like most to know the answer to
well I like everyone I've own personal
quirks yes there are some questions
which are big mega question that there
are meget questions which are on the
border of research you can't really
they're a little beyond what you can
study very much you can take a pick away
at them but
well one kind of question which is a
sort of a personal obsession is that if
you look at any by language is a
biological system as part of error it's
like our immune system or visual system
just something humans have it's highly
specific to humans they don't seem to be
any counterparts elsewhere in nature
you're in New York because of our mutual
friend Edward syeda passed away several
a month or so ago correct yeah and you
tell me what you tell me just because
you're here your sense of what would you
most want to say an appreciation of him
well Edward was an old friend we're very
close friends for years we had a lot of
mutual interests we've but they be
culture music politics culture politics
mainly mainly political interests
including his prime concern also a major
concern of mine at least but I much
broader questions of justice freedom
oppression which he was much involved in
me too and our paths often crossed and
then it was just a close personal
friendship actually he had arranged
never talked about this much but back in
the guess it must have been around 20
years ago or 25 years ago he began
arranging with meetings between high
officials in the Palestine Liberation
Organization when they were visiting New
York meetings with friends of his who
were sympathetic to the Palestinians
critical of PLO to see if there could be
some constructive discussion to suggest
ways in which they could change what
they're doing to achieve results which
would make more sense for the people
involved and I was involved in some of
those meaning anything come out of no
have to say you know what do you think
of the Geneva Accord that they've been
current Geneva Court yes exactly well it
offers better than 80 though it's it's a
great improvement over the Camp David
proposals which were completely
unacceptable Thank You Alice
you know they made no sense you know
Jenny Carter said that today on a recent
appearance on this program well he's
quite right and as soon as you look at a
map of what was proposed you see that
was absolutely unacceptable and it broke
up the others life talk about
percentages and so on have didn't mean a
thing if you looked at the actual maps
that were discussed which unfortunately
we're not easily available in the united
states that should have been but they
weren't as soon as you look at the maps
you see that what effect it did was
break the west bank into three pretty
separate ten tons so this one i'd take
it was territories well they were
technically contiguous but only way
around the edges she wanted to go from
you know Bethlem to Ramallah you're
going to go way to the east and the so
the three effectively separated
territories all again effectively
separated from a little part of East
Jerusalem which is the center of
traditional center of Palestinian
cultural educational commercial
existence and it was a kind of a bantha
Stan situation as was discussed in
Israel at the time and that and of
course was all separated from gas well
you know it's actually the meaning of
that was described by Barack Creek the
President Barack chief negotiator Shlomo
venome and later hit one minister yeah
and he was the negotiator at Camp David
and he had he was an academic and
shortly before he entered the government
he wrote a book about it in Hebrew in
which he said the goal of the whole Oslo
process and leading this that would be
what he called a permanent neo-colonial
dependency the Palestinians would be a
neo-colonial effectively modern colonial
dependency permanently and in fact
that's what the proposal was and it
couldn't work however after the Camp
David proposals broke down this is now
September 2000 auto September 2000
that's when the current ed father
started but negotiations continued
and the made some progress in january
two thousand and one there were meetings
in Taba which led to a informal meetings
but with fairly high level people on
both sides and they've made considerable
progress towards a more acceptable to
state settlement but it was too late
then because the Israelis were into
their election they were into the
election campaign and Prime Minister
Barack canceled the meetings and after
Shirin was elected and the violence
began to escalate they were never picked
up everyone soon dies him to that they
were never continued however it turns
out now we've learned that context did
continue and the Geneva Accords that you
mentioned are the results of these
continuing contacts and they are they
make considerable progress beyond the
Taba of course hammered out by Yoshi
Belen and other Israelis and content
over two years with stencil Houston who
I'm not sure in part may have been part
of may have been members of the
Palestinian Authority or not I don't
know they some had been but all are
close to it I mean there is close to the
center of Palestinian Palestinian stone
at the state so living in formal
authority but they were as close to the
central part of it as the Israeli
negotiators were to the Israeli go in
fact probably closer your further late
it was I didn't have much to say good
about Yasser Arafat nor did I know to
you fact we were very much in accord
about this real long tonight some of the
real disservice to the Palestinians well
it's a I don't think one can say that
exactly why is that because he's also a
symbol it with without him as a sample
and I was a statement I'm asking so look
he remained a symbol of Palestinian
nationality struggle refusal to submit
that's important right I mean whatever
you may think of him personally just
serving the role of enabling people to
resist harsh oppression probable
destruction which was the goal
that's significant whatever you think
about his particular decisions and
choices and of those they're a mixture
so I I wouldn't i mean i was always
harshly critical you look at what i
wrote in the 60s it was critical
nevertheless there's there's a strain
which was on the right track so in the
mid 1970s era thought did recognize that
the settlement would have to be to state
political settlement there was a
Security Council resolution debated in
January 1976 which was supported by the
PLO they publicly supported it which
called for a two-state settlement on the
international border with full
recognition of Israel's rights to peace
and security and so on and so forth that
was a good resolution unfortunately the
u.s. vetoed that and then there was a
process for a number of years in which
are a fact in his complicated way of
which there's much to criticize
nevertheless one theme that ran through
it was trying to press for such a
settlement it the reason Israel invaded
Lebanon in 1982 was to try to prevent
these negotiate these efforts at
diplomacy to continue in fact they said
so publicly the it was an invasion to
secure the wizard an invasion of lemon
yeah which is where the palace Mahela
restaurant at best and they wanted to
destroy the that it was called and by
the high command in fact worth of the
West Bank we have to stop the
negotiations which and the diplomacy
which was becoming an embarrassment and
let's get back to terror they are
happier with that and this continued for
some years and it's a sort of a mixture
of corruption terror violence bad
judgment and a continuing drive towards
what has to be what on the entire world
recognize must be some kind of political
settlement along the roughly along the
international border with to stateside
there so long 63 borders 67
roughly with some modifications how do
you actually i should add and we should
be willing to recognize this the main
reason this has not taken place is that
the US has blocked it for 30 years alan
laterally Elsa well as I said it vetoed
the 1976 resolution vetoed another
security council resolution 1980s tough
Israelis are independent well you know
we could argue about exactly why but
that he did it is really like but they
could never have luck that if the US had
impacted meanwhile much more importantly
the u.s. provided means the diplomatic
military and economic support which
enabled Israel to continue slowly
integrating the territories effectively
within Israel the big settlement
programs the infrastructure programs and
they can't do it without us support and
that's true right this minute they could
not they can't do it without us support
and they know it you support in terms of
in the international community or us
support at the UN for example every
level in other words you're suggesting
there without the US did the over lune
looming possible veto at the Security
Council or in some other way that there
would be some kind of one of every block
the source of a needy economic incentive
Arab reaction militarily without the US
they can't stand the new small country
can stand alone against the unified
international community it's just
impossible there all kinds of ways of
stopping them and they need the economic
support in the military so that's a nice
segue to Iraq but I want to come back to
other things well you know and Israel
has been as has become actually goes
back before 1976 the in 1971 that's
where the real split between the United
States and the world begins on this in
1971 the president of Egypt the new
president of Egypt that present Sadat
offered Israel a full peace treaty in
return for withdrawal from Egyptian
territory said nothing about the West
Bank nothing about the Palestinians at
full peace treaty recognizing
incorporating the main UN dress
version 2 42 so the right to live in
peace and security and so on and so
forth man everything nothing about the
refugees just in return for withdrawal
from Egyptian territory Israel discussed
it they knew that it was a possible we
have internal records and others
actually yossi beilin rota his doctoral
dissertation was in Hebrew about
revealing a lot of the records and
cabinet records and other discussions
about this but I was also in the public
record now they had discussed the
question should they accept it now they
had a choice and it was a fateful choice
the choice was to accept peace with
Egypt it's the main military force which
would essentially end the military
conflict there were no other major Arab
military forces so accept peace with
Egypt have a still retained control of
the occupied territories have to do
something about it because it was on the
table wasn't on the table and integrate
themselves somehow into the region that
was one choice the other choice was to
insist on expansion and the crucial
expansion at that time was not the West
Bank it was northeastern China Egyptian
territory they wanted to expand into
northeastern cyanide and there were big
developments they are driving veterans
out of their homes and their billing
city in fact an old Jewish city and
northeastern Sinai that was a choice
that if they made the second choice as
they did that entailed dependency on the
United States because there was going to
be a situation of permanent conflict and
that was the choice that was made I
think was a very bad and stay but I my
impression was and I'm again my
impression was that that in fact one
week we had the agreement between Egypt
1978 yeah well it was like suddenly the
agreement was it the druggies withdrew
and the since and in fact arrow schroon
came in and cleaned up the settlements
well no in in northeastern China right
yeah but seem right about that runs
great the but that's only half the story
by 1977 what the what happened in 71 is
the offer was made Israel rejected it
the crucial question is what would the
United State
do well there was an internal debate in
the United States and it was won by
Henry Kissinger whose view was as he
described that that we should keep to
what he called stalemate meaning no
negotiations just force it was opposed
to an agreement in 1971 between Egypt
and Israel yes he would have led to the
withdrawal from the Sinai disabling once
again now the reason have the Sun and
it'd be a rule of diplomatic relations
between the two countries yes uh and
that decided the matter this is which
you know the way the u.s. goes sort of
determines what happens it's just well
mately powerful now when that led to a
war Sadat can t three yes he kept saying
look if you don't withdraw from the
Sinai there's going to be a war nobody
believed him nobody took it seriously
when the work it word did come in 73 and
it was a huge shot it was closing for
Israel after the US ended up earlier
alert at that point Kissinger recognize
that you can't but Egypt isn't a basket
case you can't just dismiss it then he
began his shuttle diplomacy and it goes
on up to Camp David finally he said I
879 and at that point so that the US and
Israel agreed to an offer that said I've
had presented in 1971 but the new one
was harsher from the point of view of
Israel in the United States than the
original would have been better off
they'd accepted 71 rather than the one
was the visual from their point of my
vagina said Jimmy Carter here they see
but in 71 there was nothing about the
Palestinians by 1977 the Palestinian
issue was on the table and the US and
Israel had to accept an order an offer
which recognized in some fashion
palestinian national rights which they
didn't want to do I mean I think they
should have done it so I can't say it's
worse but they didn't want it now it's
interesting that this is described in
the United States as a diplomatic
triumph in fact it was a diplomatic at
astra fee if they'd had been accepted in
1971 with Sperry me Carter was here
several days ago
I mean he'd certainly thought it was the
diplomatic trying he probably doesn't
know the history I mean you should have
asked him whether he knows what happened
in the background well if I'd had this
interview before I wouldn't well it's
all on the public record you know what I
mean but that but you know this is one
of the many things we have to learn
about and if we want to make to gain
some understanding of what's really
happening there so when you ask
questions about say our effort you know
unfortunately all this has to come in
okay fair enough but what's interesting
now let me let me make this point I
spoke to someone about you today and he
said the following to me someone who
many his views you would recommend you
would what agree with some not he said
me that after company in your mind
quality the mind and contribution Jude
made he said that what you had done is
turned American exceptionalism on its
back and that your for all those who
believe in our conception you had
believed in exactly the opposite
whatever that is and let me stay with
this question on the other hand there
are people who have asked you look if
you have such strong feelings about how
wrongheaded American policy has been why
don't you leave the country of frequent
sort of thing is thrown at people were
critical frequently and you always say I
love this country right I mean it's a
very interesting question lets us try it
on some other country you know it's
sometimes easier to think about things
clearly if we just never agree let's go
back to say are the beginning Soviet
Union right i mean the Russians would
have been delighted to have the
dissidents leave the country if soccer
have been willing to come to us they
would have applauded what does it make
sense to ask so why don't you leave at
the Soviet Union I mean I know that's
what you said I'm not asking that
question is advancing that question the
fray make the point that you've always
said the framework in which the country
of the question should be understood
right it's assuming that you can't have
it then you stay and fight for values
because you love the country and you
know it and you think that the country
ought to live up to these values now
they're cut you know you can't rank
countries
ABC the country's up all sorts of
properties there's a culture there's a
society there's modes of interaction and
so on a lot of the things that are
simply achievements now it takes a
protection of free speech it's unique in
the United States there are a lot of
great things that have been achieved
there are a lot of rotten things that
have been done if you can write if you
have any concern about the country
meaning its people its culture and so on
you want to save and extend and amplify
the achievements and modify the men you
would contact no free speech high up on
that list of area it's not the only one
okay but tell me more and then we'll
come to some of the criticisms because
that you have made about American
imperialism and the like see that's so
we have to make a distinction between
state power and a country the different
things I understand the different but
it's often not distinguished if you
criticize state policy you're not
criticizing it I understand that too i
mean we first unfrequently when you're
traveling around the world is right
