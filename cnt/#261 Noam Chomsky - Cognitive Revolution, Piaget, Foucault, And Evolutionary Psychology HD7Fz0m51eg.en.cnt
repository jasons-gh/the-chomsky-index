hello everybody welcome to a new episode
of the dissenter and today I have the
great honor of being here with dr. Noam
Chomsky he holds a joint appointment as
Institute professor emeritus at MIT and
laureate professor at the University of
Arizona and he is the author of over 100
books on topics such as linguistics war
politics mass media and others
so dr. Chomsky thank you for taking the
time to come on the show it's a real
honor to everyone thank you very much
okay great
so I would like to go through some of
the major highlights of your
intellectual life that is very long by
now and the first question I would like
to ask you is since you were one of the
major figures that was behind what we
call the cognitive revolution back in
the 50s and 60s what would you say was
the importance of that revolution in
terms of studying human behavior
well Vlasto words are crucial the
standard approach to the study of human
beings at the time was called behavioral
science or behaviorism inquiry was
pretty much limited to actual behavior
organization of behavior description of
Bajor eliciting controlling behavior and
so on but that's not the way you study
any organism if you won't understand it
so he what you'd want to do is try to
understand what the internal mechanisms
are that are causing the behavior and
that was considered improper at the time
you had to keep to the analysis of
behavior so the cognitive revolution
so-called was pretty much with the word
suggest it was trying to study the
nature of the cognitive processes
that are being carried out internally
what we call mental processes processes
in the brain which we try to describe
and discover her and see how they
eventuate in behaviour this was not
entirely new there was a kind of a
cognitive revolution in the 17th century
which began to study such question early
the beginning of the Scientific
Revolution among the topics that was
investigated the words among those
topics were vision language other topics
that became central in the revived
cognitive revolution of the 1950s so in
the case of vision for example if you go
back to 16th century assumptions was
believed that if you perceive a triangle
the form of the triangle somehow passes
through space and implants itself in
your mind and Galileo and other
initiators in the Scientific Revolution
regarded that correctly as mysticism and
wanted to discover what the actual
mechanisms were so for example Descartes
argued that the way you see a triangle
he argued is kind of the way of blind
man with a stick would see it a blind
man would touch various points on the
triangle a series of stimuli and the
mind would create the image of a
triangle because the mind works as on
principles like Euclidian geometry that
turns out to be rather accurate it's not
a stick reaching from the object to you
but it's emotions called saccadic I
emotions which just when you look at
something you don't see it what you see
is a series of stimuli around that your
mind constructs in the image when Iced
construct the image of you triangle or
anything else
the case of language they were quite
interesting developments Galileo and his
contemporaries were amazed and shocked
at what they regarded correctly as a
most remarkable phenomenon that with a
few dozen symbols we can somehow
construct in our minds an infinite
number of thoughts and we can even
convey that as thoughts to others who
have no access to the workings of our
mind the Galileo thought that the
alphabet was the most dependence of
human inventions because it could carry
out this miracle of course because it
was based on internal alphabet
collection of symbols and it was
manipulated and quite interesting
investigations began of the nature of
these processes while this was all
forgotten during the structuralist and
behaviorist period the whole tradition
was forgotten and it was revived in the
mid 1950s and without any awareness of
the history that it was Arendt
discovered later but it was revived with
new tools so the company development of
the theory of computation one of the
great mathematical achievements in the
20th century Alan Turing girdle of the
great mathematicians that made it very
clear how a finite object like your
brain or your laptop that would have the
capacity to term in January to construct
an infant unbounded number of structures
structured expressions each of which can
convey can constitute a certain thought
and can be externalized usually in sound
or some of the media that made it
possible to begin to study the
traditional problems of language that
had been left hanging because they
didn't have these concepts to study them
in a direct and serious way
to construct try to construct precise
theories that would account for the
knowledge that you and I have and
largely share which makes it possible
for us to communicate that's and the
same was true in the study a vision was
embedded in the case in the study of
vision by a new technology that made it
possible to discover what neurons are
actually doing in the visual sectors of
the brain they didn't do it with humans
that would be unethical considered but
it was considered ethical to work on
cats and monkeys by implanting
electrodes in their the part of the
brain that picks up visual symbolism to
discover exactly what they're doing and
some pretty remarkable discoveries were
made and in the case of language the
problem is much harder that one reason
is the systems are much more complex the
other reason is there's no comparative
evidence since language is a unique
human property no analogs and other
species which is striking fact in itself
you can't study the monkeys and apes and
cats and the organism any other organism
to see to do the experiments that would
not be permitted on humans EFT is much
more indirect means as nevertheless
there are advances in technology which
make it possible to learn something
about what the brain is doing when you
and I are communicating but most of the
work is just intensive study of a wide
variety of type of AIRAID languages to
see what they cannot understand the
mechanisms that are carrying out this
miraculous achievement that so amazed
Galileo and others and I've quite a lot
has been learned so for example if you
go back to the 1950s it was standardly
assumed in the straw
Christmas tradition that languages could
vary in almost arbitrary ways and that
each language had to be studied on its
own without preconceptions that's now
known to be quite wrong turns out that
as we proceed languages that look very
different on the surface seem to have
pretty much the same internal structure
with meeting the same principles the way
they compute thoughts and transmit them
to the outside and fara matters been
learned about these principles
well the cognitive revolution deals with
in principle with all cognitive
capacities but the most far-reaching
results have been in language vision to
other areas mm-hmm okay let me now move
on to ask you about what has been known
as the Chomsky Piaget debate back in
1975 this was very interesting because
Piaget brought to the table an approach
to children's development particularly
regarding language and other aspects of
cognition that was different from the
behaviorists but also regarded an
interaction between the agent and its
environment and on the other end
back then you defended more in a theist
or a nativist
approach to those kinds of problems so
could you tell us briefly maybe what
were some of the biggest issues that
were debated back then well the biggest
issues were exactly what you just said
is development of language capacity and
other cognitive
as it is a matter of following the fixed
plan that's part of our genetic
endowment that have modified of course
by the environment so your genes don't
determine whether you speak English or
Spanish but is there a kind of a
basically fixed plant plan that directs
the child reflexively a child doesn't
think about it any more than you think
about growing growing arms but it sort
of sketches out the make theme a basic
plan of development that's the
experience of modifying it around the
edges or is there some process of the
maturation of moving from stage to stage
which that doesn't involve any innate
genetically determined components and
that was the core argument the debate
but incidentally neither PHA or I
regarded as debate the debate idea was
created by the publishers it was
supposed to be a conference bur he and I
opened it with our own presentations and
others came in gave their presentations
I guess the publishers felt that they
could sell the book better if they
turned it into a debate but neither of
us has approved of that but it was a
discussion about many cognitive
scientists some from piaces Institute
barber Linda and hilde or another some
from here friend Jerry Fodor was an
active participant and a lot of
interaction about the nature of these
problems mm-hmm and wasn't it another
issue that was brought to the table the
one that had to do with modularity of
mind and you and father if I'm not
mistaken mistaken defended a position
where you believe that the mind was
composed of several different modules he
with each of which had to deal with
different cognitively these distinct
problems correct that's great mm-hmm and
would you say that those different
modules were the result of natural
selection and are mostly genetically
determined or at least genetically based
or not first of all we have to
distinguish genetically determined from
a product of natural selection okay
remember Piaget in particular was very
skeptical but natural selection won't
together so much so that a number of the
distinguished biologists present Jacques
Monod also echoed the laureates and
biology were pretty much shocked by some
of his positions actually some of what
he proposed then does not sound that
quite as exotic today as it did at the
time because of discoveries and what
have been called it's been called
epigenetics and the way experience has
some peripheral limited effects in
complex ways on changing the nature of
than a genetic endowment but his general
anti-darwinian position is not
suggestiveness then my case and also
further and massimo Catelli who
organized the meeting the MS biologists
in fact Fodor in Fayette LA have just
written a book recently called
why Darwin was wrong in which they
reviewed with many discoveries in recent
years that which have shown that many
natural processes take take place that
are critical for evolution that over and
above natural selection
they even raise some questions about the
nature of natural selection but
I think we can concede that that's a
critical element of evolution Darwin was
marching right about that but there are
many other ways in which the genetic the
the genome the the arrangement of genes
is the changes through genetic drift
transposition of genes from one place to
another or even from one organism to
another lots of processes take place
that yield the genetic endowment the
bearer of the work of the particular
organism it's it's its genotype
so yes I think it's my few reasons I'm
clear that there is a specific genetic
endowment for language that's humans and
whether organism has that's why as I
mentioned before we can't do the kinds
of comparative studies about language
that you try with you can do with vision
and other pretty much shared capacities
and I don't there's no known explanation
for that other than genetic endowment of
course to find the basis in the genome
for particular capacities is very
difficult even for simple traits like
height but same word nobody doubts it's
genetically determined that to try to
find the hundreds of genes involved in
determining height is what biologists
sometimes called fiendishly difficult
problem so you're not something to be
simple to find the genetic endowment for
for language that's a huge problem but
the fact that it's there I think is
pretty well-established in fact that's
why an infant two year old infant as an
amazing acknowledge of language as you
can discover by experiment even though
it's at very little experience and why
if you look at the my
which development of infants it goes
through a very fixed program development
in fact a newborn infant already has
some information about the language of
its mother can identify the language of
its mother as distinct from another
language both speaking by a woman whose
voice they've never heard of bilingual
woman and by now let's the little bit
that and then there's a regular series
of progressions that the introduced
through of courses modified by
experience but it seems to be just
similar to other genetic programs there
have been efforts extensive efforts to
try to elicit something like language
behavior from other organisms usually
Apes it's been a total failure they
simply don't have the cognitive
capacities that allow them to use the
data that an infant uses just
reflexively and that's also it has to be
the basis for the fact that languages
generally seem to be cast to the same
mold in some deep sense you know they
look on the surface to be very very I
should say that this doctrine about the
almost endless variation of languages
was also held about organisms in the
1950s so a standard view among
biologists was that organisms are so
varied though that you just have to
study each one basically on its own
that's now known to be completely wrong
that discoveries is recent years have
shown that there very few types of
organisms though they have deep
properties that they all share and this
it's even been suggested and taken
seriously that there's a universal
genome single fake
Gino with slight modifications usually
different organisms it's a picture
somewhat like what seems to have been
discovered about language over the years
a lot of this is contentious and I want
to suggest there's an overwhelming
consensus about that it's the way the
evidence looks to me increasingly and I
don't see any I really see no series of
primitives to this view okay but since
you agree that we have at least certain
aspects of our cognition that are
genetically determined and you also
agree for the most part with the
modularity of mind position I've heard
you criticizing several times the
discipline of evolutionary psychology
since those are basically two of its
theoretical foundations why is that what
do you think are its main forms well I
don't criticize the discipline of
evolutionary psychology I think it's a
fine discipline effect I work my own
work falls within it okay but it's the
practice of evolutionary psychology that
I think has to be viewed very carefully
a good deal of the practice who makes
enormous imaginative leaps on the basis
of very scanty evidence jerry fodor for
example the humanity does believe in
modularity of mind as written scathingly
about the practice of evolutionary
psychology there is work that's
significant in serious work on Ken's
election on evolution of altruism Robert
rivers work others but a good deal of it
is pretty fanciful it's
constructing possible stories on the
base with have a lot of implications for
human life was on the basis of very thin
and dubious
evidence so I think we have to be pretty
cautious about it and just as you'd be
caution about any fetal but in
particular in this case but has to be
very cautious because of the apparent
implications for human life and human
society that's a serious matter you
can't just speculate wildly about that
so your opinion is mostly that some of
the conclusions that are drawn from the
activity than in evolutionary psychology
perhaps are not well supported by the
evidence
I think that's unfortunately true and as
I say there is a fair amount of critical
work on this filters written about it
major biologist Richard Lewontin Stephen
Gould have written critical assessments
of it and I think a lot of what they say
is well found it on the wanton in
particular well known evolutionary
biologist has strongly argued that we
should be careful about what he calls
just so stories like Kipling was making
up nice stories about animals or humans
based on some often just metaphoric
relationship to what might have happened
in evolution where we really have no
knowledge of how it happened it's very
hard evolutions are hard field you can't
just wave your hand and say this
happened because of natural selection
doesn't mean actually to find the actual
mechanisms is no small and the actual
processes that took place is no small
problem
in the case of in fact it's kind of
interesting to take a look at what is
studied and what isn't study tells you a
lot
so take honeybees they have a very
elaborate a communicative system the
famous waggle dance so for some species
of bees the bees will fly away from I've
wander around some of them I'll hit a
flower they'll take good directly back
to the hive which was actually called a
beeline because they go straight back to
the life which is no not a simple task
humans can't do it when they come back
to the hive they perform a certain kind
of dance they wave their wings around on
a certain way but that informs the other
bees in the hive of the direction the
height and the distance and the quality
of the flowers so it was a pretty tricky
communication systems been studied quite
well the neurophysiology of it is not at
all understood I mean it's obviously
genetically determined but nobody can
find the genes what about the evolution
of this system well I just think about
it there's hundreds of species they
differ a little bit some have no don't
have this dance at all sometimes
variants of it bees have a tiny brain
it's about the size of a grass see you
can do any experiment you want just
stick electrodes in anything you think
of ethical conditions it's almost no
study of it because it's very hard I'll
come to humans in comparably more
difficult huge brain can't do
experiments no comparative one species
no comparative studies the huge
literature on evolution of language that
already tells you that we're moving into
an area of
deep speculation I mean it's not that
you can't say anything about evolution
languages written a book about it too
few things you can say but it's an
immensely difficult topic as compared
with the evolution of B communication
which is understood by biologists to be
a very hard problem you can barely study
if you try to google it on the internet
you'll find some scattered studies but
not much because it's part that tells
you something about studying evolution
mm-hmm so let me ask you now about
debate that he went back in 1971 with
Michel Foucault and I would like to
focus mostly on the first part of it
that was about human nature from an
epistemological perspective that I guess
you had very dissimilar views there I
think that Foucault focused mostly on
how the kinds of social environments and
cultural environments that we nabbit
basically are responsible for
constructing our cognition but again I
think that you brought to the table a
more in atheist perspective is that
correct that's correct although frankly
I don't think there's an issue I mean
human nature humans are organisms just
like bees or Apes or dogs every organism
has a genetically determined major I
have dogs okay the dogs can do certain
things which I can't do but they can't
do certain things that I can do that's
not because of their experience that's
just because that's the way they're
designed and the way arm design again
that's their major no if there is a kind
of a in my view rather mystical belief
that
yes we have a nature but it's only
responsible for physical characteristics
when we move to our cultural mental
cognitive characteristics it's just
somehow comes from somewhere else I mean
there's no basis in science history
experience anywhere to countenance that
view I wouldn't sit when you hear people
say even serious people humans have no
nature only a history that can't be
correct
if you didn't have a fundamental
cognitive nature you couldn't understand
anything well you would just be some
hopeless amoeboid like creatures and
wandering around aimlessly even to have
experience requires a fundamental nature
so when I look at this screen I see a
person why don't why do I see a person
why not just a lot of the colors and the
shapes they're round and every young
infant also sees a person that's because
we have an internal nature that provides
our experience when you see you see the
moon rising why do you see the moon
rising why not just an array of colors
and shapes that has no form that I don't
know if the dog sees a moon rising
probably not even the simplest datum
simplest part of experience is already
constructed that by the mind that was
understood in the 17th century
if much more evidence for it today so at
every aspect of their the cognition
their mental life our social life it's
based crucian must be based crucially on
elements of our nature now that doesn't
mean that experience doesn't have an
effect of course as a huge effect so for
example take an issue that's very much
alive today the crucial question about
the nature of our society should people
be slaves obeying the order of a master
okay is that legitimate Welland
so should we accept totalitarian state
which controls and orders the actions
and even the thinking of its citizens
and we would all say no to that but
while we say no to it we accept it
that's what our business is not take any
business say to enterprise
now the worker goes in in the morning
and until that worker leaves in the
evening their slave they're controlled
to a level that goes way beyond what
anything wouldn't would imagine in a
totalitarian state so for example the
Stalin let's say that didn't control
when people were allowed to go to the
bathroom for 15 minutes
for five minutes didn't control when
people were allowed to talk to each
other what clothes they had to wear that
all of this happens in every business
all the time so heartlessness
is the labor contract legitimate well if
you go back in history you have
different views on this so in the early
Industrial Revolution
American workers were very militant
Marianna opposed their view was if you
work in a if you work for a wage instead
of under your own control you're just a
slave love to you leading figures in the
Enlightenment believes this the bill
humph LeNoble was one of the great
figures in the Enlightenment also a
great linguist in the humanistic founder
of the modern research university but
one of the founders of classical
liberalism his view which was not
unusual was that as he put it if an
artisan creates a beautiful object on
command we will admire what he does but
we will despise what he is namely an
automaton controlled by someone else
obeying orders and it's not a free human
being that view was held that was
actually a slogan of the Republican
Party in the mid 19th century Abraham
Lincoln believed it was a big struggle
today about whether in fact even the
most elementary structures of our social
organization have any legitimacy or
whether they should be dismantled justly
slavery was okay this is a critical
question has to do with their it's often
argued that it's just part of our nature
to want to be subordinated to
hierarchical structures that control us
very commonly or that's the way our
nature is we have to have this same
arguments were made about slavery the
blacks are just genetically they didn't
say genetically in those days they're
designed by their nature maybe by God
but to be taught to pick cotton in their
back said it to be that's the way
they're happy unfair to them anything
else similar arguments are made today
about you know about the struck the
basic structures of our economy so there
are real issues live issues about what
our nature is and what does it what is
it proper waived for our nature what
kind of social organization would be
appropriate for our intrinsic nature to
flourish there's a serious questions
science doesn't tell us that
evolutionary psychology doesn't
experience tells us some things history
tells us things we can think about it in
various ways but it's just a kind of a
truism that everything about us is a
some kind of combination of our
intrinsic nature and the environment
social personal other aspects of the
environment in which we develop and
though this part those parts are
controllable we can change them
sir the person is interested in
constructing a better world working for
what's called the common good it will be
very considered with these issues so
yeah so let me just ask you one last
question before we go regarding what you
were just saying in terms of trying to
find out what kind of social
organization would allow for us to
better express our human nature and to
flourish I think that another issue that
he was so debated with Foucault had to
do with creativity so is that one of the
things that we have to keep in mind I
mean to allow for people to be creative
when trying to devise a better system of
social and political organization I
think I'll go back to the landfill
humboldt again he regarded the essence
of human nature as being the desire to
inquire and create you see it in young
children
they're very inquisitive they want to
understand everything they want to make
new things and so on it's sort of beaten
out of them by the educational system
but it ought to be I think it should be
a proper educational system should be
nourishing it and allowing these
qualities to flourish and that's
actually what happens in decent
progressive education systems but much
much of the system is devastating so
take the reigning system now on the
United States which is called teach to
test you have to teach in the schools in
third grade you have to teach them what
they can use to pass a test that's way
better than here that's a way to ensure
that people understand nothing go
nowhere we've all had the experience of
taking a course in school which was of
no
we talk very badly we had no interest
work hard enough to pass the test two
weeks later he forgot with the course
was about everybody said that experience
we've also had for lucky had the
experience of being in environments
where your instinctive a tendency to
seek to inquire and grade is nurtured
opportunities are often encouraged we
know these of the consequences are quite
different
well I think that holds for society in
general it's one reason why I think it's
that's dramatically opposed to human
nature to have social institutions in
which people spend much of their waking
lives basically as slaves okay so dr.
Chomsky I guess that we've already
arrived at our time limit unfortunately
and again again it was a real pleasure
to have you on the show and thank you a
lot for taking the time to come and it
was a real pleasure to talk to you and
to meet so thank you very much enjoy the
