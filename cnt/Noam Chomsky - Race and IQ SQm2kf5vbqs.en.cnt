first of all i want to say just very
quickly that last night i saw this time
magazine on the
with the front cover um regarding that
iq um book that you had mentioned
and i was just appalled by it
i was a black man in this country i
would not know what to do with myself
how about if you were black
did you notice did you read the article
i mean the article claims that
one of the things that discusses is the
idea that black women
don't nurture their children you know
that's because they came from africa
with a climate with such and such
no i mean you know this stuff that's
right out of the nazis
how would i feel and you know what i
just
i don't know what to do i mean it's just
rage maybe i would wake up every day
maybe i'd be despondent maybe i try to
relate to other people as human beings
but inside there would be a
burning fire but i think the right i
mean i agree with that emotional
reaction but if you think about it the
right way to respond is to ask
what are they doing it for and they're
doing it for a very simple reason
uh like i said last night 40 percent of
the kids in new york
most of them are black and hispanic are
living below the poverty line
that means they're destroyed okay well
you can't and that's the result of very
definite social policies which are
supported by the new york times
okay uh there are certain social
policies which are driving people down
the destruction
well you can't say that plainly so you
need some cover
well what's the cover okay bad genes
you know who knows maybe you know but
and once you understand that then you
know how to deal with it
well you know it's not it's not that
their audience wants to hear that
uh it's i mean some of it does is that
that's
the proper ideology just as as it was
proper for the nazis at some point
to say jews are a virus that's
destroying our society
it is proper for the new york times to
run articles taking seriously the idea
that black mothers don't nurture their
children
and like pygmy ashkenazic jews we're
supposed to be the top
we have small families because that's
what we're like that's why my mother
came from family of 11 kids
you know because ashkenazic jews have
small families of course she was an east
european you know living in a peasant
society maybe that had something to do
with it no no no that's not what social
science tells you
uh okay well that's you know these these
things are such
such transparent ideological weapons
that you don't even you shouldn't even
bother arguing about them we should just
understand them transparently for what
they are
i'm in a real commissar culture uh
which is dedicated to trying to obscure
the most elementary truths
and therefore is able to do things like
this on the front cover of the new york
times well that's the world we're living
in
and you know you can understand the
emotional reaction and it's
easily understandable but it's not the
right one because what's going on
is very transparent
it's nothing to do with evil and god
this has to do with
rich powerful people trying to justify
the fact
that they are pursuing social policies
which are
forcing children to die that's what it
has to do with
