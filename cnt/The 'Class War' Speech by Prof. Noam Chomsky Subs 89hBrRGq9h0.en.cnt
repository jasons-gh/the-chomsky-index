The fact is that to an extraordinary extent
by comparative standards the United States is a business run society
which means that human rights are subordinated
to the overwhelming overriding need of
profit for investors
decisions are placed in the hands of unaccountable private tyrannies
which means that even if
formal democratic practices exist, as they do
they're of
peripheral significance.
The government, in fact,
is as John Dewey called it 50 or 60 years ago
"the shadow cast by
business over society", so that
modifications in the shadow
are not going to change the substance.
These were truisms throughout most of
American history including American working-class history until quite
recently, until the 1950's in fact
and it also means that social policy
is geared to the transfer of wealth and power
to those who already have it, and deliberately so.
Now, in more democratic societies, but that I mean societies where democratic forms
function more
there're countervailing forces
that enable the public to enter
the arena
of policy and decision.
That's only true to a
very limited extent
remarkably limited extent than the United States despite
quite impressive
democratic forms
The country was founded on the principle that
James Madison
explained in the
in the
constitutional convention
the primary role of the government is to protect
property
from the majority
and so it remains to a remarkable extent
Well, one of the most
affective democratizing forces has always been uh...
the Labor Movement
Labor Unions
The history on this has been... is completely clear.
In countries that have a strong labor movement
there is also a very strong tendency, or very strong correlation with a
real, life,
functioning social contract
that includes not only rights for working people
but for people who need help and protection
for the defenseless, for
children, for women, for families,
for people who need assistance generally
for the general public in fact, and there's also a
culture that goes along with it
a culture of of solidarity, and sympathy
and mutual aid and support
In countries where unions are weak
like ours
we tend to find what's called
'tough-love' as they call it this days
which means 'love' for the privilege and 'tough' for everybody else
We find
what are called, what we might call if we're honest; really existing
doctrine of free markets
that means market discipline
for the poor and the defenseless
but plenty of protection and subsidy
for those who really need it, the rich and the powerful
We find different
psychological and cultural values
the ones that in fact were denounced by Adam Smith
whose
motives were
very much like those of the Labor Movement that developed later and very
much opposed to those people who
distort his message
shamelessly use his name
we tend to find what he called "the vile maxim
of the masters of mankind"
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone else
now reaching
its
sharpest expression 
in the 'Gingrich Contract'
to which the population is overwhelmingly opposed incidentally
point-by-point by overwhelming margins if you look at public opinion polls, but
in a country where democratic forms don't function
that's basically irrelevant
and they don't function in large part because we don't have a civil society
with
organized
elements
Unions being the central one as they have been historically that can be a
countervailing force
and that's historically been the case
here as elsewhere
Human Unions have been
a leading force, probably, the leading force for
democracy and human rights, that's true here as well,
that's exactly why such enormous efforts have been undertaken in the United
States
in a really relentless and very self-conscious class war
to undermine and destroy them
it's been going on for a long time
it peaked in the Reagan years
In the Reagan years the United States simply rescinded
'article 23'
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which if you read it, guarantees elementary human rights of workers
including the right to form Unions
and this is well-known outside the United States at least
So in 1991
the International Labor Organization (ILO)
in Geneva did something that it very rarely does, in fact so rare I can't even think of
another example, namely condemned the leading industrial
power, wanted it to pay masters which it
shrinks from doing
well almost always
the ILO
condemned the United States
in the case of Caterpillar
Caterpillar Company
for hiring skeps, what they like to call  permanent replacement workers
and the  ILO called upon the United States to adhere to
international labor standards
At that time there're only 2 industrial countries that violated them;
one was the United States, the other was South Africa
Well, South Africa has changed since then so we now stand in splendid
isolation on that one
The...
Every year the ILO, the International Labor Organization, comes up
with a
world Labor report
the 1995
edition came up a couple months ago
it shows that the United States has the worst record in the western hemisphere
and in Europe
in adhering to and guaranteeing 
international
conventions dealing with labor
labor rights and workers' rights, actually I am exaggerating a little.
El Salvador and Lithuania are shade worse so we're actually the third worse in
Europe, in the western hemisphere
The United States is not even recognized standard conventions on
child labor on the right to organize
Now, what's particularly interesting
for students and faculty and people like us who live in the Athens of America
is that all this passes without any awareness and any comment
try to find some commentary on these
pretty amazing facts about the United States
what you can find it is just
craze for a magnificent
as uh... you know! leading the way in every wonderful thing
Well, the methods for subverting
i don't wanna suggest that everybody is lying about it, not everybody is in the
universities and the
corporate media and so on
Sometimes the truth is told and it's very often told in the Business
press, which tends to be more honest and open about these matters much less
concerned about that their audience might get out of hand i suppose
The methods for
subverting Article 23,
during the Reagan years, were                  reviewed in a
cover story in 'Business Week' that I'd
really recommend to you
I've written about it and you can see other reference to it
it's a cover story in 'Business Week' just a year ago last May, very accurate
very honest, as the business press
quite often tends to be
'Business Week' points out that
I'll just quote some things to give you a flavor
they say "over the past dozen years", meaning basically since the Reagans
took over,
"over the past dozen years US industry has conducted one of the most
successful
anti-union wars ever
with a chilling effect..."
"The purpose of..."
they are very clear about the purpose. They say "management basic goal
was to undermine the rights that were guaranteed by the 1935
Wagner Act."
which brought the United States into the civilized world, briefly.
They were very quickly undermined this time, we'll come back to that
Some of those rights are still guaranteed by law, but as "Business Week"
points out; "that's just a technicality!"
uh..commonalities just mention it
"The basic method of this successful anti-union war
was illegally..." I'm still quoting, "illegally firing thousands of workers
for exercising their rights to organize"
They point out that "illegal firings increased by a factor of six".
for organizing from the late 60's to the late 80's, mostly during
the 80's
Employers illegally fired
unlawful firings occurred in one third of all representation elections in
the late 80's
compared with 8%t in the late 60's
let me quote harvard law professor,                 that points out;
"even more significant than the numbers...
...is the perception of risk among workers...
...who think they'll be fired in an organizer campaign"
and that's true, any union organizer can tell you that
if the chances are that the
employers will be able to simply fire people for exercise their legal rights with
government protection
the risk of even entering into a organizing campaign, which is not small,
there is plenty of sacrifices involved, as you know, that increases enormously. In this
respect, the
this is very much like this radically mislabeled free trade
agreements
it's a lot of talk about
job flow and stuff like that, which nobody can estimate in this kind of
minor factor anyhow
the major factor is just THREAT
The threat that
jobs can move is enough 
to drive down
wages and working conditions in the wealthier countries
and good behaviors meanwhile guaranteed elsewhere by terror and repression that
American taxpayers pay for
so that they can undercut their own
jobs
and harm plenty of other people
as well as by driving peasants
into the urban labor force, in third world countries
by programs to force them into agroexport for American agrobusiness and by
flooding the countries with  subsidized US
farm products
what's called 'food for peace', by the more
hypocritical commentators.
Well, what all of this shows is
that the famous slogan; "Crime does not pay", is a total absurdity!
in particular when a criminal state is behind it
and that's crucial here
the Reagan state made it very clear that it simply would not enforce
the law
so that was 'carte blanche'
to employers to just carry out criminal
actions, it's a straight criminal conspiracy
I don't use the term conspiracy very often but this was a very clear and open criminal
conspiracy
between the substance; corporate america, and the shadow which was more of a
shadow than usual
and just say ; "you know? yeah! go ahead and violate the law! We won't do a thing about it!"
Well, this illegal destruction of Unions
'Business Week'
points out still
"is a major factor in lowering wages and in increasing the gap between the rich and
the poor in the United States, to depression..."
"...your levels."
... It's reduced pension and health protection
and it's contributed to a 125 fold explosion in
unlawful discharge suits
Why? Because
the union protections that are guaranteed by law are gone
similarly safety
regulations lapsed
thanks to state
employer
cooperation and crime
the OSHA, the Occupational Self Safety and Health Administration, I'm
quoting 'business week' now; "under Reagan and Bush OSHA used his hands off agency
...encouraging lawlessness"
and along with the
dismantling of Unions, that state
involvement in criminal behavior
led to an increase in days lost in injury from 58 per hundred workers in
1983
to 86 per hundred in 1991
which again shows that crime pays
pays very well
when criminal state is crucially involved
Well, there were 
other consequences
this is one factor in the huge growth
in profits, a huge increase in profits and concentration of wealth
which is indeed reaching new heights, meanwhile real wages
which stagnated in the 70's
started a steady decline around 1980
and they continue to decline, continued to declined right
through the latest figures right through the Clinton recovery so-called
For
people with a high school education
wages have declined
well over 20%, somewhere around 20
25%
that's the source of this uh... angry white male phenomenon that people are
talking about
they are plenty to be angry about, unfortunately the anger is
focused on the shadow not the substance      but that's the
effective
very efficient and massive corporate propaganda
but the anger is real and justified
For college students
wages didn't start dropping until 1987 when the
Reagan reforms really got in to it
high here,
and they've been dropping since...
This is noticed, the Wall Street Journal had a
big article about it in 1992, they
pointed out that from 1985...
the United States had the
highest
labor costs in the world
which you'd expect
in the richest society in the world
should have much higher ones in fact
but in 1985 as you'd expect, it would have the highest labor
cost per unit up in the world
and in 1992
it was second lowest in the industrial world
Actually in 1990 it was the lowest than any country
but then Thatcher
succeeded in smashing down the
workforce in England even better than the Reaganized years, so the United
States slipped back into second place
in the competition to see who could harm
working people more
So from 1985 to 1992 the United States
went from
highest labor cost to the second lowest in the industrial world
and this was described by the Wall Street journal as a
"welcome development of transcendent importance"
as it is for their constituency
uh... the
business press
the rest of the business press describes other factors that are
involved in this welcome development. They Financial Times of London which is
the big international
business daily
they...
had article about the same time
about what was going on in Eastern Europe, they 
described it as a horrible mess, everything's awful, but the headline said
that there's some hope
the headline was "green shoots in communism's ruins"
meaning pretty bad that there's some green shoots there, so some good things
the green shoots are what they described as the rising unemployment and
popularization of industrial workers
under the
reforms that
the West is now imposing
and those are green shoots
because it means that
you can get workers in Poland say for ten percent of the wages of the
pampered western workers
as business week
chimed in to say, that means it's a way to drive, it's another way along with
Mexico and Indonesia and so on, there's another two or more
to force western workers to abandon what business week calls the "luxurious lifestyles"
of course when GM
moves to Poland or VW moved to Czechoslovakia
they believe in the really existing free market
so they demand very high tariff protections and public subsidies to pay
them for doing this free markets, remember for the poor
that's 'toughlove' remember
not for the rich, they get state protection
but this is a tremendous weapon against
against working people by now and around the world, that's called the
'globalization of production'
you can see why Harvard
professors and Jeffrey Sachs and so on are so delighted about that
free trade, is really great for
the sector that matters
for the pampered western workers with their luxurious lifestyle might not be
so great
And this goes across the board
so uh...
Daimler-Benz Germany's biggest conglomerate
they can now move to Alabama
where they can get workers of third world standards with no labor protection
and huge subsidies from the taxpayers of Alabama of exactly the kind of a given
in third world
and you can kind of
whipsaw one labor force against another
by these methods. That's another device alongside of the
straight criminality of the state
as in the case of the Reagan years
All of this is
well understood
the...
business press
it's got a caterpillar and the
decatur strike
the business press has pointed out that "the caterpillar", i'm quoting, "is pursuing
"...a business strategy..."
"...that has nudged workers from defiance to compliance".
How have they've nudged workers from defiance to compliance?
The technique was to build excess capacity
in...
other countries
like say Brazil or  Japan or Eastern Europe and so on
which means that when you have a strike indicator you can inspire markets
by overproduction elsewhere
that's alongside of hiring skeps of temporary workers and so on and so forth
same is here when the big
manufactures left here to let
and they'd have informed the business press, that they're doing exactly the
same thing, they're building excess capacity
even in germany, which has
very strong labor movement,  has...
much...
better wages, much lower
working hours and more benefits and so on, so they are
willing to do that, they're not for profits but for class war
so they'd like to have an excess labor capacity and high labor
high-wage places for the
purpose of class war, because as they explain
quite frankly
if there's a strike in Boston they can supply
European and American markets from their excess capacity they've produced over
there
uh... well
there are other devices besides
'Globalization' and 'straight criminality'
to try to beat
down the pampered western workers
One of them, it was actually illustrated in headlines
in the papers,
'The Times', two or three days ago
when they said "bonds surge as unemployment..."
"...rises and growth falls"
If you read the papers you notice right in front the page, and you can see also 
that the thing that is most worrisome
is when unemployment goes down and birth goes up
but when unemployment goes up and birth goes down then the bond market surges
... and that's very important!  There are by now like around a
trillion dollars a day that circulate around in the currency markets speculating
against currencies
and they're looking for low growth
and uh...
low growth and low employment. They want stable currency, means no
threat to
stimulation and growth
so they're delighted when
the pampered western workers are beaten down
more and growth goes down and so on
there's a big change in the last twenty or thirty years and a huge weapon in the
hands of  those who are trying to drive the world into a sort of a third
world
picture including by now leading
industrial societies like us
Back in 1970 when this process began     before the deregulation of
currencies
about 90% of the
capital in international transactions was related to the real economy, it was
for
investment or trade
about 10% was speculation
Those figures have radically changed
by 1995 it was 5%
related to the
real economy and 95% in speculation,            that's a huge change
besides which the amount has just
zoomed astronomically
that's why the 25% of the
corporate  recruiters at MIT now
are from Wall Street
they're going after 
'Hotshot...
...PhD's' in
Physics and Maths
without knowing anything about business but they just have to...
figure out clever techniques
for robbing people
with all sorts of complicated scams
so you can shift money around, you know, every micro second couple of billions
of dollars to undercut currencies here and there and so on, that's
25% of the recruiters right now for
Physics and Maths mainly
The uh...
the same things happening in England incidentaly, they're going after
Oxford and Cambridge
PhD's in Maths and Physics
It was well understood by the late 70's that this is going to be
extremely harmful to the international economy
the James Tobin, it's a YaleUniversity Nobel Prize Winning Economist
gave a
presidential address to the American Economic Association back in nineteen
seventy eight
in which he pointed out that unless something is done to slowdown these financial
transactions
it's going to drive the world into a low-wage,
low growth, and although he didn't say it, high profit equilibrium, that's
exactly what's happening
and it's being stimulated
social justice social policies
deliberately
designed to increase state criminality to crush
the efforts of working people to organize
and to make
globalization of production easier, so you can drive down wages everywhere by
just
playing one work force against another
so it's being designed to stimulate these flows
in the interest of what makes sense if you're in the top fraction of, you know,
tiny fraction of the world's population
Low growth, low wages, and very high profits
and so the caterpillar business strategy is indeed
driving people from defiance to compliance
and will continue to if it's allowed to.
There are other factors too, take say 'automation'
which is putting plenty of people out of work
Well, a lot of that actually of... someone design here machine tools and so
on
It's alleged that
automation is a
you know, results just from market forces
so, you know. i can't stop it like the force of nature
but that's complete nonsense, that 
topic was studied in depth by
David Noble, here
no longer here, incidentally partly for this reason
But he...
he's teaching in Canada now, but he did the
main studies on what actually happened
in...
in developing numerical processing and other
automation techniques
and what actually happened in fact is that it was so inefficient
that couldn't be done through market forces and it had to be done through the
state system
we had a huge state industrial system in the United States called the Pentagon
MIT is a small
part of it, you know, way out of the periphery, but
it's a technique for funneling taxpayer funds to
high-technology industry
and automation was developed within the state system for decades in fact
in the navy and the air force and so on, work cost doesn't matter because
taxpayers paying for it anyway
and it was designed in very specific ways
not to be efficient!
Not for economic efficiency but for control and power
the automation technology is concerned, it could be used
to  put
the decisionmaking power and control into the hands of skilled machinist and
get rid of managers
technology is perfectly happy if is that way
or it can be used to deskill machinists, and increase levels of management 
technology is happy that way too, it doesn't care
that's the way it was designed
and it was designed as a weapon of class war through the state system
because it couldn't possibly be
that done through market forces because of its inefficiency!
that's true for containerization, it's true for machine tools, a fact across the board
it's even true for computers
These are
among the huge
mechanisms of social policy
that are used to ensure that the pampered western workers
have to give up their luxurious lifestyles
any effects are pretty dramatic
The one effect it's just a
vast move towards a kind of totalitarian system
in which
highly concentrated unaccountable private power
determines what yours aren't, nobody dares to say a word about it and for the
most ordinary nobody knows anything about it
and the effects are very obvious, just in the numbers
take a look at, you know, every year fortune magazine comes out with a
big going on the fortuned five hundred
This year's a particularly interesting one because this is the 14th
anniversary, so there's a big celebration of the fortuned five hundred
the May 15th issue
is worth looking at 
I don't know if you recall  but some years back Abbie Hoffman wrote a book called 'steal
this book'
and that's what you got to do with the fortune five hundred, don't pay
four fifty four, or whatever it costs, if you can pick it up somewhere
if you can pick it up somewhere it's worth looking at, very
big fat glossy
volume which is quite intriguing
in the last years, for 1994 they, which discussed
1993, they described 1993 as a dazzling year
for corporate profits
even those sales growth was stagnant
so you're not selling anything they're making huge amounts of money
1994 was far better
they say profits went up a stunning 54%
on a sales growth of 8%
and an employee growth of 2.6%
Just listen to those numbers and you see a lot about the world
profits up
a stunning 54%
sales growth 8%, meaning virtually no change
and employee growth 2.6%
you know, that
doesn't exist
The numbers are real and they mean something, and concentration is going up
too
Fortuned five hundred now controlle 63% of the
total US
gross domestic product
now that's a level of totalitarianism, remember this are totalitarian 
institutions
as totalitarian is
human beings are ever devised
and that's a level of totalitarian control that has very rarely been
reached in the world if ever, you may check
Among the biggest gainers
are Manpower Incorporated which hires temporary workers
very important fact
...their profits were up 35% percent last year
sales up 35%, but they've got salesmen
selling people
...to undermine
pampered western workers, remember, because they're
selling temporary workers so you don't need  benefits and you don't need
security, you've got a flexible labor market
so their sales are up 35%, they are now         two hundred
thirty seven in the combined
industry
services
list. Services doesn't mean guys who
clean 
the offices, it means
investment firms and banks and you know, those guys.
there are 237 Kelly
their sales are up twenty one percent
well that also tells you something
these are another form of the techniques for undermining the work
force
and the work force means the population
workers means
most of the population, their families, their children, and so on
Caterpillar is now number sixty one in this combined industrial service
list
its profits were up 46% from 1993 and the
earnings per share were up 46%
that's not
small
eh...
the
and this is expected to continue
the May first issue of fortune has a big article called;
"Why profits will keep booming?"
Remember!
In 1993 they were dazzling
and they were even more splendid in 1994, they put it
that's the fourth successive year of double-digit growth in profits
and expected to go on through 1996 at least
Remember, this is a period when wages are going down
and working hours are going up
okay but profits are now dazzling
earnings per share they say have doubled since 1991
the return on capital has more than double,  considerably more than double
since 1980
profit margins are up
working hours are up
temporary workers are way up as a proportion of the work force
the only thing that is down is wages
and benefits, and working conditions
other things are up too, as i mentioned before like industrial accidents, are shot
way up
so, you know, a lot of things are doing really good
but some things aren't doing so good,  namely the pampered western workers
with their luxurious lifestyle
The "Wall Street Journal"
having
held the welcome development of transcendent importance in nineteen
ninety-two noticed another one
just a few weeks ago
they said that
in 1993
the changing unit labor cost finally reach a zero
that's always inflation remember
finally reach a zero, and that stayed there since 1993
that's another welcome development of transcendent importance, in fact
total labor costs last year were lower than any year since 1981
headline reads; "Economy's gains fail to increase benefits or wages", which it 
kind of understates it
So, what are we suppose to do in the face of all this? Well, we can
get some information from the press too
yesterday's New York Times had a front page story
with explaining how you got to react to all that stuff
headline was...
quoting an expert
as saying, "New York is simply not wealthy enough to afford services to
the general population"
The expert was a JP Morgan executive
JP Morgan is fifth among the banks in the
five hundred listing, doing rather nicely
so New York isn't wealthy enough
In fact, the country is flooded with capital
you know, it's super wealthy!
but it's not wealthy enough for services to the
general population because you've got to
increase
those stunning, dazzling, stupendous profit levels that are shooting way up
for like
few percent
of the population
So therefore you have the 'Pataki budget'
and the 'Giuliani budget' and the rest of them,...Cut taxes for the rich
if you look at the back pages of New York Times, you'll notice that they
mentioned that
all the tax cuts
are for the benefit of business
all the tax cuts are for the benefit of business, so you cut taxes for the rich
meanwhile you increase taxes for everyone else, but here comes some advice
to
those of you wanna get into the commissar class
You don't call them 'taxes'
you call them something else, here's what he called them, here i'm quoting from The Times, you
call them "Multi-million dollar reductions in subsidies to the city's mass transit..."
"...system..."
"...and cuts in aid to education and higher education".
Well, you know, you guys are MRC students, you can figure out  what that means
When you cut
what they call subsidies to mass transportation
into city schools
you are increasing taxes
to the people who pay for those things
that's what it amounts to, you don't call it a 'tax', but of course it's a 'tax'.
When the subway fares go up beyond their already astronomical level, as they do
when you cut the so-called subsidies meaning
paying for services for people
using taxpayer pump funds for the purposes of people
that's called a subsidy
when you cut those subsidies
the rates go up, the tuition rates go up for the city schools
and somebody pays those rates
mainly poor people
so it's a tax
they don't call it tax,
and a highly regressive tax
it's a good kind of tax, a tax that slams the poor
meaning most of the population, so that's the right kind
The rich guys that ride in limousines, they want to make sure that everybody's in
the subway so they can get through New York traffic
but they don't pay for it, they want somebody else pay for it, namely the
school children who now
no longer get 
free, unreduced rates for rides on the subways, but you don't call that a tax
remember, you gotta understand how these words work
and this goes across the board. Social policies is geared with precision
delicate precision
to have these deliberate effects
So take the idea of
forcing
welfare recipients to work
In fact,
Welfare Programs in the United States are way below any other countries, one of the
miserly countries in the world in that
Largely because we have weak unions
correlates pretty well and what that was this decline radically AFDC, the one
they talk about
has declined about  50% since 1970 with
devastating effects on families, and children and so on, as you'd imagine
but it has to go down more
and the people on it
welfare mothers, they have to be driven to the work force, there's an
interesting assumption there which nobody seems to challenge and that is
they're not working
like if you're raising children... that's not work, right?
like your husband loses his job and you
go out to the work force, because you're not working when you're raising children
that just comes free, like everything women do
real work is the kind of stuff you get paid for, remember we live in "America-
tocracy", that's another thing we're taught
you live in 'Americatocracy' and you measure the merit of work by the amount
of
income that accrues to it
So 'real work',
is the kind of stuff that you do when you're in Wall Street
speculating against currencies to drive down growth rates
and wages
that's 'real' work and you can tell from the fact that in 'Ameritocracy' you get
very high pay for it
On the other hand, raising children let's say
that's not even work at all, you know, you don't get paid a cent for that, you've gotta be driven
into the work force
which has the extra side benefit that as everybody knows when
these people aren't doing any work, just taking care of children
when they're driven into the workforce,  they're gonna have to have subsidized jobs
because there aren't any jobs around
which means taxpayer subsidized jobs at very low wages
which has been nice side effect of undermining union wages so everybody's
wages go down
at taxpayer expense
well that's another part of social policy very nicely designed, you know, i'm
not very
brilliant because it's obvious to
figured out pretty obviously, but that's the way it's working and in fact
sometimes they even come clean like
the Mayor of new york the other day
Mayor Giuliani
came clean finally, and  said exactly where I knew he was up to
and all policies up to, to namely drive poor people out of New York city
he said it finally, thanks
that's pretty obvious before, but the idea is that JD New York city is for JP
Morgan executives, you know the experts wil tell you we are not
wealthy enough
to pay for people
and the Mayor was kind enough to say it in the New York Times, even had a
nice headline about it
they said "Welfare cuts provide a chance..."
"...to leave".
So it's all 'tough-love', I mean
finally we are gonna free up this poor people so they're not stuck here
we are gonna give them a chance to leave by cutting grants
and 
wages and, you know
money for heating your house and feeding your kids and so on, so finally you are
liberated
thanks to 'tough-love'
'course there's no toughlove for Cobb county
Georgia where
New Gingrich comes from
or in a way there is, they're getting a seventy two billion dollar 
boondoggle to build the F 22
to defend themselves from countries to whom we are selling F 16's for
which we are also paying
because they might turn on us and so on, so that's another part of the system this
is why they get more federal subsidies than any suburban county in the country
outside the federal system
Well, that's the free market...
I mentioned before that the attacks on the 
on labor during the Reagan years
were criminal as they were
this is not really the time to talk about this or go into it. It's true but it's
misleading
because, in fact, there has been a huge attack
ever since the Wagner Act.
the Wagner Act. drove
business 'perse'
they thought they had the country by the throat
Woodrow Wilson is red scared
smashed up the unions
you know, through the leading union-leader Eugene Debs into jail
for daring to raise some questions about the second world war free country
remember?
The...
independent thought, you know, independent action, labor movement was completely smashed
looked like business really  had everything
under control
then along came the depression and had labor organizing and activism and so on
and so forth and finally along came the Wagner Act.
which brought to the United States
the
theoretical
the law, the benefits that were part of it, had been achieved in
Europe about half century before, in fact
US labor history is extremely violent
incomparably more so than 
Europe which is so there is nothing
remember seeing thing... much worse things than when i was a kid and growing up in
Philadelphia
and before that it was hundreds of workers were getting murdered by
security forces, this went on on the late 1930's
nothing like in Europe
in fact the right wing European press was appalled by the treatment of American
workers right through the early part of the century
this is a business run society
and it shows
in 1935 the Wagner Act. was passed finally
the business went out of the minds
the
national association of manufacturers literature
warned about what they call the hazards facing industrialists
due to the
rising political power of the masses
unless we redirect their thinking
we're going to be headed to adversity
they started right off with a big campaign, you know, scientific method
strike breaking
all kind of social science frauds about
the harmony and stuff like that
was kind of put on hold for a while during the war picked up right
afterwards with an extraordinary campaign of corporate propaganda
It's not studied too much
in fact, the first academic study of it just came out. This is one of the most
important things
in modern American history, literally the first book just came out
by university released at press a couple months ago, another one in Australia
in fact, there is an australian scholar who's been writing about this for years
i've been writing about it mainly using his work I should say, but
an American study finally came out
and it's pretty interesting
Right after the second World War
the
business community, the country was social democratic
very social democratic at that time,
and they knew it
and the business leaders
said that they had to renew with a bigger, what they call "the everlasting battle...",
"...for the minds of men"
and indoctrinate citizens with the capitalist story
they said that we have three to five years to resell our preferred way of life, and
they went after with that vengence,
anti union campaigns
any unionism was
the ideal was, as they put it to sell any unionism as anti-...
...-american!
Huge campaigns were undertaken the sort of, you know, 'We' versus 'Them'
'Us'
you know, this working man and...
housewife, and the corporate executives slaving away for everyone's benefit and
'They' are those outsiders, the strikers are coming to try to disrupt their
harmony, there's huge business about this
At that time, there was a vigorous labor press
the one-dimensional press of American society is fairly recent
there're about 800 labor newspapers back  in the 1950's with
tens of millions of people reading them
they were condemning the corporate media, as they put it, for damning labor at
every opportunity, while
carefully glossing over the sins of the banking and industrial magnates who 
really control the nation
and that had to be destroyed, of course, and
the reason is the truth is subversive, that's anti-American
and has to be eliminated and it was destroyed
with a tremendous power play
this covered everything from the entertainment industry, the corporate media
and schools and so on
billions of dollars a year were devoted to this
taking over
schools, churches, recreational activities, anything you can think about
the corporate media of course right in the center of it...
Films were
quite important. Commercial films as well as propaganda films
Propaganda films were reaching twenty to thirty. Business propaganda was reaching
twenty to thirty million people a year in the early 50's
business was providing about a third of all school materials
this was not a small thing
On top of that is the whole commercial industry like uh...
you know, the standard depiction of unions in the movies, is sort of Marlon
Brando, 'On the Waterfront', you know...
Tough working-class Joes stands up against union bosses and, you know, 
and unions, in fact, were portrayed as...
...as...
something that the workers have to fight against, just as
people have to be liberated to leave New York, workers had to be freed from
the oppression of the unions
and a huge amount of energy and effort was put into this,
it was pretty successful!
The unions tried to combat it
but they couldn't even come close, concentration of capital was so enormous that wasn't even a battle
This picked up again in the...
in the 1970's, was another absurd
foundations tried take over the
educational institutions that, you know, all on professorships and free enterprise
and
glossy
right wing student magazines, very well-funded all over the place and so on
and so forth
It's left
it had an effect
The effect has been 
pretty much demolish civil society
to turn people into what is the 'ideal'
The 'ideal' is very clear
the ideal is a completely fragmented atomized society
where everyone's totally alone
doing nothing but trying to pursue
'created' wants and the ones are created
that's known that they're created, nobody want  those things
You create wants, people are stuck with their television set or, you know, their
interactive, whatever it is,
and...
they're glued to this thing, and they are told what they want, and they have to
want it, they don't want any connection with anyone else, you know, you don't see anybody else, deal with
anyone else, an
atom of consumption
and then you go to work, and lower and lower wages for more and more hours and
less and less benefits in security and a flexible labor market
That's the kind of utopia that
they're looking for and it's
not very far from there
It's led a very strange effects in the country
I mean the country is like a devastated peasant society, you know
You really have to go back to Europe in the...
'black death', i think,
14th century to find anything similar..
People are scared,
angry,
hostile,
hate everything, don't know what they hate
don't have anybody else to talk to, just
angry!
desperate! Their cults all over the place at a scale that is unknown in any other
society,
I mean, you have to...the level of religious fundamentalism alone
is probably the highest in the world
it's almost certain higher than Iran
and that's only one of them, you know
right now the malicious happen to be on the front pages but that's just a tiny
fragment of it, in which there's only not the right to live is the same, you know,
it's across the board,
it's just a dissolved society
very scary
it's...
The importance is ominous, you know, it's... the kind of the situation in which...
kind of a situation which is indeed reminiscent of Germany in the late
30's in a lot of ways, or Iran in the late 70's, you know
very frightening, it's much more frightening when it happens here.
At the same time as a kind of an
it's a kind of organizers dream
you know, people
if you look at people's attitudes they remained social democratic
like, you know, people overwhelmingly believe that
working people ought to have more influence, their don't have enough
That the government ought to help poor people, it's its job
you know,
that people are overwhelmingly opposed to things like budget-balancing, if for
example, it' going to cutdown education or health expenditures and so on across the
board
as I said it doesn't matter because it's irrelevant to policy, they do what they like
but it's a situation in which the opportunities for
organizing and rebuilding a democratic culture are very very high
and it can be done, but it's certainly not going to happen by itself
It's gonna take the same kind of energy and activism that it's taken to...
lift us out of the fuelism and slavery and every other part in the past
The Oklahoma city bombing
and so, bringing the chickens home to roost were unfortunately
there is a little more truth to that than the press is willing to make it out
turned out in this case, remember, in the beginning they're looking for some
middle east connection, and they would have bombed anybody inside if they found it
You could tell that right off...
It didn't work so you're stuck with the
angry white man
and their source of that is extra... is quite real
they have every reason to be angry
there's a lot to be angry about
I'm assuming that the current stories are correct, the
sectors from which this is coming there's plenty to be mad at,
but i don't think people know what to be angry about
what has been created by this half-century of massive corporate
propaganda
is what's called 'anti-politics'
So, anything that goes wrong, you blame the government
well okay, there's plenty to blame the government about
but the government
is the one institution
that people can change
it's the one institution you can affect
by participation without
institutional change, right?
that's exactly why all the anger and fear is directed against the government
The government has a defect
it's potentially democratic.
Corporations have no defect, they are pure tyrannies.
So therefore you wanna keep corporations invisible
and focus all anger on the government
so if you don't like something
you know, your wages are going down, blame the government!
not blame the guys in the 'fortuned  500',  cos you don't read the 'fortune five
hundred'
you know, you just read what they tell you in  the newspapers
So you don't read about the dazzling profits, and the stupendous this, and the wages going
down... All you know is that the bad governments is doing something, so just get
mad at the government
As i say, there's plenty to be mad about the government, but the government is
exactly what Dewey described it as; it's the shadow cast by business over society
if you wanna change something, change the substance not the shadow
and everyone contributes to this
including
the democrats
deeply committed to, you take a look at the Clinton campaign literature
it's like, you know, it's a...
I don't know what public relations firm wrote it
but whatever one did it, understands their business
The thing that they were giving out at of the drugs stories, you know, ten cents
for a mandate for change, as they called it, incidently a slogan that they
borrowed from Eisenhower, which shows how much change they contemplate.
The first chapter of it was called 'Entrepreneurial Economics'
now this is their big economic program
explained how these then. We're not old-fashioned liberals, you know, who live in
entitlements
getting children food eaten, that sort of thing
We are interested in 'Entrepreneurial Economics'. Now you wanna
describe it,
and it's very... Read it carefully!
...very interesting to see how the
mind of the commissar works
you know, the really skilled propagandist
guys that get trained in the good universities
The way it works is like this; 'Entrepreneurial Economics' involves
workers and their firms
So it's all about workers and their firms, you know, anybody who works in a firm can
tell you how much is their firms
so there's workers and their firms and then there's a government which is going
to try to help out the workers and their firms.
There's a couple words that don't appear in it
like 'prophets', you know, 'bosses'
'managers',
they're not investors
banks, they don't appear, just the workers and their firms. There are entrepreneurs
who have a kind of a shadowy existence,  they're sort of nice guys
who live in the slum schools, or somewhere
and every once in a while, they come around and they sort of help out the
workers and their firms and they kind of disappear somewhere
and that's 'entrepreneurial economics'
Well, ok! You know. That's the kind of thing you're told to do in good
universities, to...
put things that way
and that's the democrats
Now, when you get that on one side, and on the other side, you get, you know, i hate the goverment
because they're responsible for everything, and its taxes and
the pointy-headed bureaucrats in Washington, but not the ones in the
insurance offices, you end up with the mood of what is called anti-politics
and anti-politics is a very scary phenomenom
it can take the form of... that it is taking, you know,
forming
what shouldn't be called malicious, because, remember, malicious are things
raised by states
these are just private armies, forming private armies
to defend the country, the people against...  you know, the UN forces being
brought in on the black helicopters by the council on foreign relations to
commit genocide whoever storyline
or else it's, you know, fight against Lucifer and 'beast 66'
who's doing this, that, the other thing
and...
that's what, if you take a look across the country, that's what people are
worried about and fighting against
aliens, you know, the 'Devil',  the UN forces, the Federal Reserve, 
I mean
everything except what's real! Namely
private tyranny, private corporate power,         the guys who were listed in the
'Fortuned 500'
Well, that's an achievement!
that's a propaganda achievement and while the anger and the fear is real, and
it's based on something and you gotta
sympathize with it because it is real
When your wages have dropped 25%  roughly and
say fifteen years and, you know, and your wife has to work, and your kids can't eat and
so on and so forth, you have no future and everything is rotten, you know, there's a lot to be
angry about
but people are not focused on
Let's doing!
That's the difference between the days in which there was alive functioning
Labor Movement that was organizing these people
Exactly these people who work together to change things!
