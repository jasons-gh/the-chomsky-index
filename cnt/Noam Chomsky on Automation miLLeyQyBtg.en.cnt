talk about the future of work in light
of rapid strides in artificial
intelligence and robotics what a jobs
gonna look like in a few years well
first of all it's worth noticing that's
so far at least there is no real
indication that robotics although
they're coming along are having a really
visible effect detectable effect on jobs
if if automation was really having a
major effect you would see it in
productivity the more working people are
replaced by robots the higher
productivity measures productivity is
extremely low it's well below what it
was in the fifties and sixties now this
is coming there's no doubt it could be a
very good thing it could be a very bad
thing depends on how the technology is
handled if automation and robotics
eliminates dangerous boring mind
destroying occupations and frees people
to be more creative independent to
pursue their own interests to enhance
their capabilities even to have more
leisure that's all to the good speaking
of leisure Americans are enormous ly
overworked by Western standards by the
standards have given their the wealth of
society compared with others Americans
work five or six more weeks a year than
Europeans just insane so if robotics
could have all of these effects that's
beneficial but it depends who's gonna
have their hand on the lever that could
easily happen if an organized engaged
activist population has their hand
holding the lever if the hand is private
concentrations of power it's gonna be
deaf
and very ugly but the technology doesn't
care the technology can be used for good
or for ill
