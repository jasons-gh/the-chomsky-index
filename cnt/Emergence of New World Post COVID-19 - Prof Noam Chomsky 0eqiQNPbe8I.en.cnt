Chomsky and their participants good
morning good afternoon and good evening
welcome to our very special webinar on
emergence of new world post Covey 19 and
to speak on this issue we have very
special guest professor Noam Chomsky it
is my privilege to welcome professor
Chomsky on behalf nice and all our
participants from 25 countries who are
watching us from June first you live and
YouTube they were around 1,000 days to
participant who are watching us fire
zoom and Facebook professor Chomsky we
are really honored to have you with us
and we heart will heartily welcome you
to our program I think there is no
English word to express this especial
feeling of 9 thank you sir for a
valuable time this discussion is in
memory of those millions of migrant
workers of South Asia who walked alone
on deserted roads and to those who
certify their lives they were citizen
without a state voters without their
government and migrant workers without
owners then they don't complain but what
it made a few ashamed ashamed of being
citizen of that nation ascend of being
human and ascend of being human of this
21st century I think in in one sense go
of it 19 was an eye-opener to all of us
because it make us awake clearly make
our rule it cleared many of our losses
especially regarding state security
government scientific advancement
international order media and many
others dear participants today every
second is very precious to us we can't
afford to waste even a second
hence we directly move without
conversation with Islam scream I would
like to apologize for the delay so me
the first question for today's what kind
of wall order are going to witness post
curve in nineteen is it going to be a
China DOMA to wall order so what kind of
world will emerge depends on decisions
that are made we are now in a situation
which is somewhat similar to seventeen
years ago the 2003 but that point
there was a major coronavirus epidemic
the SARS epidemic it was contained but
scientists informed us that another
pandemic probably worse was very likely
to come they also explained what could
be done about it what kind of
preparations should be taken essentially
nothing was done and there were reasons
for that we have to explore those
reasons because they still hold today
and if we don't answer those problems a
worse epidemic epic pandemic will recur
almost certainly scientists are saying
the same things today so what happened
it was known how to proceed but it's not
enough to have knowledge someone has to
use it who could use it well there's the
major drug companies that huge resources
enormous profits great laboratories they
could proceed but they're prevented for
by something called capitalist logic you
don't invest in something that is not
profitable it's not worth spending money
on to try to prevent a catastrophe that
might happen in ten years so they don't
do anything well there's the government
oh the government again has great
laboratories enormous resources the
government is in fact responsible for
most of the work on vaccines and drugs
most of the creative work so they could
have done it but that's blocked by
something else the neoliberal principles
which say that government is the problem
not the solution Ronald Reagan's famous
words so for 40 years we've been living
in a system which was announced by
Reagan and Thatcher then implemented by
major private and government power
centers for 40 years
essentially nullify his government oh so
very little was done something was done
but then you get particular cases in
particular countries so when President
Obama was elected he did as soon as he
was elected the first days he called a
there's a presidential scientific
advisory council
he called it into session he requested
that they produce a preparation program
for preparing in case of pandemic comes
because it was anticipated they did it
it was put into operation and it lasted
until January 2017 when President Pro
came into office and the first days in
office he dismantled it and started
defunding the Center for Disease Control
as he did every year that canceled
programs that were of American
scientists working in China with Chinese
scientists on coronaviruses
and result when it finally came the US
was completely unprepared other
countries responded often very
effectively East Asia Oceania and New
Zealand's apparently eradicated it other
countries have it under control the u.s.
the pandemic is raging so the worst in
the world it's gotten to the point where
Europeans have wondered whether the
United States has simply abandoned any
effort to deal with it death rates are
much higher than elsewhere report came
out in one of the major medical journals
just a few hours ago estimating that
probably 80 or 90% of the hundred
thousand deaths could have been avoided
if the President and the government had
taken any action so putting it all
together we have three problems one is
capitalist logic
blocks the drug companies the other is
the neoliberal programs which have
undermined government action the third
is actions of individual governments of
which the United States is far and away
the worst Brazil is not far behind but
other countries have done something
rather than often effectively and that's
what we're facing for next time so we
know what to do with it problem is to do
it
you
you
you
sounded good to the next question you in
the context of India recently in an
interview you said what we are seeing is
the symptoms of fascism without the
fascist ideology what makes you think so
as India claims itself as the largest
them Christian in the world is it
because India is housing millions of
Muslim citizen after labeling them as in
illegal migrants so in the context of
India recently in an interview you said
what we are seeing is the symptoms of
fascism without the fascist ideology
what makes you think so what we're
seeing is in what you see the symptoms
of fascism without the fascist ideology
regarding India yeah that's correct
I mean we're seeing the fascist ideology
was a serious notion way beyond
president Trump sophistication with the
sophistication of the other leaders
around the world who were using showing
fascist symptoms of the fascist symptoms
or things like advocating violence
racism such things but fascism was a
serious ideology it held that the entire
society should be under the control of a
political party the Nazi Party the
fascist party in Italy which would be
led by a maximal leader and we can win
organize and control the entire society
including the business world which was
subordinated to the fascist state now
that's not the world we live in that we
live in almost the opposite world where
governments are subordinated to the
businesses that's particularly true say
for the United States the business world
essentially dominates the government
Trump's policy Trump is tolerated by the
business world even though they don't
like him as long as he makes sure that
the legislative programs every one of
these programs benefits them so if you
take a look at the programs not the
rhetoric but the programs that are
actually implemented like the big tax
cut corporate tax cut the business is
very happy about that
so they'll they're willing to let him
parades on the stage with his antics as
long as he puts the dollars into the
right pockets actually there was a very
dramatic example of that at the Davos
meetings in January every January the
rich and powerful of the world the
Masters of the Universe as they call
themselves the gather in a Switzerland
at a elegant and ski resort to meet each
other you know congratulate each other
on how wonderful they are and so on this
last meeting was interesting January of
course they invited Trump to be the
keynote speaker they don't like him at
all his vulgarity and obscenity this
disrupts their effort to present
themselves as humanistic and
sophisticated and so on so they don't
look like it but they gave him when he
because he described the programs he's
carrying out like an
it's the corporation reaching the very
rich what he does that he'll tolerate
the vulgarity and ugliness of his
general performance so it's not fashion
in fact it's some different thing that's
like what if you look closely if we look
at the different countries they're
somewhat different so in say the United
States and Brazil take the two major
countries in the Western Hemisphere the
government's are turning them into the
kind of small town small-time dictators
that you find in neo-colonial countries
in small countries with as a military
coup of a couple years and the new
dictator is put in but the business
world remains the same that's what's
happening so Trump for example has
virtually eliminated the executive
branch of the government mr. Newman
there's no appointments anymore he
doesn't even send appointments to the
Senate for confirmation quitting it just
takes people who are gonna obey Him one
of the recent things he did was just
what you get in a tin pot dictatorship
is he fired all of the inspectors
general now these are people who are
placed by waited by cono designed by
conquerors to have inspectors who will
investigate and monitor the departments
of the government the Treasury
Department the State Department so on to
make sure that there isn't corruption
malfeasance of one sort or another now
they began looking into the swamp that
Trump has created in Washington so he
just fired them all it's a symptom of
fascism but it's not fascism you find
the same in Brazil no the Parliament and
the courts in Brazil are starting to
look into the enormous corruption of
President Wilson O'Hara's family they
fired the
investigators they didn't back down he's
still doing that's different from the
United States the court is still
independent in Brazil the military coup
is threatened may happen the United
States is a little different take a look
at say yeah Viktor orban's Hungary he's
just turning it into a model of a
dictatorship without affecting business
domination and control again that's
symptoms but not fascism take a look at
Modi's in the end right next to you
pretty much the same story committee I
don't have to tell you you know better
than I do plenty of faction symptoms but
the Senators of private power captain
recently we heard about Alba tragic
mother Floyd the United States how do
you look at this incident is it a mere
accident or incident or situation of
every American has not changed much you
comment on it professor the Floyd yes a
mystery yes
it's very interesting I mean there have
been police killings severe police
beatings before and there were protests
but nothing remotely like this the
closest one is the Rodney King case in
1992 thirty years ago now there were six
days of protests they finally had to
call in federal troops to quell the
disorder 60 people were killed some
major protests but it was in Los Angeles
where it happened now it's totally
different all over the country fact over
much of the world the that has enormous
public support which is very unusual
about two-thirds of the public supports
the protests
that's much more support than Martin
Luther King received at the peak of his
popularity
others even support coming from the top
military command the two left the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
top military officers both proposed
Trump's call for violence and supported
the protests nothing like this has ever
happened it's it's a sign of increasing
consciousness there are many other signs
and awareness of the horrors of 400
years of really vicious repression of
flex which has a bitter legacy there's
it's very late but there's some
recognition of that know what'll come
out of it we don't we never know I mean
there are proposals demands for changes
in police procedure some efforts to go
beyond to the much deeper problems which
go way beyond police you know a lot of
police work is in the black ghettos
because these are high crime areas why
are they are trying areas because people
have no opportunities now they're
suffering from a legacy of literally 400
years of repression
so yes you get crime then you get police
then you get police brutality but just
look at the sources not the symptoms and
there's some moves in that direction but
I think it's a turning point in fact if
you think about the present moment
that's pretty astonishing there's a kind
of confluence of things that are coming
together all at the same time terrible
pandemic the huge protests all over the
country
global warming is extremely threatening
and developing this is increasing threat
of nuclear war which is vivid very
threatening in your area
global warming if it continues on its
present course it's going to make much
of South Asia Asia almost unlivable and
a couple of decades Pakistan and India
are nuclear-armed States which will be
struggling to obtain the reducing
amounts of water it's already very
scarce as the glaciers melt and the
rivers decline both nuclear-armed I mean
all of this together is just a recipe
for complete disaster could happen soon
in the next few decades that one of
these and it's all happening right now
it's all converging it's an incredible
moment of human history and you are
right on the fringes of it
let's move to next question
Nepal lies between two nations are ions
China and India both are economic and
military power of Asia one claims to be
socialist while other a Democrat in this
context how can a small state like Nepal
survive what should win a pause foreign
policy one that claims to be socialist
isn't socialist the one that claims to
be democratic is has elements of
democracy but they're being demolished
by the current government the cover Modi
government is essentially dismantling
Indian secular democracy and turning it
into a racist state so yes Nepal is in a
difficult position the two countries are
in fact almost at war right now
unfortunately the war has been over you
know like you know the wars been kept to
a low level so far that it could burst
out it's what Nepal has to do is take
care of its internal problems as best as
possible
and try to remain neutral when the the
elephants are fighting it's not an easy
position to be in
let's move to the next question sir
Trump came with America first Modi came
with India first there is rise of
nationalism in China and other parts of
the world similar trend is seen even in
a small countries like Nepal we will see
the chances of revival of fascism along
along with the values of muscular
nationalism and fiscal conservatism in
post Cove in nineteen world
how is globalizing going to be affected
well thing I think we should look back
to the effect of 40 years
neoliberalism it's been quite harmful
almost everywhere the policies have been
applied so for example in the United
States by now literally 0.1% of the
population has over 20 percent of the
wealth and a large majority the
population is just getting by from week
to week you get a paycheck on one Friday
maybe he can get by for the next week
that's all nothing nothing saved the
real wages have about what they were in
the 1970s something similar has happened
almost all over the world were the
neoliberal programs have been applauded
like one or another form and it's left
people angry frustrated resentful easy
terrain for a demagogue to come along
and say it's somebody else's fault it's
the fault of the immigrants the Muslims
you know the blacks and somebody the
refugees and that you know people who
are desperate can grab on to that say
okay let's close the borders let's just
work for ourselves let's forget about
the world and you get these pathological
symptoms like ultra-nationalism but
there are also forces combating them and
these forces are not insignificant so
for example very couple of weeks ago
there was the first public announcement
of what's called the progressive
international
International Organization it was
initiated by Bernie Sanders and his
movement in the United States by Yanis
varoufakis and his roof in m25 in Europe
the m25 has been working to try to over
it it's a transnational organization
throughout Europe working to try to
preserve what is sensible and
constructive in the European Union and
to overcome the very serious flaws of
the Union so now they've united they're
gonna have the first meeting in Iceland
a couple of months the prime minister of
Iceland is a member they're bringing in
the voices from the third global South
India Africa Pakistan and other
countries and it's an effort to try to
form a unified international
organization that will be able to
confront the concentrated reactionary
forces that are shattered in the white
house in the United States but include
Modi's in the the dictatorships of the
Gulf look or bonds Hungary other
reactionary forces and question how
effective it will be but it's a
promising development it's important to
remember that all of the major crises we
face know our international that cannot
be a national response to the pandemic
New Zealand can get rid of the virus as
soon as it opens and sporters it's going
to come by and they can't live in
isolation global warming is an
international nuclear war in our
national problem the racism
international all international problems
setting up borders just makes it harder
and harder to try to deal with the
crisis what we should be seeing is the
erosion of borders on something like the
move towards integration in Europe which
was limited that was in the right
direction
so you can go from one country to in
Europe to another to study to work and
so on that's the I mean in a sense that
already happened in the United States
the United States was plural basically
there was a collection of states the
different states interacting one way or
another with a civil war turned it into
a union 1860 made it a unified country
no one country you can go from one state
to another in one country if one state
say that Kansas happens to be suffering
that is you know can't deal with its
economic problems in New York can help
them survive that's automatic in the
federal system now that's what the world
would be like that's very far from there
but that's where it should be moving the
next question is do you find government
all over the world turning more
authoritarian empty people into human on
the eve of pandemic we think that the
socialist alternative are more relevant
do we think that socialist policies
would be relevant sorry I didn't hear
the question exactly say could you spare
do you think the wall is turning more
authoritarian more empty people more
empty human and we think the socialist
alternative are more relevant intensive
are actually both things are happening
it's going in both directions so for
example there's there is a as I said a
progressive international forming space
done very significant
popular movements in the United States
and Europe they're quite active there
are such movements all over the world
not a lot of attention is paid to them
but they're very real so it takes a
Brazil which is moving towards military
dictatorship on the other hand Brazil
has the most appropriate the largest and
most effective popular movement in the
world the landless workers movement
enormous movement taking over long
before years it's been taking over
unused lands owned by major corporations
as great landowners taking them settling
them building cooperative institutions
based on agriculture but also beyond
like dairy dairy production many other
things working to enter into the general
market serve the cities so that's
happening on the one hand move toward
dictatorship than the other you see the
same everywhere almost anywhere you look
so the answer is things are going in
both directions
question is which will prevail it's a
major crisis at the international level
there is on the one hand the progressive
international on the other hand there's
a reactionary international being
crafted from Washington and the White
House the Trump administration includes
both senora's Brazil Modi's in the
LCCC's Egypt
the Gulf dictatorships mvs in Saudi
Arabia
Noor bombs Hungary that's one
constellation Progressive International
is another constellation it's a major
conflict it's going to determine the
fate of the world
the next question sir how has the
foreign policy of United States
transformed the last two decades from
boost Obama to trump farah how
the for equality has transformed Trump
is a very unusual figure he's unlike any
president in American history in fact
anyone ever in the parliamentary system
he basically has no policies and no
ideology except himself is a
narcissistic megalomaniac he is solely
after making sure that he can be McCain
political power and be enriched he's a
good politician he understands how he
can proceed he has a primary
constituency that he has to satisfy or
else they'll kick him out corporate
power and private wealth so he has to
satisfy them and he does what I
mentioned about Davis is an example its
legislative programs are an example so
all the programs that he implements have
to serve them but he has to be voted in
you know the political democracy so he
asked to have a voting base and you
can't come to people and say I'm trying
to destroy you vote for me that doesn't
work so you have to approach people on
other grounds what are called cultural
grounds so racism xenophobia a religion
extremist religion the United States is
a very religious country a Christian
evangelicals who care about nothing but
you know Jesus coming or about 25% of
the population there's an enormous gun
culture everybody a lot of people where
I live in Arizona you have to be able to
carry your assault rifle into the local
coffee shop you know so appeal to people
on those grounds if you look at Trump's
pronouncements
when he's basically trying to instigate
violence every one of them just notice
every one of them says you have to
protect your Second Amendment rights
what's the Second Amendment rights the
right to walk into a coffee shop with
your assault rifle
so that's telling people I'm gonna save
your right to do that I'm going to keep
the immigrants out these rapists and
murderers that are coming from Mexico
I'm going to ensure that your pastors in
church can be openly political in
violation of the Constitution so I'll
give you all of those things so vote for
me
meanwhile I'll make sure that you're in
the worst possible situation that's a
kind of a what's called a confidence man
you have one hand stands up and says I
love you I'm going to protect you the
other hand stabs you in the back and so
far he's gotten away with it pretty well
it's actually declining now people don't
have to read medical journals to know
that the pandemic is being handled
catastrophic ly as they don't know that
80 or 90% of the deaths were preventable
and the booze Trump's malice that cost
you know eighty or ninety thousand
people to die they may not know that but
they know something's going wrong badly
wrong and his support is in fact
declining but it's a very uncertain
situation now he could do know there are
people in high places by now they were
talking openly about the possibility
that he might just declare martial law
nothing like that's happened in American
history this is a unique situation
without precedent in fact something
similar is happening in England the
England has three
50 years of parliamentary democracy it's
not based on laws Britain barely has a
written constitution it's based on trust
that good faith and that's being torn to
shreds when Boer first
Johnson closed the he prorogue to
woman so he could ram through his
proposal for brexit without
parliamentary discussion that was a
gross violation of the whole
constitutional order of three hundred
and fifty years but was finally thrown
out by the Supreme Court but this attack
on the basis of democracy in the two
leading parliamentary democracies
England three hundred fifty years
United States two hundred fifty years
and both of them the basic structure of
democracy is being severely eroded it's
happening elsewhere Brazil Hungary other
countries it's another very serious
problem happening at the same time I
should maybe mention us I presume you
know every January the bulletin of
Atomic Scientists the main scientific
journal the deals with security issues
every year they bring together the
leading scientists political analysts
and do an assessment of the world
situation world security situation and
they encapsulated in a clock called the
Doomsday Clock in which they set the
minute and at hand a certain distance
from midnight midnight me ins terminal
disaster were finished the clock was
established in 1947 after the atomic
bombings that was set at seven minutes
to midnight its oscillated up and back
over the years said every January when
Trump came into office that was moved
forward towards midnight every year he's
been an office it's been moved further
towards midnight last year it reached
the closest point it had ever reached
this year it went beyond the closest
point in fact they abandoned minutes and
moved to seconds
and they had three reasons three basic
reasons one the growing threat of
nuclear war White's serious
Trump has dismantled the arms control
regime which offered some protection
building new weapons and so on that's
increasing the second is global warming
which is a very severe threat don't have
to go through the details but it's
extremely severe and the third is
decline of democracy as are the three
major issues seems at first like they
don't fit together but they do decline
of democracy eliminates the only way
there is to deal with the first two
crises can only be dealt with by an
informed engaged public so if that
declines the other crisis will just
escalate that's the world
we're in that's it's a very almost
situation there's never been anything
like it in human history so the next
question is what will be the fate of
capitalism in post coffee 91 I think
that's again the matter of direct
conflict right now the forces who
created the current system who created
the neoliberal system with all of its
consequences they're working very hard
relentlessly every minute to try to
ensure that it remains and comes even in
a harsher form which mores more
surveillance more control and so on so
again take the Trump administration most
important government in the world the
world dominant government right every
minute they are under the cover of the
pandemic passing legislation which will
make the situation
and more brutal uh just take the latest
case the labor secretary who comes from
a there's a corporate lawyer with a
strong background of opposing labor
rights and naturally he's Labor's
secretary that wall nobody was looking
he passed a regulation that allows
private equity firms to buy into the 401
K system have to explain what this is
part of the neoliberal programs has been
to eliminate pensions so people don't
have security but what they are they
replace pensions by what are called 401k
investments so throw people into the
market you're a victim of market forces
you have no security and it's very
serious
I mean happen with me I don't have a
pension but I have a 401 K so whatever
the market does on the subject to but
nobody knows it has any idea what the
investments are that's way up there with
some banker teaching work so everybody's
in the market we've eliminated fences
now what did Scalia do he said private
equity firms can enter the market for
your 401 k's private equity firms are
predatory institutions of only one
function to take over some business or
something else break it apart and see
how much money you can make out of it
and destroy it so one of the curses of
the neoliberal theory so now they can
enter into what's left of the shreds of
your pensions every time every moment
you look something like this is being
done shortly before that the there was
an executive order saying that the
companies have to be protected if they
force their workers back to work
so suppose some meatpacking company
it's demands that its workers come back
to work I don't know if you've ever seen
a meatpacking plant but it's horrible
pandemic and it'll spread in one second
everybody's standing right next to each
other working like a maniac cutting up
chicken you talk so if they force their
workers back to work they can't and the
workers refuse they can be punished if
they go back to work and get sick the
company is protected from any liability
by government order that's a couple of
weeks ago before that it's something
else other governments reactionary
governments doing the same kind of thing
you know what Indians been doing right
on the surface
so these people are working relentlessly
question is whether counter forces will
develop to make sure they can't get away
with it so we're back to the same
question it's basically class war on an
international scale an enormous scale
one of the classes is very powerful very
wealthy
organized relentless knows exactly what
it's doing problem is will the rest of
the world respond come that's what we're
in the situation we're now and we should
say the last book of mine the title of
it is internationalism or extinction and
I think that's exactly what we face if
we don't move towards a progressive form
of internationalism a human society will
simply be destroyed the next question is
on education what will be the impact of
kovat 19 on education educational system
around the world will the use of digital
technology in education cause further
marginalization of people and countries
what will be the collective goal
response to each of those modulized
communities interesting words pretty
much the same answer that I gave before
so let's be concrete again we'll take
the United States by far the most
important country in the world the
Secretary of Education is Hashem is a
very rich super rich vet falco family
very reactionary strongly opposed to
education public they want to destroy
the public education system turn it into
private education religious schools
schools from the elites vertical charter
schools which take money from the public
and set up privately controlled
institutions and she this is Betty Davos
she is using the cover of the pandemic
to advance this program there's a lot of
stimulus money coming in from the
government that's supposed to go to
people about 80% of it is going to the
corporate system but she's using the
part that goes to education to ensure
that it doesn't go to public schools
when it goes to private schools to try
to undermine public education in the
United States this is a remarkable
development one of the great
achievements of American democracy back
in the 19th century was to pioneer mass
public education you didn't have that in
Europe you didn't have it in England the
United States essentially initiated this
great program that was one of the great
achievements of the United States now
being destroyed by the Trump
administration in the interests of
private wealth and corporate power
that's a diverse Secretary of Education
is the one doing it other countries some
where things are happy
in the country it's a big battle
interestingly in the United States the
labor movement has been pretty much
crushed by the neoliberal programs but
it's reviving and the revival began with
teacher strikes teachers around the
country some of them in very reactionary
states teachers organizing to try to
demand to demand more funding for
schools they're not just calling for
wages that they need that - but funding
for schools so you don't have to have 60
kids sitting in a class you know you're
gonna have properly funded schools you
can have nurses you can have educational
consultants you can have arts all the
things that have been taken away by the
attacks on the public schools so the
teachers now are forming teachers unions
in my own state in Arizona to try to
reinforce the legislature education
works by state Forks the legislature to
fund the education properly and they're
having an impact they have a lot of
public support so again you have the
same battle being waged on the local
scale on the national scale but
everywhere you look and the answer to
what will happen depends on how this
class war turns out
the next question is can the world
really abandon relations with China
considering the vast rate dependency if
not what would be China's political
position in the world in days to come
what will be China's position in the
world yes well there's a lot of talk
about China becoming the next hegemonic
power it's very misleading
China's has had enormous progress in
economic progress in recent years the
poverty has been radically reduced there
are many more educational opportunities
scientific institutions are developing
in some areas China's in the lead in the
world a sustainable energy for example
solar power of windmills electrification
China's way ahead and there is a lot of
talk about it has been for years about
American decline power shifting the Asia
to China and India very unlikely the
China remains a poor country if you take
it at the take a look at the United
Nations Human Development Index which
measures various aspects of the
country's welfare that China's about 90s
I think that India's maybe a hundred and
thirtieth these are poor countries with
very serious problems that's a pretty
recent development incidentally you go
back to the 18th century I tried an
India with the centers of economic power
and social advancement they were subject
to imperial conquest which devastated
them they're now sort of coming back but
they have a long way to go
I take a look at one of the measures of
standard measures of power in the world
is gross domestic product
how much is produced
in the country it's a very misleading
measure and these days of neoliberal
globalization that that measure doesn't
mean much a much more reasonable measure
is how much of world wealth is owned by
multinational corporations in a
particular country so how much of world
wealth is owned by corporations based in
the United States the answer to that is
spectacular 50% 50% of world wilf is
owned by us-based multinationals and
almost every category they are first
sometimes second retail you know in
industry agriculture Commerce the first
almost everywhere that takes a China the
China is the source of production for
most of the world if you have an iPhone
it was put together in China China gets
almost nothing from that and barely gets
any of the profit now much of the profit
goes to Taiwan because the Taiwanese
companies like Foxconn are organizing
production for Apple Corporation in
China the vast majority the vast
majority the profit comes to the United
States to the Apple Corporation which
has the design the development the
management and so on so trying to get
something Taiwan gets more the United
States gets most of it now that's what
you find in industry after industry that
aside China has an India also have very
severe problems that the West doesn't
have demographic problems ecological
problems lack of
agricultural resources very serious
problems so I think China is surely
gonna be a major power in the world but
it's not gonna be dominant in fact if
you look at the military dimension the
United States is so far ahead that's
that nobody's even in the game the
United States out spins the 10 most
following countries out spends them
together spends almost as much as the
rest of the world
technologically much more advanced it's
declining Trump is very seriously
harming the United States it's becoming
a pariah state Europe it's like other
countries hate it he's very seriously
harming the United States but even Trump
can't destroy a country that's that
powerful other countries may look you
take a look at the the international
press today one of the lead stories New
York Times other papers is that Europe
cannot understand why the United States
is giving up any effort to deal with a
pandemic in almost every other countries
doing important things the United States
is just letting it rage in my own state
where I live Arizona the governor who's
a Republican has lifted the lockdown
because Trump says you have to sow
coronavirus cases are spiking snow the
worst in the country
it's as if Europe is looking at this and
saying it's as if the country has gone
crazy they're not even trying to deal
with a major crisis that are they killed
a hundred thousand people they just want
to let it rage and get worse what's
happening to that country so it's losing
fact admiration Europe the rest of the
world hates a lot of things they're
doing but they're afraid if the United
States gives an order they follow it you
see this over and over that takes a you
ran the joint agreement on the nuclear
program was working very effectively US
intelligence agreed everybody agree
Trump destroyed it cuz the only thing he
can think of doing is wrecking things so
he destroyed it imposed very harsh
sanctions on Iran the United States is
the only country in the world that can
impose sanctions fact about a quarter of
the world is under US sanctions and when
the u.s. imposes sanctions
everybody has to obey them Europe does
hates them but they have to obey them
though they get thrown out of the
international financial system so Europe
doesn't like the sanctions they can't do
anything about they have to abide by
them other countries too another sign of
us power
I just Trump is trying desperately to
find some way to cover up for the fact
that he's responsible for killing tens
of thousands of Americans he doesn't
want people to see that obviously so
he's trying to blame it on somebody else
one of the targets was the World Health
Organization so he's now trying to
pulled out of the World Health
Organization tried to destroy it what
does that mean pulling out of the World
Health Organization what does it mean to
people in Africa or in Yemen who depend
on World Health Organization services
for survival mama they're suffering from
all kinds of epidemics even before the
Quran virus it's support they're getting
us from the World Health Organization so
here's this maniac in Washington who in
order to improve his electoral prospects
is deciding to kill
murder uncountable numbers of people in
Africa and Yemen and the worst
humanitarian crisis of the world other
poor countries nobody can do anything
about it because this country has the
hammer that can beat you on the head but
we didn't do anything horrible situation
till it changes in the United States
it's gonna be extremely dangerous for
the whole world but who's doing anything
about it
nobody very much too dangerous
that's the answer of the question
whether China will be the hegemonic
power not a lot to criticize in China
they do a lot of really rotten things
but they don't have the power with
health or nation we have another
question how do we see the role of
multilateral institutions in post covin
19 1 order collateral institutions well
I mentioned the World Health
Organization Trump administration's
trying to destroy it
what about the United Nations I think
this goes back to the beginning of the
neoliberal period I mean the United
States basically created than the United
Nations but since Reagan it's trying to
destroy it the United States stopped
stopped paying its dues some parts like
UNESCO just refuses to pay anything if
any part of the United Nations doesn't
follow us orders the United States at
the most ever since ever since Reagan
Clinton's was the same take something
else the TIC what's happening in Israel
Palestine very interesting the United
States came out with lytic
the greatest deal of the century it's
devastating rights it gives the
ultra-right and Israel everything they
want suppose somewhere that immediately
since it came from the United States it
became the basis for international
discussion so all international
discussion now is how do we how can we
fix up the greatest deal of the century
suppose some other country had come out
of that suppose China had produced it or
Germany or France or India there's
nobody who even looked at it they would
have left they even bothered with did
you throw it or not the United States
comes well you have to obey it that's a
sign of power just like the sanctions
and everything else I've mentioned
that's in other words the way the world
works it's kind of like the Mafia
there's a godfather
everybody has to obey otherwise you're
in trouble
world is not very far from there the
political scientists international
relations experts have a much prettier
picture make it look nice but if you
look at the way the world actually works
pretty much resemblances there are
international institutions they work
only and so far that's the great powers
permit them to and the most important of
them is the United States we have lots
of question but I know it's almost
midnight in Arizona so let's end with
the last question is there the
possibility of second cool who between
China and the United States like let me
do a hot sorry but the sounds dirty of
second Cold War between
and the United States different word
cold war cold war like Soviet and United
the steps have USSR United States had
cold war so cold war we can very
confidently predict that they're not
going to go to war that's the most
confident prediction you can make the
reason is if you turn out to be wrong
there won't be any around anybody around
to say anything about it so it's a safe
prediction but will it happen it could
if you look look over the record of the
last 70 years carefully there's no time
to do it now but it's a virtual miracle
that we survived just by accident over
and over we've come to time very close
to war as the military systems grow and
expand as they're doing now both Russia
and the United States mostly Trump's
initiative and as they move to more
automated control systems using
artificial intelligence to control the
response systems the danger goes up so
it just purely by accident it might
happen it's come very close in the past
sometimes also by just reckless actions
of governments conclude through that but
often just literally thousands of times
by accident so it's a very hazardous
situation the arms control regime has
somewhat protected it the INF treaty
intermediate nuclear forces treaty in
Europe signed by Reagan and Gorbachev
that significantly reduced the threat of
war
hence nuclear war in Europe the Open
Skies treaty initiated by President
Eisenhower
reduced the threat that one of the two
powers would mistake what's happening in
the other and go to war by a
first-strike reduced it trump has
demolished both of them the only one
that's left is the New START treaty
which will keep a lid on the number of
nuclear weapons that the two nuclear
states have that Russia has been asking
for a year to renegotiate it the White
House has been refusing they finally
agreed a couple of days ago but only by
imposing an impossible condition that
China has to join doesn't make any sense
the number of Chinese weapons is way
below the minimum that the treaty can
reach so to bring insists that China
comes in is just to say let's block it
somehow factor Russia responded by
saying well if China comes in why not
France they have more men more nuclear
weapons in China so these are just ways
of preventing it from happening and if
that treaty isn't signed it's due next
February there's no more lunch control
system so the danger of shortly
increases United States builds more
advanced weapons Russia will build more
advanced weapons to counter them and
here we are going off of the outer space
so it's it's a very threatening
situation that's why the Doomsday Clock
shifted two seconds not minutes because
we're moving closer to termination
and meanwhile pull the rice caps are
melting the and our glaciers were
threatened sea level rise will make most
of Bangladesh underwater what happens
then temperatures are rising to almost
agreed centigrade in parts of India what
happens then comes unlivable that's all
going on there's a monitor of the number
of carbon dioxide particles in the in
the atmosphere it's done by a major
institution in the United States they
just came out with their latest analysis
school keeps going up escalating the
there was a slight effect of the
pandemic it was so slight couldn't even
register their warning that if we don't
change this soon we might approach the
level of three and a half million years
ago when sea levels were fifty to eighty
feet no twenty meters higher than today
I mean not imaginable and this doesn't
happen in one step it comes step by step
so that's the situation we're afraid
today
I've belief yes
