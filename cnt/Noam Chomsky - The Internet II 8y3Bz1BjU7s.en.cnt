well let's take a look at the Internet
the internet was developed for about 30
years completely by the public in all of
the software the hardware you know the
satellites I mean everything about it
was completely within the public domain
the packaging systems all the designs in
fact they don't the only part that
wasn't created by the public in the
United States was created by the public
in Europe the basic ideas for the
worldwide web came out of CERN you know
the international laboratory in Geneva
which is again a international
government laboratory that's virtually
the whole story after about 30 years of
this just right now last two or three
years it's handed over to private power
so yeah Bill Gates who was difficult
parasite you know kind of watching on
the outside absolutely no interest now
wants to take over the internet is
heading to do it and the private power
is not keep being secret about what they
intend to do what they wanted to do is
take this system developed at public
expense initiative of India's technology
and so on and use it for two purposes
one purpose is for what's called an
intranet that is to carve out big pieces
of it which are simply used for purposes
of corporate transactions so if General
Electric wants to have you know
interactions between its office and you
know New York Zurich or whoever they are
you know andand and so on they'll have
this closed system with firewalls so you
can't break into it and I'll just be for
them and similarly for other big
corporations other major private
tyrannies
so that'll be a large part of the public
system and the rest of it is supposed to
be used this kind of like a home
marketing service to try to turn people
into passive consumers you know you and
the tube that
the social unit on which society is
constructed so you don't have to worry
about interacting thinking people doing
really bad things like those folks in
the slums of Porto press a couple of
years ago but they'll people will be
passive and obedient and hooked on
consuming for themselves not caring
about anyone else and then you really
won't have to worry much about the Dane
the threat of democracy which that's the
idea
meanwhile massive propaganda and the
ideological institutions tells you'll
search of teaches you all sorts of
mantras and so on and so forth that's
pretty much the way the story works I
think at any point where you look at it
in detail so anyhow my suggestion is
take this slogans and look at them you
know take them apart see what they
actually mean when you look at them in
practice where do they work where don't
they work how do they work what are the
results and you find a picture that's
very very different from the
conventional
