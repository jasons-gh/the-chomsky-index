now in one of our previous conversations
you mentioned that theory is not really
of an interest to you nor do you think
that it's useful at times for practical
application and attempting to combat and
change these systems of power however
one of the more wide-ranging left
intellectuals of our time
Slava jiseok takes almost the exact
opposite approach to his work he draws
on the work of Derrida Lacan and various
others to illuminate his critique of
global capitalism Empire ideology and so
forth can you talk about why you
personally haven't written more books on
say political or economic or social
theory and then what are your thoughts
on Slava ggx work as with regards to how
much of it you're aware of or have read
or engage with and then his use of
French psychoanalyst lakhan's work and
then of course any words on derrida's
work deconstructionism in that legacy
well but what you're referring to is
what's called theory and the reason when
I said I'm not interested in theory what
I meant is I'm not interested in
posturing using fancy terms like hollow
syllables and pretending that theory
when you have no theory whatsoever so
there's no Siri in anything stuff not in
the sense of theory that anyone will
commit here within the sciences or any
other serious field try to find in all
of the work you mentioned some
principles from which you can deduce
conclusions that yield the directly
testable propositions where it all goes
beyond the level of something you can
explain in five minutes to the
twelve-year-old see if you can find that
when the one fancy words are decoded I
can so I'm not interested in that kind
of contouring this is an extreme example
of it I don't see anything in what he's
saying Jacques Lacan actually knew
I'm kind of like good we have got
meetings every once in awhile but I
thought it frankly personal quite
frankly if I was a total sho just
posturing before the television camera
isn't the way many Paris intellectuals
do why this is influential I haven't the
slightest idea I don't see anything
there of it should be that that should
be intellectual so maybe you can tell me
why you think it's there's something
significant I don't see it oh yeah I'm
not interested in that kind of the
theoretical posturing which has no
content and would you I mean I think it
would be interesting for a lot of folks
particularly because this work has
become more and more popular I remember
just hearing ggx name a few years ago
and then now when I go into different
organizing circles or if I go to
different events or protests or rallies
or so forth assemblies I hear his name
and his work being brought up often it
seems you just recently had a
conversation with Angela Davis Vijay
Prashad of course moderated the
conversation in Boston and I would like
to see more of those conversations take
place even from say folks coming from
different angles people such as yourself
and say someone as Slava Dziedzic who
whose work is becoming more influential
are those things they do you think
that's helpful to have those maybe not
even debates but at least conversations
with people on the Left who are
providing work for people who do find it
influential I mean do you think this is
something we should think about well you
say his work is becoming influential I
wouldn't question that but I think his
posturing is becoming influential can
you tell me what the work I can't find
it I'm actually a lot of the kind of a
historian you know he's a good actor he
makes it sounds exciting but can you
find any content I can't I would have no
interest in having a conversation with
and when I suppose it's
the converse is true as well I imagine
what a discussion with Angela Davis is
fine she's an interesting person expect
things as important things to say it's
done interesting things
