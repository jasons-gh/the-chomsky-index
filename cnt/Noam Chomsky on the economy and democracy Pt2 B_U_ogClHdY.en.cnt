welcome back to the real news network
we're in Cambridge at MIT with Professor
Noam Chomsky thanks for joining us
so in the first segment of our interview
we talked about what a what a Chomsky
supported economic plan might look like
which has to do with considering the
public stakeholders I guess and not just
consumers and and how what that might
mean in terms of banking and and
democracy and and as we get into the
issue of democracy let's what do you
think in fact is going to happen here
the by that I mean the current plans for
the financial sector the auto sector the
general stimulus plan one do you think
they're going to work and if they're not
going to work what are we heading into
in terms of the intensity of the crisis
and what does that mean in terms of
American democracy I don't think anybody
knows whether they're going to work the
it's kind of shots in the dark the
general and I don't have any particular
incident it my guess is that it's not
going to be the Great Depression but
that there may be some difficult years
ahead and a lot of patchwork if the
current policies are pursued now the
crucial core of current policies is keep
the institutional structure stable same
structure of authority domination
decision-making from the top you know
public has a role you know it's gonna be
consumers that you can rent yourself to
it it's cool getting a job you can put
up the money to bail out I can grow up
the money to bail it out but you're not
part of the decision-making apparatus
there there's almost certainly in fact
certainly will be some form of
regulation I mean the deregulation mania
of the past thirty years based on real
really fundamentalist religious concepts
about efficient markets that's pretty
much gone and it went very fast so it
takes a Lawrence Summers there's no that
chief practically the chief economic
adviser has got to rebuild a regulation
system
the kind he destroyed a few years ago he
was in the lead and blocking Congress
from regulating derivatives and other
exotic instruments under the influence
of these pretty much smashed ideas about
efficient markets and rational choice
and so on all right that that much is is
really shattered and there will be a
reconstruction of some regulatory
apparatus but the his history of this is
pretty clear and understandable
regulatory systems tend to be taken over
by the industries that they're
regulating that's the way it work with
the railroads and so on and it's natural
you know they have power concentrated
power concentrated capital enormous
political influence they pretty much run
the government so it ends up with them
taking over control of the regulatory
apparatus in their own interest and it
may work you know so for example during
the many economists called the Golden
Age of modern state capitalism roughly
1950 to the mid 70s there were no huge
crises and there was a regulatory system
there was regulation of capital flows of
exchange rates and so on and it led to
the greatest peacetime growth in history
it stopped in the changed in the mid 70s
when the economy moved towards
deregulation and financialization huge
amount increase in flows of speculative
financial capital mythologies about
efficient markets and there was growth
of course but it was highly concentrated
in a few pockets and we've been through
30 years of the relative stagnation and
real wages for majority
how does any of that going to change
with the stimulus plan that was enough
in the stimulus plan that's going to do
anything about stagnant wages it no in
fact it's not well you know it's
actually there's a slight there's a
slight redistributed aspect in tax
policy very slight it
called you know socialism communism and
so on but it barely gets back to what it
was a few years ago on the other hand
the the best way to lead to a more
egalitarian system would be simply to
permit unionization unions traditionally
have not only improved the lives and
benefits and working conditions of wages
of workers but they have also helped
democratize a society they are one of
the few means in which nowhere new
people can get together and make plans
in influence public choices and so on no
that's not being pursued in fact rather
in fact it's kind of interesting it's
almost been driven out of our minds
there was a dramatic example of that a
couple of weeks ago President Obama
wanted to show his solidarity with
working people so he went to Illinois
and talked at an industrial plant the
choice was striking he chose caterpillar
now he had to do that over the
objections of church and human rights
groups because of the devastating effect
that caterpillar machines are having in
the israeli-occupied territories where
they're wiping out agricultural land
destroying olive groves and villages and
so on but nobody for Agassi noticed
something even more dramatic when
caterpillar has a role in US labor
history caterpillar was the first plant
in general and generations to bring in
scabs to destroy us right now that's
that was I think 1988 sort of part of
the Reagan attack on labor but this was
the first invest riyal
installation to do it now that's a huge
important fact at that point the United
States was alone along with South Africa
and permitting anything like this
that essentially destroys the right of
Association for working people the
employee Free Choice Act which is
supposed to be something that's going to
facilitate unionization we haven't heard
much about it from since since the
election didn't hear much about it we
didn't hear anything when Obama went to
the plant which is the symbol of
destruction of Labor by unfair practices
because this has been driven out of
people's minds the employee free choice
act is always misrepresented it's
described as an effort to avoid secret
elections it's not that it's an effort
to allow workers to decide whether this
should be for secret elections instead
of leaving decisions entirely in the
hands of employers who can use card
check if they want you know secret
election but workers can too that's what
the Act would now on the campaign trail
Obama talked about it but it's steadily
receded into the background and that
would be a big that would be a much
bigger step towards overcoming the
radical redistribution to the top that
took place in the last thirty years
would simply be to ease the efforts at
unionization now you know every recent
president since Reagan has attacked this
I mean Reagan straight-out told
employers we're going to apply the law
so a firing of workers for illegal
firing for organizing I think tripled
according to Businessweek during the
Reagan years when Clinton came along it
was basically a different device it's
called NAFTA NAFTA provided employers
with a wonderful means to prevent
organizing just put up a big sign saying
Mexico transfer operation it's illegal
but if the government's an outlaw
government you can get away with it and
the Bush years don't have to talk about
but you could reverse this and that
would be a significant step towards not
only slightly reversing the enormous
redistribution of income to the top but
also democratizing the society by
providing mechanisms by which people can
act politically in their own interest
but you know that's so far at the
margins it's barely being discussed and
things like say stakeholder control of
institutions workers and community
though it's not it's it's not deep and
people it's not much below the surface
in people's minds is being pushed to the
side now if you look back at the 1930s
when you know maybe they closed it it's
not the same but it's rather similar
issues were arising what really struck
fear into the hearts of the business
world were the sit-down strikes that's
when you start when business started
talking about the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses and so on now what's
the threat thing about a sit-down strike
why am i sit down strike is just five
seconds before the idea emerges why
should we sit here when I run the
factory that we can do it probably do it
better than the managers again because
we know how it works now that's
frightening and it's beginning to happen
just a month ago there was a sit-down
strike in Chicago plant Republic windows
and floors I think was called the
multinational at home didn't wanted to
close it down or move it somewhere or
something and the workers they
demonstrated protested you know I'm so
on but finally there was a sit-down
strike well they sort of half won they
didn't completely win a lot of them kept
their jobs different company bought it
but didn't move on to the next step
the next step is well why shouldn't we
run the plant along with the community
which cares about it and maybe a broader
community which also cares
the general public well you know those
are issues that really ought to be
discussed in the next segment of our
interview let's let's take this
conversation what American democracy
might look like in the next few years
especially if the second AMA crisis
continues to unravel please join us for
the next segment of our interview with
Noam Chomsky
there are times when reality just
asserts itself in spite of the haze
created by television news and
entertainment
sometimes crisis rips a tear in the
fabric of myth and propaganda now a
profound economic crisis has ripped
asunder the American Dream itself
millions of people losing jobs and homes
they lacked proper health care and any
real sense of security since 2001
workers wages have fallen or remained
stagnant
even though worker productivity has
risen almost 33% by 2006 the top 1% of
households were receiving 23% of all
pre-tax income more than double what it
was in the 1970s it's the greatest
concentration of income since 1928 as
unemployment rises we need to know why
this crisis is happening and what we can
do to defend ourselves why are wages so
low why is the society so laden with
debt is it in ordinary Americans
interest to have a trillion dollar
military budget to project the power
across the globe
corporate television news won't ask
these questions let alone try to find
answers only a truly independent news
network can tackle these questions with
courage and with ordinary people's
interests in mind
we need a news network that's
independent of corporations governments
and political parties we need the real
news but there won't be a real news
network unless we raise substantial
funds right away the current financial
crisis has hit our funding hard together
we do have the power to turn it around
there are already hundreds of thousands
of people watching the real news every
month if everyone pitches in we can
build an Internet and cable television
network that will change the face of
media forever you can organize house
parties talk to friends at school and at
work send email blasts and spread the
word distribute this video to everyone
you know pick up the phone and call a
few friends and suggest they visit the
real news calm
invest just 10 minutes a day to ask
friends and colleagues to join the
campaign to create a truly independent
source of internet and television news
together we can build this network just
50,000 people at $10 a month gets us to
our first level of sustainability you
can help us reach this goal and when we
do we'll move to television in millions
of homes across North America help us
reach an audience in the millions please
