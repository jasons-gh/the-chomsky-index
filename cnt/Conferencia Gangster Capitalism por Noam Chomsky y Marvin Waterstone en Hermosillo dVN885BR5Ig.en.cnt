Sundays as we have Mexico world is one of the most complex Andean 
joint border makes 350 million dollars generated annually and houses more 
of 14 million people including 26 greene 
indigenous groups as we speak there are more than a million people who already 
crossed the border legally or illegally and it is estimated that that 
around half a million people cross the mexico-united states border 
and mexico has not stopped sharing we share ecosystems of three rivers 
huge including the colorado river countless human resources and 
economic and we also share the risks of economic change and 
global environmental professor professor chomsky and marvin are here to 
share with us a little bit of your good common sense about 
of the implications of global capitalism for situations that concern 
both of our countries the doctor songs which is one of the 
most cited intellectuals in political philosophy and cognitive psychology of the 
world has received many international and national awards and has 
various honorary doctorates from leading universities including our 
own having introduced the concept of universal grammar which is something that 
underlies every language in the world is one of the founders in 
modern linguistics is currently professor of the emae kings of the issue and 
since 2016 he is a member of the faculty of the university of arizona 
Dr. Marvin Waterson is Professor Emeritus at the University of Arizona. 
former director of the comparative studies literary links of the 
university of arizona with education in biology psychology and geography 
professor waterstone's his studies focus on notions of hegemony and 
common sense and connects these ideas with progressive change and the and the changes in 
general maintains these issues such as environmental management and management and change 
climate the school of sonora wants to thank the science school 
University of Arizona Social Sciences Index See the Social Justice Index of 
university of arizona and the college of sonora please welcome us to 
both protective doctors jones and martin works 
so thank you it's a pleasure to be here today I would like to thank the 
sonora school for its hospitality which has been very very 
very warm with a great welcome it's great to be here at the university 
sonora I appreciate the opportunity to speak to 
it is incredible to be back here in Hermosillo I hope to come more 
followed [Applause] 
before it grows more and more difficult to control 
the title you see up here I think is an amalgamation of some phrases that 
we were in a course that professor chomsky and I offered at the university 
zone but we present it via video conference to 
sonora school and we were very very happy to share with some 
of the students who were in that course a little before this lecture 
with the title that comes this this title this the way it was built 
this course is a course that tries to identify underlying causes and 
connections between the thousands of problems we have right now and the 
purpose of the course is largely to clarify these problems that 
seem separate from each other actually are today connected between 
them and should be a basis for political action computes an element of 
think where we are right now not present in this industrial age that was 
industrial which is supported by capitalism 
and some problems with the border these dreams and Mexico and I want to leave 
Of course, in particular where we are 
of crisis but also of but it is a time of unique opportunities and with 
that's going to start talking a little bit about the idea that is capitalism won this 
I think this phrase explains itself but I want to say explain something before 
continue before I get there I want to talk about 
very brief way about the kutxa of the historical trajectory that has 
brought to this particular moment and that is to think about period that we can of 
mark by the dates that you can see here on the screen as approximately 
40 and 15 to 70 before neoliberalism are sometimes in this 
period is called regulated capitalism sometimes it's also called as 
liberalism to annex is also called the golden age of capitalism 
depending on your disposition towards capitalism it is also referred to as 
a capitalism with a big human face and this is the period in which 
there is a there is a great negotiation between 
capitalisms and those of labor but I want you to know that in this photo 
is that this is capitalism with the gloves on 
I am going to contrast these with capitalism with gloves or without 
gloves so in this period in terms of the global economy 
we can think of the bretton woods system that was designed by the 
they won the second world war as a system that controls and for 
regulate international trade and international development a number 
large institutions that we already know emerged from the bottom of the system a 
global international home the general tariff agreements that later 
followed the last world trade organization after headquarters 
of these financial institutions that now largely and particularly in 
the period we are talking about I have 35 to 50 controlled 
mostly controlled what was happening in the world economy there was 
changes in fixed currencies the system was backed by gold gold 
backed the dollar which was the international currency was 
moderately open in a moderately open economy that had some 
sense not a world economy moderately this way allowed 
movement so the book so to speak I'll talk about it in a moment 
it also allowed and allowed foreign direct investment and the U.S. by far 
in the largest political and economic identity there was and many of the 
arrangements made in these periods favored the development of the us and 
its economy not in these systems this one allowed large investments we are going to 
say that it also allowed the colonization of the states but at the 
same time led to the problems we have now is that it also opened 
those to the US markets to Europe markets and allowed 
strong growth in capitalist economies around the senate of 
these of this set of contradictions several problems began to emerge 
between capital and labor among various sectors of capitalism among it 
money from the us and capital from around the world and this started in a 
decrease in profit the capitalists began to gain so 
slower there were several recessions so this called for a new model to 
capital accumulation and this model is what we think of as the period 
neoliberal a new model on how the world economy should be managed to 
maximize the return on capital this is a period that dates from the 70s more or 
less until the problem of the crisis of 2008 more or less out there but in effect 
this is what puts the period acceptably this important points of the 
liberalism is that ideas had already been 
specifically or not since the 40s there was an organization called the 
montpellier society very remarkable very economical very iconic like freddy 
years but the ideas were there but they didn't start to gain value until like 
until the 70s are more or less two and then there they took off in very 
very remarkable way in a world political sphere of administration of 
ronald reagan and after the administration of his counterpart in which 
the man is there and the idea was to free 
to entrepreneurs or the entrepreneurial skills of individuals 
this is entrepreneurship is something very important of neoliberalism 
I hope 
within an institutional framework characterized by 
strong private property rights free markets in quotes with 
scared quotes said 
free trade trade again in quotes because none of these 
markets are free and trade is not free either but they are 
influenced by the states very strongly at all levels the economy 
global is characterized by the removal of barriers to 
movement of goods services capital and money across national borders 
but very important, in a majority way, is to maintain the workforce 
in place that is the labor force remained where it should be is 
say people could move looking for the best salary and so there were problems 
so then this is something very important of neoliberalism 
the role of the state broadly with things the following things create 
and preserve an institutional framework that is appropriate for activities and 
practices just described to ensure quality and integrity 
of monetary systems 
establish police military defenses and legal structures to ensure 
private property insurance is very important for forces and it is necessary 
for markets to function properly 
privatize and bring to the market anything from the city or the 
society this environmental things environmental pollution controls everything 
if the markets in these areas did not exist then they must be created 
then by state actions if necessary these are areas of the economy 
that they cannot simply be left adrift they must be made to submit to the 
market so that they finally produce something any other action of the 
been any other action is illegitimate like 
you will notice it in a moment more when we mention it there are many functions that 
we can think of as properly a civilized state lacking that 
list or they're not on that list 
to be a little bit more specific the role of the economy in the state includes 
some of these kinds of things the aggregate demand waiver that's what 
that the regulatory period of capitalism was about if there was not the 
enough demand in the economy to take all production and increase 
then where capitalism was involved then the state was 
involved 
also a significant form of this kind of song ism in the in the good 
minutes science nismo militarized spending large amounts of money on the 
military in some way or another and instead of 
to handle demand there was a policy movement to provide 
subsidies lower taxes on the richest and the fury is that all the wealthy 
because they benefited and the regulation of industries 
basic is to release the deregulation of the financial sector is 
say to move 
to increasingly risky actions the weakening of the regulation of the 
product safety for consumer safety at work 
of environments weakening anti-trust forces that is to say that we 
carry agglomeration monopolies from the seventies onwards in almost 
any sector of the economy there are fewer and fewer corporations than 
they control almost all the activity in this sector privatization icon and doing 
contracts for public goods and services in mexico you know that 
one of the key examples of this is the change in the law regarding the ejidos 
that for a long time were common goods but in this period the 
ability to privatize them something very important was done 
finally cut its removal from all social welfare programs 
later we will talk a little more about that so we are in a period that many 
professors call it gangster capitalism 
generally following the crisis of 2007 2008 or the financial collapse 
normally called global collapse there are some exceptions such as 
china that did very well even during that period 
and a very wild greed especially in the richest assault on all 
citizen common property institutions that have no right to ex 
expect help from the state these are characteristics that I think are 
now coming out in production on gas capitalism or 
in capitalism gas the dominance of financial capital over all others 
sectors which leads us to chronic capitalism an insight 
deep or privatization of all elements of society 
war instead of a war against poverty we have a war against 
poor and against the vulnerable a massive production of populations 
surpluses the more capital moves to finance rather than to 
productive economy labor is being destroyed at precipitous rates 
very large so labor is no longer needed then they no longer serve as 
consumers then they are no longer really good for anything now I'm going to 
use the free trade agreement as an example of what I'm saying about 
moment of neoliberalism this i want i want to see the purposes of naphtha those 
real and those that were explained and that we are now in renegotiation have 
seven specific goals when it went into effect in 94 the first was 
introduce you to signatories and a better nation state eliminate 
barriers and facilitate the movement between borders of goods and services 
now again no labor once and promote conditions of a 
fair or fair competition and increase investment opportunity 
investment provide protection and enforce property rights create 
procedures for solving commercial disputes this is a point 
Central to all of these agreements are protections for investors and 
arbitration mechanisms are usually very secret they are kept they are kept 
within the confines of those of the actors 
of trade and only remain with investors and no one else and 
finally establish a framework for multilateral regional cooperation 
trilateral to expand the benefits of these trade agreements here I 
I am going to make a little bit controversial what it says because the true objectives 
the true objectives i would say that the true objectives of the tlc are 
free American corporations from the laws that protected the 
workers and the environment to prepare the way for the agenda 
neoliberal in the us and elsewhere including privatization 
of public services the deregulation of finances and the destruction of 
independent trade union syndic movements these are the 
real goals and have been very successful so let's look at the shortcomings of 
naphtha 
job loss in the us difficult to estimate these but but the estimated 
current of those of the political institutes 
what is bipartisan which is an analytical group is very difficult it is difficult 
to designate but to estimate but between half and a million lost jobs 
particularly from california and from factory jobs there are some 
increases in jobs but fewer months paid less wages this and with 
more precarious conditions mostly services and at the border after 
suppression of wages and intimidation of workers more through 
threats by corporations to seize what you want you don't go if you don't 
have if they don't have many fixed expenses they can is to threaten to leave or 
if they do so they can have a very disciplinary effect on labor 
it is simply the threat is very disciplinary this has happened in those 
three countries the way the suppression for example even today the workers of 
Mexico earns 30 percent less than Americans even when I eat 
we compare housing costs or living costs farmers 
Mexicans eliminated them from business poverty rural poverty were created 
products required us imported products from us and this created many 
rural promises and this created a lot of immigration and these are 
they went to rural areas sorry urban and these were absorbing this the 
urban parts observing a large part of these people I don't know why that happens 
but then the most recent estimated 1.3 million farmers 
they lost their farmers lost their jobs 
2 points 9 million Mexicans were living in the U.S. in 95 during the 
tlc I am going to jump the other numbers but not go to this in 2014 there were 5.8 
Millions of Mexicans living in the United States, which is more or less double than when 
instituted the tlc 
this also led to the militarization of the border, great loss of life 
policies of those pieces of immigration and that we still have them to this day 
from today 
a high in the maquiladora industry 
and working conditions its standards very low workers wages 
vulnerable and the maquila had more or less employed 30 percent of 
the Mexican workforce a huge impact finally a whole set of 
environmental effects environments from pesticide business mining practices 
of deforestation etcetera these are [Music] 
it's a very schematic and illustrative list but a lot so we talk 
a little bit let me talk a little bit about the general effects of capitalism 
good guys an effect is that we see everywhere now it's a race to 
down 
that is to say either in wages in environmental protection in health 
occupational in any sector you want to think about is part of what 
called a spatial arrangement of capitalism and capitalisms 
need this different supplies of labor or product accesses to 
other markets then you're looking for those places where you're going to maximize your 
profitability they will not look where wages are higher they will not look 
where there are many environmental regulations they will not look for places 
where resources are more expensive so this is what a career takes 
down with capitalism this is what is threatening to push 
all downwards so there is an inequality in income and wealth these 
inequalities have dramatically increased and impacts on the 
wellness and health environmental effects including climate change 
Like a god 
as we see the damage that fossil fuels are creating this a 
weakening the position of labor everywhere these effects of 
disciplines action discipline session i.e. discipline the workforce 
enormously the commercialization and privatization of everything including 
importantly it is again it is very important in many parts of the world 
including indigenous knowledge and some practices that is to say also things 
of intellectual copyright patents when everything becomes part of a 
system where everything can be put on the market the important things have been done 
things that have been done through millennia millions million years now 
you can bring economic instability to the market and they were 
and the interesting thing from before is that there was an economy very stable economic 
important and now from the 70s onwards now we see 
a catastrophic instability in the economy including the peso crisis 
94-95 in the passage of gasoline in the Asian crisis 
this some things some parts escaped them as I said a few moments ago 
in 2008 
not as dimension above 
disposable production again this is one reason for capitalism that of 
you can actually make a profit without producing anything just by moving the 
electrons around the world you can bet any one and win money or 
lose money on it but it the fact that they require less 
workers and requires fewer workers 
produces its less effective consumers then 
an overproduction in disposable people which again wields enormous 
so again these jobs enriching to 
highly skilled and people are seeing that it would be lucky to use 
in the town of the jobs and finally there is a change of state in 
the legitimacy in this new regime that is in the period from 1945 to 1970 
Much of the legitimation of the state was based on giving the common good to 
citizens who deserved it as well as a role of finance and 
corporations air becomes more important in the world the states cannot 
guarantee this type of social political common good not even its 
citizens so a new basis for optimizing the state is what 
we see from a state of the common good of those of support with social problems 
well now you're going to protect worthy citizens from others so I 
let's say the enemies and these are foreigners the terrorists are the 
national or domestic cousins   so immigrants the vulnerable the 
poor the young the old so societies are being 
divided against themselves this is the model that they have been for 
protect those worthy citizens from the dangerous others from the dangerous others 
there has been an increase in social movements in response to 
these effects and these again account is one of the types of effects of the 
capitalism that aster nastic that there have been a substantial number of these per 
the place provide a few to you guys so if I pick it up from 
us zero battle at least 799 that was a protest against the world 
pride 
social war that also another world may have started in 2001 the summer 
arab i do 
the battles that are taking place against the buttock and the pockets in 
English the anti-internal trade movements were more recently with 
the arguments presented against the pacific treaty 
movements with austerity worker movements that don't 
have land or are homeless that is being taken away from them 
people for production we also see similar similar cases 
in south africa 
out a move against one 
against a company that aims to design electricity to the movement of the 
stl in mexico that are increasing more and more 
in these cases everything started before the free trade agreement of america of the 
north that was in response against gasoline 
but they started before or after but we are seeing the movements 
progressive are growing but are against anti-globalization many their 
movements are in favor of global integration in one way or another 
whether that through the works or some other type of collaboration of the 
world but they are against the neoliberal reform of globalization in the 
which benefits the mind goes to a group to a very small population of the 
world but this also generates other types of movements 
excuse me and I wanted to teach you other global anti-capitalists and global 
thesis but that has also produced a 
reaction from concentrating on 
the concentration of wealth in very few has generated 
xenophobic movements worldwide for example 
let's make north america were a big country new account 
or first of all this again I would say are 
reactions to any kind of characteristics but they have a 
very different inflection with what we are seeing above these are groups 
they're using this kind of globalized effect to 
become more insurgent more xenophobic in more 
and ancient chroniclers 
I'm going to end this slide where we are going slowly here with him 
what national and neoliberalism and capitalism song marx and engels 
crowe marx it 
either an official constitution of society 
on a large scale and a common ruin of class strife 
they thought things could end in an asset in a useful way 
or quite disastrously the watts on this 
also based on the process he said that things as they are today the 
capitalist civilization that cannot continue we must either move towards 
socialism or backing down to barbarism 
very similar 
the increase in social movements in reaction to legalization 
in its neoliberal form and that clear financing through all the 
world are seeing more movement people are realizing and people are 
she is not happy with the system that is being delivered to us by millions but the 
big question is 
I return to make the reaction of the elite state of the mobilization to the 
resistance go to be accepted and there will be a change in the system it will be real or it will be 
artificial [Music] 
or there will be an increase in repression and I think with those terms 
satin 
I would only be adopting the framework that Marc has already described to us and I will fill 
more spaces here for yesterday's comment than yesterday 
the rest in a very specific way is to say that there is no society 
only individuals 
in fact it clearly wasn't 
aware of it but I was paraphrasing ways that once 
he referred to society as a sack of potatoes that he was not praising the 
result of was condemning him he was describing he was writing 
the rule of autocratic regimes the regime that wanted society 
comparing society to an isolated sack of potatoes happened individuals 
isolated confronting power by themselves and in our case they are not kings or 
princesses 
and if not in the concentrations of private power in their agencies, that is the 
neoliberalism real definition of the system that mons 
condemned mark you know and in its current form so it's not just society 
a sack of potatoes on its own so in an organized way 
against organized power and in fact neoliberal policies in fact 
lead to this result which is quite obvious and true and expect them as what 
we have been doing until today for 40 years of experience should 
demonstrate the obvious have led us to a very particular concentration and 
specific to corporate and economic power and that's been growing 
in an extraordinary way and have done nothing to practically harm the 
economy but 
in finance they have been responsible for many of what is happening in the us 
owner of 40% of these institutions have further damaged the 
economy the concentration of private power immediately leads us to 
deterioration of democracy so it's so obvious it's not even 
necessary to describe it this should take 
an example an exemplary case is the research carried out by one of 
America's leading economists who did it a couple of years ago showed that 
votes of 
lesson of deputies in major cases is 
could predict almost accurately with amazing accuracy only 
to see the funds from the campaigns where they came from, how about they received so much 
that the candidates are getting in shape in the way that the students are 
resulting another effect is that it has been mentioned about the concentration of 
air of economic good is the deterioration of the 
population in terms of real wages now the current wages are 
much lower than in the sixties than in the late 60s 
now that more money is being produced it is going to very few 
pockets particularly in the majority of the population 
this is being recognized 
[Music] franklin also when he was at 
charge of the national economy as director of in addition to board of directors 
next also one of the greatest economists in history that was before 
that his reputation 
went away due to the 2008 crisis 
which teaches us exactly I want you are managing 
he testified that before the congress that because the economy was also going 
and he attributed to what he called 
the insecurity of employees who weren't sure they feel 
bullied the star of get tried to get 
better wages or working conditions then the economy prospered then 
that's called the health of the economy even when jobs are 
available workers felt fearful given the nature of the 
system that they had built with wages that 
even with very low unemployment that is not really low because it does not have 
all the people who left the workforce out of desperation 
but that's the insecurity growth of the employees helps 
to economics according to doctrine and there are many illustrations 
regarding the collapse of democracy and one of the most shocking is that 
just recently been studied in a role that is military spending 
and military spending always increases and continues to increase already under a pretext u 
another the first role just came out the first 
study by a very respectable analyst on popular opinion 
Regarding military spending, about 60 years of surveys that have been carried out 
you dig and it turns out that the public consistently wants you to spend less on 
everything that has to do with the military but continues to increase more and more 
and this increases and alternates the function that democracy works and the greater 
part of the long-term population has wanted preferred some kind of care 
public medical health 
all these effects are systematic 
social relations break unions also in all unions 
the effects vary from country to country but are basically everywhere 
places and in weak and conflictive societies 
the effects can actually be lethal 
there are some very shocking examples of this for example in rwanda 
there are many atrocities there that happened in the early 80s and have had 
many conflicts in rwanda massacres technical conflicts 
but they were very dejected by all the reforms 
neoliberals and all the structures presented in the eighties 
to create xenophobia hate racism in all of that that impacted the 
western societies and created ethnic conflicts 
that caused very massive massacres in the early 1990s is another example 
yugoslavia which was doing very well during the eighties and 
Yugoslavia was also subject to neoliberal assault regarding the two 
who believes that society went bankrupt and then guided by volcanoes at the beginning of 
the nineties then societies are weak 6 and there we just stopped 
writing are almost types of genocide there are those kinds of societies 
but the overall effect 
has almost are almost inherent in non-liberal policies at the time of 
separate people from each other and leave them isolated without any way to 
defense are isolated in some kind of market is a market 
which is already arranged in the aspect that is in favor of the whole class and of 
investors and corporate powers 
and in the west the result is some societies that were managed by the 
fear anger focused institutions 
and very big situations that collapse and that is very constant in the elections 
European the last lesson in Italy and everything everything 
that in the parties on the left that 
run the political system fell 
and other new political parties fell the non-fascists 
and the same has happened in other places is perhaps the same is true for the us 
in the 2016 elections 
there was a lot of surprise and a lot of huge discussion regarding the election 
cheating but that was the least surprising thing about the results 
not so surprising that a billionaire who spends big 
amounts of financial and economic support and you have 
all the support of the media mean when they do someone does a lesson is 
not surprising because he was not the traditional candidate but basically 
is a cover for the people who are designing the policies 
for the left side and all the capitalist parties what was very 
surprising for the election was the bernie sanders campaign 
that deviated from all American political history 
it was the first time that a candidate actually came very close to victory and 
who could have won it had it been by many partisans without any support 
of private power of corporations without any media support either 
they attacked and named them nobody knew him yet they used the word fear in 
usa and I also use the word four 
letters not allowed to mention it 
and he is very easy he could have won the election without it being for you 
for problems that had nothing to do with his campaign and even now maybe 
it was the most popular political figure in the country that says something to something else 
in a functional democracy one can think that the most popular figure 
the most popular political figure knew what his opinions say in the 
newspaper reports and all that is not because it is silent but 
there is a lot of discussion about him but and about his campaign 
and many activist groups that are working across the country in many 
ways 
they go under roll it's the kind of thing that should happen 
but don't listen to it but it's happening and it's very important well and in 
Latin America under the liberal lion program what 
have passed in recent decades there has been a period of low recovery 
more progressive leadership but unfortunately many opportunities 
were that you're going to lose is a question that deserves attention but 
right now there is a very severe regression I don't think things are permanent 
can change a lot was obtained and you can build on that 
there have been a very interesting number of economies for over 30 years 
of neoliberalism and the results are very direct I will quote 
lower raisins with lower growth rates 
social welfare measures measures from rich to poor countries these are 
dating in growth patterns is ambiguous 
one of very marked growth in the era 
neoliberal that preceded it 
50% reduction in which equality is measured per capita there is no 
poverty reduction there is a Chinese exception which is that it always ignores the 
neoliberal prescriptions and some other Asian countries that 
they omit to pay attention to these parts to these precepts and they have grown and 
eliminated poor poverty one of the facts not so 
appreciated is the decrease of what is the growth go from also 
the policies [Music] 
policies increases inequality poverty and among 
countries when you walsh and what china rate when you use realistic measures of the 
poverty 
all all the countries these that have eliminate 
poverty does not meet or would not be understood as neoliberalists of 
interesting way economic theory doesn't change it doesn't seem to matter it's disproved 
100 percent of the time which is very interesting the question now arises 
of academic integrity we are not going to talk about mexico from the tlc mexico 
It is ranked at number 15 of the Latin American countries in what is the 
gross domestic product the poverty rate grew many se 
they lost many jobs many farmers left they had to leave 
many of its places cannot compete with 
businesses that are subsidized what is not very beautifully called this 
free trade 
in the us it increased by 80 percent and then from the tlc it leveled off 
now immigration to the us is called a crisis 
it is an immense moral crisis where he says they are from societies 
destroyed of central america [Music] 
from since the enthusiastic support of regan since the genocides that there has been no 
They have rebuilt those nations and are going to the United States and that is 
called this what is a lot of people emigrating 
to the us from honduras for example to the us that 
it became one of the most violent states in the world this is a crisis 
of refugees there are two countries in the region from which we have no immigration 
there is virtually no one is Costa Rica, which happens to be the country 
[Music] the only country where you haven't 
intervened usa I say there is pressure in one way or another 
but it hasn't intervened that's one of those little things that 
nobody is supposed to notice other countries nicaragua that is a country of 
Central America that had a that had a military some soldiers to defend 
your citizens of the us and then at that time in some 
times societies were established 
to defend them but they are blamed for a lot of atrocities 
and there have been many attacks but they were dependent on light 
but hey there is no immigration flow from nicaragua well the tlc is 
essentially continued the neoliberal policies that had been 
instituted since the 80s of some depression of the monetary fund 
international to increase deregulation the regulation of 
factories owned by foreign investments and mexico are 
moved away from development policies of previous decades and the purpose 
of the tlc was explicitly enclosing that's the phrase that was used publicly in 
close [Music] 
the changes of the neoliberal period to put it in 
an international treaty and that it was very difficult to get out of there and that it be very 
hard to come back then of course it is all 
free trade agreements allowed the free movement of capital but not the 
free movement of labor if there is such a thing people who have 
studied economics they have been told to read adam smith but not to mention that 
Adam Smith considered the free movement of labor as something 
main market is good one of the many things that have been 
forgotten if the Mexican economy had continued to grow at rates 
before the 80s for the next two decades if 
would have continued to grow like this in the neoliberal period 
Mexico today would have the average economic income of 
societies European societies this is how everything was moving but well 
of course after the tlc per capita income fell below it compared 
against 100 percent increase at other times 
europe is a very interesting case [Music] 
one of the economies specializes in investigating for 
Central American example of this if we study the policies 
neoliberals in europe what he did is study 
regular meetings of the international monetary fund which looked 
year by year and they reviewed the policy situations 
this person studied these policies and found very interesting things 
I'm going to need it found a very scary pattern that the 2008 crises 
it was exploited as an opportunity to enclose neoliberal reforms 
instead of putting more this tax was to cut welfare to services 
social not generally moved to create a society and I'm quoting that 
have less negotiating capacity 
mediators governments smaller social protection networks this growth of 
reduced employment and the international monetary fund does not raise this and the 
last five years these decision makers weren't elected 
this europe is a is a drama effect a dramatic effect 
how these neoliberal decisions are destroying many countries 
and there is something called troika the center the European central bank for example they 
put the policies and have to adhere to them and one has a view 
radical democracy have fear xenophobia hate 
courage that is happening right now in europe everywhere 
any country in europe that was even if it was poor for example then already 
we were seeing great massacres but since they are rich countries then what 
we see are therefore a bit ugly things like the resurgence of neo-Nazis 
these policies have similar effects elsewhere with everywhere 
depending on the nature of the society where for example 
well let's see the tlc there are some some interesting facts 
there are commercial exchange laws since '74 that requires any agreement 
International that affects workers has to be achieved 
after talking to the workers unions these are 
organized by there is a committee called the law d 
of the workforce so to speak of the employees 
the labor action committee was informed of the 
they were informed of the tlc decisions the day before they were never 
actually asked if they got together anyway they did a study and 
Of course, it was very convincingly presented to them that the 
executive version of the tlc was going to 
and the tlc will have negative effects but they presented an alternative that 
they 
they said it would lead to big to big growth that it wouldn't have those 
negative effects and interestingly this committee in testing the 
defense of workers the report was very similar to the one created by congress 
in the us office of technology these studies 
they had the same conclusions basically this was all totally 
ignored we no longer find mention of this in the press in literature 
academic but there was an effect immediately the technology office 
and evaluation was removed by the clinton administration 
they didn't want research that could provide information they didn't want something 
similar to what rum is doing with climate change no but this 
looks like this was clinton what happened is that the low-growth version of the 
tlc had no discussion and this tells us a little more about what democracy is 
the tlc has some very weak provisions regarding the rights of 
workers for example it's almost nothing but one is that it's supposed to 
to study the effective rights of the tlc in 
As for manpower and some studies were done by Mr. brain and a 
cornell university historian during about tlc rules and 
found that the actions of the employees directly reduced them 
by the effect of the tlc 50% of the shares were eliminated 
as to go on strike they were removed they were removed 
for example there was a factory where they were planning to go on strike and the 
manager started a propaganda where he told them that if you go on strike 
well we are going to take the company mexico and put a sign that said 
operation transfer to mexico and the workers returned they returned to 
work and that is legal this but if you have a state that is illegal then no 
it matters if it is legal or illegal so the tlc if it has very ponderable effects 
direct on workers' rights to our usa 
in this quest to find any indicative of this indeed 
first the first in canada for example today there are negotiations with them in 
relation to naphtha and there are some interesting aspects in which Mexico could 
participate canada what you read is that all objections 
The US with the NAFTA but Canada also have objections to the NAFTA and are 
interesting can read them in the Canadian press they canada who 
renegotiate the tlc that will prevent it from preventing anti-employment laws before 
unemployed in the us and these who are not allowed to come to court at 
supreme court as it happened recently these are laws 
called right to work the right to work means 
right to steal laws with right to work 
means they can be represented by a by a union leader but not 
they have the right to pay that's what is what is done in the us and that I had a 
great effect on unions obviously not this should have would have 
declared illegal in the tlc for example the subsidies of the 
agriculture businesses could have been changed during the renegotiation of the 
tlc is a radical violation of business 
of agriculture that are subsidized is a violation so for example 
Mexico Mexico may have to take part in this type of activities, not the 
business subsidies for example after another doctrine of 
neoliberalism as omar mentioned in the financial liberation introduced since 
the seventies and this had an immediate effect 
in an impressive increase in speculative capital 
and in the speculative capital flows that exploded after that and that had 
an effect what does it mean that countries had to put aside 
reserves to protect themselves to protect their countries from any attack that's a 
double attack on the economy a speculative capital because this no but not 
support or do not contribute to production they certainly do not support when 
reserves are saved to defend a country's currency from attack 
speculative then removes some capital from the 
production and this and this is very impressive that 
certain countries maintain capital control 
this would not be allowed or some countries are not allowed to do these 
that is, they are not allowed to protect themselves from repeated crises 
financial for example 97-98 india china malaysia 
they had capital control and they suffered from these crises in 2007-2008 
the same thing happened but release financial forgiveness release has a 
immediate effect on democracy is undermining democracy and are separated from 
The ones I just wrote are important for Mexicans 
consider why they will arrive very soon after the next election 
and it goes to what employers consider the for the wrong part 
businesses are going to create something that economists call a parlament 
virtual parliament 
that's some economics economics literature 
with a virtual parliament of people who can contribute or lend money and 
they can do referendums on them and they can decide if the policies are 
irrational or not that is if they are designed to benefit people or 
to maximize profits then they decide to exercise their veto power 
for currency taxes and so on then governments go and go 
face a dual constitute cya is to say that means at least in 
principle is that if one of them is his population until he does not know until 
point where they can if it is a democratic country and the other would be the 
virtual parliament even in rich countries that is the prevailing constitution 
and this this situation is very likely to appear very soon in Mexico as well 
that if the Mexican election goes the wrong way from the 
point of view of the us or international business if it starts like this it starts to 
pursue moderately progressive policies if parliaments do 
they make their decisions so mexico is going to have only one way to protect itself 
and it's the same thing that successful countries do they have done it and this is 
as they do they do it with other means to 
defend and 
well it must be recognized that other Asian countries for the so-called countries 
miracle how they are developing they had and still do have a 
very tight control of capital for example south korea you can't get 
this the death penalty for capital flight then latin america and 
I will end this has many internal problems away from the assault 
Neoliberal Latin America is notorious for its extreme concentration of power and 
money is not wealth there are the elites who have no responsibility in the 
well-being of populations and it is very difficult to compare with mexico 
Latin America with East Asia and South Korea for example long ago 
was the level of South African countries and now it is an industrial power the same 
It happens in the countries of East Asia and the changes in Latin America are very 
dramatic Latin America is is much more favored than these other countries have 
many more internal resources east asia does not have this no 
Latin American has external enemies Asian countries and wars attacks 
However, East Asia has developed and Latin America has grown 
very little and the reasons are not difficult to identify for 30 years during the 
growth period in East Asia Latin America has observed the 
neoliberal rules the washington consensus 
East Asia has been totally ignored by the elite. 
Latin America have separated from their own countries, maybe this 
They tried the same as this one from Asia but here they were not allowed these 
Elite decisions have been in this way, such as the flight of 
capital capital flight is in is Latin America is very common 
that is to say you can you can punish in east asia even for the penalty of 
death there is an economist david felix who speaks 
that good consumption he and only the main scholars write that the 
consumption patterns and the behavior of elites have been very different in 
both regions in Latin America there is a fervor an insatiability of the elites 
to stop it to produce luxuries in contrast to that with the orientations 
of Asian societies in things created in their homes in the most organic 
so before turning it into something consumer for example in contrast 
dramatic with Latin America that is for example in the countries 
Latin Americans have also been much more open to investment 
foreign since the 50s multinationals have controlled 
large shares of industrial production in Latin America much more 
that in the success stories in east asia 
the world bank reported that privatization and foreign investment 
has tended to replace other capitals in Latin America by transferring the 
control and sending profits to other countries something that does not happen in eastern 
asia and that is something that is happening to mexico right now this 
for example energy systems and more generally east asia 
it adopted the kinds of modes of development that had allowed the countries of the 
west develop including us germany what are transfers 
technology and focused investments Latin America mainly the latest 
generations have adhered to the principles of markets yes they were that 
they were forced by the colonies that are now called countries 
third world now you should mention that there is a 
this an exception to these East Asian successes is the philippines 
which is the only country that by the way because it has a lot of control of the us 
There are no things that are not seen, such as Costa Rica and other examples 
similar but there is also good news the good news is that 
Latin America culturally has the good ones 
cultural and economic resources to escape this will not be easy but it is 
possible since the partial successes of some 
of the few years of positive development in Latin America as indicated now 
the task is to use this opportunity that is very real and crucial for 
develop thank you [Music] 
we have we have received a distillate of the questions that were 
made and have been organized for us into three categories and we are going to 
try to cover as many questions as we can the first category is the 
criticism of capitalism and direct the spaces of resistance the second is the 
relationship of the usa and mexico and the third is the role of the students in the cdm 
in academic situations because we don't start with the first one with criticism 
of capitalism in spaces of resistance and the first question is how 
is how they see the anti-capitalist movements in this sector in 
comparison of other movements like anti feminism 
in our course you know what 
a key part of the course was trying to make a connection of what 
it could be at least on the surface at different movements that was 
in terms and teams of when people are gathering and tend to leave 
in various orientations feminism is more important than this other 
movement or is it better than this one and then when we design the course we 
we design thinking about our problems and all of them talk about 
very similar circumstances that even in our night 
in a very brief way we talk about problems in a way 
a more dominant form in what has been the realism of capitalism 
it is the common ground of what has been the political movements what is coming 
being for the collision capitalism is real 
I think in a very very good way and the question here is very well encapsulated in 
the next sentence today it's easier to imagine the world the end of the world than 
imagine the end of capitalism and that's a time when we are 
living right now we are saturated right now and somehow 
way capitalism subdivides 
puts one segment of the population against the other is connected to 
feminism questions of racism with xenophobia homophobia is that that's very 
useful for capital to divide the working class into 
and infinite forms against itself so feminism and capitalism are 
very important intersect in a very important way and one of the ways in 
the ones that intersect is here for example in the very important choice or 
lessons to learn in order to proceed in the face of the anti chant 
anti global capitalism and before neoliberalism movement in the 
moments in a way that they were developed in the movements of the 
one of the ways that feminism helps us understand 
/ the difference between hierarchies that's 
no values   give it value in one way over the other so we have many 
lessons to learn about feminism clearly we have many 
intersections between capitalism which is a system 
that must continue to grow is a system that must continue to grow 
in a finite world so we have many connections between capitalism and its 
current form and the environment itself the environmental effects are missing 
some of these problems so these problems came up very 
fundamentally in the capitalist way organizing the economy and society 
so I think they are very 
close between these movements that precisely only between these that 
were accomplished in question but among all of them who are connected 
between a framework of capitalism and the only way that society can 
be organized so I think they determine that with that x I will let 
Professor Chomsky take the next question which is 
in terms of climate change with the 
capitalism what are the real ways in 
the chapter 
these are all the failures opportunities to be able to take this question so 
I will take Mexico here in the middle they have many problems that they have to solve 
So Mexico has to develop a way to grow and a way for 
grow mexico is to maximize its use of fossil resources 
in exploration in the gulf of mexico to be able to carry more exploration and 
exploitation of fossil fuels is and be watching it 
as the sea level continues to rise 
and everything later everything will be underwater 
submerged underwater then it is not especially true but mexico has 
is in a position to develop 
wind solar energy then are times when you have 
to take leadership and develop alternate forms of energy here the 
electrical resources and other resources are options the more right away I don't think 
it doesn't take much imagination you can recognize them and recognize these options 
that are available is I would like to make another comment about the first 
question 
on board I think it is quite correct but there is also another way of looking at it and 
that's looking at what's happened through human history 
throughout history the history of mankind everywhere in the 
nature we can see it everywhere the power 
resist legitimate authority if there are hierarchies and if they don't exist then you 
they take great efforts to overcome this and all of this crystallizes 
with an assault in a legitimate way on legitimate institutions 
that they demand a form of hierarchy and dominance and so are justified is not 
automatic as well as a 
like the test race then not to say this burden of proof 
all this is evidence of capitalism capitalism must be dismantled 
fundamentally based on legitimate authority 
some people give orders others follow them 
and we can see all this from the industrial revolution that 
it was a form of slavery for wages so if we look at the culture 
of the U.S. working class in the 19th centuries during the revolution 
industrial or be to accept young women 
in the textile industry or working in the mills all of them with the 
subordination of orders as well as legitimate for a form slavery is 
a way of writing must be timeless and then you 
you go free this was so popular it was a catchphrase of the party 
revolutionary in the us and it is natural to recognize that 
when you sell something you produce something of your own under your own 
decision that does not touch your personal integrity that 
when you do something under orders that attack you 
it's great 
produces something that is beautiful under orders 
with salaries we can is to watch what he does but we hate what he is 
and that was understood by what the working class understood the capitals the autocracy 
the capitalist became instilled as a common sense 
but they can be rebuilt and this includes everything that is mentioned the 
feminism immigrant rights 
anything I mentioned through these structures of 
authority and dominance we have no justification 
there are movements in the current time that take themselves 
the ideals of enchantment then 
These are the 
but the movement has many aspects 
any form of authority or dominance no matter how it is 
legitimate - and good and seeks to justify itself but cannot which is almost always the 
case and are looking to dismantle to add to that quickly to 
expand governance systems a little bit and this I think speaks 
also in the ways in which we can think of as social change 
they have opposite positions and there is a continuum no they are not empathetic between them they are two 
interesting forms of governance one is hegemony consisting of govern 
with the government with the consent of the governed which is the model 
preferred and on the other side of the spectrum is 
the other is the coercion that exists when consent fails and the 
government has to move a little more towards conversion and there is a 
governance problem when you have no legitimation when you have the 
government with consent is the question is why do people see what 
they see this way because they give them the consent to have the right to be 
governed because they believe governance is done for their benefit 
if he if that legitimation begins to fail and there are many laughs for which 
can fail then government structures have to move around a lot 
more towards coercion then governance becomes a lot 
more fragile and one of the things we see under the gangster gangster capitalism is 
one of the things you see is the relations between the us and the us is that it 
closer to coercion think about that in light of the next question the 
construction of the wall in the on the border this is a sign of the 
gangster capitalism if you think of ways in which the framework 
neoliberal occurs and the idea that they can have so much capital movement 
of goods and services as possible but that you must keep the hand of 
works in its place then the wall because it makes sense then if 
the idea that the problem with material conditions deteriorate 
it's always the fault of other dangerous people in one way or another 
it is never the fault of those who make the decision how to maximize the 
capital accumulation you have to see sorry move to another part of those 
people the responsibility must fall on those people who come to take 
our works for example putting that that wall has a lot of logic in terms of 
rhetoric about tangible barriers in a way that the neoliberal framework 
you must prevent certain types of movements and allow others for example 
the wall if it is to be built has to see it will be quite permeable from and in 
others then not so much but the wall is a result of gangster capitalism 
and I want to remind dance med the icon of capitalism again 
and the principle that the core of the market capitalism market is the 
movement of labor if it does not serve us 
also it is not only the wall it is important to note what 
mention that what is called the refugee crisis is an immoral crisis 
because the flow of refugees is not mainly from Mexico, the flow of 
Refugees are from Central America who were unable to defend themselves against the assault. 
from the us and those who could defend themselves because they are not refugees and that 
It has doubled in Europe, not only in the USA is one of the great 
Today's moral crimes is the European effort to maintain the 
migrants far from their coasts thousands of people are trying to 
run away from africa and they're dying in the mediterranean and they're putting them in 
fields not to say field concentrator or they're returning them but it's 
a very simple question because people are leaving europe and africa 
Europe sorry and not in another direction that is something difficult to explain but it is not 
a secret you just have to review it and destroy your country as people leave and 
they are going to countries where they can get rich where they can get 
profit that's a moral crime and if we see it 
that's right grandpa 
I'm going to take this advantage of having the microphone and I want to get to this 
category 3 question which I think is vitally important this is a 
asks about the role of students in academic institutions so what 
I am going to read Mexico has student movements 
students who have brutally suppressed one in 68 in the 
disappearance of napa students recently so the questions are that 
can you recommend to the students of our generation is a very question 
directed then as they see the role of academic institutions including 
teachers unions then I will not speak to stop apart no I will not 
talk about for me one of the reasons why I've been in 
teaching in over 30 years that seems like a blink to anyone 
this time or teaching as a company with a lot of hope in the sense that 
it gives one the opportunity to put ideas not sense of indoctrination but to put 
ideas there and people move with those ideas in ways that are 
totally unpredictable sometimes putting ideas there and hoping that they can 
go in certain directions but it is an act of faith that means that the 
people who are going to find them to face the problems that we have 
described and that our generations have created sorry I'm sorry to say that's 
people that young people who are young today 
the fact that they can name in student movements we can put 
the finger in certain movements that there are in the us several social movements that 
I put on my two blackboards in all those are for youth movements 
then hope has to be put there they have to put ideas there and that 
students advance with them the academic institutions that can 
do because we can be as brave or as shy as our inclinations 
take us I think there are still huge opportunities in the academy 
to have for example have a meeting like this have a conversation like 
this which is difficult to consider or have in any other sphere have 
this kind of freedom this is I think in many other places 
it's good we have to protect it as much as possible is a company of hope 
the idea that students are going to take ideas in ways that cannot be 
prejudice or prosecute 
[Applause] [Music] 
let me add a little more to that the relationship between student teacher is a 
authority relationship and not like the others but but how is that must 
questioned and has been questioned by by educational theorists paulo freire a 
brazilian educator 
he mentioned throughout his life that the teaching experience should be 
participative of a participative company where the students and 
teachers cooperate from different points of view but they cooperate and that if 
happens it can't happen anywhere and if it happens in certain parts 
particularly let's say in advanced science courses where there's 
seminars on serious organic constitutions 
let's say in one of the sciences because this is how it works 
courses where I have given courses where students give challenging new ideas and 
that challenge how things are going 
this modern physicists for example from carrasco de mighty and who gave courses to 
principles those who were entering then the students who were 
going in they said we are going to see this year and he said no matter what we are going to 
covering what matters is what you discover and maybe you discover something 
again something that will change the way we think about things that 
is there are other cases I have seen cases where children children can bring their own 
ideas can participate can learn how to learn by participating in the process 
of discovery and that's what teaching should be the teacher 
he has a background he has certain privileges he has studied for a long time 
time many people use it many people contribute to that but pablo 
freire is basically okay there is an authority structure that should 
to always confront each other over time and what can be done 
in very productive ways [Music] 
[Applause] 
so I think we have time for one more question 
I'm going to let you not answer this I don't know why people want to ask 
more so what is the one a socioeconomic policy that mexico 
you need to regain your identity and your independence but that is not hand 
I would say that they build the wall and make 
let them pay it [Applause] 
[Music] 
I don't think there is a socio-economic policy can you can put a 
simple sentence this is not but it would not mean much because there are many 
aspects many policies that mexico should face or that has to 
facing has a variety of problems this one I don't have to tell 
You guys can tell me a lot more about that wide range of things than 
we talk about is that they have destined to Latin America the 
immunity of elites from elites of responsibilities 
of that of the inequalities more of the masses and in Mexico it has some very 
specific specials that you know for example insurance know 
that there is a sentence that says Mexico's problems are far from 
god and very close to the us the problems of the usa approach 
that is to say that the us brings the problems or says that the problems come from 
drugs but the drugs are based in the us then demand and supply 
then the demand comes in the us but but the supply of weapons basically 
comes from the usa we live in arizona there you can go to a store and buy 
a submachine gun and they give it to you and some representative can be part of the cartel 
and someone from drug trafficking can pass it to the other part of the border on 
alcohol tobacco most 
most of the weapons that have the cartels of mexico are 
The United States is also one is something of politics in the hemispheric conferences that 
held every few years every two years the most recent one was in panama 
the entire hemisphere opposed or was opposed to 
Canada and USA and there was no consensus one of the reasons 
it was that they wanted to recognize recognize Cuba these sounds do not want and canada 
kind of like he wants that and that's something that has been going on for a long time and the 
another is for the criminalization of drugs the criminalization policy of 
drugs is devastating for Latin America for many for many 
things for example in Colombia there is still a chemical warfare through 
fumigation that is destroying as cattle crops has had has moved 
entire populations and in mexico they already know what the 
effect a problem for mexico is that it has 
to get out of this we already know how to do it there are models 
Portugal for example a couple of years ago just decriminalize on drugs 
legalized and it's like a traffic violation now 
and criminal activity was reduced society is healthier 
there have been no negative effects in mexico it will be more difficult because it is something that 
is immersed in society and why is it so close to the united states- 
but for socioeconomic policies if mexico tries 
more progressive administration returning to 
to development policies before the neoliberal decades the policies 
of the industrial era focusing on the domestic market focusing and 
controlling capital and other measures then there is an old person who does not 
is going to like it in a virtual parliament as it is called as I told you and it is going to 
they are going to take action they have ways to do it and for mexico for mexico 
defend yourself this is going to require two ways of 
well a lot of internal strength and organization of the inside from within 
from mexico but also solidarity with popular forces in the us what 
which is not impossible but one of the facts 
awesome 80s is so important that it's never discussed 
is that for the first time in the history of imperialism for the first time 
popular groups and societies of the empire not only protested the 
atrocities that were taking place in central america which is where the 
they were educated but thousands of people went to help the victims 
from the us from rural communities of evangelical evangelical churches sorry 
Masses 10 tens of thousands went to help the victims by participating 
taking part seeking to help them with their needs 
seeking to protect them in the way they could against racist attacks 
imperialists this had never happened something like this they never thought they were going to live 
in a Vietnamese country for example or in a country of Algeria to go help them 
them running running as part of the resistance was important 
there's the nature of society is very mixed on what can be done and 
These movements are extremely important and this in Latin America for 
example during his years for several years of 
progressive policies you started and started to develop institutions 
independent which is something very important and in South America for example 
unisur became a union of societies of south america that did not 
a lot but the important thing was to fight the main empire not something that never 
lit or did not grab shape but there it is something that made up the entire hemisphere 
just excluding the united states and canada that's very important 
and its importance and importance is that you can be a form of solidarity in 
against the attack of virtual parliaments and the imperialist state that 
is behind it and if mexico starts trying to get out of those 
colonial or colonialist traps because you are going to get into trouble there are 
many academic studies in mexico have surely seen 80 percent of the 
Mexican businesses are involved in some way or another in drugs 
banks are involved in many ways 
so 
this this system we must end this system of self-destruct corruption 
and destroying it is not going to be easy so I don't think there is a policy 
socioeconomic there is an important variety of policies but it is not going 
to be easy it's something that will require a lot of energy effort from within 
mexico and much international solidarity [Applause]
