that sounds good for what it's worth
Sergio Mendes and Brasil 66 here on
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report we're on the road in
Boston with professor Noam Chomsky we're
talking about well us global policy from
NATO to Afghanistan to the new
government in Israel can you talk about
Benjamin Netanyahu and what you see
coming up well Benjamin Netanyahu is on
the oh you can't say on the far right
anymore because the country's moved so
far to the right that he's almost
centrist to the far right is his foreign
minister avigdor lieberman who has made
his first pronouncement yesterday he
said that the Israel has no
responsibilities for any previous
commitments not the Annapolis commitment
to eventually form some sort of
Palestinian state and unclear what only
to the roadmap that's what's reported
yesterday in the press now what's
Israel's commitment to the roadmap he
knows very well the roadmap is the
famous decision of the quartet US Europe
Russia and the United Nations a couple
of years ago which sort of laid out
vague plans for what ought to be done
it's worth looking at them but put that
aside because really doesn't matter
because as soon as the roadmap came out
Israel formally accepted it and
instantly added 14 reservations which
completely visit one of the
contributions of jimmy carter's book on
israel palestine was that he was the
first i think to give public attention
to the israeli reservations there in an
appendix to his book bitterly condemned
book but nobody ever mentioned the one
major contribution in effect israel said
will sign the road map but we're not
going to observe it now because here's
the conditions
so for example the condition one
condition is that nothing can happen
until the Palestinians and course all
violence but also all incitement so
anything critical of Israel on the other
hand it added nothing can stop Israel
from carrying out violence and
incitement was explicit approximately
those words and so it continues there
can be no discussion of the existence of
settlements in fact no discussion of
anything that matters that's the road
not now the u.s. supported that that
means both the US and Israel reject the
road map and the Lieberman statement
yesterday is well that's our only
commitment it's you know if we had a
functioning media those would be the
headlines and there's much more to this
it you know President Obama appointed a
Middle East emissary George Mitchell
who's reasonable choice if he's allowed
to do anything so far he's only allowed
to listen to almost everyone not
everyone for example he's not allowed to
listen to the elected government in
Palestine the Hamas led government will
it would be hard to listen to them
because half of them are in Israeli
prisons but nevertheless you know they
have voices for example they've
supported the call for a two-state
settlement that the United States and
Israel have rejected so they've joined
the world on that why are we not allowed
to listen to Hamas well because they
don't meet three conditions that were
established one is they have to accept
the roadmap which we in Israel reject
but they have to accept that otherwise
we can't allow them into the civilized
world the other is they have to renounce
violence well we don't have to discuss
the question whether the United States
and Israel renounce violence so we can
put that aside a third they have to
recognize Israel but of course we don't
have to recognize Palestine nor does
Israel so they have to meet three
conditions that we don't meet their
Israel doesn't meet but again that
passes without comment
what do you think President Obama's role
should be right now what do you think
would be the most effective action he
should join the world there has been an
overwhelming international consensus for
over 30 years was made explicit in
january nineteen seventy six when the
arab states brought a resolution to the
Security Council calling for the
establishment of two states on the
international border which indeed the
international border up until then was
recognized by the United States it means
the pre June 67 border and official US
terminology when it was still part of
the world in the late 60s was with minor
and mutual modifications so maybe
straighten out some curves the entire
world agrees with this it has been
blocked by the United Stated States v to
the resolution that meets a similar one
in 1980 won't run through the record but
it's essentially the same up till now so
what President Obama should do is in
fact what President Clinton did in the
last few weeks of his administration
it's important to recognize what
happened then there were the word
negotiations in Camp David in summer of
2000 which collapsed Clinton blamed RF
ahead of the Palestinian delegation for
the breakdown but he backed off of that
pretty quickly by December he formally
recognized that the us-israeli proposals
at Camp David could not be accepted by
any Palestinian and he presented what he
called his parameters somewhat vague but
more forthcoming he then made a speech
important speech in which he said both
sides have accepted the parameters both
sides of expressed reservations well
they met in Taba Egypt in January 2001
both sides to iron out the reservations
and they came very close to an agreement
which was very close to the
international consensus we're just
wrapping up right now but I want to ask
if you support a one or two state
solution
yeah nobody supports I mean you can talk
about a one-state solution if you want I
think a better solutions in no state
solution but this is pie in the sky the
if you're really in favor of a one-state
solution which in fact I've been all my
life except the bi-national state not
one state let's get it you have to give
a pass to get from here to there
otherwise it's just talk now the only
path anyone has ever proposing we have
10 seconds through two states as the
first stage professor Noam Chomsky our
guests part two of our conversation
which will play next week will be on the
global economic meltdown Noam Chomsky
