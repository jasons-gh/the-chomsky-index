good evening my name is Fred neuhauser
I'm the chair of the philosophy
department here at Barnard and I'm very
happy to welcome you tonight to Barnard
College and to this lecture by Noam
Chomsky sponsored by the Center for
Palestine studies at Columbia University
the last time I heard professor Chomsky
speak was in the mid-80s when I was a
graduate student here and if I remember
correctly the talk was held in this very
same room it's a little bit depressing
for me to think that his talk that
evening almost 30 years ago could have
borne the same title that his talk has
tonight which as you already know is
America and Israel Palestine war and
peace among other topics professor
Chomsky will address how the United
States is strategic alliance with Israel
affects the process of peace in the
Middle East and why the u.s. is so
involved in that region in the first
place our time tonight is very limited
and for that reason I'm going to forego
a long introduction we'll start right
off with Professor Chomsky's lecture
which will last perhaps 40 minutes and
that should leave us about 40 minutes
after that for questions and answers
before i turn the podium over to him i'd
like to just mention and recommend to
you one of his most recent books that's
directly relevant to the topic tonight
this book which is co-authored with Ilan
Pappe is called Gaza in crisis
reflections on Israel's war against the
Palestinians it's published by Haymarket
books and they're at the back of the
room and have plenty of copies of that
book and other books for sale if you'd
like to pick one up after the lecture I
think we'll just move right into
professor chomsky's lecture I'm very
honored to present to you professor Noam
Chomsky
actually I didn't pick the title for
that book if I had I would have called
it the US war against the palace which i
think is more significant certainly for
us well a good place to start this
discussion is a useful concept that I'll
borrow from British diplomat a young
British diplomatic historian mark Curtis
and his important and i might add
therefore neglected works on post post
World War two British crimes of which
there are many he makes a distinction
between people and what he calls on
people on people are those who sort of
look human but are not considered worthy
of elementary human rights and that
happens to be very crucial distinction
for this topic come to it soon but just
first notice that the distinction is
ever-present so about a week ago the New
York Times had a headline saying the
West celebrates a clerics death the
cleric was lucky killed by a drone
wasn't just death it was assassination
and another step forward in Obama's
global assassination campaign which
actually breaks some new records in
international terrorism well it's not
true that everyone in the West
celebrated there were some critics
almost all of the critics of whom there
weren't many criticized the action or
qualified it because of the fact that
all lucky was an American citizen that
is he was a person unlike suspects who
are intentionally murdered or collateral
damage meaning we treat them kind of
like the ants we step on when we walk
down the street they're not American
citizens so they are unpeopled and
therefore they can be freely murder
that's it's some may remember if you
have good memories that there used to be
a concept in anglo-american law called a
presumption of innocence innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law that's
so deep in history that there's no point
even bringing it up but it did once
exist some of the critics have brought
up the Fifth Amendment of the
Constitution which says that no person
person notice shall be deprived of life
liberty or property without due process
of law well of course that was never
intended to apply to persons so it
wasn't intended to apply to unpeopled
and unpeopled fall into several
categories there's first of all the
indigenous population that either in the
territories already held or those that
were expected to be conquered soon it
didn't apply to them and of course it
didn't apply to those who the
constitution declared to be three-fifths
human so therefore unpeopled that latter
the category was transferred into
theoretically into the category of
people by the Fourteenth Amendment that
essentially the same wording as the
fifth amendment in this respect but now
a person was intended to hold of the
freed slaves that was in theory in
practice it barely happened after about
ten years
the category of three-fifths human were
returned to on category one people by
the device of criminalization of black
life which essentially restored slavery
maybe something even worse than slavery
if you went on to the Second World War
and it's being reinstituted now past 30
years of severe moral and social
regression in the United States well the
fourth amendment amendment was
recognized right away to be problematic
the concept of person was both too
narrow and too broad and the courts went
to work to overcome both of those flaws
the concept of person was expanded to
include legal fictions sustained created
and sustained by the state what's called
corporations and it was also narrow over
the years to exclude undocumented aliens
that goes right up to the present recent
Supreme Court cases which make it clear
that the corporations not only our
persons but their persons with rights
far beyond those of persons of flesh and
blood so kind of super persons the
mislabeled free trade agreements give
them astonishing rights and of course
the court has added more but the crucial
need to make sure that the category one
people includes those who escaped from
the horrors we've created in Central
America and make
try to get here those are not persons
their own people the and of course it
includes any foreigners especially those
accused of terror which is a concept
that has taken a quite an interesting
conceptual change an interesting one
since 1981 when ronald reagan came into
office and declared the global war on
terror what's called a G watton current
fancy terminology I won't go into that
here except with a comment to note on
how the term is now used without any
raising even any notice so take for
example Omar hotter is a 15 year old
child Canadian he was accused of a very
severe crime namely trying to defend his
village in Afghanistan from us invaders
obviously that's severe crime serious
terrorist so he was sent first to secret
prison at Bagram then off to Montana mo
for eight years after eight years he
pleaded guilty to some chargers that we
all know what that means if you want if
you pick up a few of the details even in
Wikipedia or other sources so he pleaded
guilty and was given eight more years a
sentence could would have gotten 30 more
years we hadn't pleaded guilty after all
it is a severe crime defending your
village from american aggressors he's
Canadian so Canada could have him
extradited but with the typical courage
they refused
they don't want to offend the master
understandably well the crime of
resisting aggression it's not a new
category of terrorism there may be some
of you old enough to remember the slogan
a terror against terror which was used
by the Gestapo in which we've taken over
the none of this arouses any interest
because all of these victims believe
belong to the category of unpeopled well
that coming back to our topic now the
concept of on people is central to
tonight's topic Israeli Jews are people
Palestinians are unpeopled and a lot
follows from that as clear illustrations
constantly so here's a clipping if I
remember to bring it from the New York
Times front page story Wednesday October
twelfth the lead story is deal with
Hamas will free Israeli held since 2006
it's glad Chile and right next to it as
a running right across the top of the
front page is a picture of four women
kind of agonized over the fate of blood
shall eat friends and supporters of the
family of Staff Sergeant gilad shalit
received word of the deal at the
families protest tent in Jerusalem well
that's understandable actually I think
you should have been released a long
time ago but there's something missing
from this whole story so like there's no
pictures of Palestinian women on no
discussion in fact in the story of what
about the Palestinian prisoners being
released where do they come from and
there's a lot to say about that so for
example we don't know at least I don't
read it in the time
whether the release includes the
Palestinian the elected Palestinian
officials who were kidnapped and
imprisoned by israel in 2007 when the
United States the European Union and
Israel decided decided to dissolve the
only freely elected legislature in the
Arab world that's called democracy
promotion technically in case you're not
familiar with the term the so I don't
know what happened to them there are
also other people who've been in prison
exactly as long as you let shall eat in
fact one day longer the day before gilad
shalit was captured at the border
israeli troops entered gaza a kidnapped
two brothers the lamar brothers spirit
of them across the border and violation
of the Geneva Conventions of course and
they've disappeared into Israel's prison
system I'm clue what happened to them
I've never seen a word about it and as
far as I know nobody cares which makes
sense after all on people whatever you
think about capturing the soldier a
soldier from an attacking army plainly
kidnapping civilians is far more severe
crime but that's only if they're people
in this case really doesn't management
matter it's not that it's unknown so if
you look back at the price at the press
the day after the more my brothers were
captured there's a couple of lines here
and there but it's just insignificant of
course which makes some sense because
there are lots of others in prison
thousands of them many and without
charges there's also in addition to this
the secret prison system like facility
1391 if you want to look it up on the
internet secret prison which means of
course a torture chamber in Israel
actually was reported pretty well in
Israel when it was discovered also
reported in England than in Europe but I
haven't seen a word about it here at
least anywhere that anybody's likely
look I've written about it a couple of
others all of this is these are all on
people so naturally nobody cares in fact
the racism is so profound that it's kind
of like the air we breathe unaware of it
you know just pervert pervades every
year coming to the title of this talk it
could mislead and and it could be
interpreted misinterpreted as supporting
a kind of conventional picture of the
negotiations such as they are united
states on over here and these two
recalcitrant forces over the air the
United States is an honest broker trying
to bring together the the two militant
difficult groups that don't seem to be
able to get along with one another
that's it is the standard version but
it's totally false I mean if there were
serious negotiations they would be
organized by some neutral party maybe
Brazil and on one side you'd have the US
and Israel on the other side you have
the world that's literally true but
that's one of those things that's
unspeakable although it's so it's very
clear if you look at the record oh just
give a few of the high points or maybe
low points which illustrate this much
Richard record so let's go back 40 years
in 1971 1971
the US and Israel made one of their most
important decisions with a lot of
consequences Egypt offered Israel a full
peace treaty in return for withdrawal
from the territories and all they cared
about was that I cared about was
Egyptian territory the Sinai at that
time Israel was beginning to implement
major plans for settlement than the
Egyptian Sinai is going to be a new city
meet supposedly a million people Jewish
of course settlements newquay buti'm
others they're driving thousands of
peasants Bedouin into the desert
destroying towns and mosques cemeteries
on and on and they had a choice
incidentally this offer by Sadat I said
absently nothing about the Palestinians
he also regarded them as on people so
there was a few phrases about refugees
which didn't mean anything but nothing
about Palestinian rights Israel
considered the offer and decided to
reject it as saying they would not
retreat to the 67 borders the
internationally recognized border Jordan
made a similar proposal shortly after I
don't think that one was even answered
the crucial question always is what's
the master going to do and in fact if
you go to Washington there was an
internal debate over it there was a
split and in the government the William
Rogers Secretary of State in the State
Department were apparent apparently in
favor of accepting so that's offered and
certainly we don't have a good
documentary record from this furious
bestie kind of piece together but so it
looks as though Rogers was in favor of
it it was pretty much like his own
proposals Henry Kissinger at the time
was trying hard to displace as he was
national security adviser to displace
the State Department
I think the State Department was his
biggest enemy in the world I mean way
down below somewhere was Russia and
somebody else but if the State
Department said it was raining he would
tell Nixon and sun's shining and this
went on until he finally kicked out
Rogers and took over well since Rogers
was in favor of it Kissinger was of
course against it and he explains it he
read his memoirs he says he was in favor
of what he calls still me meaning no
negotiations just forced and it kind of
understandable to a person who believes
in nothing but force what's called a
realist in international relations
theory it looked as though Israel had
all the force if you read the internal
record from Israel at the time just
quite interesting the line was Arabs
don't know which end of the gun the
whole you know we know anything we like
so why bother so Kissinger went along
with the Israeli rejection and rejection
of the Jordanian proposal which turned
out to be quite significant that Sadat
kept trying to convince the u.s. to
accept his offer to become basically a
satellite it kicked out the Russians did
everything he could made it very clear
that if Israel continues to build in the
Sinai there'd be war yah meet means I
meet with the name of the town yummy
city in fact you meet means wards and
nobody paid any attention
you know Arabs don't know which end of
the gun to hold then came the 1973 war
turned out they didn't know which end of
the gun to hold in fact was a very close
thing for Israel they barely survived
last minute shipments of arms kind of
saved me and they understood it's a
problem the Kissinger understood who he
does understand force and off he
understands anything else but he
recognized that Arabs just can't be
disregarded then starts the famous
shuttle diplomacy leading to the Nobel
Prize for Peace and finally in 1979 78
79 the Camp David agreements in which in
effect the US and Israel accepted so
that's 1971 offer except that they
accepted in him from their point of view
a harsher form because by the 70s the
issue of Palestinian National Right Said
kind of entered you know the
international agenda so they were at
least compelled to make some gestures
towards Palestinian national rights this
is regarded as a diplomatic triumph in
American diplomatic history great
triumph of Carter and Kissinger it's
actually a diplomatic catastrophe by fit
refusing to accept peace when it was
offered they led they opened the way to
a very significant war which
incidentally came pretty close to being
a nuclear war but barely managed to
escape but finally accepted what they
rejected in 1971 though in a heart form
well that's nineteen seventy one
meanwhile other things that happened as
I mentioned the Palestinian issue of
national rights began to appear by the
mid seventies and in 1976 that came
another critical of
also wiped out a history and you can
find that if you really search but sort
of politically incorrect so not notice
in January 1976 the three major Arab
states so-called confrontation States a
Syria Jordan Egypt a brought to the
Security Council a resolution calling
for a two-state settlement that was the
first official international reference
to the notion of a Palestinian state to
state settlement on the international
border internationally recognized border
region 67 with guarantees for the right
of every state in the region Israel and
Palestine to exist in peace and security
within secure and recognized boundaries
that soon became an overwhelming
international consensus but by now
virtually everybody accepts it in fact
have for a long time Israel reacted
refused to attend the session it reacted
by bombing Lebanon with no pretext
killing about 50 people presumably that
was a reaction to the UN meeting the
United States reacted more politely
namely by vetoing the resolution that
continued to happen I won't run through
the whole story but it's been pretty
much the record ever since at the
General Assembly well I'll skip forward
til 1988 in 1988 the Palestinian
National Council the formally accepted
essentially this framework that tacitly
accepted it before so to stay settlement
rights of every state in the region you
know to exist in peace and security and
so on and so forth
Israel in the United States immediately
reacted Israel reacted with a formal
declaration that their quote the words
are there can be no additional
Palestinian state between Israel and
Jordan they declared that Jordan is a
Palestinian state the Jordanians don't
think so and Palestinians don't think so
but remember they're on people so that
matter so there can't be another
Palestinian state and added that the
fate of the territories would have to be
determined according to the guidelines
of the State of Israel that was
essentially a coalition government at
the time labor the coup paris from here
the you know again as always the
question is how the united states will
react and the United States reacted at
once and what's called the Baker plan
December 1980-88 I guess 89 the Baker
plan essentially just repeated the
Israeli formal declaration so no
additional Palestinian state between
Jordan and Israel and fate of the
territories settled according to the
guidelines of the State of Israel well a
little bit later came the famous Oslo
agreements couple years later the Oslo
agreements were heralded as a fabulous
breakthrough in the struggle for peace
Robin and RF met on the White House lawn
with Clinton call them under his arms
and sort of bromine reluctantly shook
hands looking the other direction and
they issued a declaration of principles
if you read the Declaration of
Principles very short but two pages you
can see exactly what it meant it was a
total capitulation one hundred percent
the Declaration of Principles states
that the final outcome of negotiations
will be based on un 242 anyone who knows
anything about this story knows that you
n 2 42 says nothing about the
Palestinians accept refugees so if
that's the final outcome Palestinians
have given up and that was understood
it's a criticized it I criticized a
couple of other people the most
important was hydro adorable shafi he
was the conservative nationalist is
probably the most respected person than
the territories and he had in fact been
heading the negotiations team within the
Madrid framework he rejected it right
away in fact he refused even to attend
the day of all on the White House lawn
and for very simple reason exactly what
I said he says this just gives up any
hope of national self-determination and
furthermore he added and stressed it
says nothing about continuing settlement
if Israel continues its settlements the
programs then games over so he refused
to attend man his person free of
principle one reason he was a respected
but there was a lot of unfortunate
euphoria about it well meanwhile the
settlements continued right through the
90s you look at the pace of settlement
under Clinton steady increase peaked
actually in the year 2000 with a sharp
increase also the US and Israel put into
operation at that time a very
significant program early 90s they put
into operation a program to separate
Gaza from the West Bank now that happens
to be in direct violation of the
specific terms of the oslo accords which
they're in a territorial unity which
can't be broken but remember we're
talking about international outlaws the
United States and Israel so they do what
they like and subordinate educated
classes they can get away with so they
immediately began to separate Gaza from
the West Bank that's been persisting
sins and that's quite important because
it means that if any kind of national
anted rights are ever granted to
whatever fragments remain in the West
Bank they'll be imprisoned they'll be
imprisoned between Israel and Jordan
Jordanian dictatorship they'll have no
outlet to the outside world which would
have to be Gaza of course they also lose
very important part of Palestinian
territory and that again continues until
today in pre ugly ways well I should
mention that the settlements are at not
only illegal but recognized to be
illegal this is really no debate about
this I'm Security Council the
International Court of Justice the
United States used to recognize them as
illegal too and it was more or less part
of the world and now it says they're
disputed or something so Press says
disputed Israel recognize that they were
illegal right away in late nineteen
sixty seven when the settlements began
Israel's leading a legal adviser
well-known international lawyer theodor
meron now quite a distinguished
international legal figure he advised
the government that any settlements at
all or in violation of the Geneva
Conventions which says are explicitly
you can't transfer population to
occupied territories a war crime so
that's the Israeli eternal general
agreed with a Deans formed the
government same thing and perhaps the
most interesting reaction was Moshe
Dayan he was he's kind of went about the
more dovish end of the spectrum
and person who did have some sympathy
for the rights of Palestinian he and he
was in charge of the occupied
territories Minister of Defense he said
yeah it's true it's in violation of
international law but countries violate
international law so we'll do it too and
as long as the boss says it's okay it
doesn't matter what international law is
he also gave a kind of a poetic image to
explain what's happening well he said
it's a little bit like Bedouin customs I
mean a Bedouin it will kidnap some young
girl and raper and a force her to marry
him and ultimately she'll kind of accept
it and maybe it'll she'll even think
it's a great thing and that's what will
happen with the Palestinian he added
will inform the Palestinians that we
have nothing for you you shall live like
dogs and whoever wants to leave can
leave and we'll see where this leads
meanwhile we'll continue settlement and
goal is to have permanent rule over the
territories that's at the division so
there's no real debate about this in
anything involving what's called
Jerusalem the Jerusalem incidentally is
a huge territory about five times the
size of Jerusalem and x-play Israel
anything involving Jerusalem is doubly
illegal presses in violation of specific
security council resolutions relating to
Jerusalem in fact some of those were
even signed on to by the United States
went in the early days when it was still
part of the world well the I won't go
through the rest of the record just to
say that there's been one break one
interesting break in the record of total
rejection ISM on the part of the US and
Israel that was in december two thousand
clinton
last month in office Clinton recognized
that the proposals in the failed Camp
David agreements couldn't be accepted by
any Palestinian any Arab and he
therefore gave a different presented a
different framework it was called his
parameters they're kind of vague but
more forthcoming he then made a speech
saying both Israel and the Palestinians
accepted the parameters of both sides
had reservations and they met in Taba
Egypt both sides in january two thousand
one and tried to hash out their
differences and we actually have a
pretty good record this a lot of it in
English a lot more in Hebrew and I
basically converged they were getting
pretty close in fact in their last press
conference both sides said that with a
little more time they might settle
everything well the negotiations were
broken off at that time by Israel Prime
Minister Barak and since then there's
been no formal negotiations well that
tells us something it tells us that if
an American president is just willing to
Alette let diplomacy proceed it might
actually implement the international
consensus which are stress again is
almost exceptional asst well this
continued a couple years later the
quartet was formed US Europe Russia in
the UN and they issued a road what's
called a road maps called bushes road
map which everyone is supposed to live
up to Hamas is constantly denounced
because it doesn't accept the road map
less notice is that Israel immediately
rejected the Rose map road map it
formally accepted it but
added 14 reservations which when you
read them completely eliminate its
content this was kept pretty quiet came
out in public apart from activists for
the first time in a Jimmy Carter's book
know the famous book about peace and
apartheid the book was
