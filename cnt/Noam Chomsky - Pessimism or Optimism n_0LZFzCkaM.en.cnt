as a child of the Terry agave 1930s and
40s period of the war and the Holocaust
and so on that I grew up thinking as I
got older that the world is never going
to be like this again I'm quite an
optimistic view of how things change but
as time goes along as I get older I find
that the world repeats itself and that
many of the things that I had feared are
still going on and will continue to go
on and I look at and I see a very
dangerous and dire world as we look
further into the future and wondering
whether you have the same feelings and
had the same experience and whether at
this point you two are looking
optimistically to the future or a
semester well I I guess we're about the
same age I grew up in the 30s and 40s
too but and those were very frightening
period I'm the rise of fascism over the
Europe was really frightening actually I
can remember the first article I wrote
which was in they exactly what it was it
was February 1939 I was right after the
fall of Barcelona it was fourth grade
newspaper that was the editor and the
only reader of I guess but and it was a
buddy I kind of remember it was about
this this symbol of Austria falling and
Czechoslovakia falling no Franco has
taken over Spain what's going to come
next it looked like you know this
monstrous plague was going to spread
over the world
then came the depression was bad enough
much more serious economic crisis than
anything that's happened in the years
since then comes the war Holocaust
wasn't really known then was known bits
and pieces were known but was really
only known about later and then we at
the end of the work after all
you can probably remember august 8 1945
when the atom bomb was used I mean that
struck me as being as terrifying as the
full rise of fascism over Europe and
that could be the end of the world it
may turn out to be the end of the world
but it was already pretty clear on over
six six the 1945 even worse a couple
days later when Nagasaki was mom then
came many real horrors I mean the
threats of the Cold War were in fact
exaggerated but they weren't something
real was exaggerated and so it goes on
is it worse now in some ways yes I mean
there are two maybe three contingencies
that might really deal a lethal blow to
the survival of species 1 remains
nuclear weapons and that threat is
getting worse unfortunately another is
environmental catastrophe and we may be
near some kind of tipping point on that
it's not to another is pandemics I mean
if there's a bird flu mutation the kind
that could happen it could lead to a
pandemic and which huge numbers of
people with that and very little is
being done about any of these things in
fact in many ways they're getting worse
so there's reasons for pessimism on the
other hand there are reasons for
optimism including those we just were
talking about the it's a much more
civilized society than it was 30 or 40
years ago in many respect including
those who mentioned and you can see it
in policy as well I mean it bet back in
the 50s and the 60s the United States
was overthrowing governments that will
imposing brutal violent murders
tyrannies you know every year they'd be
a couple of them we can't do that
anymore the last time the United States
tried to
the support a military coup to overthrow
a democratic government was in 2002 in
Venezuela and it was overturned within a
couple of days but for one thing that
was a huge uproar in Latin America about
it most of Latin America and also
because there was a popular uprising and
also because the US couldn't couldn't do
it openly you know the way it was done
in the past because there's too much
opposition here well there's a reason
the things like that or reasons for
optimism so you take a choice I mean you
can be pessimistic if you like the Whale
imagine golden days of the past or look
at the things that are positive and
dried it would amplify me
