Noam Chomsky has been described as one
of the greatest minds in human history
he's the sort of the greatest exponent
of natural philosophy in the 20th and
21st century he's a it was quite
remarkable what he's done he is a quite
extraordinary human being in every
respect both intellectually and
personally he's known for his writing on
language and his views and America's
actions abroad especially in the Middle
East
Noam Chomsky is important for many
reasons but principally he has been the
leading critic of u.s. foreign policy
for many decades now in his late 80s
Chomsky is still emeritus professor at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Boston I'm trans P alpha
Daniel a Hammond man was the hawk the
inti haircut Allan seniya the relay at
the head our Elohim mother succeeding at
will have been young he first emerged
through his pioneering work in
linguistics in the 1950s but then became
a political activist for 50 or more
years he's opposed u.s. foreign policy
it's neoliberal capitalism and the
mainstream media it's always inspiring
to listen to him and trying to argue
against him nearly always leads to
progress there's no other linguist like
that
my parents were Hebrew teachers grew up
in a Jewish environment very much imbued
the revival of Hebrew and so on but my
closest relatives were mostly
working-class unemployed mostly in the
1930s so unemployed Jewish working-class
part of the active very active
intellectual community of a
working-class community and in New York
at the time you know people that didn't
have much formal education in fact one
uncle it was very influential in my life
never got past fourth grade but real
high culture so a lot of discussions
about the latest performance of the
Budapest string quartet
you know the Shakespeare play
freudenstadt abates every variety of
radical thought you can imagine I just
kind of a lively environment 12 years
old or so I was spending a lot of my
time in downtown New York at the end
those days there used to there was on
4th Avenue at globe
Union Square there was a string of
secondhand bookstores mostly run by
European emigration refugees from Spain
fled Franco's during civil war a lot of
more anarchists and I got involved in
anarchist and left Marxist literature
and thought they were very eager to talk
you know young kid comes in and they're
happy to talk and artists offices and so
on they just became involved in active
the political life
Chomsky has been almost as prolific a
writer as he has been controversial his
early books and linguistics were
influential but largely academic with a
tiny readership but his writing on the
Middle East gained attention beyond
academia
despite his Jewish origins he became an
increasing critic of Israeli policy
towards the Palestinians and of u.s.
foreign policy as a whole in the late
40s
he'd funded his university studies by
teaching Hebrew and was primarily
interested in learning Arabic but he was
persuaded by one of his teachers zellig
harris to major in linguistics Chomsky
says somewhere I'm some sort of
anarchist and it's clear that his
anarchism is reflected in a revolt
against Authority and the revolt against
Authority again is something that
generalizes to the academic disciplines
of linguistics and philosophy so he
began his linguistic career by working
first with zelich Harris and then alone
on the Morpho phonetics of Hebrew and on
a wide variety of other subjects
culminating in syntactic structures in
57 that book was revolutionary
I read extensively and their classics
and the modern literature and political
writings mostly on the Left philosophy
it led in directions which had a lot of
influence in shaping the way I think
about things the first article I wrote
was 1939 and fourth grade actually the
fourth grade newspaper
I was the editor probably the only
reader maybe my mother it was an article
on the fall of Barcelona so remember the
exact date I took through February 1939
and the spread of fascism in Europe was
interested in concern without those
things and I happened to be in a the
school that I was seeing was very
supportive and encouraging in these
respects not political side but just
there was a doobie eight experimental
school which encouraged the creativity
independence pursuing your interests
wherever there we go so on
which very much personal taste so it
worked out very well in 1940's I was a
Zionist youth leader to me it was a
large part of my political life to me
Zionism and to my circles meant
establishment of a cultural center and
national home in Palestine opposition's
opposed to a Jewish state and as I
mentioned before in cooperation with the
indigenous populations of our Jewish
mainly working-class cooperation he had
read all of Zionist literature by the
age of five and he had resolved that he
was the Zionist then he remains so so
his it's not so much Chomsky versus I'm
ISM it's Chomsky who considers himself
both a Zionist and maintains the same
principles and values when it comes to
the israel-palestine conflict as he does
to any other conflict and so he applies
those principles and values and reaches
the same source of what you might call
radical conclusions as he does when he
comes when he addresses any other
conflict
in 1953 Chomsky and his wife Carol went
to Israel to live on a kibbutz already
immersed in radical politics Chomsky
visited activists in neighboring Arab
villages before 1948 he'd already argued
publicly for a single or binational
state in Palestine it's been his view of
the ideal solution for 75 years but he
now accepts it would condemn
Palestinians to living in a virtual
apartheid Society Chomsky might have
stayed in Israel but in 1955 he was
offered a job at MIT in Boston as an
assistant professor here he published
his first work in linguistics the basis
of which was termed generative grammar
studying grammar as a body of knowledge
possessed by language users he argued
this knowledge is innate and the
children therefore need to learn very
few features of their native languages
which is why they learn to speak them so
quickly and the fifties I started
linguistics when after I graduated my
teacher took me aside and said the
future is going to be generative that
was the first time I heard the word or
heard generative grammar and it was only
later that I became began to understand
what Chomsky had contributed and because
of that I went to MIT for two years in
the 60s to work with Chomsky and study
with him
I was given a book by my father by
Chomsky which was published in the same
year 2002 and I read this book and was
first of all I was struck by several
things the first thing I was struck by
was that he hadn't been on a single
reading list even though I had been
studying issues about politics and
social justice and so on and secondly I
was struck by how assertive his voice
was how clear how he could say such
assertive things about how America
performed in its foreign policy and so
on
Norman Finkelstein has also faced
controversy a dispute with lawyer Alan
Dershowitz ultimately cost him his job
at DePaul University Chomsky changed my
life but the fact that he did and I have
to give credit where credit is due I was
coming under a quite severe battering my
ego was being pretty much shattered from
all the criticism I had to absorb and
the only compensatory factor was the
knowledge that when the greatest minds
in human history thought I had something
to say and so he lifted my spirits
through some very very difficult periods
were it not for him I can tell you with
certainty and although I'm a pretty
determined person I would have given up
well I heard about him in the 1970s and
even earlier in in the late 1960s I had
heard that there was this teacher at
professor at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology MIT who was also a
political activist and I was interested
in his political writings and I wrote to
him after reading one of his books and
quite to my surprise he responded and we
began their correspondence then and it
continued of core endemic important even
fear nauseous there resulted up to the
habala Raziel

I spent a lot of time responding the
mail and a lot of it is critical I like
I spend 5 or 6 hours a day
responding to to mail a but it's of all
kinds some as criticism some as a
request for information some as you know
proposals some as people write about
their own problems
I don't really spend a lot of time
responding to criticism most most of the
criticism that's published I read it and
if there's anything interesting maybe I
can learn something from it
ok oh except that if it's interesting if
it's just nonsense ignore it
I'm rarely respond unless I'm asked to I
think the response it's interesting what
happens when I do respond so for example
the Columbia Journalism Review which is
the main journalism review the most
important one
they haven't have a interview which was
full of outlandish slanders and
fabrications about me which I ignored
but friends of mine in the profession
said they thought it would be worth
answering because a lot of people read
it so I wrote a response to the Columbia
Journalism Review and they published it
almost they rewrote it they changed what
I wrote and put in their own sentences
and then they had a response to this
letter in which they responded to the
sentences that they had introduced I
wrote a letter to the editor and I said
you really think this is honest
journalistic practice and there was a
woman wrote back saying well we thought
those sentences we introduced expressed
your views better than you did so was
appropriate
his debates with people are generally
not personal he's really interested in
the ideas that he's talking about and he
wants to engage with those ideas and he
believes that his interlocutors the
people he speaks with our deserving of
respect which does not mean that he
should agree with him or that he can't
criticize what they're saying but he
doesn't tend to criticize them he
criticizes what they're saying and what
they're asserting and this actually is
quite unique I'm kind of there's sort of
a schizophrenic existence I mean part of
it is my roughly professional work a
scientific work and they are a right if
there's something to say so I think you
understand something or this discovery
or so on well ok you write it down
actually I never my earliest writings
were not intended for publication and
that's stays pretty much the same so the
first linguistic book I wrote was
written for 20 friends never expected it
would be published I think it wasn't
published until 20 years later the one
that first one that actually came out
for publication in 1957 was syntactic
structures it was actually class notes
it was notes for an undergraduate class
that I was teaching here and publisher
you saw them asked if I could just that
I write it up they would publish it but
it wasn't intended for publication and
many of the other things that I write
are either no lectures class notes
something like this put together when it
looks as if it's appropriate and it's
pretty much the same in the other sphere
in the political sphere
most of what I write and occasionally
I'll sort of sit down and you know
decide I'm gonna write a book about X Y
Z that a lot of it is edited versions of
the talks hundreds of talks
put the
often at the request of a publisher
that's just another you know another
form of reaching out to a wider audience
most of its speaking greetings and
welcome to alternative radio I'm David
Barr Sam Young today on alternative
radio we're going to feature that's how
he expresses himself he is prolific he
is able to write on linguistics as well
as political issues he has a lot to say
he knows a lot and he's able to produce
many many books and articles it's
extraordinary and the the intellectual
output of of Chomsky has few rivals
anywhere what I'm driving home
you know I'm thinking and if there's
anything worth putting down I'll write
it okay I don't think there's anything
ever found to say about these matters if
he ever asked for a letter from somebody
who has a query or a comment or
criticism and so on and it leads me to
think about something and I think about
it
maybe I'll write it down the same if I'm
having a discussion with say a student
comes in with his draft of his thesis
and we talk about something and
something comes up well maybe I'll write
that down syntactic structures aspects
of a theory of syntax lectures of
government and binding the minimalist
program these are for landmark books in
linguistics he's written a large number
of very important books in philosophy
including language in mind and
reflections in language and the recent
Cambridge volume and as you know as well
as I do that he's written countless
pages of very influential work in
politics my own favorite actually is
peace in the Middle East
certainly the book that had the biggest
impact on me was faithful triangle that
was really that was a tour de force
it really was it was you know he wrote
the whole thing in about six months at
night after work
and it's really endured I remember just
a funny story I gave it to my late
mother to read and she read it and
devoured it is fast if not faster than
me
you know the book is very heavily
documented with Hebrew Israeli sources
so she once went to a presentation about
professor Chomsky attacking professor
Chomsky by an Israeli ambassador at the
local library and it's really young from
the Israeli embassy and she attended the
presentation and the guy was defending
Israel defending Israel and so what
about what professor Chomsky says in
faithful triangle and the persons is all
professor Chomsky crazy so my mother
says but do you mean crazy all the
sources are Israeli I suppose the book
that had the biggest impact on me was a
collection of essays language and
politics which was edited by Carlos
Otero and it's a huge book as one of the
earliest books by Chomsky bought but in
fact it was very good as an introduction
because it was a series of interviews
that he'd done over many many years and
as a consequence it was extremely
accessible and gave you a broad sense of
the vast scope of Chomsky's interests so
for me if I was to pick out one book of
his that I was taken to a desert island
it would be language and politics which
is still available I think for a press
in the academic domain either
reflections on language or rules and
representations of the best books and
they're the best books because they're
philosophically deep but they're
accessible to a reasonably
unsophisticated audience everyone's
impressed by the fact that he documents
almost everything he says I'm footnotes
are almost as impressive as the book and
it's it's clearly the writing of someone
who's thought seriously about these
topics and wants to share what he
believes is the case with you I think
that's true in everything of his that
I've read I just don't think there's
anything trivial about the man and
that's not something you can say about
most people
he writes whenever he has free time but
I must say as a as a critic of his
writing that he does not have the most
fluent writing style the sentences tend
to be very long the I prefer shorter and
crisper writing but that that is his
style and that's what he's been doing
for for many years
these books are deceptively simple
sometimes people think they're just a
massive accumulation effects and
footnotes now there is a massive
accumulation of facts and footnotes
there is a really a quantity of research
which is almost terrifying there is a
Nobel laureate in biology named Salvador
Laurier who was a personal friend of
Chomsky and in his autobiography he
referred to Chomsky's terrifying
storehouse of knowledge and it's true
fine storehouse of knowledge there
because Chomsky his mind operates like a
it's like it's a decomposing machine
wherever he goes whatever he looks at
literally whenever he looks at he
intellectually decomposes it
many of much of what I write most of it
probably's with small small publishers
of one kind or another so for example
the first book I wrote the second first
book I wrote on israel-palestine the
publisher published most of what I was
doing didn't want to publish it so it
appeared in France French translation
and then after it appeared in French
translation they agreed to publish it
here the second book
there was no publisher said that was a
small it's a small collaborative press
after impressed so they published it and
continues it's not censorship you know
it's just these are the pad these are
the constraints through which dissident
opinion has to move some sometimes there
is direct censorship it takes a the
National Public Radio which is the
public radio system there is actually a
statement in print by one of the
co-hosts of their primetime program all
things considered
saying that I'm the one person they'll
never allow to beyond another researcher
has discovered that memorandum it was
circulated by the Managing Editors in
New York Times instructing reporters and
the columnist they should never mention
her name
you
Noam Chomsky is admired by academics for
his pioneering work in linguistics
generative grammar and by activists
worldwide for his unwavering criticism
of u.s. foreign policy its neoliberal
economics and its mainstream media he
wasn't really ignored at the very
beginning because he had already had a
reputation from his linguistics and also
from his criticism of Vietnam so at the
beginning it was kind of hard to ignore
him because of his stature he began to
be ignored you could say from the
beginning in the early 1980s where he
came out with a really excellent book
the faithful triangle in the United
States maybe you get slandered or
denounced kept out of the press and so
on in the old Soviet Union you could end
up in the gulag if you're in a typical
American dependency like say I'll solve
it or you get your brains blown out it
differs on differs from society to
society but it's all there's always it's
it's it's never an honored profession
and how could it be its condemning power
systems so of course it's not it's not
to approve welcome to alternative radio
I'm David anyone in the u.s. political
culture who swims against the current
who goes against the tide is going to be
marginalized to a certain extent because
the truths that Chomsky articulates are
very unpopular he was let's say
segmented or isolated simply as a
linguistics professor and his political
work and analysis was largely ignored
marginalized and derided in in many
instances there were a lot of the
so-called liberals martin peretz Paul
Berman
and others Irving how crystal they all
were very hostile to Chomsky's ideas

now Chomsky forget about him he shut
down in other ways in the sense that the
media don't review his books and
academics don't treat him seriously and
so on but because he's nevertheless able
to publish his books able to give talks
able to be on independent radio and so
on people do get to hear his ideas and
they do feel supported by that and they
do appreciate that somebody is actually
voicing making a criticism and I think
as he sees it offering an alternative
historical account of events not the
mainstream account of history so he's
putting forward a different version of
history I think one of the thing reasons
they ignored him is because of what he
stood for in their eyes he stood for
their youthful ideals their youthful
principles their youthful commitments to
truth and justice all of which they had
effectively abandoned and they joined
the rule
now the intellectual establishment the
ruling establishment and so they didn't
want to be reminded about Chomsky and
whenever they were they would say oh no
professor Chomsky his ideas are so
infantile simplistic that's one of the
words they always like to use simplistic
because now they're more tuned to the
subtleties and complexities of power
which professor Chomsky doesn't
understand well of course he understands
them perfectly
he just happens not to give in to them
in fact when I first started to write
about Chomsky I wrote to him with an
outline of the project that I was
interested in writing and this was in
the days before email and I received a
very long letter back from him typed
explaining to me why he thought I
shouldn't do the project because it
would create trouble for me and make me
unpopular this at the time I was
somewhat surprised with but given the
hostility with which he is often greeted
by intellectuals I can see why he sent
that now there has been an attempt to
marginalize him in certain areas in the
state and that marginalization is almost
certainly due to the fact that people
feel threatened by what he's done and
they feel threatened for the sort of
reasons we've gone into his acting as
conscience of the West means that
because it's conscious and is part of
the conscience it now is accessible and
difficult to hide so unless you can
marginalize him there's an implication
that something has to be done
incidentally not just as a factual point
you know where everything changed for
him politically because I had that his
wife Carol used to manage all of his
literary output which was very
substantial you know we're talking about
now it's over a hundred books but she
was able to manage everything until 9/11
that was the turning point after that
pamphlet he wrote on 9/11
then his
books went off the chart and they had to
hire somebody to handle his literary
production up to then the sales were not
very high I mean of course there were
large because of the number of books but
they weren't very high so that's when he
took off in terms of his publications
and now he's still ignored that's true
yeah he's still ignored but he's ignored
and he's getting recognition at the same
time both are happening he's getting
academic recognition and he's still
ignored in the media his book on 9/11
for example which came out after the
9/11 events came to number three and the
popular best-selling list so ordinary
people but it had no marketing it was
not you know heralded as a book that
everybody you know the beat the media
did not put it forward as a book to read
and and yet it got to number three so
ordinary people are very interested in
his ideas but the media academics and of
course government the three group of it
of elite don't want to look at his work
that's important event we might ask
incidental which 911 the to one of the
mattered history one didn't the one that
entered history is September it's number
11th 2001 okay we know what happened
then it's supposed to have changed the
world and so on
there was another 9/11 September 11th
1973 and now let's let's imagine let's
do a thought experiment suppose on what
we call 911
suppose that al-qaeda had bombed the
White House had killed the president
established a military dictatorship
killed thousands of people tortured tens
of thousands established a international
terrorist center that was carrying out
assassinations and overthrowing
governments all over the world
establishing the murderous National
Security States misters imagine that
that would have been worse than what we
call 911
that's not imaginary it happened it
happened on September 11th 1973 with the
us-backed coup in Chile that's exactly
that's what I was describing but we
don't call that 9/11 because we we were
responsible for it if he come that
enters history when somebody does
something to us not when we do some of
these others which is much worse often
that that's a you know blundering
efforts to do good as Anthony Lewis
called so sure the first 9/11 had a huge
impact on history but few people in the
West would even know what it is
the second 9/11 was targeted against the
West so therefore it's very significant
in fact it aroused enormous sympathy
throughout the world
I've read somewhere that he looked at
himself in the mirror during the Vietnam
War and realized that you know he could
either remain silent and be quiet
despite his clear criticism of what was
going on in Vietnam or he could make a
public stand and use his public position
to have a voice on matters that were
very dear to him and so he chose to use
much of his time to explore and critique
American foreign policy he's one of
those very few people I can't really
think of another who managed to create a
global reputation for himself including
including a very substantial reputation
in the United States without having any
access to the mainstream media and
remember that was before Internet
already before internet so it's not as
if there was an alternative media
available he just worked through his own
or through alternative circuits and
managed to plug into a huge following
notwithstanding the fact that he was
never on television never a national
radio it was really a remarkable
achievement and they're they're the
achievement is due to two things one he
had some very unique message which
managed to get out and also his own
intrepid miss by constantly speaking to
little audiences off in politics I think
one of the issues about Chomsky's work
there's that makes it important is that
he focuses on current issues and detail
he doesn't write for an academic
audience so his books in a way will
probably not last in the way that the
books of other intellectuals will he
writes about the specific details of the
here-and-now
because he's interested in bringing
about change in society so the books in
a way are a bit like
toolkits for political activists around
the world that's who he writes for and
that's what he hopes to achieve and I
know that's hugely significant because
most intellectuals do not have that kind
of audience they write in a way for
other intellectuals as I chose to engage
the issues long before I ever heard of
linguistics or even thought of going to
college I was doing it as a child so I
just continued doing it I mean you know
the fact that you're say a specialist
and 17th century English literature or
that you're you work on the quantum
theory or something that doesn't prevent
you from being a human being so if
you're a human being you should be
interested in issues of human concern
and since you're if people like us you
know say professors are privileged very
privileged privileged confers
opportunities opportunities confer
responsibility then you make your
choices but I don't regard it as the
question that should be asked as wise
and everybody do Chomsky lost his wife
Carol to cancer in 2008 they'd known one
another since he was five and she'd been
his constant supporter however unpopular
his views among the American
establishment his advancing years have
not diminished his capacity for analysis
or his determination to continue to rail
against what he sees as the iniquities
of the day in 2006 he visited a lehayim
detention center in south Lebanon with
the prominent Hezbollah figure Nabil
Koch Elohim was used by the south
Lebanon Army and Israel as a prison camp
during the Israeli occupation from 1985
to 2000
when Chomsky attempted to cross into the
occupied West Bank to lecture at Bizet
University he was interrogated about his
views on his Rayleigh Policy before
being refused entry undeterred he
returned to Jordan and gave his lectures
via videoconference to his audience at
Bizet well you know there are two kinds
of intellectuals there's the type that
does research and teaches seminars and
gives and gives lectures and is not
connected with any movements and then
you have the type of intellectual that
Chomsky represents where he has
historically always made his knowledge
available to movements to activists
because knowledge that is simply inert
and is not being used by popular groups
in movements I think is not something
that attracts him he wants to be a spark

Elliott will be really mad at what I
would say about Chomsky is he's in
constant communication with the
activists that's who he speaks for
that's who encourages he's not in his
political life in his political life his
primary audience is not journals
intellectual journals and he's not out
to attend wine and cheese parties and
you know these kinds of academic
conferences in his political life
his primary aim has seems to have been
to encourage activists people who are
trying to in a real way trying to change
the world and that makes him completely
in a different category than you know
most other academic leftists he's often
described as a self-hating Jew and
that's if you know him it's clearly
false he was a member of the Jewish
community he was brought up as a
practicing Jew even though he's himself
an atheist but he is part of Jewish
culture he speaks very highly of his
uncle of his parents who were practicing
Jews and I think that he practices what
he preaches he preaches equality he
preaches the importance of taking things
at their face value or at least as
though what there was a universal
justice the fact that Chomsky is Jewish
is a secondary what is what I think is
more important
is the justice of the Palestinian cause
and from the very beginning of his
political activism he was always
interested in and concerned about
Palestine and there are few in the
United States who have been as strong an
ally and friend of the Palestinian
people as has Noam Chomsky he's written
many books one of his first books was
called peace in the Middle East it came
out in 1974 and 1975
he's written on the topic extensively

could go from Cairo to Baghdad Istanbul
without crossing any borders and where
you know people were could run their own
affairs in their own neighborhoods and
so on you can advocate you can propose
that to your food no I'm Thomas clay
Electra Heart at Masuda and I don't know
why I know that
Nona was very limited Neha come on lair
food woman - Magda yehulin Adam our food
and relationally charisma and a million
are a hero and Ezra Atlanta's maybe well
I can't ah one man can die out and
another non Surya the little apartheid
vision over free clearances mafia I am
and Yenta he neva mohaka muntaha in
peace in the Middle East he made the
observation that Israel has a choice it
can remain a democratic country or
conveying a country with the territories
it can't do both and he said that if
they tried to do both it would be moving
in the direction of an apartheid like
state that was said in 68 that was
unbelievably prescient and I think
that's basically the argument that's now
being made by everybody in the United
States but for that matter in Israel
Chomsky invented modern linguistics it
didn't wouldn't have existed without him
it's way the way we like to put it
sometimes all of us who are doing
contemporary linguistics are playing in
the playpen that's or the sandbox that
Chomsky created he defined the problem
he defined the class of solutions he
defined the possible options for
investigating these class of solutions
without him it wouldn't exist
he just in his modern linguistics he is
like a guide to exploring the world the
political world particularly of the
United States and that has not been by
accident I mean that has been the result
of decades and decades of a tremendous
commitment and dedication to writing
about and speaking about United States
foreign policy a u.s. economic policy
the media in the United States the role
of the media
the role of the Academy the colleges and
universities the whole idea of
manufacturing consent and propaganda
Chomsky has changed the way we see
ourselves we used to be some kind of
malleable blank slate on which could be
written whatever the people in authority
wanted to be written Chomsky changed
that in just as Darwin changed our view
about the position of human beings in
evolution Chomsky has changed our view
of what it is to be a mind bearing
entity we have an innate makeup which is
characterized by a craving for freedom I
don't know anyone who works as hard as
Noam Chomsky I mean whenever I feel
sorry for myself you know I'm working
too hard or I'm too tired
I think of Chomsky and what he does and
I feel ashamed that I'm doing nothing
because I know that he only sleeps a few
hours a night and this issue of
responding to people is extraordinary
stop writing nothing as long as I think
I've something to say I'll give as long
as I'm asked to give talks and if that's
interesting I think I can say something
I'll give the talks if it looks as
though it's coherent enough for him to
put down on paper these days I'm
computer together somebody wants to
publish it maybe I'll publish it but as
long as that process continues I suppose
I'll keep writing now there's plenty of
things in the back of my mind I'd like
to get to
you
