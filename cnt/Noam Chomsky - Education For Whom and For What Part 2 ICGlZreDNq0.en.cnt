and Nobles well that's been forgotten
so nobody talks about that anymore and
that's a very serious problem because
the in fact that's the failure to attend
to the Commons is going to distress
that's the environmental crisis which
we're marching towards with utter
abandoned if some extraterrestrial
observer was watching I think we're all
lunatics but what's going on right now
unless this conception of preservation
of the Commons and the values that were
part of it unless that's restored we're
in trouble well shortly after that with
the beginnings of capitalist
industrialization there's a move towards
making everything a commodity and it
then becomes necessary to inculcate the
new spirit of the new spirit of the age
gained wealth for getting old itself and
reverence for what Adam Smith condemned
does the vile Maxim actually there are
major industries devoted to it the
public relations industry advertising
marketing is probably the sixth of first
national domestic product is devoted
pretty much it is its devoted quite
consciously interesting to read the
literature their own literature it's
devoted to create what's called creating
once fancied needs the stimulated
consumerism the turning people's
attention to what are called the
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption and away from
real human values
and an enormous work goes into this keep
people from our throats again that new
spirit of the age is so inhuman so that
over 150 years of effort this still is
always resistance so in the early 1970s
as kind of an outgrowth of 1960s
activism there was a very important
series of labor strikes most young young
workers mostly many Vietnam veterans
others just young people getting into
the workforce the most famous one was at
Lourdes stone and striking very
significantly they were not striking for
particularly for wages and benefits but
for dignity for human dignity in the
workplace that was also the time when
women were becoming organized and active
and Chicanos farmworkers black unions
and so on all of this was beaten back
and it's been beaten back for a
generation but it's there in fact the
Occupy movements that are spreading all
over or reviving it
I think it's their main significance and
a lot hinges on whether the new spirit
of the age 150 years old but whether it
can be an in fact in England going back
centuries the destruction of the Commons
it's very significant important to
determine whether this new spirit can be
overcome if not we're just lemmings
walking off the cliff and soon there's a
lot to say about that but I'll put it
aside
well again after World War 2 going back
to that there was a another new spirit a
spirit of triumphalism before the second
world war that the United States was a
kind of a cultural intellectual
backwater if you wanted to study the
science or philosophy or the arch there
to be a writer you went to Europe
Germany Britain France someplace like
that but after World War two that all
changed and it led to it just a
different attitude I mean I remember it
very well I was just coming to college
student at the time the atmosphere was
that we should all this old world
baggage and lead the world to a bright
future what was called an American
Century European scholars many of them
were emigrating here flee Nazi Germany
they were feared because they were too
good and they were disdained because
that's the old-fashioned baggage and the
two were at the same time there were
many very ugly incidents I could tell
you about some of them which I
remembered from a student perspective
like what I was in the 1940s in
philosophy linguistics psychology they
just had to start afresh disregard over
this old
from Europe I elected to and say forget
it all don't talk about it and start
from the beginning you know we're going
to create a new age and a lot of
contempt and a lot of ignorance and
there are many consequences some of them
right to the present it's very striking
in the behavioral sciences in fact but
also elsewhere there were also changes
at that time crucial changes in the
nature of the in the way the economy
functioned and the state role in the
economy which had a huge impact on the
university's higher education
particularly you go back to the colonial
period Adam Smith gave advice to the
colony's greatest economist of the day
and the advice he gave was the standard
prescriptions that the World Bank and
the IMF and the US Treasury and others
give to the poor countries today pursue
your comparative advantage
don't try to import higher to
manufactured goods more advanced goods
from the advanced countries so don't try
to control your resources everything
we'd better if you do that well the
United States was independent by that
time so they were able to totally reject
the rules of what's called sound
economics and they did if we had
accepted them we'd be a third-world
country but in fact that's how the third
world is pretty much created now but the
colonies could reject it the so-called
Hamiltonian system introduced very high
tariffs to block superior British
manufacturers there was a lot of
stealing of technology what's now called
piracy
and the united states began to develop
but began and this went from textiles
the early stages of industrialization
that right through steel and you know
pretty much till the second world the
first and second world war the after it
said they were just there a huge role of
the state system and state sector in
developing the economy mass
industrialization was developed for
example in the Armory's because there
you could control things the railroad
system was managed by the army corps of
engineers and so on well after World War
two that took a major leap forward huge
there was massive funding for science
and technology but mostly through the
Pentagon and was done through the
Pentagon for the usual reasons you have
to inspire fear and you can get
taxpayers to you know pay the Pentagon
to protect us from various imaginary
dangers but what the money that went
through the Pentagon ended up creating
the high-tech economy that we're now
living in so computers internet
satellites Michael electronics whole
array of stuff comes out of decades of
mostly Pentagon funding and research my
own University of mighty was right in
the middle of it the and
the net effect is to socialize cost and
to privatize profit and it's a standard
device the interstate highway systems
another example it's not what it's
claimed to be it was sold on the basis
of defense it's really part of the mass
subsidy to automobiles that energy
corporations rubber corporations and
turned us into it
the idea was to make us a a society that
massively used wastes fossil fuels with
consequences we're now in the middle of
there was also a rapid expansion of the
student body through the GI Bill which
brought a whole new sector of the
population into higher education people
who never could have gone before that
had a very positive impact on them the
colleges and on the general society
that's incidentally a course that's been
reversed in the last generation all come
back to it
Athene the sharp increase in funding was
mainly directed to science and
technology but of course there was a
spill over into other domains 1957 the
Russians sent a satellite into space
with Nick and the laments about how the
u.s. is falling behind you know want to
be destroyed and so on the scientific
community knew that this was total
nonsense that there was just the
achievement was essentially nothing it
duplicated and go way beyond that
anytime we wanted to but it was
exploited and Exploited pretty cynically
I should say
very well and it was exploited to give
an enormous additional input into higher
education and also K to 12 now that's
when you get the start of the kinds of
things that Albert's is deploring like
no math for example I have to say I had
young kids at that time we had very
amusing experiences with watching my
young children ten year old nine ten
year old children try to learn new math
from teachers who didn't understand a
word about the set theoretic basis for
it but we're trying to teach it and the
kids were kind of making up their own
I'll just give you one example when my
daughter was youngest daughter was maybe
10 or so we had a I had a visit from a
friend an Israeli logician there's an
old friend yoshua bar Hurley also if you
know he he came stayed with us for a
while and he saw my daughter doing her
work and what was called boolean outset
of called set theory actually boolean
algebra and he was interested because
he'd been trying to teach it to junior
high school students in Israel in
Aramaic hard time doing it and she
seemed to be doing it fine so we started
asking her questions like if you have
three things how many sets are there you
know like a milk bottle and blow up or
something
and she said right off eight sets and
then he asked a little and he asked her
to list them she listed them all
including the null set and he asked
which set is included and all the others
you should didn't all set and that I
couldn't believe it so I asked her how
do you know the null set is included and
all the others so she said well to have
a set when you do is draw braces and you
put the things inside it and if you look
carefully there's always a little space
between them that's what the better set
so that in fact that happened is she was
doing something quite sensible she was
making up a physical model which
happened to work for these principles
and of course definitely nothing to do
with its what the retarded teacher this
was going on all the time it's that's No
Child Left Behind in the sixties there
were major changes major social cultural
changes civil rights movement moves
towards diversity women's rights all
sorts of things and the universities
were greatly enriched by that as indeed
was the whole society by the end of the
60s there was also a fair amount of
political activism developing and it
became a major force so again at my own
University MIT mainly Science University
it had been extremely conservative and
passive right through the 60s people are
absorbed in their work but by the end of
the 60s by 1969 activism had gotten to
the point that a day was set aside
formally to just consider the question
of for the whole Institute to consider
the question of the role of Technology
in society amazingly a question that had
never been asked you just do it and that
led to a lot of consequences which in
fact have changed the maid wrote about a
permanent change in the Institute and
similar things were happening in other
places this is a even broad - it's a
very it's a general movement
well the unit had a real civilizing
effect on the whole society well that
civilizing effect of the 1960's aroused
deep concerns all across the mainstream
spectrum that's why it's usually called
the Time of Troubles it was civilizing
the country too much and that's
dangerous
and it's kind of interesting that I'll
talk a little about the reaction it has
effects very strong effects right to the
president on the right that one striking
example was a influential memorandum
which it's worth reading you can pick it
up in the internet a memorandum by Lewis
Powell was a corporate lawyer he was
later appointed by Nixon to the Supreme
Court at the other end of the spectrum
there's an important study also worth
reading by the trilateral commission
these are liberal internationalists from
the three major industrial regions
Europe United States and Japan their
general outlook is indicated by the fact
that the Carter Administration was drawn
almost completely from their ranks
that's who they were the on both of them
merit attention they provide a good
insight into the ideological aspects of
what has in fact been a major assault on
democracy and on rights that was
beginning to take shape forty years ago
escalated pretty sharply in the Reagan
Thatcher years and continued and it's
now reaching new heights and they also
provide insight into how this assault
targets the educational system so let's
start with Powell's memorandum 1971 this
was sent to the US Chamber of Commerce
that's the main business lobby the title
was the attack on the American free
enterprise system that's worth reading
not only for the content but also for
the tone which is totally paranoid which
characteristic the major criminals who
were Ralph Nader with his consumer
safety campaigns
Herbert Marku zu who was preaching
Marxism new leftists
on the rampage but primarily their naive
victims who dominate the universities
the school's television and other media
the educated community and virtually
control the government if you haven't
noticed that I'm incidentally not
exaggerating that's exactly what it said
I urge you to read it well the takeover
of the country by these Devils is a dire
threat to freedom he said now because
the only alternatives to free enterprise
are varying degrees of bureaucratic
regulation of individual freedom ranging
from moderate socialism to the leftist
and brightest dictatorships active any
of you are watching the Republican
debates that's being the same thing as
being repeated right now you know the
center of the right Obama administration
and Marxist radicals and so on actually
Powell was very familiar with another
alternative to free enterprise and
namely the system in which he and his
Chamber of Commerce associates thrived
he was an influential lobbyist for the
tobacco industry and he was surely aware
of the huge federal subsidies for the
production of this leading leading
killer which not only kills users at a
scale that vastly exceeds the targets of
the mostly farcical drug wars but also
kills many others and deaths from
passive smoking for collateral damage
just being around when somebody's
smoking
way beyond those from heart drugs and he
was surely aware of the great successes
of lobbyists like him in assuring that
for many decades the government would
help thee not only subsidize the
industry but help it conceal what they
all knew they knew about the lethal
product that they were peddling and
there are huge mounds of corpus of
corpses to show for their achievement
they're still piling up rapidly but that
didn't keep him from whaling and his
memo that all quote as every business
executive knows few elements of American
society today have as little influence
in government as the American
businessman corporation even the
millions of corporate stockholders in
case you hadn't noticed and that again
is considered is pretty characteristic
and the reason is that there's an
assumption that for the state to support
subsidized private power that's just the
natural order that any disruption of it
is a catastrophe and he then drew the
obvious conclusion he was talking about
the universities he said the campuses
from which much of this emanates are
supported by tax funds generated largely
from American business and contributions
from capital funds controlled or
generated by American business the
boards of trustees of our universities
overwhelmingly are composed of men and
women who are leaders in the business
system most of the media including the
national TV systems are owned and
theoretically controlled by corporations
which depend on profits and the
enterprise system to survive and
therefore these marginalized groups who
are being destroyed
should organize to defend themselves
instead of just watching passively while
business and our fundamental freedoms
are destroyed by this Marxist onslaught
from the media in the Universities
well Powell's memo expresses the
concerns elicited by 1960s activism at
the right end of the mainstream spectrum
but much more revealing I think is the
reaction at the opposite extreme the
liberal internationalists and these are
spelled out in the trilateral commission
report that I mentioned called the
crisis of democracy it's not easy to
find incidentally because they mostly
took it off the market when people
started reading but it's there actually
I should say that my MIT as soon as I
read it I read it when it came out and I
figured this isn't gonna last very long
so I bought a lot of copies from the MIT
library so if you can't find one MIT
library has maybe a dozen or so copies
and then it did go out of print I should
say very quickly the crisis of democracy
that they were talking about is
literally that there's too much
democracy the problem they said this is
leading figures you know major political
scientists from Harvard and so on the
public the way they work the Democratic
were supposed to work the public is
supposed to be passive and apathetic
Lippmann Bernie's Emerson Madison model
for him the they're supposed to be
passive apathetic but in the 60s they
were beginning to organize to press
their demands that's what the was being
done by we're called the special
interests the special interests are
women young people old people that
workers farmers the population in other
words they're the special interests if
you look through the and when they press
their demands there's too much pressure
on the states they can't deal with them
so therefore they have to moderate the
demands now there's one group that isn't
mentioned with a corporate sector and
that makes sense because they represent
the national interest not special
interest so just like the far-right the
liberal international internationalists
assume that the their extraordinary
power and their control of the state and
other institutions is just the natural
order a primary concern of the
trilateral scholars just like Lewis
Powell was the failures of what they
called on quoting the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young the schools the universities
the churches and the like they're not
carrying out their duty to indoctrinate
young properly and that's why we had
this time of troubles in general they
said we have to have more moderation and
democracy if the national interest is to
be protected including much more
successful indoctrination of the young
well the Powell memo and the trilateral
study spill out the concerns at the
opposite extremes of the dominant
ideological spectrum these are largely
shared concerns and they've led a
vigorous action to restore order this
often happened in the past one
consequence of these and other
developments has been a pretty sharp
attack on public education taking many
forms or mentioned a few about a year
ago I went to Mexico to give talks at
the national university you know quite a
good universe prepared for a country of
course but pretty quite a good
impressive university
high standards good faculty lively
discussion reasonable facility is not
like a rich American University would
quite reasonable I also visited a city
university the City University in Mexico
City which as it's only when Tom is free
no tuition about ten years ago there was
an attempt by the government to raise
just some very low tuition that led to a
national student strike countries
practic closed down the government we
through the proposal actually still
anyone on campus is a an administration
building that was occupied at the time
and is still occupied and it's used as a
kind of activism Center the City
University is not only free but has open
admissions with compensatory options for
those who need them and it's also pretty
respectable quite impressed to see well
I went from Mexico to California
maybe the richest place in the world
there the public education system which
is just you know the best public
education system in the world is being
destroyed it's being privatized for the
rich of course for the rest
level of mostly technical training and
that's it's quite a contrast between a
poor country and in many ways the
richest place in the world and that's
happening all across the country so in
most states like here I just heard
before a tuition as a tuition most
states tuition covers more than half of
college budgets that's also true of most
public research universities pretty soon
only the community colleges will be
state financed and even they are under
attack and I'm quoting too recent study
analysts generally agree that the era of
affordable for four-year public
universities subsidized by the state
that may be over that's one important
way to implement indoctrination of the
young for a very good simple reason
students leave in a debt trap whenever
there's a college debt has reached the
astonishing level of over a trillion
dollars now that when you a student
leaves college with a big debt they
don't have many options indoctrination
is working that's true of social control
generally it's also an important feature
of international policy well as the
Mexico California comparison illustrates
the reasons for the conscious
destruction of the greatest public
education system in the world in
California and comparable things
elsewhere the reasons are not economic
there are many other cases including
rich societies so Germany dimension one
or for that matter the post-war US
experienced much poorer country than we
are now but
it wasn't totally free but tuition was
very low so for example when I went to
the University of Pennsylvania's an
undergraduate it was literally a hundred
dollars a year that might be four
hundred dollars today it's not a
economic reason but as a technique of
indoctrination is very valuable well if
they're not publicly supported how are
universities going to survive that they
don't produce commodities for profit and
that's the dominant value under the new
spirit of the age the funding issue
raises many troubling issues these would
not arise if fostering independent
thought an inquiry were regarded as a
public good as during the and the
Enlightenment model that is as having an
intrinsic value the traditional ideal of
the universities however flawed in
practice and our major attempts to
change that so crossing the ocean in
Britain the right-wing government is now
challenging what was caught was been
first century called the whole Bane
principle it's a century-old principle
that barred government intrusion into
academic research whether they'll
succeed in overturning it I don't know
and well there's another kind of assault
on intellectual culture you can read
about in this morning's newspapers the
Cameron government has announced that
it's not going to apologize it's not
going to give an apology for essentially
murdering that one of the great
mathematicians and scientists of the
20th century Alan Turing
who apart from being a major
intellectual figure also happened to be
a war hero he was firstly involved in
decoding the German code is something
which saved Britain they killed him
basically drove him to suicide and
Cameron the Prime Minister said they're
not going to apologize because Turing
broke the law he was guilty of the crime
of homosexuality which is a violation of
law this should be a major scandal I
mean know how to describe it but we'll
see if it is it isn't so far well for
the and the United States for say
research research institutions like my
own MIT the way the problem was being
dealt with is by a shift to more
corporate funding and that has several
effects first of all there's more
emphasis on short term applied work so
funding from say the Pentagon or NIH
they're concerned with the long-term
future of the advanced economy that
incidentally means also the
profitability of the corporate sector
long afterwards so develop computers the
internet for a couple of decades and it
ends up being profitable for the private
corporations that feed off it now that's
the socialising costs privatizing profit
principle well that's the government
funding Pentagon funding for example
very free best thunder there is I was
funded by them for a long time
in contrast a business firm that
typically wants something it can use
that not its competitors and it wants to
be able to use it tomorrow
I don't know of a careful study but it
appears that they shift towards
corporate funding in fact does lead to
more short term Applied Research and
less exploration of wait what might turn
out to be interesting and valuable for
the longer-term future and another
consequence of the shift from say
Pentagon funding to corporate funding is
more secrecy
during the Pentagon funded era at MIT I
haven't been a faculty student committee
which examined it carefully
decades of Pentagon funding there was no
secrecy on campus one exception was the
political science department but in the
sciences there was no secrecy literally
true they were involved in the Vietnam
War but said none in the physics
department engineering departments
nowhere else no that's not true today
corporate funders cannot of course
cannot force secrecy but have an
indirect way of doing it they can
threaten non-renewal of contracts that's
led to some scandals some of them severe
enough to land it on the front page of
The Wall Street Journal involving MIT
corporatization can also have a
considerable influence in other ways
corporations by their nature the focus
on profit making that's what they're for
and they seek to convert as much of life
as possible into commodities there's a
lot to say about this topic
time but one particular consequence is
the focus on what's called efficiency
efficiency is not a simple economic
concept that has quite crucial
ideological dimensions so for example of
a business reduces personnel it becomes
more efficient by standard measures with
lower costs but quite typically that
shifts a burden to the public it's a
very familiar phenomenon and the quest
of the public are not counted that's not
a choice based on economic theory but
ideology and that applies directly to
the business models for the university
increasing class size they using cheap
temporary labor instead of full-time
faculty graduate students for example
and other measures like that may look
good on University budgets but
significant costs are transferred to the
students and to the society generally as
the quality of instruction is affected
this furthermore no way to measure the
human and the social costs of converting
the schools and universities into
facilities that produce commodities for
the job market abandoning the
traditional ideal of the university's
encouraging creative and independent
thought and inquiry that challenging
receives beliefs exploring the horizons
free of external constraints it's an
ideal that's undoubtedly been flawed in
practice but nevertheless it is a kind
of a measure of the level of
civilization achieved well they're
related consequences for the
k12 is a major assault on the public
schools underway and the main reason is
the new spirit of the age that public
schools are based on a very dangerous
principle they're based on the principle
that we care about one another so for
violation of the new spirit of the age
so me for example I don't happen to have
kids and the schools anymore obviously
so why should I pay taxes I mean I'm not
getting anything out of it so therefore
let's get rid of public schools and just
do things for ourselves
the attack on social security has a
pretty much the same root it's based on
the principle that you're supposed to
care about the disabled widow across
town supposed to care if she doesn't
have food to eat see there are various
so why should I care I'm doing fine
there are various pretexts offered but
they collapse very quickly on
examination the real source of these
attacks on just humane public value ISM
couple of goods I think is the
passionate effort to instill this
hateful and destructive principle this
new spirit of the age from going on for
150 years and long before that the
attack on the Commons and that
instilling it as enormous profits to
concentrated private power were very
harmful to human and human effects
there's a related campaign to destroy
those parts of the educational system
that enrich the lives of student
and enable them to follow the string
that's laid out for them in the
Enlightenment division of education that
interferes with indoctrination with
control with imposing passivity and
obedient with subordination to the
principle of caring only about oneself a
major struggle about that right here is
you know better than I do the
destruction of the flourishing Mexican
American Studies program and even
and even the removal from classrooms of
books that are used in that program this
become a national scandal incidentally
classics like Paulo Ferreira the history
of Chicano is a Mexican civil rights
movie
we're thinking in Columbus even
Shakespeare's Tempest this is all
reminiscent of precedents that we don't
like to think about but they're worth
thinking about and it's particularly
dramatic that it's happening right here
in the midst of what could properly be
called occupied Mexico
you know I think went to but it was
conquered in a brutal war of aggression
well I don't know any simple answers to
the dilemmas that constantly arise and
trying to develop and sustain an
educational system of Independence and
integrity that one that strives for the
Enlightenment ideal and to do this
within societies that are dominated by
concentrations of power with very
different values and goals but at least
one thing seems clear enough efforts to
do this cannot progress very far in
isolation from much broader struggles
that to protect what has already been
achieved and a lot has been achieved
from severe ongoing attacks and to carry
them forward towards a world of greater
freedom and justice
thank you so much ladies and gentlemen
as we get ready for the
question-and-answer a part of our
program tonight reminder we only have
about 30 minutes for this and I can
imagine a lot of you if you had paper as
I do would have a lot of notes and a lot
of questions and a lot of comments for a
professor Chomsky so as we get into this
Question and Answer let me lay out some
ground rules some housekeeping if you
will we have two microphones in the
aisle will alternate back and forth as
dr. Jones mentioned at the beginning
make sure you risk
