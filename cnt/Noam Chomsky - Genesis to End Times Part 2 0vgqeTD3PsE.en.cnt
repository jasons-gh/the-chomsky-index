Obama's that senator from Massachusetts
Senate Foreign Relations Committee he's
basically Obama's appointment and
abilities Baker place he get talkative
workings institution
which she explained that for the first
time at Israel now has a legitimate
negotiate important so it can pursue its
passionate hopeful piece for the first
time legitimate negotiating partners the
Palestinian Authority and the reason
they became legitimate Terry exclaims is
because they now have a military force
which can control the population namely
Dayton arm and he points to their
success the main success story was
during the us-israeli the patient of
Gaza when they anticipated that there
might be protests in the West Bank
trustees in carry out there weren't any
because the Dayton Romans it was
pressing so kept things quiet I kept
things so quiet to know a Dayton said in
a speech to the ocean
that they were so quiet that is repent
in fact dispatch forces to take part in
the gas attack thanks to the American
Red Army which was controlling the West
Bank worry about any protester so that's
a real success very much like the
success in there will be three or ago
the successes of the u.s. imposed
national guards and public
authorities and now Palestine can look
forward to that same auspicious fate and
we couldn't praise ourselves for having
created an army which can control the
population and so effectively but they
can't even protest the major slaughter
going on in the other part palestine I
say the other part palestine the
us-israeli policy since ah so since 1991
one crucial component of it has been two
separate Gaza the West Bank tree them
totally separately wait a month as one
of the ways to prevent the recognition
pathetic Palestinian nationalism I'm if
gas is Park West Bank yes of course it
is under national war that means that
Palestinian state we actually have
access to the outside world with a seat
work for example and that's dangerous
you want to be completely involved by
the Jordanian dictatorship on one side
by the us-backed is rule on the other
side comes out there so you gotta
separate them from desk and that's good
pretty effectively Israeli analyst
teacher and most extensively and fully
about this is an American journalist yes
the state policy but now that's
succeeding youth in particular by
persuading the Philippine model with the
datum are made us the core of the analog
and pretty good lifer it has been well
that's the the third alternative point
basically options for the Palestinians
one of them is a two-state settlement
the other is not what has been closed
one state's open and anti-apartheid
struggle there's the slightest
indication that anything like that will
ever happen with mrs. Wordsworth
anywhere and us miss Ruth have never
accepted but the third of trim the real
one is continuation exactly what's being
done and what's being done is not a
secret Prime Minister e the owners have
blinded to a joint session of Congress
leaders ago
it's going to go convergence expand but
convergence means Israel takes over
everything those of anybody takes over
everything me too what is this what's
called the separation wall it's actually
an annexation goal which is completely
legal question about the details if you
want but nobody doubts that's illegal
Israel take over everything if I busier
what sex or anything inside the
separation annexation rule which happens
to include the sources of water that in
the region main source of water
westbank aquifer and it also includes
the present suburb versal philippine so
this rotates that it takes over Jordan
Valley third the country palace on the
twenty two percent that stress repel
astronomers will figure that the
imprisonment amount to much capacity and
in the remaining territory Israel
established several carb corridors which
is cut through so the main one is that
what's called Jerusalem is actually a
wave
Jerusalem is illegally annexed by
Israel's it is five times the size of
Jerusalem Israel picked over all of that
and to the east is a quarter extending
through the town of value name which was
established in the 1970s but mainly
built with Clinton support under the
Oslo agreements and there was a purpose
that Carter's to buy site for this Bank
it reaches almost derek early Ford
elected Palestinians indoors is just hit
and then to the north there couple other
partners which got through the rest so
what you end up with is what the
architect of the policy erasure run cold
banter stands separated and tons of what
separated from the group Gaza and
assurance description was not quite
unfair because they're worse than
Baptist now
mention South Africa sustain that extent
Israel has no interest in sustaining
these conference for them involving
Diane proposes nothing to offer you
don't live like dogs the cat and many
amazing special wealthy mr. populations
but some would be left in the colonies
for motor cosmic queries to write
travelogues valance
the year that leaves nothing for past
and make can the caller state
the first israeli prime minister to
accept the notion of palestinian state
was in fact benjamin netanyahu the
current prime minister that he took this
from first time in 1996 replacing human
paris in five years paris left office in
1996 informing the press that there will
never be a Palestinian state right after
that Netanyahu came in super Paul and
his Minister of Information was asked a
press conference I said okay you're
gonna leave fragments here and there
Palestinians and what do you do with
they decide to call the state that he
answered with a chemical on state of the
right where they can go on fried chicken
rip your beautiful so that's the first
Israeli recognition of the possibility
of Palestinian self-determination years
later they
I said pretty much the same thing and
yeah that is the action the realistic
option if nothing is done is to pursue
to present policies and leading select
to the Palestinians as a fried chicken
that's the option not one state and in
quite a struggle on a civil rights
struggle that's all pipedreams minus
bill is there any other alternative the
first option to state so there's a lot
of problems in the world it's hard to
think of the solution in the conjurer
went up but in this case it's remarkably
easy to conjure one up its neighbor
furthermore there's overwhelming
international support for it that's
supported by international law it has
one barrier the u.s. one effect that's
it it's been sitting there since 1976 on
the moon in nineteen seventy six days or
Arab states introduced the Security
Council resolution calling for a
two-state so
international border with guarantees of
the thief it used all the wording of you
in 242 goes for the history know that
that's the kind of document that
everybody agrees is the major document
used all that working guarantees for the
security of understatement Israel of
course with secured and recognized
borders and nice words that was the
proposal in 1976 Israel refuses to
attend the session the United States
beat up the resolution to get in my
Canadian report same resolution oppa
through the history of the same record
since
mr. Eakins the new supports everybody
supported by the Arab League Europe an
online countries by the organisation of
Islamic unity which includes ran to flu
the support of Hamas because by what
position is it was support anything that
those minions except occupation so it's
exactly one barrier in the US industry
which is detected and they refused to
accept it on grounds that were
established in 1971 five years before
this in 1971 I think that's probably the
most fateful decision is yours history
the Egypt under presidents of that
offered his really full history Egypt is
of course the only significant military
force in the Arab world so peace treaty
with Egypt means full security those
that may pro quo
throughout the Egyptian territory it
didn't want to do that because issue is
that expanding into the Sinai big city
city
saw an animated choice are we going to
accept expansion are we going to choose
between expansion and security an inside
of an expansion that was amplified the
following year when jury made the same
offer about the West Bank but that point
is recorded at full speed but it shows
expansion mostly in to sign I at the
time will also go to the west bank they
recognize that it's completely illegal
they're leading them legal authority
right in 1967 including a very
well-known international where they were
informed the government attorney general
second
any transfer of population in the
occupied territories is in violation of
international law bae yong said was
defense minister in charge of the
territories agreed is a yes we know that
it's a violation of international law
but sakes violate international law so
we go to and we do that as long as the
US courts and that's what's going on
well the rejection of said I offered
that led to the 1973 war which is a very
close and very they were almost
destroyed at that point the US and
Israel recognized that the campus
disregard Egypt as a basket case and
then starts
name is Cheryl diplomacy by leaning to
the Camp David agreements which in which
the United States of Israel basically
accepted setbacks 1971 offered ensures
but they ferment point on nineteen
seventy one of the USS or have preferred
expansion to security then that
continues to the present Israel who has
security now rid of the Rockets hostile
countries on its borders but not but we
have to account an expansion is the West
Bank savage criminal siege of gas is it
possible that was also said that the
United States says ledbury the
rejectionists saw pretty solid since
1976 but there is one exception as
revealing in Clinton's last month in
office of january two thousand one he
recognized that the offers that had been
made to the Palestinians by the United
missions failed negotiations could not
possibly be exactly waiting for skating
and he produced we call his parameters
sir Sir evading the forthcoming and he
then made speech in which he said
pointed out that both sides and
acceptance parameters both sides had
reservations that they met him egypt in
egypt and january two thousand one to
iron out the reservations and we have
detailed information about those
negotiations that most of it comes from
how that was early sources it's a human
but there's plenty english nope today's
about it they came very close to a
settlement in fact in their flying press
conference today by the two sides
jointly announced that they had a couple
of more days they produce a tellurian
when the details well you sort of pulled
off the negotiations and truly
two thousand one but was that single
event is pretty stressful it indicates
that if a u.s. president was willing to
tolerate a political settlement probably
reached will that happen
self-representation I went along as more
at least as extremists george w bush may
be merciful but there are some fissures
development and they're interesting
under for watching one thing is the
american population including the
american jewish population especially
younger trees are just not willing to
support what's going on anymore it's too
inconsistent with standard liberal
values museum employees indication so
kind of withdrawing from I'm the
Christian Zionists or a huge group
baseboard no matter what those who have
the memory of us about colonialism for
them and certainly true sport take the
elite sectors tobacco
the American Jewish communities
community back off that's the one
development another one is that for the
first time there's a split in the
Pentagon intelligence up until now
they've been strongly supportive of this
really regarded as a very valuable ally
the u.s. in high-tech industries in
highly supportive of Israel to the wall
street journal's major newspapers as the
Lincoln's most produce really was early
expansion but whether this is beginning
to weaken and they're striking
indications of it probably seen comment
by David Petraeus sometimes what Lord
betrayus in the United States great
genius is now the head of the simple of
command he made some comments couple
months ago the US now has forces armies
in the field in several countries of the
region I understand you're right next to
the rack
it's just dangerous for those forces in
the few if Israeli intransigence when
us-israeli intransigence that creates
the problems when the population Indian
reserve forces he was told to shut up so
he quickly withdrew the statements but
others have been repeating highest
officials in the u.s. until police
intelligence for Adele's pencil and
program ganas identity and he proceeded
seen statements done so too we got to
the point where that Martin hindi who
was clinton's a hazard is your guide his
roots come
yep it not been for your crimes morning
is really there they shouldn't take the
US for granted the US policy could shift
Israel's the head of the most out of
this room Laird the God in Israel warned
the government that they're treading on
thin ice if they push too far mynews us
support which lethal that's developing
10 there's a history which is worth
Kings intention to finish with that
briefly there are a lot of comparisons
grown between Israel and South Africa
but most of the women think amount to
much like apartheid dentist in
comparison works business of measure but
but there is one comparison which isn't
discuss his attention back in round 1960
the white nationalist of South Africa
came to wreak think we're beginning to
recognize to be coming up
state they're losing Global's foot
United Nations big majority of the
former colonies and so on business and
European support and the foreign
minister of South Africa the quote in
the US ambassador to the specification
and he said yes will become a pariah
state against us in the United Nations
but you and I both know the design one
vote the United Nations yours as long as
you support us will stand up against the
world and that's exactly look in the
following years had a part had set of a
did increase by around nineteen eighty
in American corporations were pulling
out of South Africa in opposition to
apartheid appears later Congress passed
sanctions against South Africa the
Reagan administration had to evade
congressional sanctions as well as
popular go to opinion in order to
continue supporting South Africa's and
he did the right through the 1980s the
pretext was the war on terror 1988 the
Reagan administration declared that the
this is the Pentagon on your phone
declared that the explanation Congress
mandela's and see it was one more to
notorious terrorist groups in the world
so we had to keep supporting the white
South Africa and things were on terror
which reagan declared accomplished
in fact as you may know just one year
ago my dad was taken off the terrorist
list he came out energy might associate
special this conversation that continued
great through the 80s and South Africa
live completely impregnable it had crush
J&C underground world hated it but
there's no real acquisitions would it
look like it was in a permanent position
of bakery then US policy shifted around
1992's shifted its policy I mean though
it was let out of problems Island the
end of the room to take over then couple
years apart head was gone the South
African foreign minister was exactly
correct as long as Godfather supports us
the matter what the world thinks but of
course the Godfather can change his mind
and that happened
you go to push the partay you're a
beautiful big paper that's not the only
time just one other example frets
training none of these things are ever
discussed they can't be discussed
because they but follows from the u.s.
to is the world and Rosa by force and
you can't accept that goes through
another example which is great sure is
indonesia in 1975 that indonesia invaded
the Portuguese territory of his team
work and its strong us support a later
British support and fresh support I
carried out the worst prize in the late
20th century virtual genocide and wake
up
personal population this went on right
through 1999 the role of posturing
so on a strong us bored british word
fresh support and so on firstly us the
word that continued right until
September 1999 at that point I find the
date in stember 11th 1999a Clinton the
Indonesian military was a really didn't
care with the world things Sarah
territory gonna keep with us support
September 11th 1999 Clinton or the quiet
phrase he informed the Indonesian
military that the game's over and they
immediately through they could have done
us could have done that 25 years earlier
but I consider that snow goes into
histories humanitarian intervention why
did clinton shift position will for one
thing there's a lot of international
opposition at the time there was a
domestic
solidarity movement we've had some of
they would probably be major effect was
right wing Catholics far-right Catholics
and represents from sector of power in
the United States leading figures in the
Reagan administration East emo was a
Catholic polity and they turned against
and under those pressures come change
his mind that day later the occasional
fairly good happenin is recited the
director in the mayoral run could be
great it could be the US with kids
policy with enough pressure and insist
on joining the world on accepting and
the international consensus on a
two-state settlement Israel have a
choice we'll have to follow his word
that's the way power systems work we do
have the capacity to influence a
consequence it's a kind of mountainous
conclusion in a way well there's a lot
more to say about Iran do it if you like
it's quite constructive look for the
president
I speak well can you please speak about
that about its really agen control and
the steel wall things oh yeah well you
know Egypt has been I actually just had
an interview that appeared in Alec
remain Egyptian newspapers almost
appeared what they published eliminated
one sentenced negley talking about
Egypt's complicity in the savage attack
on Gaza to my surprise that sentence was
eliminated in our Egyptian democracy but
yeah he took you're quite right has been
complicit gzipped was more frightened by
Hamas and Israel is for quite a good
reason each of the dictatorship brutal
harsh potato chips strongly supported by
I said straight out he's going to
service them because nice group
dictators or Mubarak is a nice guy and
it helps us he maintains abilities when
I was saying one of the reasons why
nobody in movies with the brain
functioning can take mama seriously when
it talks about human right but they're
very worried because if they ever allow
anything remotely like a democratic
election there is a popular force in
Egypt which should would come out pre
strong returns majority and a Muslim
Brotherhood and so they don't want to
allow anything remotely like a
democratic election and the United
States ports in the net you know the US
doesn't want them some rather to do but
air will neither about Hamas is an
offshoot of innocent Brotherhood so each
of the name there there are five popular
palestine so yes they're complicit in
maintaining the siege egypt also
understands us Israeli policy which is
not very obscure the US and Israel want
to throw Gaza into the hands of Egypt
Gaza has been virtually destroyed is
really wanted the United States doesn't
want it so they can't just kill
everybody because you can't get away
without these days could a 19th century
chant now so they have to keep the
population barely alive as you may have
read yesterday in response to
international criticism about the
flotilla they released they relax the
restrictions a little bit somehow they
can get potato chips and shaving cream
what other things but the idea is to
keep them just barely alive and to
abandon irresponsibility fructose him
into the hands of Egypt but each of this
morning so for that reason and because
of the factory there ruled by wall
street is a Muslim Brotherhood maybe
she's been participating in media siege
they are building and as you said
with us engineering support to seal off
the country totally and partly just to
increase the savagery of the siege but
also partly to confound the us-israeli
policy which is attempting to drive to
plus Gaza into the hands of Egypt for
gentlemen so yes Egyptian complicity has
been very strongly Gyptian dictatorship
is alive United States addition and has
good reasons not to want to go along
with the us-israeli policy of the caging
the animals and maybe letting go into
Egypt and there's a good reason why the
Egyptian press wouldn't permit that
since moved on since 2000 january 2009
Israel's motivations for the Gaza attack
Norman Finkelstein had written that it
was to restore its deterrence capacity
and I guess I have a question framed
around that i'm wondering if you agree
with that thesis and if you see this
position which is that 0 at some point
must suffer a military if you possibly a
coma or ran and what the dilemma is for
activists who are interested in seeing
some sort of lessening of power but the
dilemma about supporting groups such as
well who are resisting and defending
himself and what our role should be it
such a like a repeat of duple summer few
dozen students might occur I think he
has a plausible case and Israel was if
he didn't he's out of shapes and they
recognize it and they they want to
maintain a posture invincibility and it
was seriously harmed 2000 states
if maybe they thought that by smashing
my casa they could restore it exactly
they thought they were the present and
to show that a advanced modern army can
destroy a totally defenseless population
which kind of fire pistol and response
is not a very impressive demonstration
of deterrence capacity so if that's what
they thought
very impressive demonstration but I
suspect that probably they right there
and they know that they construct the
rocket attacks but to stop the rocket
attacks would mean accepting an
agreement with Hamas and providing some
legitimacy for the elected government
and they want to provide any agency for
the elected government they want
separate as it was the elected
government palace
most of the capital in prison they want
to destroy Edinson independent force
can't be covered the the nationalist
person they want to make sure that
stripped and one way to destroy it is to
create that as a prison and crush the
population and that those need to rocket
attacks which they could end but only by
granting legitimacy maybe a sufficient
reason why they carry out the attack and
it's kinda like so that they understand
that as long as the u.s. Backson even in
the face so as I mentioned even a human
rights groups the both senators were
accepted the Israeli position and I
can't find a word in Western common
heritage questions the ear is social
coordinate the u.s. that the European
educated opinion just mimics weather
you think that if the US says they
didn't
hundred reasons for virtually so sure
they get away with it very much like the
South African case was very much like
Indonesia up till nineteen ninety minute
maid the thing I snake crack but good
reason to think that they can get away
with it strongly enough reason what
about military defeat
I did talk to some of the leading
western is really dizzy very significant
knowledgeable of them expect the board
and in fact think that both Israel and
was well I wonder about once a word that
it can really show they can destroy that
last time and also if Israel decides to
it with us back into it Pataki brand was
my hand they have to destroy but my
first as Lebanon has a turn so they may
attack and they think that Hezbollah
month they take seriously the nest rock
crystal has claimed that they have the
capacity to carry a massive assault
against issue
structed so it could be the W board to
the stretcher it's not impossible states
don't necessarily act rationally Israeli
in particular is becoming extremely
irrational nationalist take the attack
on the flotilla just completely
irrational if they wanted to they could
easily disable the boat sure didn't have
to attack them attacking a Turkish
pleasure ship until you Turks about the
craziest thing they can do from a
strategic point of view turkey is there
one in regional and line it's been a
very close listen sue 1958 so
antagonizing your one regional ally
directly
reason it's kinda like insanity and
they've done for couple months earlier
they purposely humiliated the Turkish
ambassador a matter which I think has a
precedent of diplomatic history that's
pretty irrational their reaction the
Goldstone report also extremely
irrational that much easier way to do it
I'm even very minor case but preventing
me from luxury of the Palestinian
University put the irrational and I'm if
they'd let me come in and talk to
Palestinian university by blocking it
okay they may determine to
internationally
they're they're acting in a way which is
paranoid the spherical irrational
footballs full support of population
mood is spreading in Israel of the world
hates us with an anaesthetic and what do
we care we're going to stand up against
a little the more they're hated where
they denounce the Maurice towards an
aesthetic and
understands if you follow the israeli
President see this been directly
affected entities Jewish tradition with
particles unless the one like of sanity
left in the country there's a couple of
articles like first one strange we
taking this bunker mentality it's
forward they're just existed and it's
it's very much like white South African
language where I'm this their position
with ok we can withstand the logo as
long as the matthew thomas beckons
face the consequences the year they
claim there's an existential threat from
Iran Iran through the US strategic
analysis of the threat the threat is the
Iran does know big Western orders it's
not an existential threat to Israel
except that it is a deterrent to their
efforts and regional knowledge and they
may if they taught themselves into
thinking this is an existential threat
they may go allow us to work done by the
outcome of that you can think but it's
not that Iran is that rational there's a
possible conflict brewing in the region
which is really frightening to think of
it Iran gimino has announced that it
intends to send ships to break the Gaza
blockade if that happens a little bit 0
Israel can go preserve their
unclear weapons they could decide which
Norwegian to show themselves as scary
Israel has a doctrine which goes back to
the 1950s they sometimes well Samson
comfort it's named after the most
perspective and honored the suicide
bomber the world in history since the
first suicide bomber ilysm you know the
education know that Samson thinks you're
a Philistine seasons go out of material
us the strength and the Philippines
listings captured him blinded him his
hair grew back strength being that
and he was in the temple of standing
between two columns and also stands in
the temple
kill himself killed more Philistines
innocence and complex inspecting fifties
if the world presses us too far new
google crazy go crazy i will bring the
uncomfortableness personality it's a
part of the cycle national seconds
it's a joke
attempt to crush left dissidents
