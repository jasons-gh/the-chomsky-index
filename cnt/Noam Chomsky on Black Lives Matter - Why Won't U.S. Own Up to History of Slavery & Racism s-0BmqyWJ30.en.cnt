it's the 50th anniversary of the Selma
Bloody Sunday March 7th when John Lewis
now a congressman and scores of others
had their heads beaten in by Alabama
state troopers it's fifty years later
and you have the black lives matter
movement you have these stories
repeatedly around the country of police
officers killing young people and not so
young people of color what do you make
of this movement and do you see the
anti-austerity movement in Europe the
accountability movement in the United
States the movement around climate
change do you see these coalescing in
any way they should but in an actual
fact the degree of coalescence is not
high we should remember that take Selma
if you listen to the rhetoric on Martin
Luther King Day it's instructive it
typically ends with the I have a dream
speech and the Voting Rights the Martin
Luther King didn't stop there he went on
to condemning the war in Vietnam and to
raising class issues he began to raise
class issues and turned to the north at
that point he fell out of favor and
disappeared he was trying to he was
assassinated when he was trying to
organize that Poor People's Movement and
he was supporting a sanitation workers
strike in in Memphis they were supposed
to be a march to Washington to people
establish a Poor People's Movement
appeal to Congress to do something about
class issues well the March actually
took place after his death led by his
widow ended up in Washington the set of
tensity
resurrection city
this is the most liberal Congress in
history probably tolerated it briefly
then sent in the police in the middle of
the night and drove them out of town
that's disappeared from the rhetoric on
Martin Luther King Day so it's it's okay
to condemn a racist sheriff in Alabama
but not us please don't touch our
privilege in power and that's a large
part of the background these issues are
very real there's more issues here
racism is a very serious problem in the
United States there's take a look at the
scholarly work on it say George
Fredrickson's
study of white supremacy comparative
study it concludes I think plausibly
that the white supremacy in the United
States was even more extreme and savage
than in South Africa just think of our
own history you know our economy our
wealth or privilege relies very heavily
on a century of horrifying slave labor
camps the cotton cotton production was
not just the fuel of the Industrial
Revolution it was the basis for the the
financial system the merchant system
Commerce England as well these were
bitter brutal slave labor camps there's
a recent study by Edward Baptiste which
comes out with some startling
information it's called actually the
title is startling something like the
half was never told which is more or
less true was never told but for example
he shows pretty convincingly that in the
slave labor camps the plantations would
call them politely the productivity
increased more rapidly than an industry
with no technological advantage
that's just the bullwhip just by driving
people harder and harder to the point of
survival they were able to increase
productivity and profit and it's not
just the he also points out that the
word torture is not used in discussion
of this period he introduces it should
be used these are camps that could have
impressed the Nazis and it is a large
part of the basis for our wealth and
privilege is there a slave Museum in the
United States actually the first one is
just being established now by private
some private donor I mean this is the
core of our history along with the
extermination or expulsion of the native
population but it's it's not part of our
consciousness
