actually in varying degrees this is
happening throughout South America many
different ways when instructed the
illustration are the regular poles of
Latino barometer oh the Chilean polling
agency taken every year and they're
quite interesting the results are quite
different from what I just described
here in the United States the assessment
of satisfaction that democracy has in
fact been freezing but not everywhere
but particularly dramatically in
commitments in Uruguay and Venezuela
which would rank right at the top and
satisfaction of with democracy for the
best sir we use the assessment of
current and future prospects especially
the economic situation that equality and
justice educational standards rankings
are also fairly high Venezuela way in
the leading of those the effective
Venezuela ranks only 11th and support
for market systems but despite that flow
from our point of view it still ranks
first in Latin America in matters of
democracy and justice optimism the
futures portrait economic policies
government far above us patrons so
obviously all this can't be recorded and
isn't recorded and not that the polls
are unknown there's one part of the
polls one question folks that's great
early report
that's the fact that in Latin America
Venezuela places Chavez ranks as almost
was unpopular as bush that gets reported
regular but not everything else that
young reporting is unacceptable to our
conception of the present there are
concrete steps that are taking place
which are also very promising so last
December the bank of the South was
established established that was a
Venezuelan initiative participants are
Bolivia Brazil egregore paraguay and
uruguay others may join in it could if
it's successful become an alternative to
the international financial institutions
which have had a very harmful effect in
South America particularly the IMF
missions it's American executive
director the cult of the credit
communities enforcer the same it's being
kicked out of country after country
which frees the countries from a
stranglehold of a branch of the Treasury
Department which is technically with
them that is same to the little thing if
this takes off it could be an
independent source of integrated
independent development for the region
succeed last week some important steps
were taken through firm up of a
Brazilian Venezuelan agreement on
Venezuelan investment in the Brazilian
refinery through process Venezuelan
crude just impressive well again that's
a
it takes place the only example of the
Brazilian Venezuelan interactions of the
first trip first action after his
reelection was the bharatas the support
Chavez election campaign and also to
dedicate a joint Venezuelan presenting
project delivery plan for traditional
ones anam innocence then we can get
reported here because it's against
doctrinal orthodoxy the doctrinal
orthodoxy is that yes in South America's
for moving the left questioning
neoliberalism so on both there's a good
left and a bad lip and their poles apart
the good left is Lula the bad left as
Chavez of others named around so
therefore the relations between them are
effectively unreported but they exist in
december two thousand six there was a
major meeting of American leaders in
Cochabamba which discussed plans for
something like a European Union style
Federation also relations between among
the leaders and for that reason also I
presume that's the reason not recorded
well these and many other steps go on or
hi Lydia unwelcome in Washington for
obvious reasons the leading principle of
u.s. foreign policy with
the Latin America has been described
subscribe free accurately by the
National Security Council in nineteen
seventy one who pointed out that if the
United States cannot control that in
America it cannot expect to achieve a
successful order elsewhere in the world
so if you want to run the world better
at least be able to run your own
backyard that's some position that any
mafia don could easily understand and
the world is much more than a few of
them recognized the Godfather aloo
simply not to accept that kind of
disobedience and the Godfather would
also be sympathetic to the the Kennedy
Johnson position on Cuba which we know
from internal documents they would take
stay upset for internal documents about
the cubed what they call Cuba's
successful defiance of US policies going
back to the menorah doctrine but that's
really intolerable the monitor doctrine
of course was premature implemented
coming but time can be implemented and
now you have successful clients which is
quite unacceptable so therefore this
thing of granted was legitimate to
punish severely punish the people of
humor by terror strangulation for this
deviation from good orders unacceptable
and this kind of his prime and
successful defiance is indeed continued
a couple of days ago order this week the
government of the parliament in Ecuador
close the Monta airbase major US based
call from work let's cover for counter
insurgency potential intervention may
recall that and his electoral campaign
where was asked about the month of air
basins that good answer is that he would
allow it to remain if the United States
could allow Ecuador to have an air base
in my absence affects the sign of the
successful defiance which is spreading
and is quite unwelcome in Washington
Washington has had in the past basically
two techniques of control violence and
economic strangulation and both are the
planning infected ridding themselves of
the IMF commissioners words that's one
form of weakening with the effectiveness
of economic strangulation sames true
integration and also of south-south
integration relations be still indeed
South Africa more diversification in
expert and investment in yunnan china
even though the u.s. is still forehead
it's all happening and it permits
degrees of success with appliances were
not would not have been accepted in the
past no thrown in fact the last time us
the other main motive control violence
is also defined as adverse decision a
couple of days illustrate the last time
the u.s. supported a military coup in
south america
2002 and it failed very quickly part
because of Latin America composition
that's quite a change from fairly recent
past the u.s. is not abandoning these
tools by any means training of Latin
American officers as increased very
sharply it's also been shifted from the
State Department of the Pentagon it was
just some significance when the training
is under State Department controlled at
least in theory there's supervision and
conditionalities human rights and
conditionalities and be very effective
but at least were there when it's under
Pentagon control is an open group this
notion provision anything goes and in
scale and in character me neither and
that's now increasing substantially
scale also its explicit what the mission
is it's directed against what's called
radical populism on the Latin American
context radical populism has a meaning
it means priests organizing peasants
that human rights activists labor
leaders anyone who's serving the river
so that tool is not gone but it's very
much weaker than before
