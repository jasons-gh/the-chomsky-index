my name is Carl Hobart director of
access of Hope based right down calm Ave
here at the School of Education Boston
University and it's my pleasure to
introduce our guest speaker this evening
professor Noam Chomsky received his PhD
in linguistics in 1955 from the
University of Pennsylvania during the
years 1951 to 1955 professor Chomsky was
a junior fellow of the Harvard
University School of fellows the major
theoretical viewpoints of his doctoral
dissertation appeared in the monograph
syntactic structure in 1957 this formed
part of a more extensive work the
logical structure of linguistic theory
circulated in 1955 and published in 1975
professor Chomsky joined the staff of
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1955 and in 1961 was
appointed full professor in 1976 he was
appointed Institute professor in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
for over 30 years professor Chomsky has
been a path-breaking linguist as well as
a provocative sometimes controversial
critic of American policies and politics
he has lectured at countless
universities here and abroad and he is
the recipient of numerous honorary
degrees and awards he is written and
lectured widely on linguistics on
philosophy on intellectual history on
contemporary issues on international
affairs and on u.s. foreign policy his
most recent books include a new
generation draws the line new horizons
in the study of language in mind rogue
states 9/11 understanding power on
nature and language pirates and emperors
old and new Chomsky on democracy and
education imperial ambitions failed
states perilous power interventions
inside Lebanon what we say goes
conversations on us power in a changing
world the essential Chomsky and Middle
East allusions this forthcoming book
hopes and prospects will be published in
2010 this evening lecture by professor
Chomsky is being co-sponsored by the
Boston University School of Education
under the sage leadership of Dean Hardin
Coleman it's also being sponsored by
axis of Hope a nonprofit organization
collaborating with a school of education
and dedicated to improving the practice
of international conflict analysis
management and prevention in public and
independent high school and middle
schools in the US and around the world I
was introduced to Professor Chomsky
years ago by a mutual friend as I
studied and became passionate about the
ideas of Martin Luther King jr. and
Gandhi and began to ponder the idea of
what I still to this day call
educational civil disobedience in u.s.
schools over the years professor Chomsky
and I spoke about the preventive
medicine ideas of Paul Farmer and Jim
Kim and the philia dal at Partners in
Health or the bricks and mortar of
schools that Greg Mortenson was working
on or the people's history of the United
States idea of mutual friend Howard Zinn
professor Chomsky's advice and guidance
have helped us at access of hope to
carefully craft in-class intellectual
outward-bound conflict resolution
exercises to help us and foreign youth
learn to prevent rather than to
instigate conflict
this is what we now call it axis of hope
preventive diplomacy professor Chomsky
also taught me to pursue what I believed
in with passion in this case speaking
out with a diplomatically dissenting
voice about the need to create the
future the prospect for future peace by
working tirelessly with view youth
specifically focused upon teaching them
trust compassion transparency empathy
and humility as global citizens one
child at a time two professor Chomsky I
am greatly indebted as I use many of his
sage ideas and teaching a course called
sed 214 here educating global citizens
focusing on international conflict
management and Prevention Professor
Chomsky's lecture this evening being
filmed by bu productions and then placed
in the archives for future viewing
purposes is entitled Obama the Middle
East and the prospects for peace he will
speak for thirty minutes following this
portion of his lecture we will open the
floor to questions from the audience for
one hour until 7:30 during the
question-and-answer there will be two
Boston University students roving the
auditorium with microphones they will
bring the microphones to you so that you
may ask your questions please wait until
the microphone gets to you to ask those
questions one suggestion if you're in
the balcony and you want to come down
during that Q&A session please feel free
to walk down and have someone bring you
a microphone professor Chomsky it's an
honor to welcome you here to Boston
University this evening
well I think a reasonable way to
approach this network of problems is
from the perspective of preventive
diplomacy one of your main concerns
preventive diplomacy of course is also a
primary concern of the Security Council
of the United Nations and in fact it
recently passed an important resolution
on preventive diplomacy in the Middle
East the residue was blacklist late last
September the 1887 if you want to look
it up on the Internet
the resolution was held here as a major
victory for President Obama and his
ongoing conflict with President
Ahmadinejad and Iran and actually if you
read the resolution you find that that's
not entirely accurate it had two
provisions one of them was a call for
all states to refrain from the threat or
use of force in their conflicts that
merely reiterates the leading leading
element of the United Nations Charter
article 3 point 2 4 which says States
should refrain from the threat or use of
force the second part of the resolution
1887 called on all states to resolve
their conflicts within the framework of
the non-proliferation treaty well who is
that resolution directed at nothing in
the resolution relates to Iran they are
not engaging in the threat or use of
force and as far as anyone knows they're
staying within the framework of the
non-proliferation treaty however the
resolutions directly
is directed explicitly against the two
states that consistently unregular Li do
resort to force and the threat of force
namely the United States and Israel
those are the countries that carry out
aggression regularly and repeatedly that
invade other countries occupy other
countries impose terror and violence and
they're unique and at respect
furthermore they are the countries that
refuse to accept the non-proliferation
treaty now of course the United States
is a member of the non-proliferation
treaty but it backs other countries that
are not and supports them in their
violation of the non-proliferation
treaty there are three countries that
have never signed the non-proliferation
treaty all in the least one is Israel
one is India South Asia and the others
Pakistan in all cases they have
developed their nuclear weapons programs
with US aid and support and continue to
and they all responded to resolution
1887 as did the United States itself in
the case of India it responded to the
resolution calling for States to settle
to work within the non-proliferation
treaty by announcing quite publicly that
it can now produce nuclear weapons with
the same power yield as those of the
great powers as those of the United
States and it's been able to develop its
nuclear weapons program in particular
thanks to the Anglo the u.s. Indian
treaty which exempts India from the
provisions of US law and the
non-proliferation treaty that had up
till deciding this treaty barred States
developing nuclear weapons outside the
NPT barred them from
having gaining aid in their nuclear
weapons programs now the u.s. of course
says that its nuclear aid India is out
this for civilian programs but of course
it can be transferred immediately to
nuclear weapons programs and doubtless
that's being done the treaty was signed
pretty openly there was no secrecy about
this in order to improve the
opportunities for US corporations to
sell nuclear equipment in to India jet
planes other military weapons which
would have been barred under the
provisions of preceding US law so that's
India now what about of course India
expands its nuclear weapons programs its
offensive programs Pakistan does as well
can't keep up but it devotes resources
to expanding its own offensive nuclear
weapons capacity that was developed
primarily during the 1980s it's one of
Reagan's Ronald Reagan's many gifts to
the world Reagan the most vicious of
Pakistan's many military dictators ziyal
Huck was the president in the 1980s
after a military coup and he was a real
Reagan favorite be giving us was giving
extensive aid to Pakistan the pretext
was the war in Afghanistan the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan however the u.s.
the CIA station chief and Islamabad
made it very clear that the purpose of
the aid is not to liberate Afghanistan
the u.s. didn't care about that it was
to kill Russians and as he put it so in
order to achieve that objective
meanwhile tearing Afghanistan to shreds
and leaving it in the hands of radical
Islamist fanatics who Reagan and
organized the new proceeded to tear the
place to shreds with such violence that
the population welcomed the Taliban
in order to maintain this Reagan and his
administration pretended that they
didn't know that Pakistan was developing
nuclear weapons and although it was
completely obvious and they certainly
knew but they had to pretend that they
didn't know because otherwise there
would have been a barrier to providing
aid as the zeal Huk carried out his
programs which included among other
things the radical Islam ization of
Pakistan with Saudi money and US port
they developed a network of madrasas
radical schools which laid the basis for
what we're now seeing in fact
radicalization and Islamic
radicalization of substantial parts of
Pakistan
so that's Pakistan India mentioned what
about Israel well Israel of course
developed its nuclear weapons with the
support and of the United States that's
not controversial but right at the time
of the passage of resolution 1887 and
the you know the furor about whether
Iran is concealing something from the
International Atomic Energy Agency as
they doubtless are right in the middle
of that furor on the front pages every
day still is the International Agency
considered a resolution calling on
Israel to join the non-proliferation
treaty and to open up its nuclear
weapons nuclear facilities including
weapons facilities to international
inspection well the United States and
Europe tried to block the resolution
when they failed it was voted anyway and
it was passed but then Obama immediately
informed Israel that they could be they
were immune to it he also informed India
that they were immune from resolution
1880s
so the resolution wasn't literally
barred it was just barred from the site
of the American population thanks to the
cooperation the media which doesn't
report things of this kind you can read
it if you read the Mexican press or AP
reports or something like that but it
didn't if you're not a disappears here
the how did the United States respond to
resolution 1887 well right at the time
that Obama received the Nobel Peace
Prize for his inspiring contributions to
peace which maybe somebody can find if
they have a electron microscope in their
pocket but right at that time the
Pentagon announced that it is rapidly
accelerating the production of the most
lethal weapons in the u.s. arsenal short
of nuclear weapons 13 ton bombs to be
delivered by bb2 b-52 stealth bombers
which are what are called massive
penetration ordnance they're designed to
penetrate deep into the ground through
huge amounts of reinforced concrete and
destroy whatever's down there these are
huge bombs way beyond anything else the
plant everybody knows exactly what
they're for they're one of the many
threats against Iran the the programs
had actually been initiated under George
Bush with kind of languished however as
soon as Obama came into office he called
for sharp acceleration of programs and
they are now according to the Pentagon
accelerated by three years and should be
deployed within a few months that's a
part of Washington's radical violation
of the UN Charter and of course the
Security Council resolution which bans
any threat of force these are parts of
the over threat of force and
Israel's case as well it is the US and
Israel were supposed to carry out air
operations planning clearly planning for
posed as a threat for to Iran that was
kind of undermine when Turkey pulled out
of it refusing to join in the end these
violations of international law one of
the reasons why turkey is being slapped
on the wrist for its disobedience these
days but those were the reactions of the
three countries to whom against whom
resolution 1887 was directed Iran has
rotten government nobody doubts that and
certainly nobody wants Iran to develop
nuclear weapons or anyone else for that
matter but it's easy to see why the
world outside the West just doesn't take
seriously
Washington's professions of concern
about these matters and the same is true
of Washington's profession the West's
professions of concern about human
rights in Iran not a terrible repression
undoubtedly but by the standards of US
allies in the region not very bad so
it's not as bad as say Saudi Arabia or
Egypt Egypt has a brutal dictator
President Mubarak and Obama made clear
his attitude towards human rights when
he visited the Egypt for his famous
Cairo speech for which he was
magnificently praised he was asked what
he had to say about President Mubarak
and his answer was I don't like to use
labels for folks when ippolit politician
uses the word folks you kind of get
ready to shutter something Awful's
happening and he continued I don't like
to use labels for folks so I wouldn't
call him Authority
arian in fact he's a force for stability
and good in the region yeah okay you
wonder why the world collapses and
ridicule outside the West when they hear
the United States talking about concern
for human rights in Iran and in fact it
is most of the world outside the West we
don't hear about it because we are
carefully protected from the events of
the world by an information system
designed for that purpose media
commentary and so on so very few people
know that when you read that the that
Iran is defying the international
community by enriching uranium very few
people know that the term international
community means Washington and whoever
happens to agree with it so the majority
of the countries in the world the
non-aligned countries most of the world
have repeatedly and vigorously endorsed
Iran's right to enrich uranium within
the framework of the non-proliferation
treaty of which it's a member unlike the
u.s. allies Israel India and Pakistan in
fact very few people know that the
majority of the American people are
excluded from the world - they also
endorse that right or they did as of a
couple of years ago when the last polls
were taken it's very likely different
now because of the go haven't seen a
poll because of the massive propaganda
campaign to demonize Iran and portray it
as a major threat to world peace that's
been going on for the last few years the
that's the world and it in it's
necessary to be very delicate and
reporting things so for example one of
the most maybe one of the most or one of
the most popular leaders in the world is
President Lula of Brazil and he's also
Washington's fair-haired boy in South
America he's supposed to be the moderate
as compared
with the bad guys who are going farther
left so it's been necessary for some
time to suppress the fact that Lula has
been quite openly and strongly
supporting Iran's right to do what it
wants within the bounds of the law
including develop developed nuclear
power enriched uranium it became if Hugo
Chavez says something like that you know
huge uproar we expect of this demon
but when Lula says the same thing even
more strongly have to suppress it if any
of your going into journalism you've got
to learn these lessons it became pretty
hard to suppress in the last few weeks
when President Assad visited Brazil so
then yes you had to report it and
admonish Brazil for stepping out a line
but in fact relations between Brazil and
Iran in fact South America in general
and Iran have been improving trade
relations and others because the world
outside the West simply doesn't follow
us orders the way it's supposed to it
used to because it was terrified to do
anything else
but the world is getting more diverse
and the Godfather is losing his clout to
some extent so it's necessary to kind of
suppress what's happening though it is
happening there's a lot more like this
so take say thee there's a lot of talk
to remember a couple of weeks ago Obama
announced that he was going to
reconfigure the missile defense systems
in Eastern Europe which were regarded by
the Soviet Union by the Russia it's not
so anymore regarded by Russia as a
threat to its security with justice if
you read us arms control journals you'll
find that US strategic analysts like say
Theodore Postol
over at MIT recognized that these
so-called missile defense systems would
have to be construed by the Russians as
a threat to their security there's a
good reason for that a missile defense
systems are not for defense
their first strike weapons and that's
understood everywhere I mean if they
were work they're not going to stop a
first strike but it could conceivably
stop a retaliatory strike so they're
effectively a first strike weapon and
that's understood by strategic analysts
on all sides almost in the same words
well Obama did agree to reconfigure
these systems and move them somewhere
else and there was a big debate about
whether that was a sellout to the
Russians or whether it was as he said a
better way to defend the world against
the threat of Iranian missiles and
nuclear weapons that was the debate does
the debate make any sense I mean I
suppose Iran had missiles and nuclear
weapons it could it used them as much as
loaded a weapon the country would be
vaporized and the ruling clerics have
not evidenced any wish for mass suicide
and destruction of the country that they
pretty much own and in fact the US
intelligence analysts on specialized in
the Middle East
consider the threat of an Iranian attack
with missiles as so small that you can't
even evaluate it if they're developing
which maybe they are it would only be as
a deterrent an effort to deter a
threatened very openly threatened u.s.
Israeli attack the u.s. is not quiet
about this openly threatening attack
Israel even more so in fact Israel is
sending Israel happens I have nuclear
nuclear submarines capable of carrying
nuclear tip torpedoes at gift of Germany
and it's openly sending them through the
Suez Canal with the agreement of
the force for stability and good
President Mubarak sending them through
the Suez Canal into the Gulf as a threat
to Iran saying you know if you if we
don't if we want to we can wipe you out
and you won't be able to do anything
about it
so yes the threats are constant and
continuous and but those are coming from
the rogue states the only states that
regularly resort to violence and the
threat of violence
who else is occupying two countries in
the region and illegally occupying other
territories who else constantly carries
out aggression in the region and other
violence I mean Iran hasn't done it for
probably two centuries but the United
States and Israel do it constantly so
yeah there's a good reason for the
Security Council to be concerned with
preventive diplomacy in the region and
for others concerned with preventive
diplomacy to be concerned to that
particularly the ones here because we're
right at the heart of it we're at the
heart of the use and threat of the use
of force and the threat of force in the
region nobody else begins to compare
just think it through these is kind of
an intriguing feature of our
intellectual culture that these matters
cannot be perceived I mean it's not that
they're profound or hidden on the right
on the surface you know completely on
the surface but they can't be perceived
that is a revealing indication of the
strength of the grip of imperial
ideology which is comes naturally in the
West history the West for hundreds of
years sort of second nature so much so
that it literally cannot be perceived
though again there's absolutely nothing
concealed about it well let's turn to
the other major trouble spot in the
israel-palestine what's President
Obama's contribution to that Obama has
made actually one major speech about
Israel Palestine it's when he introduced
george mitchell as his negotiator now
mitchell is a good choice for a
negotiator he was also george bush's and
he's got a good record he was prominent
in negotiating the the peace in Northern
Ireland which is no small achievement I
happened to be in northern in Belfast a
couple of weeks ago and I had been there
in 1993 in 1993 it was a war zone
you couldn't park your car you know
there were security forces all over the
place people were afraid to go from one
area to another because of the threats
literally a war zone and this time it's
peaceful on the surface like for an
outsider like me it looks peaceful how
and of course the people all look alike
you know so you don't identify the ones
that were in conflict however as soon as
you travel around a little bit than with
the guidance of people who know Belfast
you see that while it is a vast
improvement over what it was which is
attributed to George Mitchell and Bill
Clinton and Tony Blair the the division
the problems still remain not far below
the surface the fact that still is a
regular low level of terror low nothing
like what it was but the divisions
remain is very little intermingling
among the two populations unionists and
nationalists and you see driving through
Belfast you know a wall of a building
with a big painting on it saying this a
loyalist area meaning don't enter here
or enter at your risk unless you're one
of us
the mystic is kind of still there but
they're not violent they're much less
violent
in fact they when I went in 1993 I was
my wife and I were taken from Dublin to
Belfast by a young woman who was a
Catholic a peace activist in North in
Belfast and she is now a minister in the
government on the way she had as she
managed to get us to visit with an IRA
hitman who was on the run he'd escaped
from British from British jail so it was
kind of you know secret place and a lot
of security and so on I spent a couple
of hours talking to him basically asking
one question what do you think you're
achieving by killing Protestants his
answer basically was basically I'm not
achieving anything he killed my cousin
they killed my cousin
I'm going to kill their uncle and then
they'll kill my brother and that's the
way it is well a couple years later he
was on the negotiating team now he's in
the government okay things can change
no unchanged for the better and Mitchell
had a substantial role in that the real
reason it happened is because the
British finally recognized that if you
want to deal with terror and IRA terror
was not a joke you better pay some
attention to its roots the terror is you
know it's criminal but it's based on
grievances a lot of those grievances are
legitimate and they should be dealt with
terror or not and if you do pay some
attention to the grievances you'll
reduce the terror and they finally
agreed the respond to terror not by more
violence but by paying attention to the
grievances and it worked and there's
been a tremendous improvement and that's
an important lesson of preventive
diplomacy if you like well let's go back
to the Middle East so Obama introduced
Mitchell and he made a speech and he
said
the United States wants to bring about
peace through diplomacy and negotiations
and he said fortunately there's a
there's a very constructive proposal on
the table from the Arab League the
proponent he was referring to the
originally the Saudi proposal which was
adopted by the Arab League and then
adopted by the Organization of Islamic
States which includes Iran and the
proposal calls for a two-state
settlement on the international border
which has been the international
consensus for 35 years
blocked only by the United States of
Israel but that's something else were
not supposed to know the so they
endorsed the international consensus and
they went beyond it in the Arab League
proposal by saying well in the context
of establishing a political of a
political settlement establishing two
states the Arab states should proceed
towards normalization of relations with
Israel okay
so Obama referred to the proposals and
very constructive at them on the head
and then urge the Arab states to live up
to it by beginning to normalize
relations with Israel well you know he's
an intelligent man he's literate he
knows that's not what the proposal was
the proposal called for normalization of
relations in the context of a two-state
settlement kind of a corollary to it so
Obama mentioned only the corollary
omitting the content which tells
everyone who has a gray cell functioning
that he intends to continue with the
u.s. policy of extreme rejection ISM
that is blocking a political settlement
I wish the u.s. in fact been doing ever
since it clearly ever since 1976 when it
vetoed a Security Council resolution
calling for a two-state settlement done
you know full guarantees for the peace
and security every state in the region
and so on put forth by the major Arab
state
time and continuing on I won't run
through the record but it's been a very
consistent record of leading the
rejection front of blocking diplomacy
and Obama was saying okay we're going to
continue with that very clear that's his
one major speech on the least there was
also in a quite an important speech by
John Kerry air senator head of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee who's
been one of Obama's active agents and
negotiating in the region Young and
Kerry had something is the Brookings
Institute a couple of couple of months
ago Kerry gave the usual picture the
standard picture virtual party law and
Exceptionalist the United States is an
honest broker but that's true by
definition no matter what's going on the
u.s. is an honest broker trying
desperately to seek peace and human
rights and it's been sort of caught than
this is trying to get these two sides
together and Israel has been desperately
seeking a legitimate partner for peace
and it's never had one but Kerry went on
to say at last Israel may have a
legitimate partner for peace namely the
Palestinian Authority and he then gave
the reason the reason was that during
the attack on Gaza a year ago which we
call an Israeli attack but that's a
mistake it was a u.s. Israeli attack
joint attack during the attack on Gaza
which is a violent brutal murderous
attack there were no protests in the
West Bank and the reason was that
there's an army in the West Bank run by
a u.s. general general Keith Dayton and
that army was able to suppress any
protests okay so we've got enough
military control over the population of
the West Bank so they can't even protest
when the other half of Palestine is
subjected to a vicious assault so maybe
at last Israel has a legitimate partner
for peace dayton's army is trained
with this with support of Israel and and
Jordan and it's not the most violent
army in the West Bank the most violent
of this Satan's armies under State
Department control supervision so
there's some constraints on what it can
do kind of weak but non-existent but the
CIA is running its own military forces
their general intelligence and the
presidential guard and they have no
constraints what the CIA does is
anything you like reports from there are
that those are the the worst state
terrorist forces so at last we have
Israel has a legitimate partner for
peace and we can proceed with our plan
for peace now right now Obama and Prime
Minister Netanyahu we're calling for
negotiations and the Palestinian
Authority is dragging its feet and so
that shows maybe it's not such a
legitimate partner negotiations are from
a good thing the better than killing
each other but negotiations presuppose
something what are the negotiations
about you can't enter into negotiations
or they're not about anything okay so
what are they about in this case well
there are two views of that one view is
that of the entire world outside the
United States in Israel the negotiations
are about a two-state settlement on the
international border okay which the US
and Israel have been blocking for 35
years so that's one possible topic the
other topic is the u.s. Israeli policies
in the territories
maybe negotiate about them well what are
they well they're very clear the
policies first of all are to break Gaza
from the West Bank there's no basis for
that in law or anything else they're
just the two parts of what's left of
Palestine but they're treated quite
separately now by the United States and
Israel and that's kind of important
because that means if there ever is any
kind of
entity it won't have it'll be trapped it
won't have any access to the outside
world which it would if it were in Gaza
and Gaza was allowed to develop to be
have a seaport and Airport and so on so
but if it's just the West Bank it's
completely trapped in within hostile
forces so first break Gaza from the West
Bank second turn Gaza into a prison in
fact a maximum-security prison where you
just torture the population in ways
which are really sadistic like just a
couple of days ago to tighten the siege
your siege is of course an act of war to
tighten the seeds blocks anything but
just bare survival you know us Israel
don't want the population to die like
flies that would look good so keep them
alive somehow
but make sure they can't really survive
so the water supplies are destroyed the
sewages powers destroy the trickle of
goods get in just a couple of days ago
the Israel tightened it a little more by
closing the entry point that follows
which is the place where cooking gas
gets into Gaza so now no cooking gas
Egypt cooperated yesterday by closing
that terminal it took at the Egypt in
Arafah preventing diesel fuel from
getting in
so there's continued to strangle the
population meanwhile drive them away
from the borders so this constant
bombardment another terrorist acts by
Israel along the borders which drive the
population inland depriving them of
arable land and making the maximum
security prison even worse and also
driving away from the Seacoast so the
Israeli Navy in the last seven or eight
years has just been driving fishing
boats out of Gaza in territorial waters
and right up to the shore which
essentially destroys the fishing
industry because after the Israeli
destruction of the power and Su
and other facilities the pollution on
the shores so outrageous that you can't
fish there so just drive them inland
keep it keep the keep it tightened make
the situation worse and worse and just
we'll see what happens
that's the Gaza the prison in the West
Bank the policies are very explicit
there's a wall
snaking through the West Bank it's
called the separation fence it should be
called the annexation wall it's about
far higher and much longer than the
Berlin wall and its purpose is very
explicit it's to ensure that Israel can
annex the valuable territory in the West
Bank the water resources which happen to
be behind the annexation wool arable
land and the pleasant suburbs of Tel
Aviv and Jerusalem the place is kind of
similar to where I live say Lexington
the nicer burbs of Boston which happened
to be in the West Bank Hills so let them
take that also take the Jordan Valley
which is about a third of the territory
so that the rest is in prison and in
what's left that the us-israeli
settlement programs if you look at a map
cut through what's left with said ends
at one east of Jerusalem which pretty
much bisects the West Bank and two
others farther to the north which kind
of break up what's left what's called
Jerusalem is actually a greater a great
area way beyond Jerusalem and Israeli
actions there which you read about every
day in the press you know kicking out
our families building and so on those
are not only illegal but doubly illegal
all settlement in the West Bank is
illegal all settlement that has been
recognized universally including by
Israel since late 1967 as Israel began
the settlement programs and after the 67
war its highest legal authorities highly
respected international lawyer there may
runs its Attorney General and so on
inform the government that all of this
is in violation of international law
the defense minister Moshe Dayan who was
in charge of the occupied territories
agreed he said yes it's in violation of
international law but States violate
international law so we'll do it to
which you can do as long as the
Godfather says it's fine so those are in
violation of international law that's
all the settlements and Jerusalem
Greater Jerusalem doubly because that's
also in violation of explicit Security
Council resolutions
barring any change in the status of
Jerusalem
but as Diane said yes we can violate
international law freely as long as our
patron provides military economic
diplomatic and ideological support
that's us and that will and then in the
little territory that's left the
hundreds of checkpoints are put up
mainly for harassment to make it say
impossible to go and an ambulance from
one place to two miles away to a
hospital and just to make life
impossible following a principle that in
fact Moshe Dayan stated explicitly back
in late 67 minister in charge I said too
we should tell the Palestinians that
they will live like dogs and whoever
will leave will leave and we'll see
where that turns out so that's the u.s.
Israeli policy it's being implemented
right before our eyes and meanwhile
Obama is talking about settlement
expansion which is just a diversionary
tactic doesn't make the slightest
difference where they expand settlements
or not they're all illegal and they all
break everything up so if you can focus
on expansion maybe people forget the
real problem namely the settlements and
all of this is designed to ensure that
there can't be any political settlement
that allows any meaningful national
self-determination to the Palestinians
and the 22% of the
tear of Palestine that technically
they're supposed to have under
international law well those are the
policies right before our eyes I haven't
talked about the the constant regular
brutality and sadism which is serious
but that's the diplomacy and Mitchell is
bound by it there's he's not given any
gently maybe perfectly good negotiator
he has no opportunity to do anything as
long as the United States remains
committed to those policies well there
are things that can be done in fact one
good suggestion was made by Amnesty
International it's now considered in the
United States and Israel a kind of a
radical left organization but hope we
don't talk about that
in the several Human Rights reports
about the u.s. Israeli war in Gaza they
call it an Israeli war but that's
politeness in the have been quite a few
human rights investigations and one of
the most important of them hence the
least publicized was an Amnesty
International report which went through
the weaponry that was used in the attack
on Gaza found of course that almost all
of it comes from the United States
including white phosphorus another
high-tech weaponry and it called for an
arms embargo on both sides
well can't call an arms embargo and cos
because no state publicly leaps provides
them with arms but you can call for and
of course most overwhelmingly that means
Israel so they called for an arms
embargo on Israel for good reason
because it's actions violate
international law and u.s. shipment of
arms to Israel violates US will the u.s.
loss quite explicit that arms cannot be
sent except for the purpose of defense
and of course this is it I might say a
word about that Israel of course claims
that all the actions I described are in
self-defense
but you know that claim is meaningless
everything that
a state every state when it uses force
reflexively says it's for self-defense
like when Hitler invaded Poland it was
to defend Germany from the wild terror
of the poles and so on if you can find
an exception to that in history it kind
of be interested so to say it's in
self-defense is like saying two plus two
equals four
you have to ask is there any merit to
that claim well is there let's take the
separation fence going through the West
Bank and what does that have to do with
self defense
I mean if Israel wanted to build a war
that would keep wall that would keep it
secure it would build it on the border
it would make it impregnable you know
mile high tanks on all sides this is an
annexation wall has nothing to do with
defense but take the attack on Gaza its
uniform in the United States including
the human rights reports to say yes
Israel had the right to attack it has a
right to defend itself against Hamas
rockets there is no there is a right of
self-defense that's true everyone agrees
that state has a right of self-defense
but that's not even the issue the issue
is that which is never discussed did it
have a right of self-defense by force
okay that's different from a right of
self-defense
now international law is quite clear on
that as it's common sense you have a
right to use force himself defense if
you've exhausted peaceful means
that's a precondition well the US and
Israel not only didn't exhaust peaceful
means they refused to try them and they
refused to try them because they knew
they were going to work there were clear
peaceful means that could be used in
fact there had been a ceasefire that was
called in June 2008 and Israel concedes
publicly that during the ceasefire there
wasn't a single Hamas rocket so okay and
Israel broke the ceasefire in November
by sending troops into the Gaza Strip
and killing a bunch of Hass activists
and then rockets started in response but
then Hamas continued to offer to renew
the ceasefire and the Israeli cabinet
considered it we have the public record
and decided not to and the u.s. of
course never mentioned it
well that alone completely undermines
any claim to the youth to the right of
force if they fired one bullet into the
Gaza it would have been a crime that
quite a permit but the discussion is all
about disproportionate use of force
which again an evasion you don't talk
about disproportionate use of force
unless there's a right to the use of
force in the first place which there
wasn't then if you go case-by-case there
are no security issues of course there
are security issues but they're largely
self-generated because there are
opportunities for peaceful settlement
well the United States has been blocking
them and continues to block them and so
does Obama and that's another good case
for preventive diplomacy
as we get microphones out I'd like for
people to think about questions they
have for professor Chomsky again
focusing on the Middle East focusing on
the first term of Barack Obama focusing
on George Mitchell's role
they're also focusing on the role of
Hillary Rodham Clinton who's playing an
interesting role in this whole quote
unquote peace effort do we have
microphones one right there we have a
second right there please raise your
hand if you'd like to ask a question and
please make certain that once you get
the microphone you speak right into it
so we can hear your question please
raise your hand first
let's start right down here terrific
speech um it seemed after 9/11 that
Bush's policy with Israel largely fell
under the war on terror and there's a
lot of support with it kind of fell into
the axis of evil scheme and all that how
would you relate that to the rationale
of the Obama administration in terms of
how they relate to Palestinian
self-determination Israel's response to
terror what not about the same it's hard
the war on terror is a kind of an
interesting concept what we are supposed
to think is that George Bush declared a
war on terror in after September 11th
that's not quite accurate here II
declared a war on terror the war on
terror was declared by Ronald Reagan in
1981 as he came into office he announced
and his administration announced that
international state-directed
international terrorism is the plague of
the modern age returned to barbarism in
our time it's going to be the core of
our policy and then they proceeded to
deal with it by carrying out massive
terrorist wars
which practically destroyed Central
America killed over a million people in
southern Africa and supported the
invasion of Lebanon just a massive
terrorist war so that's kind of out of
history because we're not supposed to
talk about our terrorism so therefore
that terror that war on terror is kind
of submerged
what about Bush's war on terror about
the same it has almost nothing to do
with reducing terror is real you know
9/11 happened it's bad it was a real
crime actually if you try going to Latin
America you may find that people call it
the second 9/11 the reason is there was
another 9/11 September 11th 1973 in
Chile which by any objective standard
was much worse I can go through the
details if you like and we know who was
responsible for that people like Henry
Kissinger and others so yes there was
massive terror 9/11 our 9/11 was another
one and if you want to if when there is
a case of terror a major crime there are
ways to react to reduce the terror and
they were understood so in the case of
what we call 911 second one if you
wanted to reduce if your goal was to
reduce terror which would have done is
use the options that were available so
for example the jihadi movement which is
a broad movement was highly critical of
Obama Osama bin Laden and 9/11 there
were fad was coming from them you know
the radical clerics and al-azhar
university kind of you know the main
Islamic Center condemning bin Laden and
al-qaeda for this and if you wanted to
reduce the threat of terror what would
have been done is to exploit the
opportunity to break up the jadi
movement you know to separate this
violent militant element from its space
of support okay that's the natural way
to reduce the threat of terror that's in
fact what Mitchell succeeded in doing in
northern
instead the u.s. decided to escalate the
threat of terror by welding the jihadi
movement back together at first by
attacking Afghanistan then by attacking
Iraq that's exactly what happened so for
example the evasion of Iraq it was
predicted but so every Intelligence
Agency that it would increase the threat
of terror for a very simple reason
terror doesn't come out of nowhere you
know it's not because people decided I
want to blow myself up there's there's a
background for it and the background are
grievances and sometimes the grievances
are legitimate as in northern island so
if I mean one of the leading and by
terror and Iraq I'll come back to this
intelligence agents predicted it with
the invasion would increase the threat
of terror as indeed it did far beyond
what was anticipated so using
quasi-governmental statistics
terror increased by a factor of seven
two big jump the year after the invasion
of Iraq of Iraq as anticipated but more
and we can go through other cases a
protection of a population from terror
or other violence is usually a low
priority of States not a high priority
and that's true of the United States as
well so sort of down there somewhere but
not a major priority that's easy to show
furthermore what do you do about 9/11
itself what was criminal act when
there's a criminal act the first thing
you do is try to figure out who
perpetrated it it wasn't so simple in
this case about eight months later the
head of the FBI after the most intensive
international investigation in history
said that the the FBI was still unable
to really pinpoint the blame they said
we believe the word that was used that
the plot may have been hatched in
Afghanistan what was probably
implemented in the United Arab Emirates
and in Germany okay so that's what they
believed
eight months afterwards
well okay if you're trying to carry fine
perpetrators of a criminal act you go
beyond your beliefs until you're pretty
confident who carried it out and then
you work to apprehend them if it's an
international case you get international
support which very easy in this case and
then bring them to a fair trial that
doesn't mean want anima or Bagram well
that's the way to deal with criminal
acts assuming you want to reduce terror
okay if reducing terror is not your
concern or a very low concern then you
do the kinds of things that were done
now use force and violence to achieve
your other objectives that's I could go
on with many other examples so as you
may know there was a 9/11 commission
that was formed over the objections of
the Bush administration but was formed
to high-level commission to recommend
means to reduce the threat of terror and
if you look over they recommend that
they reconstituted themselves later
because they were quite angry that none
of the recommendations work we can't
being carried out and if you look yes
they weren't being carried out so for
example one of the recommendations was
to fortify the border the Canadian
border
that's the poorest border for the United
States I mean you and I could cross the
Canadian border with a suitcase with a
small nuclear weapon in it and you just
go through the forests basically
unguarded border so one recommendation
was okay reinforce the border
well the Bush administration responded
by reinforcing the border namely the
Mexican border which was not considered
a threat because the threat that the
people who are fleeing from the effects
of NAFTA and the u.s. terror in Central
America the the need to keep them out as
far higher than the need to protect the
people in New York from a nuclear
explosion and it goes that way
step-by-step I mean governments are not
the benevolent agencies their power
systems they carry out policies in the
interest of those who dominate and
control them and protecting populations
is a low priority
Israel's a case in point could have
security but prefers expansion thank you
another question yes sir right here do
we have a microphone right down there
place right up there what worries me is
what's going to happen in this country
Obama raised such exaggerated
expectations such great hopes in people
precisely because he wasn't unknown I
recall reading that approving peasant
was asked why he voted for a particular
candidate for presidencies
he said because I know nothing about him
and I'm afraid that's what happened in
this country people voted for Obama
because they knew nothing about what he
was going to carry out and it's a very
dangerous situation when you raise
exaggerated high hopes and they did -
them down you know what happened in
France after 1968 the goal came back to
power with a vengeance the Labour Party
disappointed people in in the 60s and
the facture regime came in harder
disappointing people this country we've
got Reagan what's going to happen it
seems to be starting right now when this
exaggerated hopes are dashed down who we
have real dangers here and how can we
fight that yeah you're quite right and
in fact his Obama and his campaign
managers made sure you would know
nothing about him or very little about
him and if you look back at the campaign
the slogans were hope and change what
hope for what you know what change well
at that point it kind of evaporates why
hope and change well you know campaign
managers are intelligent enough to read
polls and they knew that 80% of the
population thought the country is going
in the wrong direction okay hope and
change in fact those were McCain's
slogans - except he didn't do it as well
Obama made it
Merilee because the financial
institutions who are of enormous power
in the country mainly thanks to Reagan
and Clinton the they preferred him to
McCain so they poured money into the
Obama campaign way beyond McCain and
that's the core of the funding and yes
he managed to make it you know over to
win the election and it shouldn't come
to a surprise to anyone who knows
anything about American political
history that they're being paid off just
take a look at the front pages every day
I'm the big problem for the big banks
now is that the profits and the bonuses
are so high that they're getting a bad
press and also have to figure out some
way to conceal it by taking them in
stocks instead of money so you're kind
of borrowing money from the public
instead of stealing it no so sure
they're getting paid off for having put
Obama in office but the other programs
are well you know what's happening to
them is probably a nice man I don't know
but that there shouldn't it's just as
you said there should be no surprise
they were very careful to keep it quiet
and that's characteristic of US
elections the u.s. elections are a
facade I mean they are run by the public
relations industry who market candidates
the same way they market toothpaste and
lifestyle drugs I mean when you see an
ad on television you know you're not
supposed to believe it you know it's not
an attempt to inform you the way it
would be in a market system it's a way
to create uninformed consumers will make
irrational choices exactly the opposite
of what you're taught in an economics
class about markets but business spends
huge amounts of money to undermine
markets by constructing uninformed
consumers who are supposed to make
irrational choices and the same
institutions PR institutions run the
campaigns and they market candidates the
same way they want an on
informed electorate that'll make
irrational choices and in fact as maybe
you know Obama won an award from the
advertising industry for the best
marketing campaign of 2008 they beat out
Apple Computer and if you read the
business press executives were euphoric
they said you know best we've done since
we since Reagan when we sort of were
able to market him now we have an even
better achievement it's going to change
the atmosphere in corporate boardrooms
in new ways of behaving and portraying
ourselves and so on yeah that's the case
and what one technique is if you really
want to create an uninformed electorate
you have to keep issues off the agenda
and there's a second reason for that on
issues both of the political parties are
commonly well to the right of the
population so it's important to keep
issues off the table make sure people
don't know what they are so yeah you're
quite right and what will the result
likely be and Mike well my suspicion is
an erosion of the base for the Obama
campaign because people will be
disillusioned they shouldn't be but they
will be in it's understandable and a
very significant backlash there's a
major group of huge group of people in
the country who feel they have serious
grievances the grievances come back go
back to the 1970s the shift of the
economy from production to finance which
a huge shift at the place primarily
under Reagan and then Clinton and of
course Bush even workstream and that's
left a lot of people out in the cold
majority of the population have seen
their wages and incomes stagnate for 30
years their benefits decline
you know services decline infrastructure
collapse and so on and they're not happy
about it and they want to know why is
this happening
if you listen to talk radio you get a
good sense of it which I do my drive I
listen the the the standard person is
saying something like you know I'm I've
done everything right I'm a hard-working
decent white Christian done everything
right why is this happening to me well
who's going to give them an answer
they're not going to get an answer from
the Republican Party saying yeah that's
the policies we designed to shaft you an
enriched couple of rich people and
they're not going to get an answer from
the Democratic Party saying well that's
pretty much our policy - except maybe
not as Extreme so they get an answer
from Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck who
tell them well why I got an answer it's
the rich liberals who own the banks and
run the government and on the media and
don't care about you people to fly over
people they only care about the rich
folk and on the two coasts they want to
give everything away to illegal
immigrants and you know the unworthy
poor and so on so yeah that's your
problem well you know if that's the only
answer you're going to get people are
likely to believe it and we've seen we
had experiences like this it's
unfortunately reminiscent of late by our
Germany where there were also were
people with grievances and they were
getting an answer crazy answer horrible
answer but happen to take over with
consequences we know about I'm not
saying that's going to happen here but
the similarities are not insignificant
wait a question in the back yeah as it
becomes more apparent that our
leadership is complicit with Israel in
its occupation by sending three billion
dollars a year in military aid and as
the demographic in East Jerusalem is
changing more rapidly with housing
evictions and shakes Iran still on in
other neighborhoods and like the Israeli
left is shrinking and shrinking and
getting gradually smaller do you find
hope in the boycott divestment and
sanctions movement that's been growing
in the world or do you feel that
that there's other ways of assisting and
ending the occupation and other problems
in the region well I think the
development of the sanctions movement
reflects an understandable and in many
ways appropriate reaction to what's
going on but it has some problems that
we ought to think through the sanctions
movement is directed against Israel
okay that absolves the United States but
the United States is the prime actor in
this Israel can go just as far as the
u.s. permits it to and as far as the US
provides the essential support so
tactics are supposed to be educational
and this one is Mis educational it's
direct it's in fact a gift to the United
States saying that's those terrible guys
over there now a sanctions program can
be effective and sensible but it has to
be formulated properly BDS is called
boycott divestment sanctions that's a
pretty blunt instrument you can use it
effectively you can use it badly to be
used effectively first of all it ought
to be directed against the right target
and it ought to be done in a way which
the population which can be which is
defensible which the would take the high
moral ground not be indefensible
for example it shouldn't be obviously
hypocritical for example if you boycott
say an Israeli dance group may make
Israelis feel bad but it's totally
hypocritical why not work out a u.s.
dance group saying well US has a far
worse record of violence and aggression
you're boycotting an Israeli dance group
because you get away with it there that
we can't do it against the United States
too strong and tough but anybody can see
that that's just total hypocrisy on the
other hand something like say the
Amnesty International proposal that
makes a lot of sense calling for the
u.s. to follow its own laws you know
and stop sending arms to Israel first of
all it's directing it against the right
target namely us and we should always be
primarily concerned with ourselves and
that happens to be the appropriate
target anyway and it's completely
defensible the u.s. Auto live up to its
laws and that opens the door to an
educational program and make it clear
that the u.s. is violating its own laws
international law by sending arms to a
country that's engaged in direct
aggression not using it for defensive
purposes this is the first time a human
there have been cases in the past where
human rights groups like Human Rights
Watch have suggested that the u.s. live
up to its own laws by not sending arms
to Israel because there are laws that
bar sending arms to laws that engage in
systematic torture as Israel does but
this is much more extensive this is
calling for an overall arms embargo and
it's coming from an impeccable source
Amnesty International and they have a
very good reason and a defensible reason
and one that can be you know can be
justified and can be used to as a wedge
to get people understand the situation
so that's a sensible PDS program others
are - so for example a boycott of say
arms manufacturers or caterpillar which
is just create destroying the occupied
territories yeah that makes a lot of
sense but you just have to craft these
things so that they're sensible it can
be done actually the case of South
Africa is a very interesting one that's
usually suggested as a model but you
should really pay some attention to it
I'm the BDS program against South Africa
it really took off by around 1980 that
was at a point where nobody was
defending apartheid Congress was passing
legislation against supporting a mayors
were getting arrested the press was
against it and so on and it was after
decades of
educational programs that got people to
oppose apartheid okay at that point a
BDS program made a lot of sense and it
was effective the Reagan administration
which was a criminal administration
beyond the norm had to evade
congressional legislation in order to
continue to support its South African
allies and I was no small business as I
mentioned it led to the killing of
probably over a million people in the
neighboring countries
well that was important and in fact to
finish up on South Africa but a lot of
the lot of analogies are made between
Israel and South Africa I don't think
many of them hold up very well one
reason they don't hold up is that South
Africa needed its black population its
African population badly they were its
workforce Israel doesn't want the
Palestinians be happy if they would
disappear
that's one crucial difference and it's a
difference in the policies that are
followed but there is something to be
learned from the history in South Africa
by the early 1960s South Africa was
beginning to become a pariah state and
there wasn't a boycott campaign but
there's a lot of condemnation of
apartheid and there were votes in the
United Nations you know overwhelmingly
against apartheid and so on as that was
that the South African nationalists
reacted pretty much the same way
Israel's reacting we're right the world
is wrong they don't understand this all
we need is an information campaign to
explain to the world that everything we
do is wonderful and perfect and that's
pretty much what's happening now and it
went on for a long time but a South
African the South African foreign
minister made a very interesting comment
as to comment to the American ambassador
this must be close to 50 years ago he
told the American ambassador yes the UN
is voting against us but it really
doesn't matter because you and I know
there's only one vote
the United Nations yours okay and as
long as you're backing us it doesn't
matter what the rest of the world say
and he was right and the history showed
it as long as the United States
continued the back of them they could
get away with whatever they wanted then
matter if the whole world objected
didn't matter of Congress passed
legislation against them
as late as 1988 the Reagan
administration condemned the African
National Congress Mandela as one of the
more notorious terrorist groups in the
world
that's 1988 actually as you may know
Mandela was just removed from the
terrorist list a couple of months ago
that's 1988 within about two years the
United States changed its position for
reasons we could debate but anyway it
did change its position Mandela was
allowed out of the prison at Robbins
Island there were moves towards
overcoming apartheid with a couple of
years the system was gone all it takes
is that one vote which happens to be the
only vote there is in the United Nations
that's what it means to have
overwhelming power and that's a hopeful
sign it's not the only case there are
other cases like that too and it means
we can really do something if we want to
but we're going to have to focus tactics
on what the United States does not what
somebody else does another question yes
right here
hi um I have a sort of two-part question
the first is with the increasing
fear-mongering towards the Iranian
regime it seems like an Israeli
airstrike it could be quite possible and
if that happens I think the United
States stands to lose more just because
we have our troops in both Afghanistan
and Iraq if that happens or if Israel
and the first could you repeat the first
part understand it it seems as though
there's an increasing chance of an
Israeli airstrike on your own increasing
Oh an airstrip the threat of an air
strike on Iran right yeah and if that
happens I think the USA can lose more
than Israel would just because our
troops are far closer how do we stop an
Israeli air strike when they claim that
they're fearing for their existence and
my second question is our negotiations
with Iran have consisted so far of us
demanding that they stop how can we
expect this to be a negotiation if we're
not willing to budge on our issue on any
issue if we're not willing to budge on
any of the issues if we haven't offered
or we haven't asked them what they want
in return and all we're doing is
demanding that they stop well as far as
stopping an Israeli air strike is
concerned that's fairly straightforward
the u.s. just has to tell them you're
not going to do it okay
then there won't be an Israeli air
strike and put teeth into that statement
which of course the u.s. can do u.s. is
providing the armaments providing the
state allow for transit you know in fact
it's happened like last summer for
example summer 2008 so you're a half go
right in the midst of the presidential
campaign you know the most sensitive
moment AIPAC fees main Israeli Lobby was
trying to get Congress to pass a
resolution calling for a blockade on
Iran well that's an act of war
that could have led to a war and they
had gotten a lot of support a lot of
Congress people were lined up and
signing all of a sudden the campaign
ended there was no indication of why but
it must have been that they just got a
message from the White House saying we
don't want to war now so call off your
boys and the campaign ended right in the
middle of a campaign very sensitive and
that's happened over and over I'm in
Israel and it's lobbies here know that
they can go only so far they can go as
far as the u.s. lets them if they tried
to do something to do as really opposed
they'd be in serious trouble and they
understand that they're not suicidal
either so yeah we can stop it by putting
an end to our support for it there are
on threats for that matter and you can
it's not a 100 percent guarantee but
pretty pretty safe prospect as for the
negotiations it's not very clear what
they're about actually we're going to
try to prevent your Iran from exercising
the rights of a signer of the
non-proliferation treaty as we're
insisting well we can insist on that but
we certainly can't expect the world to
go along with us except for Europe which
you know follows obsequious leave behind
but outside Europe the world doesn't
accept that that's why you have the kind
of statement I quoted from President
Lula Brazil and the non-aligned
countries which continue to support that
right if we want to negotiate with Iran
got to offer them something and what we
should offer them is first of all that
they should have their rights but also
the will put an end to the effort to
exclude them from the world which is
serious it's quite serious like we now
have laws in the United States which bar
international banks from dealing with
Iran
we can't legally do that but again when
the Godfather says it it happens so the
banks don't want to lose under the
Patriot Act for example if a bank is
violating the u.s. sanctions it can be
barred from action within the United
States
that's pretty serious risk for some
international banks oh sure they follow
well okay we could offer opportunities
for Iran to enter into the world system
which I think would also be a help to
the Iranian reformers I mean it's just
the harsher we are in our treatment of
Iran the easier it is for the ruling
clerics to get the population to huddle
under the umbrella of power for you know
for defense and we know that perfectly
well you know after 9/11 okay everybody
was willing to accept you know harsh
restrictions you know support the
government and so on yeah other others
react that way too so I think there are
steps that can be made they're not
guaranteed to succeed but we should at
least begin by putting an end to the
hypocrisy you cannot praise President
Mubarak of Egypt as a force for
stability and good and then in the next
sentence condemn the Iranians for a
harsh treatment of protesters and expect
people not to crack up and laughter
outside the highly disciplined West
which of course you know does what stole
so there's there steps that could be
made if there were serious diplomatic
interests we have time for just one more
question from this side yes hi my
question is early in your talk you
talked about the threat of Iran being
exaggerated how it's not as big of a
threat as the world and the Middle East
is making it seem to be and then later
you talked about how no-one is emitting
to supplying arms to terrorists in Gaza
and Lebanon but you also implied that
somebody Iran is doing so so and they
have
so how is that not a threat to the
Middle East and to the world how is it
not a threat if Iran violates say
international agency resolutions and so
on
Oh surprising terrorist organization
well that's an interesting notion -
according to the United States and it's
obedient allies the United States is
supporting terrorist organizations
okay well ask yourself is that true I
mean which of the terrorist
organizations I mean they're presumably
they're providing arms to Hezbollah and
to Hamas are they terrorist
organizations well I mean Hezbollah is
called a terrorist organization because
it drove Israel out of southern Lebanon
okay maybe it carried out other
terrorist acts maybe not but the main
charge against Hezbollah is it drove our
ally out of an illegal military
occupation of southern Lebanon where our
ally was there in violation of Security
Council resolutions went back 22 years
you know they did drive him out
they also defended Lebanon when Israel
invaded it's six that's v invasion in
2006 okay terrorism from one point of
view not from others we can't expect the
world to accept our condemnation of that
as terrorism
what about Hamas yeah I must say the
Hamas Rockets are criminal acts no doubt
but we're not going to you can't expect
rational people to accept the charge
that charge if they know as we prevent
ourselves from knowing that there's a
very simple way to stop those acts
namely accept the ceasefire in fact
there's a more general way pointed out
by near rosen who's one of the best
reporters of
in the region a very fine reporter he
was asked he was on Amy Goodman's show
Democracy Now a couple of weeks ago and
she asked you know what can we do to
stop Muslims from killing us as well
stop killing them okay stop killing them
maybe they'll stop killing us not a bad
answer so sure the Iran is undoubtedly
supporting Hamas and Hezbollah but you
know as compared with what we do it's
like a toothpick on a mountain I mean
whatever you think about from us that
Kerry had nothing like the violent
murderous acts of Israel and Egypt which
we strongly support and the same with
Hezbollah they've defended Lebanon and
you may like him or hate him that's
really irrelevant but there maybe
they've involved in something like for
example there one of the charges against
Hezbollah is that they carried out a
suicide bombing in 1983 at which the US
Marine base in Lebanon well actually
probably wasn't Hezbollah which you look
at experts on the topic they point out
as well I barely existed then it's
probably somebody else but whoever it
was was it a terrorist act I mean the US
military base in Lebanon was being used
to bomb an attack Lebanon that was the
time when the US Navy right off shore
was bombarding the hills over in Lebanon
in support of our our allies in a civil
war a response to that action is hardly
a terrorist act so you really have to
ask yourself who are the terrorists you
know they're not nice people and I
wouldn't admit him but in fact they
happen to be pretty popular in Lebanon
it here organism you have to be very
careful not to believe what you read in
the American press Curley like right
right after there was an election in
Lebanon a couple of
a couple of months ago and if you read
people like say Thomas Friedman or
everyone else they were just overjoyed
Friedman was the most extreme as usual
he said you know tears come to my eyes
when I hear about free elections and on
and on
he said the Lebanese people had a free
choice and they voted for Obama and
against doc Medina jawed course the
us-backed coalition won the majority of
votes in the parliament what he didn't
tell you and what the American press
didn't report is that the majority vote
went to the Hezbollah backed coalition
they got 54% of the vote of the roughly
half of the population of voted and
because of the sectarian system in
Lebanon which is a residue of French
colonialism the Shiite population is
very much underrepresented
underrepresented so you believe in free
elections the festival out back
coalition won in fact won pretty handily
but if you really hate free elections
which is standard here then they didn't
because the way of manipulating the vote
that put them in the minority of the
legislature so that you know you can't
really say that they're an unpopular
group in Lebanon in fact the legislature
just recently authorized their retaining
arms well make some sense
I mean if Lebanon has a right of self
Lebanon has no right or self-defense
yeah then of course they shouldn't have
arms but if Lebanon does have a right of
self-defense then who else is going to
defend it against the next Israeli
invasion I mean not the Lebanese army
they can't do it if it's about like nah
I can do it but did do it so okay
nothing to do with whether you like him
or hate him but you should be a little
cautious about using the notion
terrorist organization particularly when
we happen to be in the state which is
guilty of far more terrorism than
anybody else you can think of
practically
before we go I'd like to offer a couple
of get to professor Chomsky the first
gift is a beautiful bookmark thanks to
our wonderful Dean of the School of
Education who's sitting in the back

grandchildren but one more this is from
