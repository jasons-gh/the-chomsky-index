and often heard objection against a
libertarian socialist society is that no
one would bother to work in it do you
think that's a valid objection what
about those that don't want to work well
it's an interesting concept actually
this is one of the things in which I've
differed for some time on the pair them
up with the Paragon people they
basically have the same view my cow work
Robin hanel and the others we've
disagreed about this for many years it's
question of what you think work is I
mean there is a point of view associated
with capitalist systems that holds the
work is a burden if you weren't driven
to work it prefer to vegetate I don't
think that has anything to do with human
beings and in fact it's kind of striking
that the people who hold this view most
of them come from the University or in
scientific backgrounds we they're going
to save the University where I work MIT
mainly scientific university people are
working 80 hours a day 80 hours a week
because they love their work and their
work is under their own control you know
of all the social institutions these
especially science-based its
universities are places where you really
do control your own work I mean you got
to meet some conditions but it's pretty
much controlled by participants so you
know optimally and in fact often
realistically and under those conditions
people just want to work but they're
carpenters who love what they're doing
and can control it they work all the
time and in fact you know there's an old
tradition from the enlightenment which
is came out grew into classical
liberalism and finally anarchism which
holds that work is the should be the
highest I'd one of the highest ideals of
life creative work under your own
control and I think most people know
that that's true we have an opportunity
to do creative work under your own
control
with especially if it has some social
purpose and so on and the best thing to
do is a lot better than you know lying
on a couch and watching a boring
television program so I just think it's
the wrong it's a concept of work that
comes out of capitalist ideology which
as people have to be driven to work
actually it's very interesting to watch
the debates about this it's debated in
mainstream circles not so much in these
terms but it take a look at the debates
about a taxing taxation of the wealthy
the standard argument against taxing the
wealthy is well if you put high taxes on
the wealthy they're not going to do
anything and they're the ones who invest
and make things happen and so on and so
forth now the people have pressed this
most are economists and sometimes it's
almost comical that was an article of
the major journals by a well-known
Harvard economist liberal economist Greg
Bank you wrote the major texts and he
argued he said look you can't he's kind
of a liberal he says he can't tax the
rich because they're not going to do
anything and then he did there's no
economic theory behind it or any other
theory but he just so he gives an
example of himself he says well if I
didn't have a high salary I wouldn't do
anything you'd never get anyone in the
university saying that except from an
economics before
and that's because the ideology is so
built-in they can't think they can't
look at the next office and see that the
guys in the lab all day because he loves
what he's doing of course people want to
want to do meaningful work especially if
they can run it themselves the Paragon
position that I've discreet with is they
want they believe that pay remuneration
ought to be proportional to input the
harder you work the more I should be
paid but I think that's a very demeaning
conception of non of what work is but
what human beings are like and I don't I
don't think it's true you know in fact
they themselves work very hard they
don't have paid work so are they
different from other people you know
if a person works on order let's say a
craftsman produces something on orders
or under coercion we may admire what he
does but we despise what he is because
he's a machine and we want people to be
human you find exactly the same thing in
Adam Smith incidentally one of the
reasons Adam Smith was very critical of
division of labor and he has an ode to
division of labor at the beginning of
wealth of nations would have E or on it
criticises at the end and he criticizes
because he says if we let division of
labor continue we will reduce people to
creatures as stupid and it's ignorant as
it's possible for a creature to be
because they'll simply be carrying out
mechanical operations under command and
a very limited domain and what you are
you know your intelligence your
understanding your your human
characteristics come from your capacity
or from the options available to you to
carry out independent productive
creative activities work included maybe
in free association with others because
we're social beings but not under
external coercion Marx himself complex
figure the early marks so you read the
philosophical manuscripts and so on the
you know this is coming straight out of
the French French and German Romanticism
so the kinds of ideas you find expressed
in Humboldt and then the more
libertarian side of her so resilient
self was very split but if you take the
libertarian as part of versatility
second discourse on inequality and
humbled and so on all of this was that's
the background that which marks grew up
and if you read the philosophical and
that kind of manuscripts of the early
period they're immersed in this so his
theory of alienation comes out of this
work the coerced labor is alienating and
counter to human nature
at the core in the nature again as a
kind of record later called by the cone
of an instinct for freedom that is a
need to become involved in free creative
activity free creative work so for say
Humboldt up one's work is sort of the
core of one's existence you want to be
involved in creative honest work in
association with others but voluntary
Association and not under external
control these things have mostly been
forgotten so being as the market systems
of the 19th century developed they
eliminated all of this they would have a
called Adam Smith no doubt you know the
market systems that developed because
they when you get the people I same
office and Ricardo and so on the
conception of human beings as freely
creative active people with intrinsic
rights due to their nature disappears
and people become nothing more they have
no values other than evaluate and what
they can sell on the market their labor
power if you can't sell your labor power
in the market you have no right to live
this way it was discussed because
there's nothing to a human being other
than what can be attained by sale of
labor power within a market system under
what become basically totalitarian
structures corporate structures and so
on so the modern extensions of classical
liberalism are very anti libertarian and
these eigen the ideologies change and no
the intellectuals change and so on so
this tradition has pretty much been well
if not wiped out at least marginal arts
but it's there and it certainly can be
revived it stayed alive and for example
in the anarchist tradition and in parts
of the libertarian left in the United
States you find traces of it as late as
real traces as late as people like John
Dewey probably didn't know any of these
things but just came out of it from
another source and you know
reach the same point and his conception
of democracy is a value because it opens
the opportunities for people to freely
liberate themselves as they must do sort
of core it isn't in the contemporary
world you'd be hard put to find much
discussion this is unfortunately but I
think it to be revived that he's very
easy
