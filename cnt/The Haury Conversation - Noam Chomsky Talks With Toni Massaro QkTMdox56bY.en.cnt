[Music]
good evening and welcome everyone my
name is John Paul Jones on the Dean of
the College of Social and Behavioral
Sciences and it's a pleasure to welcome
everyone to tonight's event
the Howry conversation Noam Chomsky
talks with Tony Massaro I am extremely
grateful to the co-sponsors of tonight's
event the AG nice nomes Howry program in
environment and social justice our
favorite local nonprofit art house
theater the loft cinema and Tucson
entrepreneur Don Martin
[Music]
[Applause]
the Howry conversation celebrates the
life and values of Agnes Nelms Howry a
noted traveler author and editor and a
woman with a means to make a dedicated
philanthropic commitment to social
justice human rights indigenous peoples
environmental protection journalism the
arts civil liberties international peace
and economic development and scientific
research especially archaeology and
dendrochronology her generous bequest to
the University of Arizona established a
unique program that leverages the power
of partnership between the University
and our community to address local and
regional manifestations of some of the
world's most pressing challenges these
include equitable access to life's basic
needs like food and education and
housing and health care as well as
enhancing community resilience and
dealing with water availability energy
demand and climate change the Howry
program supports projects designed to
serve marginalized communities but its
principles demand that these projects
are also authentic and co-equal and we
hope sustainable and scalable after a
few short years since its founding the
how a program can count on many
successes and many more are in the works
and I encourage you to visit Howry
Arizona ddu to learn more about her and
her ongoing legacy
tonight's conversation will touch on
topics that are dear to the Howry
program's mission and throughout will
have an opportunity to hear from and
engage with one of the world's most
influential activists but because of
that I ask that whatever your opinions
that you respect those of both our
guests and your neighbors in the
audience I will not however ask you to
turn off your cell phones for the
conversation after it's over we have
allotted approximately 45 minutes for a
question-and-answer session your chance
to ask professor Chomsky whatever is on
your mind well just about whatever is on
your mind and to submit your questions
just take your mobile device to WW slide
oh that's SLI do calm and type in event
code hashtag Chomsky 2017 and send us a
question and now it is my distinct
pleasure to introduce this evening's
moderator Regents professor Tony Massaro
she joined the faculty of UAE's James E
Rogers College of Law in 1989 and she
has held a Milton Oh repeat chair and
constitutional law for the past 20 years
from 1999 to 2009 she served as the Dean
of the College of Law and was the first
woman to hold that post
[Applause]
in 2006 she was named a Regents
professor by the Arizona Board of
Regents the Regents professorship is the
most is the most prestigious faculty
rank one can attain in the state of
Arizona recipients are chosen by their
peers for their exceptional achievements
and scholarship and teaching among the
works leading to her recognition were
dozens of Law Review articles on
constitutional law shame penalties and
law and emotion as well as two books the
Ark of due process in American
constitutional law published by Oxford
and Civil Procedure cases and problems
which is now in its fifth edition and I
should also mention that in addition to
her scholarship she is an eighth time
recipient of the teacher of Year award
from the College of Law
[Applause]
now I asked professor Massaro to
moderate tonight's event because of her
tremendous intellect but she is also the
perfect choice insofar as she serves as
the chair of the Howry program Advisory
Council a role in which she upholds the
highest ideals of mrs. Howry
so thank you Tony for all you've done
for the Howry program and for agreeing
to be part of tonight's event
professor Massaro is joined tonight by
one of the University of Arizona's most
recent faculty appointments
laureate professor of linguistics Noam
Chomsky
formerly of MIT the author of over 100
books and countless articles in his
field professor Chomsky is widely
recognized as the founder of modern
linguistics his ideas have
revolutionized that field of course but
they have also indelibly shaped
anthropology cognitive science childhood
education computer science the teaching
and study of languages mathematics
psychology philosophy and speech this
breadth of scholarship and innovation is
why he is the world's most cited living
academic
[Applause]
and I should add that his attraction to
the University of Arizona is first and
foremost foremost because of our
outstanding Department of linguistics of
[Applause]
course there is also Noam Chomsky the
public intellectual the self-described
libertarian socialist critic of
established politicians on both the left
and the right an ardent free speech
advocate Chomsky has published and
lectured widely on capitalism the media
the Middle East terrorism and war an
activist who has influenced millions he
is well known for his insightful
critiques of US foreign policy from his
outspoken stance against the Vietnam War
in his first political book American
power and the new mandarins to his most
recent book requiem for the American
dream those two works are mere bookends
to 50 other volumes he has published on
politics during his career a career that
it's not over for as I understand it two
more books are appearing this year for
his global impact in support of social
justice and the fight against
environmental destruction the Howry
programs donor-advised fund board was
enthusiastic and bestowing upon Noam the
title of agnese gnomes Harry chair which
is supporting his presence at the U of A
where he will be lecturing teaching and
consulting with graduate and
undergraduate students and for that
support I am eternally grateful to the
Howry trustees mary greer greg darien
and tammy barnett please join me in
giving a warm Tucson welcome to Regents
professor Tony Massaro and you a
laureate professor of linguistics and
Agnes Nelms how a chair Noam Chomsky
okay
so I want to be sure you can hear me so
kind
welcome to Tucson welcome to the U of A
he's been here before but never so
completely one of us we're delighted
that you and your wife are here so are
two so I want to start for the audience
to get to know you a little bit better
before we get into some of the
substantive themes and one would be if
you were reflecting on your own life on
who or what shaped you the most
especially as it relates to the theme of
social justice how would you answer that
question begins pretty early I was
growing up as a child in the 1930s
during the Depression deep depression my
earliest childhood memories are people
coming to the door trying to sell rags
something to try to survive I recall the
writing in a trolley car with my mother
passing a textile factory where women
were on strike outside being brutally
beaten by security forces most of the
family was first-generation immigrants
mostly unemployed workers with a high
level of cultural engagement partly
through the unions which are of course
very centers of activism education
recreation and so on partly just in the
general they were in New York General
New York
vironment they were part of the high
culture scene even though they were
quite poor and unemployed but the
objective circumstances were much
harsher than they are today but rather
strikingly my memory is that there was a
sense of hopefulness that's missing
today striking difference there was a
sense somehow we're going to get out of
this will work together they'll be a way
out there was a sympathetic
administration there were New Deal
programs that didn't end the depression
but they softened the edges and they
gave a sense that there is a way forward
the labor movement was mobilizing it was
the source of energy activism
hopefulness for the future all of that
was positive at the same time I'm old
enough to have listened to Hitler's
speeches over the radio on the Nuremberg
rallies not understanding the words but
there was no mistaking the the mood of
the of the crowd that was cheering and
you could see that step by step Europe
was succumbing to fascism
Italy of course had already had was
fascist well before I was born but
Germany Austria Czechoslovakia in fact
the first article I remember writing for
school newspaper fourth grade newspaper
I hope that it's disappeared and that
nobody will ever find this
but I remember the first couple of
sentences it was and it's easy to date
because it was the immediately after the
fall of Barcelona in February 1939 and
it started by talking about the fall of
one country after another Spain the next
Toledo of Barcelona looked inexorable so
that was and we were Jewish we happen to
live in a an area which was pretty
harshly at his Medic it was mostly Irish
from German in fact took me a while as I
grew up to get over a visceral fear of
Catholics yes again Irish kids down the
street when they came out of the Jesuit
school was raving Adi Semites later in
the afternoon things calm down play ball
and that's what I think that all of this
was an amalgam of on the one hand deep
depression but hoped for the future on
the other hand the sense that the world
is coming to a fascist cloud that
there's going to be no end there was a
dramatic period in many ways I'm
interested in the fourth grader writing
an essay on fascism I'm sure the
audience is too and and I really am you
know here's somebody whose whole career
is devoted to thinking about sinking and
language and I'm wondering if and and by
the way that essay that he wrote in
fourth grade became the subject of a
more major paper later at NYU you
discount your own genius but nobody else
does and I'm wondering if you can say
were you conscious of being a little
different from the other fourth graders
well actually that goes back to earlier
my parents were teachers Hebrew teachers
so very I think I was put in a nursery
school at about 18 months old 20 months
and I have memories of nursery school
just kind of standing there and
wondering what are all these kids doing
you know they all seem to be doing
something narced a bit but I was at UH I
was at a an experimental dewy-eyed
school run by Temple University had a
very progressive education department at
a very good school on Dewey grounds and
there was no it was a mixture of
students some of them from some of them
students who couldn't make out and the
behavioral problems in schools others
whose parents were oriented towards
higher education so a mix but there was
no sense of ranking it was not like when
my own kids went to school in the
sixties by the time of third grade they
were describing other kids as smart and
dumb you know the smart kids were in one
level class the thumb kids in another we
had nothing like that there was there
were no grades there were no of course
there were tests but they were just for
seeing how you're doing what you have to
do better and so on actually I skipped a
grade but nobody paid any attention the
only thing that was noticed is I was a
smallest kid in the class something else
that you've talked about that I think is
it's probably something that came
naturally to you but you you have a
definition of true science that I really
admire which is you said true science is
a willingness to be puzzled by simple
things you think that can be taught
I think that children have it it's not
so much a matter of being taught as a
matter of being driven out of your head
I think it's natural with children you
your own children or young children that
you deal with or couldn't puzzled about
everything in the world for strange
things are happening and it takes a
rigid system of indoctrination and
control to beat that out of people's
heads but the idea that but modern
science says did really begin with a
willingness to be puzzled about simple
things so he'd go back to say the
Galilean period the reigning you know
scholastic doctrines had answers to all
sorts of questions like suppose I
suppose this has boiling water in it and
I hold it like this and I let go as a
couple fall and the steam will rise and
there was an answer they're going to
their natural place I see you what what
am I saying there's a form that's going
through the air and getting into my
brain and that's how I see you
so we answered that question and those
were considered answers going back to
classical Greece when Galileo and others
decided to be puzzled about it and asked
why is the glass falling and the steam
rising how quickly are they falling that
would have stone and a feather fall at
the same rate and so on then you get the
beginnings of modern science and it's
the same in my own field back in the
1950s forties fifties there were but
we're considered to be answers to the
questions about the nature of language
in fact as a student as an undergraduate
in the 1940s the concern the students in
linguistics felt this is a lot of fun
but
it's terminal we know the answers to
everything is just a matter of applying
the methods we were taught to all the
languages in the world and then it's
over turned out when you began to think
about it you didn't understand anything
everything was a puzzle a lot of it
remains not only puzzles but deep
mysteries and that ability to take a
look at things that look obvious and say
well why is it that way which children
do have is I think actually the source
of creative modern science and it
certainly can be taught it's in fact
there's a famous physicist at MIT Victor
Weisskopf who was famous for having in
his freshman courses in physics if
students would ask him what are we gonna
cover this semester his answer was
doesn't matter what we cover or matters
would you discover then you proceed from
there if you learn how to question to
search to find answers and then you're
okay whatever you study well we're gonna
be puzzled by some very big and
seemingly intractable questions tonight
what holds them together is social
justice which as the Dean has explained
is a major theme for the hary program
but it's a big vague noun you know
social justice what is it to you well I
think it's captured reasonably well by
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights the social and economic
provisions the second part of the of the
1948 Universal Declaration especially
article 25 which lists the rights the
inherent rights that humans ought to
have health education freedom so on
that's a good encapsulation of
justice but it's and of course all the
countries practically all the countries
in the world signed up for
no one observes it but some more
cynically than others and it's a
unattractive feature of our own country
that it was rejected almost explicitly
so Jean Kirkpatrick the Kirkpatrick the
Secretary of State under the Reagan
administration when she was asked about
the socio-economic provisions of the
Universal Declaration simply dismissed
it as what she called a letter to Santa
Claus
Paula drove Bronski who's the assistant
secretary for human rights under the
first Bush administration later said the
idea that there are social and economic
rights is a myth that we have to dispel
and in fact if you look at the
comparative records of the wealthy
countries the OECD countries the richer
countries about 30 of them the United
States ranks very low
it's a ranks about 30th or 31st
alongside of Greece and Turkey
poorer countries which is astonishing
because we're the richest and most
powerful country in world history with
incomparable advantages and in fact
there are severe attacks on social and
economic rights proceeding right before
our eyes these are all issues that we
should be deeply concerned about some of
it may be structural the Constitution of
the United States as a negative rights
Constitution so the things that you name
is critical to social justice are not
constitutionally protected let's start
with you talk about health and and in
let's pivot to climate change and in
healthy environment there are some young
people who brought a lawsuit in which
they're arguing that there in that there
should be a constitutional right to them
as a future generation
to a world in which the environment is
inhabitable and safe but it's definitely
going to hit choppy water legally you've
talked about it you've talked about the
Doomsday Clock which was first set in
the 1940s please tell the audience what
that's what that clock is and how it
relates to the current status of our
environment the Doomsday Clock was
established in 1947 shortly after the
first and so far luckily only use of
nuclear weapons by a distinguished group
of physicists and brought in political
analysts under the auspices of the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists the
leading professional journal on nuclear
issues and it was set it's the the hand
of the clock is set a certain distance
from midnight midnight means terminal
disaster were finished the first setting
in 1947 was seven minutes to midnight
and then it's oscillated over the years
in 1953 it reached the point closest to
midnight two minutes to midnight that
was because the United States first then
later the Soviet Union that exploded
hydrogen bombs that signaled the fact
that human intelligence had reached the
point where we had created the means to
completely wipe ourselves out on
everyone else and after that it's going
up and back a couple of years ago about
two years ago it was moved that the
clock was moved forward to three minutes
to midnight and at that point for the
first time they took into account the
effect of environmental catastrophe and
the fact that it's not being both the
threat of nuclear war
which had been the earlier concern and
now the threat of environmental
catastrophe moved at the three minutes
to move midnight because the threats are
not being addressed last January
immediately after the inauguration of
President Trump the clock was moved
another half minute towards midnight two
and a half minutes close as it's been
since 1953 actually this is there's one
point when it was would have been moved
even closer that was 1962 the time of
the Cuban Missile Crisis would have been
moved to one minute the midnight but it
happened that the crisis was not at the
point where they made the annual
decision so it's not registered there
but in fact it's a important book about
the Cuban Missile Crisis called one
minute to midnight but that's that's
where we stand and I think frankly that
I just had an interview with The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists about this
and suggested that last march should
have been moved even closer to midnight
that was a remarkable discovery which
should have been on the front pages
everywhere but as buried a group of
quite distinguished scientists dealing
with nuclear weapons issue hans
christensen theodore postal a couple of
others published a very important
article in which they gave a careful
analysis of the nuclear weapons
modernization programs that are being
that are being carried out under started
in the Obama administration are being
now escalated under the trump
administration and they pointed out that
these programs had succeeded in
enhancing the killing capacity of the
u.s. nuclear weapons for
to the point where it could eliminate
any deterrent and they say explicitly
this is the kind of program that would
be used by a country that's planning a
nuclear first-strike will be able to
protect itself from any retaliation they
didn't argue that the United States is
trying that they don't think it is but
they say that any adversary would have
to consider this now the adversary that
everyone has in mind the only other
major nuclear powers the Soviet Union
and the Soviet strategists of course are
perfectly aware of this they they have
the very limited detection systems not
like ours our detection systems are
satellite controlled you can detect the
launch of a missile
there's our still radar control so
you're limited to the horizon they have
not much warning time at a moment of
tension and there are unfortunately
plenty of possible moments of tension
it's possible that strategic planners
say in Russia would conclude there's a
missile strike coming we better send off
all our missiles or we're finished and
in that in which case were all finished
and in fact if you look at the history
of the arms race that has come very
close quite a few times back in 1983 the
Reagan administration had initiated a
program called able archery you can look
it up on the Internet the idea was to
test Russian defenses by simulating air
naval and air and naval attacks on the
Soviet Union even including threatened
nuclear attacks and the point was to
make all this obvious so they would we'd
see how they'd react and then learn
something about their defenses well it
turns out they took it pretty
seriously when the Russian archives
finally came out it turns out not very
surprisingly that they were concerned
that there was an actual plan for a
missile attack and you take a look at
the US strategic analyst journals they
now say we came very close to war and
advertently right about at that time
there was in the Soviet we now know
there was in the Soviet Union a warning
of a missile of a US missile attack
there are automated systems incidentally
our automated systems fail all the time
other hundreds of cases where the
automated systems have warned of a
missile attack but there was human
intervention which prevented the the
response that's programmed no that's
happened frequently and our systems are
much more sophisticated than theirs so
we can be sure that they had many more
errors well there was such a case and I
think it was 1984 there was a warning of
an American missile attack by the
automated systems
there's the protocol is that it there's
a particular officer who receives the
information his name happens to be
stanislav petrov he is supposed to
transmit it to the higher military
authorities they decide whether to
launch a retaliatory strike he simply
decided not to transmit it he concluded
that there were not enough missiles
detected to make it look like an
authentic attack so he just made a
decision not to transmit the order
that's probably why we're here it
literally and it's not the only time he
died recently and some was recognized
for having done this year not the Soviet
Union he was not our artificial
intelligence might make that situation
worse because of may be programs that
intervene with
doubt that human judgment call but
before I have a follow-up on the nuclear
threat I want to go back a minute to the
to the climate change and I know you see
both of these as two of the most
important existential threats that we
face this is really a political question
can't we assume that everybody cares
enough about their children and their
grandchildren and beyond that they want
a livable world for them which would
mean to me an inhabitable climate
without extreme weather and rising seas
and the kind of environmental
disruptions that impair human life on
the one hand if that's reasonable to
assume then question one what explains
the persistent political divide on the
issue and and then the second part is is
if a lot of people believe things are
that bad that the Doomsday Clock is that
close why do they have children what
young people decide not to for exactly
that reason hmm no that's happened
before in the early sixties when the
threat of nuclear war seemed very severe
there were young people had decided
there's no point having children why go
on but these questions are very poignant
and severe right where we are it's not a
secret that we are the only country in
the world that is refusing to
participate in since last November that
will since last January in the
international efforts to address the
climate change a threat one of the
international meeting is convening right
now in fact cop 23 there were three
countries that didn't sign that that
opposed the Paris agreement of course
the United States said was instrumental
in initiating them under the Obama
administration but
the Republican Party not just President
Trump the entire Republican leadership
takes the position that we shouldn't do
anything about climate change you take a
look at the last primaries every single
candidate Republican candidate either
denied that what is happening is
happening or said the moderates Jeb Bush
Kasich said yes probably happening but
we shouldn't do anything about it
so case is just position that was yes of
course
anthropogenic human initiated climate
change is taking place but the way he
put it was we're gonna burn coal in Ohio
and we're not gonna polish ways forward
so we don't do anything about it
now there were three countries the
United States Nicaragua and Syria
Nicaraguan Syria had not joined the cup
22 the earlier negotiations Paris
negotiations Nicaragua hadn't joined
because they thought the conditions were
not stringent enough they wanted to be
much more correctly I think but they
finally joined Syria hadn't joined was
they weren't able to sell what send a
delegate now they've both joined that
leaves the united states and splendid
isolation not only refusing to
participate in the international efforts
to deal with this impending catastrophe
but even dedicated to escalate the
crisis by increasing the use of fossil
fuels and it's pretty remarkable to see
it's not just the administration that
just read the business pages of you know
not only in the United States the
Financial Times in London and the
leading world's leading Business Journal
pretty liberal in general attitude when
they describe the prospects for fossil
fuel production its euphoric
there's article after article talking
about the wonderful prospect you know
they just discovered a new field
somewhere new new deep digging deep
water exploration techniques will open
up new fields in the Gulf of Mexico it's
a great thing and so on with barely a
word saying that unless those fossil
fuels are left in the ground we're
doomed and it's pretty serious
just recently Steven chose the former
Nobel laureate in physics it was the
energy head of the Energy Department
under Obama gave a talk at the National
Academy in which he pointed out that
about a hundred and twenty-five thousand
years ago the earth had a temperature
just slightly above today's and at that
point there were perhaps roughly ten
meters of the sea level was about ten
meters for six to ten meters higher than
today
just imagine life in a planet where the
sea level was a couple of meters higher
than it is now he also pointed out that
800 million people live within about
thirty meters of sea coast and we're
facing a monstrous catastrophe unless
something is done quite seriously and
yet we're lagging behind in fact most of
the world is as well some countries are
doing better than others Denmark is
moving too close to a hundred percent
renewable energies China which is a
major polluters acting taking pretty
serious steps to cut back coal
production to move towards renewable
energy towards imposing a sharp
restrictions on automobile
pollution so on we're outliers at this
point not entirely because states and
localities are doing significant things
in many cases and individuals as well
but at the federal level we're the sole
country that is not committed formally
to trying to address this very severe
catastrophe and some of the things that
are happening are almost surreal there's
a Senate hearings that have been that
are taking place some president Trump's
latest appointment of nominee for a high
position and the environmental agency
heart wait I think her name is her view
is that to talk about climate change is
paganism the governor of your state
Wisconsin Scott Walker denies climate
change but he's willing to talk about
climate resilience so we're allowed to
plan for climate resilience meaning do
something to deal with the catastrophe
that's coming but we're not allowed to
call it climate change I mean this kind
of denialism is I can't think of words
to describe it it's utterly shocking
in fact November 8 was a pretty striking
date in that respect and of emerets of
course the date of the American election
at the same time in Morocco Marrakech
Morocco there was an international
conference underway cop21 which was a
follow-up to the Paris negotiations that
was intended to put incidentally the
Paris negotiations themselves at night
2015 were aimed at a verifiable treaty
but that had to be withdrawn because the
Republican Congress would not have
tolerated
so it had to be a voluntary agreement
which of course much weaker a couple 22
in Morocco was intended to carry this
forward on November 8th the World
Meteorological Organization delivered
its description of the state of the
climate and the threats and it was a
pretty dire warning that was November
8th after that the conference basically
pretty much terminated it turned to the
question of how the world can go forward
with the most important powerful country
in the world in fact most powerful in
world history pulling out of the effort
that's our responsibility it's very
serious going back to your question I
don't know the answer I don't know how
people can face this prospect see what's
going to be the lives for their own
children and grandchildren and not be
willing to dedicate themselves to it I'm
puzzled by that simple thing and they
you know you've alluded to two things
that I think might give us a little
optimism one is the cities and the
states that are reacting but there's
lots of reason to think that won't be
enough and I agree with you there
and then there are those who think
science can save us that there will be
strategies that emerge there but in the
short run the hary program you know this
is this terrific Tucson now based
program that's trying to act
strategically for our region and and in
the world say that you're on the board
with the people responsible for
allocating funds and grants and it's
it's not it's not open to them to say
there's nothing we can do and so they
want to intervene what advice would you
give them about how to choose among
projects in the short run to try to
advance this ball
well even something as simple as using
LED lights has a very significant impact
the the shifts of the transportation
system to public transportation would or
even to less destructive automobiles
would be a significant effect solar
panels for heating in a place especially
a place like Arizona with the sun's
shining all the time
it's kind of shocking not to see solar
panels everywhere on every house and
that can be done there are steps that
can be taken from the individual level
to the federal level to the
international level that can make a
major impact the optimistic part of this
is that we do have the capacity to not
to end the threat but at least to
significantly mitigated and to ensure
that there will be likelihood high high
probability that organized human life
can continue at a proper level we have
that capacity if we can use it I want to
pick up on something else that you were
talking about I mean it's it's it's
astonishing the retreat of the United
States from the Paris Accord but but
it's it's part of a larger phenomenon I
think and I'm wondering what you think
might explain it that the United States
has in so many respects now retreated
from globalism and there's been a
corresponding I think not unrelated rise
and populism and I'm wondering why now
with respect to the retreat we can look
to the travel ban to the wall to anti
sanctuary jurisdiction penalties the
plight of so many refugees including
environmental refugees the weakening of
the State Department and global
diplomacy
and other parts of the federal
government that are best positioned in
most cases to deal with things from a
national in an international perspective
what is going on well the United States
is an unusual country in many ways for
one thing that's it has by comparative
standards it's a huge country has
internal resources agriculture minerals
holman relatively homogeneous population
once the native population was pretty
much exterminated it's it's been able to
for much of its history though the
United suppose they buy by 1900 the
United States was far and away the
biggest economy in the world in fact
Richard them the next several economies
put together but it was not a major
actor in the world it was a kind of an
observer had its own conquered the
territory expanded some but it was not
the major international actors were
England France the United States was
behind the United States looked inward
and in fact as late as before the Second
World War let's say the 1930s if
somebody in the United States wanted to
be a physicist let's say chances are
they'd go to Germany or if you wanted to
be a writer or artist you'd go to France
you didn't stay here I mean I saw this
myself when I was started teaching at
MIT in the 1950s one of the things one
of the kinds of sort of I hate to call
it a course but the things that I were
teaching were fake courses where you
tried to teach graduate students how to
fake their way through reading exams
German and French and this went on until
the 1960s and it was a residue of the
pre-war period when the great science
was done in French and German if you
wanted to be an engineer physicist in
the 1920's 1930's he had to read french
of german by the second time of the
Second World War that was over the
United States then became preeminent
geopolitically many other respects so
the idea then of course students didn't
have to read French in German anymore
because everything was in English but
there was a kind of a lag you know took
about fifteen years before this was
finished but that's a sign of what the
country was like the country was a back
cultural backwater I know the Second
World War did change that but only for
part of the country part of it remains
what it was kind of internationally a
cultural backwater and we see that in
many different respect and many by
different many different measures and
it's showing up now and these almost a
cosmic level of threat of global
destruction it means there's a huge
educational effort required in the
United States to bring about an
understanding of the nature of the world
in which we live and you can see easily
why this should be the case I mean
there's no other country where you can
travel 3,000 miles and seem to be in the
same place from where you started you go
from Boston to Los Angeles let's say the
stores are the same the language is the
same the people look the same a little
bit of difference but not much if you're
in Europe when you go 100 miles it's
culturally different different language
and so on so the understanding that
there's a rich complex world is just
part of life
in most of the world but not here that's
partly just because of the history
immigrants came eliminated the
indigenous population spread over the
continent developed their own unique
life which in many ways was the most
advanced in the world
I don't have to tell you the US
Constitution as was well beyond anything
that existed in the world in terms of
progressive values at the time and
that's all on the positive side much of
it remains but there's a negative side
to well though there's also we're not
alone and and in this impulse away from
global partnerships and or in the rise
in population I think that's happening
in Europe as well but let me let me do a
few a few let me focus on a few things
that some people have suggested have
huge explanatory power in addition to
this we're a big island and we think of
ourselves as the center of the universe
that you've just named let's talk about
race you know there have there I think
of Tanna haha sees coaches the first
white president essay and the Atlantic
month monthly and Tana Hafiz thesis is
that race was doing most if not all the
work in the most recent election that
that's really what explains the
resistance to globalism and the rise in
population and so it's a race resentment
others would say and I would be one of
them
that don't forget about gender it's
consistently Elita dand discounted as a
contributing factor religion which
you've written about and observed is a
is a cultural Universal but face it
religion has inherent secessionist
aspect
to it you're faithful to the religion it
can mean defiance of collective norms
the authority of the secular world
mandates like non-discrimination all
these things may have been part of the
olio of things and and of just the brute
economic despair of some people in the
United States said we've had it we're
going in another direction what do you
what do you think about these possible
explanations for where we are right now
I think all of those are factors but
there's an overriding factor that should
not be ignored and that's simply
economic and political policy the
post-war period post-world War two
there have been really two phases of
social and economic policy the first
phase was what's sometimes called
regulated capitalism roughly second
world war up to the mid 1970s there was
the New Deal regulations were in place
in the financial system there were no
financial crises that banks were banks
there were places where you put extra
money and they lent it to somebody for
starting a business sending the kid to
college whoever it was there was a sharp
break the that was the highest growth
period in history sustained growth
period he got a fairly Galit Arian
growth the lowest quintile did about as
well as the highest quintile that was
cut there was a sense of steady constant
progress there was also progress on
social issues the civil rights movement
that developed error beginnings of the
women's right move rights movement those
early stages the environmental movement
all of this was taking place through the
1950s and 60s labor activism
was significant in fact rising by the
early seventies there was a militant
labor organizing by women in service
industries and so on as well as the
farmers workers and so on all that was
taking place one this essentially ended
by the late seventies really took off
under Reagan the same was happening
internationally of Reagan and Thatcher
we moved to a different phase the
neoliberal phase of the phase that
undercuts social commitments terms to
freed freed up financial institutions to
become monstrous investment oriented
predatory institutions not crisis after
crisis each worse than the last
essential stagnation for most of the
population and wages and incomes in fact
by 2007 which was the peak of success of
the neoliberal program lots of euphoria
about what was called the Great
Moderation everything's wonderful real
wages for American workers were below
what they were in 1979 when the
experiment began that's the that is the
background and that same pretty much
seems happening in Europe with the what
they call the austerity programs this is
all also led to a decline in democracy
as you as wealth an income concentrate
and much of the populations stagnates
and wealth and income that translates at
once into political choices and
legislation by almost obvious mechanisms
and it keeps the vicious cycle Moin
that's true
and what's now called populism like not
a very good term in my view but what it
is is a a general anger and contempt for
institutions which has plenty of
justification the institutions are not
working for people so they thought you
can see it in the electoral system so
the less the recent elections in Europe
almost everyone is an attack on the
centrist parties that have been
governing the center left center right
parties they're undermined you get the
forces on either side coming up same
happened here
the most dramatic aspect of the 919 a
2016 election a year was not so much the
election of Trump the nomination of
Trump it's not that surprising for a
billionaire with huge economic support
and massive media support to be
nominated as a party candidate a little
unusual but not off the you know off the
spectrum what really broke with a
hundred years of political history was
the Sanders campaign this is somebody
who came out of nowhere nobody knew him
I used the scare word socialist which
meant basically new dealer no financial
support no media support probably little
one the Democratic Party nomination if
it hadn't been for mation ations of
party managers might have won the
election that's completely a total break
from American political history which is
a history of pretty much bought
elections there's substantial academic
political science research which was
quite convincingly that a very a very
good predictor of electoral success is
simply campaign spending and so only
that's not true of President
the Senate and House very good study
that came out about a year ago from fine
political scientist at UMass Boston Tom
Ferguson and a couple of colleagues
who've done most of the work on this
they did a study of House and Senate
elections from mid-80s to the present
just asking to what extent can you
predict electoral success simply by
campaign spending and it's almost
straight line it's the kind of
prediction you rarely get in the social
sciences and that means of course not
just electoral success but legislative
programs the Sanders campaign broke
radically from that and it's similar to
what's happening and say the French
election where a candidate who came out
of also didn't come out of the political
system Mike Rome became won the election
and the major parties were marginalized
I think a lot of this is simply the
effect of the collapse of of the I
wouldn't say collapse but the turn of
political institutions to service to
thee to extreme wealth and corporate
power neglecting the population which
you see in all sorts of ways and
naturally that leads to anger and fear
irrationality the policies that can be
can be and sometimes are hopeful and
constructive but can be very destructive
as well its leading to in Europe what
sometimes called a liberal democracy
like Obama in Hungary where you have
democratic forms but really
authoritarian structures a lot of this I
think is simply the result of the shift
to the neoliberal market-oriented
programs with
diminish the role of individuals and
society in favor of concentrated wealth
and power which tend to escalate and in
fact if you take a look at Trump voters
it's they're mostly moderately affluent
petty-bourgeois the some working-class
but that's not the overwhelming majority
but these are people who feel that with
justice that things have stagnated we
there was you know it's partly myth but
partly reality there was a sense that
this that each generation is doing
better than the last we're moving
forward there's a better future and so
on that came to an end
it's we're not our children are not
going to do better than we do the
opportunities are not gonna be greater
except for us very small and shrinking
minority and that sense is overwhelming
and I think you can trace it to the
socio-economic decisions that were made
that shifted the nature of policy these
are choices they're not economic and
necessities the specific choices you see
them in the structure of the World Trade
Organization agreements which are
basically investor rights agreement
don't have to be that way there are
other ways for international trade to be
organized but this has been happening
now for a generation and the population
reacts now that's interacts with the
factors that you mentioned which are
certainly their race and gender the
religion and others are major factors in
the United States they take particular
forms related to our own history go into
well there's a lot in that I think
there's there's you're describing
beautifully a structural phenomenon and
driven by some
economic principles the neoliberalism
that you've identified in your work that
translates into the work or may produce
the the economic stratification and
despair but I wonder I don't think that
the average voter understands that the
average voter understands that there's a
image that's been used which I think
captures it very accurately it was
actually used by aurelie culture on the
sociologists have studied the Louisiana
bayous and tried to figure out what how
the people is a very sympathetic report
of people of people who feel this is
basically deep red you know Republican
people who vote for candidates who are
destroying the Bayou in which they live
but are themselves environmentalists
they want to preserve it to try to
figure out what's going on why are
people apparently voting under the
against their own interests at what she
comes up with as an image that the
people themselves accepted when she
interacted with them that we're standing
in a line behind us our parents and
grandparents they worked hard made a
better life made a better life for us
where we should be moving forward but
we're not the line is stopped ahead of
us there are some people going to the
stratosphere but that doesn't bother us
much you know what bothers us is that
we're stuck and why are we stuck because
the federal government is working for
the people behind us the immigrants
african-americans Hispanics people back
they're worthless people who aren't
really working the way we do and our
parents do when they're putting them
ahead of us so you get
this kind of attitude and that people
can understand they can understand that
weird that the line that we're in has
stopped moving forward there's a
interesting study that just came out
today yesterday i think maybe the
washington post an analysis that a
journalist went to a former Steel City
Johnstown Ohio which was a steel major
steel mining area and very pro Trump and
he was interested in finding out why the
people are the people how do the people
react to the fact that Trump has not
come through on any of the promises that
he made in fact he didn't go into it but
he's actually making their lives worse
how do they feel about that and the
answer that surprised him surprised me
is that they don't care they say we know
he's never gonna bring back the steel
mills we know the promises are all
nonsense but we don't care he expresses
our anger every crazy thing he does we
like because he's thumbing his nose at
those people who are our enemies who are
of who have made the progress stop for
us our town is over it's never gonna
reconstitute they'll never be steel
mills our children will go away it's all
collapsing we can't have the old life
that we thought were my have but at
least we can express our anger at the
people who are doing this to us a lot of
them they don't know who's doing it to
them I mean that's a different question
but but you can see it's a framework in
which scapegoating works very well and
the fact that we had a black president
was not a small factor the racism just
exploded that's why you have 25 percent
of Republicans thinking that Obama's
maybe Antichrist I think a majority of
Republicans forget the exact number I
think he's a
who came from Kenya you know things like
that a lot of it was just a reflection
of deep-seated American racism witches
goes right back to the origin of the
country's never been eradicated um I
wanna I want to shift I know we started
a little bit late now and I have time
for the audience but I recommend
everybody requiem for the American Dream
which is one of his more recent books
and in it
dr. Chomsky says that what we need is a
functioning democracy with informed
persons and I want to shift to how does
that happen
and given the disruptions in or that
where the the flaws in the marketplace
of ideas and freedom of speech model
your definition of a functioning
democracy includes the notion of
informed persons but let me just
challenge that with two clusters why
should we believe that freedom of speech
and persuasion are going to help promote
critical engagement and an informed
electorate today given two things or two
clusters of obstacles and the first one
is We the People we are poor thinkers we
don't seek enlightenment if there is all
the more studies that being that coming
out of the eye area suggest that
when we are you accepted but most of us
aren't in fourth grade thinking things
through in a careful way we have wildly
imperfect human brains we live in
information silos choosing the bubbles
and with our cognition weaknesses and
our confirmation biases the big and sand
and striking insight is that we're not
looking for facts we're not looking for
truth we're not looking for
enlightenment we're looking to be
entertained often or ass waged in some
way and we use information to persuade
other people and that's not necessarily
based on the facts so that's that's
cluster1 we're not good at thinking the
audience and cluster - you've written a
lot about the people talking to us sets
of them have distorting influences that
make it very difficult for us to extract
the truth
you're very critical of the mainstream
media the propaganda model of the
corporate mass media is something you've
written about there's every reason to be
skeptical of government if you don't
like an idea just cut off the funding or
if you think people shouldn't taking the
niaz on patriotic say things like fire
the SOPs third thing that you've pointed
out that I think is very worrisome - is
social media and under private control
they are the new sensors and and we may
not even know the extent to which
they're distilling information and then
finally sorry for the long question you
blame us campus leaders that were Craven
we've created architectural plans so
that large demonstrations can't be
possible we've hiked student debt
created debt peonage and have adopted a
kind of business model for a complicated
set of regions but that all these things
make it harder for the audience to get
good information in the first place even
if we knew what to do if we could think
straight through it plenty of plenty of
barriers go down but the point is
they're all surmountable every one of
these things that you mentioned is a
human decision and human decisions can
be changed you don't have to have
I'm a business model for the
universities is this a choice and a
decision can be eliminated there was a
time when I don't want to claim there
was a golden age there always were
plenty of problems but there was a time
when a public education higher public
education in the United States was
essentially free we were a much poorer
country in the 1940s and the 50s much
poorer than we are today
but education was pretty much free the
GI Bill gave free education actually
subsidized education to a substantial
part of the population incidentally
white male population that's a
reflection of the phenomena that you
were describing but a large part of the
white male population which never would
have gone to college was given the
opportunity to do so and it was
rewarding for them and it was beneficial
for the country even private colleges
were they weren't free but there was
nothing like today so for example in
1945 I went to University of
Pennsylvania Ivy League college it was a
hundred dollars a year that's what was
it maybe eight hundred dollars today and
it was very easy to get a scholarship
the the United States was at that time
very much like what many other countries
are like today other other countries
from rich to poor have a pretty free
higher education so Germany which is
maybe the most successful state
capitalist economy as your tire
education is essentially free a Finland
which has the highest records almost
every year in educational attainment
education is free right next to us
Mexico poor country Unum the
our education system is a pretty high
level of lecture theorem appreciated the
level of education but it's free now
rich and four countries can do it the
United States itself did it when it was
a much poorer country there's no reason
why that can't happen right now that
just has no economic
I feel compelled to add that's also the
morale act and they think the we are a
land-grant University and the idea that
these places would be created to serve
the community was born during the Civil
War era
with so if things can be very very bad
and there can be people who rise up and
say this is a sentence I'll say that
that's one of the achievements of the
United States was to create mass higher
education the land grant system others
the United States was really a pioneer
in the mass public education so it's
kind of shocking but we're now going
back to the back of the line yeah I'm
glad for your optimism there to say the
least
let me let me close this part with a
more of a fun question that comes from
my friend Tim good as soon I have in my
pocket a one-time golden key and it's
gonna allow you total access to a folder
in the bowels of the United States
government that's never and the archives
never been seen before
nobody's ever accessed it with a FOIA
request and the only rule is it that the
folder can't be about you all right what
folder would you choose and why a lot of
attractive possibilities
for example there were just recently
into new it was a new trove internal
documents released about the u.s.
involvement of the overthrow of the
government of Iran in 1953 but a lot was
apparently redacted it would be
interesting to see what wasn't told and
there are many things like that but the
the case that I would use the golden key
for myself and the puzzles me and Men
interests me in many ways
is the build-up to what has been
described as the most dangerous moment
in history which we already discussed
the Cuban Missile Crisis phrases Arthur
Schlesinger historian Kennedy confidant
quite accurately described the 1962
Missile Crisis as the most dangerous
moment in history how did it come about
we only have very limited information
about that some and it's tantalizing why
did Nikita Khrushchev decided to put
missiles in Cuba okay well a scholarship
pretty much agrees that there were two
major reasons the one was a major
terrorist campaign that the Kennedy
administration was waging against Cuba
Schlesinger's words the campaign was
bringing the terrors of the earth to
Cuba it was under the control of Robert
Kennedy he was it was his prime
responsibility was to organize a mass
terrorist campaign against Cuba it's not
much discussed here but it was pretty
serious and it was intended to lead to
an uprising
perhaps followed by an American invasion
in October 1962 that's when the missiles
were placed we don't know for sure that
the Cubans and the Russians
aware of all the details but it's quite
possible that they at least surmised and
perhaps knew that invasion was planned
to 19th in October 62 that's one factor
and the nature of this campaign is
pretty shocking actually something was
just released recently hidden in the
back pages when the the kennedy archives
were just released the assassination
archives that a lot of publicity about
that you know a lot of talk about what
sleazy operations were going on who was
doing this and that but there was
something hidden in there or which I
think was a something that really should
be pursued turns out that at one point
McGeorge Bundy who was the national
security adviser serious intellectual
former dean that impressive right not
really
forward former dean of Harvard he was
leading the liberal intellectual he was
asked about using chemical and
biological warfare against Cuba as part
of the campaign and he responded that he
thought that would be appropriate if we
could make sure that we're never
identified as the source I'd like to
learn a little more about that so
there's that's one aspect the other
thing that was happening was actually
sort of related to North Korea today
when first Jeff it came into power and
Russia a couple years after Stalin died
he understood that Russia could not
compete with the United States
economically it's much more less far
less developed country and the arms race
was an overwhelming burden which
prevented Russian economic development
actually North Korea to date is taking
the same position it's worth thinking
about the and what he proposed he
proposed that there be a mutual
reduction reduction of offensive
military weapons the United States
incidentally was way ahead in every
respect he proposed this to the Kennedy
administration and in fact even
unilaterally moved to cut back offensive
Russian forces the Kennedy Nation
considered it rejected it and initiated
the biggest arms growth in in history in
response well part of first choughs
placing the missiles in Cuba was
apparently an effort to try to
compensate slightly for this tremendous
imbalance those two years 61-62
it would be really interesting to
discover what the thinking and detail
was that led to these decisions and they
are decisions remember that's important
that led to the most dangerous moment in
history I think it would be extremely
interesting to find out what they were
thinking these are this was an
administration of you know the best and
the brightest as they called themselves
leading intellectuals Harvard MIT
intellectuals what were they thinking
when they made these decisions just like
today let me see if I can I don't yeah
okay
this is going to enable me to watch CNN
apparently that's not what it's supposed
to tone estimate yes sir can I take a
minute there's certainly no fear
anything we'll be right back
let me take this moment while we're
waiting for gnome to return so you won't
have to hear this at the end tomorrow
night at the loft cinema and in
specifically at the loft Film Fest
professor Chomsky will be honored with
the lofty achievement award he's
appeared in over 25 films so he is very
deserving of this award and in
recognition of the award there will be
in 25th anniversary screening of the
film based on his book manufacturing
consent and that event is if it's not
completely sold out it's almost entirely
sold out so if you want to make your way
over there tomorrow night I recommend
going a little early and seeing if you
can get one of the specially reserved
tickets next week in collaboration with
various community partners SBS is
co-hosting to featured events on women's
empowerment and human rights to coincide
with International Education Week the
first of these is a screening of the
documentary film the tent village by
Nelly Mia Abrams on Tuesday November
14th at 6 p.m.
ATS at the loft and that is also nearly
sold out and tickets a few tickets are
available on the lost website and then
secondly SBS is pairing up with YWCA and
a number of other community
organizations and partners to bring
international actor and activist and get
this you a PhD in molecular and cellular
biology
Dipti mehta who will present her
one-woman play honor confessions of a
mumbai courtesan
on Friday November 17th at 7:00 p.m. at
the temple of music and art and you can
find tickets there by going to our
calendar SBS dot Arizona slash Arizona
dot edu slash events and this is a
benefit for the YWCA and portions of the
proceeds will go to supporting their
important work for women and children in
southern Arizona and then finally I'm
pleased to announce that this coming
spring semester were thrilled once again
to offer the opportunity for community
members as well as undergraduates to
participate in the course what is
politics which will be Co taught by
Professor professor Chomsky and my
colleague professor Marv Waterstone now
you a students will have priority for
this class but registration for our new
SBS community classroom will open on
November 29th with the limited number of
seats available for community members on
a first-come first-served basis so keep
an eye on our website community
classroom Arizona edu and we'll release
more details about the course and how to
register okay so back to the show thanks
for your patience
[Applause]
so we have time for a few questions one
of them is are you gonna run for
president in 2020 and then there's a
little one in the audience who wants to
know if you can't speak how can you
think sorry if you can't speak how can
you think it's this question from a
seven-year-old and it proves your point
about kids doesn't it nor did the more
to the that's a tough to tough for him
to answer tell your child it's too hard
hmm so another one would be say a little
more about social media and the control
that the in the private hands of
information and what you think that
means for the future well social media
has had an interesting impact on our
social cultural and political life it's
been pretty well discussed I'm not
saying anything you don't know on the
one hand they do offer opportunities for
expression for reaching out other people
they're the main technique of organizing
these days they're the means by which
teachers communicate with their students
groups organize and form and interact
they provide options which unfortunately
often aren't used to attain it attained
in the to go to media sources
information sources that are otherwise
rarely available all of that is positive
on the other hand as it's been well
studied they do form bubbles people and
I think I do it myself I'm not blaming
others we tend to go towards the sources
that basically we
except that agree with their general
point of view that when you read a
newspaper whatever one thinks of the
main media you read the New York Times
releasing some range of opinion if you
go only to the sources that reinforce
your own views you do end up with sulfur
in forcing enclosed bubbles which
separate from one another and that's
been one of the factors that has led to
a pretty dramatic polarization in the
United States I mean you go back in 30
or 40 years if a person was a Republican
or a Democrat that didn't make much
difference you interacted the your
friends in or married all sorts of
things statistics are pretty striking by
now these are almost separate groupings
and the it's led to a degree of kind of
fanaticism connected with the political
labels and so there was recently uh an
interesting study of just Republicans
not Trump voters Republicans a majority
slight majority of connection with 2020
a slight majority said that if Trump
decided to delay or cancel the elections
they'd go along with it there was one
question that was asked was what do you
believe you know one of the sources you
believe that Trump was kind of up in the
stratosphere the major media practically
nothing even Fox News was low this is a
very dangerous phenomenon of almost
worship for a charismatic leader that I
felt all my life frankly and wrote all
my life that if the United States ever
had an honest charismatic leader we'd be
in deep trouble I mean
Hitler type someone who's not a crook
not a thug you know but dedicated
fascist leader I think the country it's
the kind of country that could succumb
to that and I think we've seen signs of
it over the years it's never happened
Joe McCarthy for example was just too
much of a thug Richard Nixon was you
know couldn't he just didn't have that
capacity but somebody might come I don't
think Trump is is either just too much
of a con man but somebody could come
along who could take this anger fear
sense of betrayal you know everyone's
against us and our lives are collapsing
Lee and organize it into a force that
could be extremely dangerous and I think
the social media one and their negative
aspect does contribute to that and when
you see when you were talking about all
the barriers that there are towards
developing an informed educated
understanding population that's the
basis for any functioning democratic
society this is one of them but we
should bear in mind that there's nothing
inherent about this I mean I mentioned
before at the beginning that in the
1930s much much more desperate period in
term in objective terms the working
class was an educator lot of large parts
of the working class were not only
educated and informed but really part of
high culture and that goes way back you
go back to the 19th century the early
days of the Industrial Revolution the if
Irish blacksmith in Boston may have been
illiterate had a little bit of money he
would hire a boy to read through him
well
is working and read to him men read what
we call classics that is contemporary
literature you take a look at the
fascinating literature from what are
called the factory girls the young women
from the forums who moved into the
textile factories around the Boston area
that's the beginnings of the American
industrial revolution mid 19th century
they had their own journals they
published the journals and the journals
one of the things that they were bitter
they bitterly condemned the industrial
system as did male workers as well which
was taking away their freedom turning
them into automaton to the control of
others they were selling themselves
instead of selling their products losing
their dignity and rights as free
Americans bitter condemn nations of the
industrial system and one of the
condemnations is taking away their
culture they had a live rich culture
there's a study of the British
working-class thousand-page detailed
academic study by Jonathan rose of just
the reading habits of the British
working-class he concludes they were
better educated than the aristocrats
there's nothing inherent in having an
ignorant population it's a very modern
phenomenon partly it's related to the
breakdown of unions which were a Center
for organization education cultural
activities activism and it can be
reconstituted I mean I've seen it all
over incidentally I should say that you
also see in popular Park populations
which have very little education that
they have a deep understanding of the
way the world works we have it in our
own history there was an authentic
populist movement in the United States
not what's called populism today
but the populism of the late 19th
century the radical farmers began in
Texas spread to Kansas other Midwestern
states became organized they wanted to
free themselves from the control of the
northeastern bankers merchants who were
basically dominating controlling their
lives and they don't they didn't have
much as you form allege ocation Muslim
probably barely went to school but they
had a very precise can accurately of the
social and economic forces that were
governing their lives and they organized
very effectively to try to overcome them
was finally crushed by force but it was
very significant maybe the most
democratic movement in American history
actually a lot of the people fled to the
north afterwards and became part of the
labor Democratic base of Canada part of
the reason why Canada has had more
progressive politics all of this is real
and can certainly be reconstituted we've
exported the wrong things a second
question that someone in the audience
had goes back to the the first set of
questions we asked you and it's about
your intellectual journey everyone knows
that your footprint in linguistics is
deep and abiding and you know one of the
one of the most important figures but
here you've had in all of this tonight
such an impact in the realm of social
justice and as a public intellectual why
didn't you stay in your lane Gordon
white what what what possesses you what
drives you to engage people on these
issues beyond your your narrow field of
expertise I haven't asked that
occasionally but I find it kind of
puzzling because
seriously the right question is why it
doesn't everyone do it
and if the problems are it's not deep
it's not quantum physics we can all
handle it we can all deal with it it's
of enormous significance for our own
lives the lives of people we care about
for the world for future generations
it's just hard to understand why it
isn't a leading factor and everybody's
normal than life for many people it is
should be for many more I told you he
wasn't a normal 4th grader so a third
question before we do the final one of
the night has to do with the young
people in the audience and or those who
may watch this later if they wanted to
pursue a path of of social justice what
should they be doing now and what should
they be studying where would you guide
them say it was one of your own
grandchildren coming to you and saying I
I very much admire the way you've lived
your life I would like to do it too in
these times and the ones that that lie
ahead what would you tell him or her
well I get a lot of letters from young
people asking pretty much that question
and I'm reduced to almost a form answer
nobody can give you that advice
these are things you have to understand
figure out for yourself there are many
different ways to live a very positive
very constructive life for yourself and
for others many different paths to
follow and just have to find out which
are the right ones for you college is an
opportunity should be at best an
opportunity to explore these options
that does this University others offer
many opportunities for exploration and
investigation I should say the one of
the most educational experiences I ever
had was
when I had a I was lucky to get a
postdoctoral position at Harvard for
four years in which I just had a a desk
in the Widener Library a great library
and just walking around the library and
exploring was opening seeing the
treasures of human thought and
civilization in front of you just isn't
opens up endless prospects for journeys
and investigations and that's only one
kind of work there's plenty of other
ways to live
which make a big difference in life so
you just have to find the right way for
yourself we differ and the last question
of the night I think you actually have
have have answered but let's ask it
directly what is why should we be
optimistic why should we be optimistic
why should we be optimistic we basically
have two choices we can we can decide
that everything's hopeless give up help
make sure that the worst will happen or
we can recognize that there are
opportunities there are significant
challenges there are ways of addressing
them whatever the possibility we can
grasp the opportunities maybe we'll make
a better world for ourselves and others
it's not a real choice
