the basic idea is to present a picture
of the world that looks kinda like this
there's there's us you know kind of big
happy family in the community the you
know the honest workman going off every
morning with his lunchbox his loyal wife
who's making the meals and taking care
of the kids the hard-working executive
who's toiling day and night and the
interests of you know his workers and
the community the friendly banker who's
running around looking for people to
lend money to and so on and so forth
that's us you know and we're all in
harmony harmony was a big word we're in
harmony we're all together it's
Americanism you might take a look at
that word Americanism it's an unusual
term it's the kind of term that you only
find in totalitarian societies as far as
I know so like in the Soviet Union
anti-soviet ism was considered the
gravest of all crimes you know and the
Brazilian generals had some concept like
that and II Brazilian but try say
publishing a book on anti Italian ISM
and see what happens in the streets of
Rome or Milan
I mean people won't even bother laughing
so ludicrous idea the idea of Italian
ISM or you know Norway is I'm or
something like that or it's just the
obvious of ridicule in societies that
have some kind of residue of a
democratic culture inside people's heads
I don't mean in the formal system but in
totalitarian societies it is used and as
far as I know the United States is the
only free society that has such a
concept maybe there's another one if it
might try it in place as you know but
anyhow Americanism is an anti
Americanism and unamerican ism and so on
these are concepts which go along with
harmony and getting rid of those
outsiders and all that kind of stuff
another part is simply to induce hatred
hatred and fear among people so it's a
diverse society you know you go to
Europe most places are pretty uniform
this is a very diverse society so it's
easy for propagandists just pretty easy
to get people that you know I hate the
guy next door because looks a little
different there
thing or another and huge campaigns go
on to instigate divisions among people I
don't tell you about this it's all so
familiar you go on but but these are
very natural techniques of social
control if you can't control people by
force you have to control their minds
you have to control their add it to
