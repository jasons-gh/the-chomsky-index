this year in the Democratic primary
there were two candidates a woman and a
black the african-american won the
election 40 years ago any of that would
have been totally inconceivable so
there's been a big change since the
1960s and that's very significant
whatever one thinks about the candidates
that's a tribute to the activism mostly
of young people in the 1960s and it's
aftermath the feminist movement which
radically changed the consciousness of
the country was in the 70s developments
in later years but these accusations of
in fact contributed to civilizing the
country quite significantly it's
striking that if you look at exit polls
the largest book for obama was on
younger people
and through this experience of visit on
its face so that's a matter of
considerable significance we should be
willing to put it into context this is
150 years after the formal declaration
of equality and notice that it's a well
it's a political victory it's not really
overcoming racism to see the how much
that's true simply take a look at for
example incarceration rates the US has
far and away the highest per capita
incarceration in any part of the world
where statistics mean anything that
since about nineteen eighty-two
increasing rapidly since 1980s I think
do with crime has been declining and
it's overwhelmingly black and to an
extent Latino that's a reflection of
much larger general problems in society
nevertheless it's a it is a historic
change that a ugly tradition of racism
that goes back to the founding of the
country has been significantly mitigated
to the extent that a black candidate can
be elected president
looking over a longer stretch the
hegemony of the United States in the
world system has been declining since
the Second World War at the end of the
Second World War the United States
literally had half the world's wealth
the war was very beneficial to the US
economy it ended the Depression
industrial production almost quadrupled
in a semi command economy and it not
only had half the wealth of the world
but
incomparable security controlled entire
western hemisphere to both oceans sides
of both oceans and control Middle East
energy resources and it would found the
decline and as decolonization said in
and the other industrial countries
recovered from the disaster of the war
it did decline by about 1970 the u.s.
share of world in work wealth was maybe
twenty-five percent and it stayed pretty
much like that since by the early 1970s
it was already clear that the world
economy was becoming what's called
tri-polar there was a North American
Economic Area european economic area
centered on Germany mostly and France
and an Asian Northeast Asian economic
area at that time centered mostly on
Japan including China with India on the
periphery and these Latin America
however was almost completely suppress
it went through a terribly violent
period u.s. imposed nasha national
security states neo-nazi style murders
dictatorships atrocities crimes and so
on and very little development that's
changing again Latin America for the
first time and it's in hundreds of years
in fact in its history is beginning to
take some steps towards integration and
independence
well Europe has been slowly moving
towards integration of course after
since World War two the world war two
was a watershed for centuries in Europe
had been a savage place in the world
Europeans were their highest goal was to
slaughter each other thirty years war in
the 17th century may have killed maybe a
third of the population of Germany it
was in developing this internal culture
of violence of savagery and the
technology for at these were major
factors in Europe's conquest of the
world well in 1945 that came to an end
Europeans understood that the next time
they played the game of mutual slaughter
it would be the end the means of
destruction had reached a point where
this phase of history was over and they
have begun to make moves towards
integration in the European Union NATO
which is distinct and the other means
how it's not you can see in the current
financial crisis what the achievements
in integration and what the limits are
the European Union has not been able
there is a division within the European
Union as to whether they should have a
union wide policy with regard to the
financial crisis or whether it should be
dealt with in terms of the individual
national economic entities and so far
it's the latter that's prevailed so
there is no unified approach to its own
steps but not not far this illustrates
since the only one of the great
advantages of the United States the
United States is quite different from
Europe in the United States the
indigenous population was eliminated
mostly exterminate and it was there that
probably the richest country in the
world back in the 18th century
by the end of the 19th century its
economy surpassed that of other
industrial societies combined and as I
said by the end of the Second World War
was overwhelmingly dominant I didn't
mention military terms in military terms
the united states that unique its
military expenditures are comparable to
the rest of the world combined has a
network of military bases all over the
world from which it can project force in
other words carry out intervention and
aggression it's a pioneering the use of
space as a tool of military action
against the opposition of almost the
entire world so that's on the side but
europe ooh one advantages the united
states has as a result of its history as
it is a homogeneous entity so yes
there's a national policy right or wrong
but at least it's as national the
general policy as to how to deal with
the financial crisis your split on this
and there are other US advantages
they're other respects in which the
future of Europe is is not clear Europe
the United States since the Second World
War has had a ambivalent attitude
towards the European unification on the
other hand it's favored because it's
extremely good for us business interests
if say IBM who wants to invest in Europe
it's much easier if there's a european
common market then if they have to
target investment individually for each
country
rules or so on has been tremendous
pressure that was large reason for part
of the reason for the marshall plan to
move towards a unification of europe as
a market and as an economic unit on the
other hand the united states always been
opposed to a European unification as a
political unit you go back to the early
days of the Cold War there was
considerable concern about what was
called a third force that is your might
strike out in an independent direction
something like say de gaulle's Europe
from the Atlantic to the Urals a force
which would be comparable of the United
States in fact even greater in economic
terms and might become an independent
actor in the world well that hasn't been
happened hasn't happened if I've one of
the purposes of NATO's to try to prevent
it from happening is one of the reasons
why the United States is so infant much
in favor of the adherence of the former
Soviet satellites into the European
Union and also NATO is that that is
expected to dilute the influence of the
center of central components of Europe
Germany and France particularly and
hence make Europe more amenable to US
influence and these tensions will surely
increase
oh my
anyone in Estonia or Eastern Europe is
naturally concerned about Russian power
for obvious historical reasons but
nevertheless I think that a move though
popular and understandable was a mistake
and it goes back to nineteen ninety in
the Soviet Union collapsed Mikhail
Gorbachev had a proposal the garbage F
first of all made a remarkable
concession astonishing concession he
agreed to let a unified Germany join a
hostile military alliance no estonia has
its history with Russia has its history
to the Russia was practically destroyed
but a huge cost by Germany alone several
times during the past century and to
permit a reunified Germany
enter into a hostile military alliance
run by the global superpower with the
military force comparable to theirs to
the world it's an incredible concession
but he there was a quid pro quo the
United State was in the bush number one
administration the Bush administration
agreed that NATO would not expand one
inch to the east that was the phrase
that was used that would in their view
and Gorbachev view he was the prime
mover leave open away towards a
cooperative interactions between the new
Russia and the West which would not be
an outcome of we rule and you obey but
rather of cooperation in addition he it
would also give Russia some strategic
depth for its concern a chiral concerns
about security given the history and
obvious realities Gorbachev also
proposed a nuclear-free weapons zone
from the Arctic to the Mediterranean
that would again have reduced tensions
increased security paved the way to
further the cooperative relations I
think that would have been a very wise
move that notice that that does not have
anything to do with say the Baltic
States joining the European Union yeah
they could have joined the European
Union the question is joining a hostile
military alliance that's quite different
for example Austria and Finland and
Sweden are part of the European Union
but not part of NATO not part of a
military alliance led by the United
States well in my view that was the
right direction to take unfortunately
when the Clinton came into office one of
his first acts was to back off on that
agreement one of his first acts was to
expand NATO to the east thereby and of
course the US flatly rejected the idea
of a nuclear weapons-free zone well okay
that naturally increased
tensions and potential conflict there
were also the imposition of extremely
harsh market discipline and Russia which
was favored by the bureaucracy they
enriched themselves becoming comparable
to the third world elites but had a
miserable effect on the society
practically destroyed largely destroyed
the economy killed millions of people
and all this was happening at the same
time and the u.s. under Clinton just
refused rejected Gorbachev's proposals
for more cooperative interaction and
move toward confrontation well that
became far more extreme under the Bush
administration second Bush
administration with the aggressive
militarism huge increase in the military
budget at the dismantling of arms
control agreements and much else and
that led predictably to an increase in
Russian offensive military capacity it's
going on right as we speak just I think
yesterday the Russian president
announced that Russia may install
missile bases in Kaliningrad we are very
ugly development and it's a direct
reaction as no one has any doubt about
that to the US insistence on installing
what's called an anti-missile system in
Poland and the Czech Republic components
of it now strategic analysts all over
the world including the United States
you can read it in the leading our arms
journals top military analysts point out
that those anti-missile systems are a
direct threat to the Russian deterrent
and naturally Russia will respond and
that increases the level of tension and
danger and so going back to the Baltic
States and NATO although though they're
joining NATO's understandable just it
would be perfectly understandable for
Latin American countries to join the
Warsaw Pact if it still existed for the
same reasons to protect themselves from
their
traditional invader actually here I
agree with the large majority of the
American population that the United
Nations should be supported and in fact
I agree with the large majority of
Americans that the United Nations should
take the lead in international crises
and that other countries say the United
States should follow the lead of the UN
majority in fact it may surprise you to
know that a majority of Americans
considerable majority favored abandoning
the veto in the United Nations so that
the UN will indeed be a force for
dealing with international crises and
problems now that hasn't that's happened
to a limited extent the United Nations
has been effective in some areas
but it's limited by the the United
Nations can go only as far as the major
powers permit it to go and that means
overwhelmingly the United States you can
see the limits of the United Nations as
simply in looking at votes so for
example just in the last week or two
there have been two major votes in the
general assembly one vote was on the US
embargo on Cuba the vote was 183 23 the
three where the United States Israel
votes reflexively with the United States
and Palau a small Pacific dependency
that's the way it's been for years the
world is overwhelmingly opposed to the
embargo which it's declared to be
illegal plausibly the Latin America is
completely opposed a large majority of
Americans are opposed to it but
nevertheless Washington and sits on
insists on punishing Cuba savagely for
its for what the was called in the early
60s in the internal record its
successful defiance of US policies going
back 150 years a couple of days later
there was another vote the General
Assembly remember the exact numbers but
it was an overwhelming vote in favor of
restriction on arms sales cross-border
arms sales there were two countries
opposed the United States and Zimbabwe
everyone else supported a few abstain
well okay that's finished it can't be a
member there can't be a cut back of the
lethal sales of arms leading to huge
massacres in the Congo and elsewhere
because the major superpowers opposed in
the Security Council we can eat directly
easily this is not uncommon in the
General Assembly on a wide range of
issues in the Security Council it's
dramatic up until in the early years of
the United Nations most of the vetoes
were from Russia and the reason is very
straightforward everyone acknowledged it
because the US was in such a world
dominant position that the UN did
whatever
said and the US was using it as a weapon
against Russia well by the night through
the 1950s with decolonization and
reconstruction of other industrial
societies that control declined the
first u.s. veto at the Security Council
was I think in 1965 by then the UN was
not under control now since nineteen
sixty-five you can easily check the
record the u.s. is far in the lead and
vetoing Security Council resolutions on
a wide range of issues Britain is second
and none of the other three
veto-wielding powers are even close and
that goes even as far as security
council resolutions calling on States to
observe international law which the US v
to France and Britain politely abstain
the and that and yes that of court
that's a symbol of controls that do
paralyze the United Nations in many
areas on the other hand where the great
powers and crucially the United States
agree they can and sometimes have done
important things the answer to this to
these this network of problems in my
opinion is for the United States to
become a functioning democracy by that I
mean a country in which not only in
which people vote the way they did
yesterday but in which policy reflects
the will of the population now the
population in the United States is quite
explicit on this about ninety-five
percent believe that the government auto
pay attention to popular opinion and
object to the fact that it doesn't about
eighty percent believe that the country
is on quoting now run by a few big
interests looking out for themselves not
for the benefit of the population and in
fact there's a very substantial divide
in the united states between public
opinion and public policy it's true one
international on the United Nations as I
mentioned it's drew on international
affairs its drawn domestic affairs
you look at exit polls yesterday you
find this according to the early ones
that for most people who voted a very
large majority in fact the primary issue
that concern them was health care that's
been true for a long time and it's not
surprising the US has the only
privatized health care system among
major countries and it's also the most
inefficient and with the worst outcomes
I mean us per capita expenses on health
care about twice as much as comparable
countries and the health outcomes are
among the worst in the industrial world
and people really suffer for that from
that that's not you know that's not just
statistics that's individual life health
care is basically rationed by wealth and
that's extremely cruel but people suffer
from it and don't like it and for
decades people have favored a national
health care system but it's simply been
off the agenda it's been described as
politically impossible it's interesting
and tells you a lot about American
democracy that in 2008 it's a little
different in 2008 the Democratic
candidates first John Edwards and then
later Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama
all proposed complicated health care
plans which begin to approach what the
large majority the population wants
national health care don't reach it but
they at least approached in 2004 nobody
even mentioned it so what happened
between 2004 2008 no change in public
opinion that remains the same but there
is a change in concentrated power
manufacturing industry which is of
course a big component of us power is
being seriously harmed by the
inefficient highly inefficient
privatized healthcare system and once it
changed so that they can compete better
with say Canada okay when a large sector
of
the peeps you know the owners is the
society in effect to change their
position then it becomes politically
possible but this is only one example
it's important because it's so
significant to people of a substantial
divide between public opinion and public
policy

Oh
if you look at a lead opinion in the
United States the Council on Foreign
Relations what they say is there's a
consensus in the United States that Iran
is developing nuclear weapons well
they're right about the articulate
classes but it's an odd consensus
because it excludes the US intelligence
community oh it's just a year ago
determined with what they called high
confidence that Iran had abandoned its
nuclear weapons program five years ago
if they even had one but this is an
ideological need doesn't matter what the
facts are it's an ideological need Iran
is independent it's not subordinated to
the US will efforts an enemy it's kind
of like Cuba you know large majority of
the population wants to end the embargo
against Cuba but it doesn't matter in
the case of Iran a large majority of the
population is opposed to threats against
Iran frets little own war but the
political class is it totally in favor
of them both candidates all writers
everyone says all options have to be on
the table but that's not what the
population wants the populations very
strongly supports diplomacy no threats
and furthermore the population accept
say what should be the solution to the
problem I think namely a nuclear weapons
free zone in the entire region that
includes Israel Iran and American forces
deployed their large majority of
Americans support that most of the world
supports a non-aligned movement others
but it cannot enter into political
discussion do a google search of the
press nobody's put nobody even mentions
this possibility Washington doesn't want
it and therefore the intellectual
classes can't discuss it
but that would be the direction to go to
mitigate maybe overcome this crisis
along with improving the commercial
cultural and other relations that's
exactly what Iranian dissidents want in
fact are pleading for sure in a body
awkward jump kanji and others what the
labor movement Iran wants and so on but
the Western intellectually leads
especially in the u.s. want
confrontation hey
I
karva liya I love 02 e la taille I love
well there are two problems that simply
stand out because they reach as far as
extinction of the species one of them is
nuclear war it's always imminent it's a
miracle that we haven't had a nuclear
war since the news since 1945 I was
become very close many times and just by
miraculously didn't happen and it's
those dangers are getting worse the
examples that I mentioned the nipple
bases and so on their exacerbating the
problem so that's and we know how to
solve it there is a way to solve it
unlike other problems namely live up to
the terms of the non-proliferation
treaty which require the nuclear States
to take good faith measures to negotiate
an end to nuclear weapons and that's
supported by quite you know powerful
voices and Henry Kissinger former
secretaries they George Shultz Robert
McNamara and security defense many
others have pointed out that unless we
eliminate nuclear weapons as we were
legally required to do there may not be
a future to talk about that's one the
utter is ecological disaster I mean
what's called conservative opinion I
don't think the term should be used is
opposed to doing anything serious to
deal with a coming enormous crisis very
serious crisis with the world may be
hitting a tipping point on this where
you can't do much there's an
overwhelming scientific consensus but
the you know the editors of the Wall
Street Journal and similar segments
don't think we should do anything about
it in their view short-term profit for
their friends is much more important
than whether the grandchildren have a
world to live in ok how many various
other excuses but that's basically what
it comes down
too that's a huge problem and we have to
do something about it now the longer we
it's not imminent like nuclear war
that's ends everything but it's we're at
a point where the longer we delay the
worse it's going to be for our
grandchildren and for poor people over
the world who are the ones are going to
suffer most
hey farmer
okay for my
there are very few free market societies
the United States for example is very
far from free market society in fact the
fact that we are doing what we are now
doing is a result of the growth and
development and innovation that takes
place in the state sector of the society
it's within the dynamic state sector of
the society that we find in the United
States and other countries too in which
we find most of the innovation and
development computers the internet
lasers micro electronics biotechnology
the aircraft just run across the list
the advanced economy crucially relies on
the dynamism of the state sector
computers in the internet for example
were within the state sector in the
United States for about 30 years pretty
much before their before they were
handed over to private enterprise
sometimes private industry becomes
involved with usually on government
contracts in fact we see that right now
at this minute and not only does high
technology and the economy of the future
rests primarily on the dynamic state
sector but so does short-term economic
growth in the last quarter US economic
growth was very low but the only reason
it wasn't lower is because there was a
the bush administration carried out a
sort of quietly a large increase in
pentagon spending well that's a stimulus
to the economy Keynesian stimulus to the
economy presumably they did it in order
to try to look better in time for the
election but it was significant maybe a
couple of percentage points in GDP
growth should have been negative
otherwise so first of all or any you
know there are very limited free markets
they exist to an extent and you're right
to the extent that a free market exists
these are going to be serious problems
because in a free market you
post to maximize personal gain
corporation for example is legally
obligated legally obligated to look
after its own interests whatever the
effect on the public so yes that carries
with it an undermining of social goals
you can see this in all sorts of domains
however it doesn't seem to me a one that
can't be overcome there can be
regulation intervention corporations can
be democratized you know they can be
taken over by their workforce and
communities there is no rule that you
have to have totalitarian institutions
and corporations are about as
totalitarian as any human institution
it's been devised so yes it's a problem
but it can be overcome by popular

I mean it's a shocking indictment of the
economics profession that they weren't
shrinking about the coming crisis
because it was obvious its immediate it
has a long-term long-term causes but
also an immediate cause the immediate
cause is what are called subprime
mortgages hospira housing in the United
States but other countries to England
Spain elsewhere a housing crisis we're
going way out of line with their value
you know there is a trend line over time
housing prices relate to the growth of
the economy but it started in the late
Clinton years but just went out of
control in the bush years that's how has
a huge effect on the economy I mean the
United States is deeply in debt actually
debt is greater than personal wealth by
now and a large part of the debt is
based on inflated housing costs so you
you know get a you want to buy a house
you get a mortgage at a small input and
you hope that then you go into debt on
it you use the debt to purchase
commodities way beyond your means and
that leads to inflated consumption way
beyond the protective productive level
of the society a huge amount of imports
as an enormous current account deficit
which is impossible to sustain and it
was obviously going to burst but
everyone sailed along happily thinking
look we're making money tomorrow so why
should we pay attention ok it burst now
it's a systemic disaster actually there
are much more long-term causes and they
shouldn't be overlooked the basic cause
probably not time to go into this now is
the breakdown of the Britain would
system after the Second World War the
United States and Britain the victors
John Maynard Keynes and harry dexter
white instituted that in a global
international economic system it was
based on several fundamental principles
one was currencies were restricted
within a narrow bands and the role the
IMF was to keep him that way so he
didn't have a lot of speculation on
currencies in fact very little which is
mostly waste and governments had the
right to control capital so they could
prevent capital flight now that is
extremely significant you cannot have
serious development if governments can't
control capital flight and you certainly
can't have welfare state measures that
was perfectly well understood the reason
is that you know investors become what's
called a virtual Parliament who float on
measures that a government carries out
and they don't like them they destroy
the economy with capital flight that
happened in Europe's happen all the
third world so a basis for democracy is
ability to control capital also the
basis for growth now in the early 1970s
that system was dismantled and finance
was liberalized ok that's a crisis in
the waiting and in fact since that time
there have been repeated financial
crisis crises much more than before and
they keep getting deeper combined with
that was kind of a religious mania about
market fundamentalism now as I just
mentioned before it's largely myth
because the rich countries make sure
that the wealthy are not subject to
market discipline they do that in all
kind of ways like the state sector of
the economy but there was a kind of a
ideological mania about self-correcting
markets so you can leave them alone you
don't need regulation and so on the
theoretical basis was extremely weak the
factual basis was non-existent and it
but it did lead to a significant
dismantling of regulation through the
Reagan years increasingly in the Clinton
years and dramatically in the bush years
and the same was happening all over the
world well okay when you have a crisis
in the making from liberalized capital
which under prices risk for well-known
reasoned and you have no regulatory
apparatus you're just asking for a
crisis how to deal with it well you know
first of all you should I think we
should go back to something like the
Britain woods system there
being controls on capital those who
control capital should not be free
independently the will of the population
to export it and use it as they like
even for any social purposes the
problems have to be dealt with about
currency regulation but in general there
has to be a just at the very minimum
there has to be a much stricter
regulatory apparatus and firm regulatory
apparatus has to be instituted in a
state capitalist economy just in order
to keep it viable and I think will be
because it's in the interests of
business itself so some kind of
regulatory apparatus will be
reinstituted now in a more democratic
society a bank bailout like Paulson 700
billion dollar bailout would be combined
with public control over what the banks
do in a less democratic society like
that in the United States there's no
public control so it's what's turning
out is pretty much what economist Joseph
Stiglitz predicted there will laureate
he pointed out about the Paulson bailout
that we could pour money in but they'll
pour money out into their own pockets
unless we have a veto power that is
public control well the ideology of you
know the doctrine of the business run
society is you can't have that and it'll
it's just laying the basis for new
crises
these are really questions of will and
choice um his matters are not determined
so take just the United States the 1920s
were very much like the last eight years
the Bush years tremendous inequality a
lot of euphoria about endless wealth for
the very wealthy the labor movement had
been completely smashed to Anna quite
violently to an extent that shocked even
right-wing visitors from England and
Australia and it looked like it was
going to be a utopia the Masters the end
of history okay then came the 1930s it
was all radically reversed great
uprising of the labor movement CIO
formation civil rights pressure for
social reform and the government had to
respond to it again in the 1950s it was
a period of another period that was
called the end of history you know
utopia the Masters very quiet apathetic
wealthy the post-war economy was very
successful largely state based economy
and then all then came the 1960s country
exploded there was and the effects are
striking I mean in fact we saw them in
yesterday's election of one of the
effects but it's much more widespread
than that well what's going to happen
next again it depends on just what it's
always depended on if there is an
engaged active dedicated public
organized public it can bring about the
significant positive change if there
isn't then the bitter class war that is
always foot unremittingly by the highly
class conscious business classes that
will continue and we'll go back to
something like extreme inequality
stagnation the last 30 years in the
United States have been one of the worst
periods of economic
tree for the large majority of the
population wages real incomes real
incomes have stagnated real wages have
stagnated pretty much for the majority
benefits of decline working hours have
gone up that has been wealth produced
but in very few pockets and yes we'll go
back to that but these and I am speaking
about the United States but these
observations generalize around the world
it simply depends on what people will do
I think there's reason for hope but not
illusion it's hard work just as it's
always been we have a lot of freedom a
lot of privilege more than ever in
history and places like the United
States but in many ways the freest
country in the world but it was not
gifts from above it was won by struggle
from below and that's the way it's been
everywhere so the answer the question is
in our hands
