this is the wgbh forum network thank you
Tom and to the fort hall forum
Northeastern University I'm I have to
tell you I'm I'm smitten by the size of
the audience come to hear professor
Chomsky tonight I'm just so delighted to
see that expression of of interest in
the news that that statement that you're
making by by coming here tonight when
when I was a very young reporter with
the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation I
remember being in the production area
one of the major current affairs
programs for radio back in the 1970s now
I was brand new and I was being shown
around and everyone was being very
polite to me and speaking in very soft
voices as you do when you're gently
trying to integrate someone into
something new and one of the senior
producers slammed down the receiver of
his telephone stood up and said all
right it was a sort of 1970s version of
yes everyone turned to him and he smiled
like this trophy fisherman and he said
we've got him there was a pause of
expectation in the room just like this
one now we've got Chomsky he said and a
sigh of satisfaction in the room now I
was a very young reporter I knew the
name but being the ace cub reporter
wanna be that I was I knew I had to find
out a little bit more about the man so I
thought well that's simple I'll just
read what he's written
right 30 years ago that was a full time
job even today just keeping up with the
writing of norm Chomsky is a full-time
job he has written over 70 books over a
thousand articles he writes about
linguistics philosophy intellectual
history contemporary issues
international affairs and u.s. foreign
policy mr. Chomsky was born in
Philadelphia his undergraduate and
graduate years were spent at the
University of Pennsylvania where he
received his PhD in linguistics in 1955
while he was a junior fellow at Harvard
he completed his doctoral dissertation
entitled transformational analysis it
later formed part of a more extensive
work called the logical structure of
linguistic theory norm tomski joined the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1955 and in 1961 was appointed full
professor in the Department of
linguistics and philosophy from 66 to 76
he held the Ferrari p ward professorship
of modern languages and linguistics in
1976 he was appointed institute
professor of position he holds today in
the spring of nineteen sixty-nine he
delivered the John Locke lectures at
Oxford in January 70 the Bertrand
Russell memorial lecture at Cambridge
University in 72 the nehru memorial
lecture in New Delhi in fact we were
just exchanging remarks behind the
curtain here about a trip that he just
completed in in India he is on the move
perhaps more than most reporters you'll
ever talk to professor Chomsky has
received dozens dozens of honorary
degrees from universities on four
continents he is a fellow of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences
and the National Academy of Science in
1988 he was awarded the Kyoto prize in
basic science that is the Japanese
equivalent of the Nobel Prize he has
received the Helmholtz medal the Dorothy
Eldridge peacemaker award and the ben
franklin medal in computer and cognitive
science now my sister is a speech
pathologist and she's particularly good
at her job so she understands norm
Chomsky on the topic of linguistics I
explained I was having a little bit of
truffle with that
so she said she could put it to me in
rather simple terms she said that almost
everybody that you meet who goes to
school learns something as a result of
the way that Norm Chomsky changed the
way our education system introduces us
to language now what introduced it what
intrigues me as a journalist about mr.
chomsky's mind is what he writes what he
says about power about the way in which
power is used about the way that it is
abused and the way it is often excused
about this time of year or so ago he was
actually talking about retiring I don't
know if it was in fact September 11 that
kept him at his keyboard and but I can
say that this nation and this world is a
much better place for having his
arguments and his ideas made as
available as they are so on the topic of
the emerging framework of world power I
ask you to welcome professor Noam
Chomsky
thank you it's widely held that the
post-september 11th world will never be
the same and there's no doubt that that
911 was an event of historic importance
however it's less clear how it's going
to affect the emerging framework of
world power personally I'm rather
skeptical I suspect that we may discover
down the road that it has established
more firmly tendencies that are already
underway in our rather deep-rooted well
to clarify the basis for that judgment
it's worthwhile to think about a few
background issues in particular to
questions and I'll start with those
first is why is it a historic event and
the second is why did it happen I should
say that these questions themselves
often elicit highly irrational reactions
as if seeking explanations and trying to
place events in the historical context
amounts to what sometimes called
rationalization or implies that the
victims deserve to be murdered that's
very common but it's so outlandish that
it's hardly necessary to comment and
I'll put it aside it's comment about the
people who raised the questions other
than that not worth discussing so first
why is it a historic event well the
answer that is simple it's because of
the choice of victims not the nature of
the crime that much should be obvious to
anyone who's familiar with the record of
the past several hundred years which it
should be unnecessary to review however
it may be useful I think it is to listen
to some voices of the traditional
victims reacting to September 11th so it
takes a Latin America particularly
important to us our shadows been cast
they're very heavily for a long time
September 11th atrocities were very
harshly condemned as they were virtually
everywhere but quite often with a
recollection of their own suffering so
in Central America perhaps the leading
research journal as the journal of the
Jesuit University in Managua they
described the events they said the
events of similar September 11th could
be described as Armageddon but added
that we have suffered our own Armageddon
in slow motion referring to the
atrocities of the 1980s which was an
international terrorist attack condemned
by the World Court as you know and it
would have been condemned by the
Security Council if the United States
hadn't vetoed it and that was more
serious than September 11th tens of
thousands of people killed the country
rec'd may never recover so yes this may
be Armageddon but it's not new to us in
Panama a journalist radio journalist
like others bitterly condemned the
September 11th atrocities but added that
we're familiar with it he referred to
the attack the bombing of the barrio
rodeo in November 19 December 1989 when
the United States invaded Panama and
that one bombing according to Panamanian
sources several thousand people were
killed in the poor audio since its air
atrocities we don't investigate and
nobody really knows the details but it
was certainly serious the that invasion
that that was operation just cause
undertaken by George Bush the first in
order to kidnap a disobedient thug who
was brought to the United States and
tried and is now in jail sentenced for
crimes that he committed almost entirely
on the CIA payroll well they remember
that and others refer to Operation
Condor and the
atrocities in the Southern Cone again
international terrorism because of the
u.s. involvement crucial involvement and
others speak of the international
terrorist wars of the 1980s in Central
America that left hundreds of thousands
dead millions of refugees and orphans
four countries ruined there were
international Gallup polls taken after
September 11th condemnation of the
atrocities was near universal on the
other hand there were very few places
where there was much support for a
military reaction some places and apart
from a few places it rarely went above
about thirty percent rather legal means
the kind of means that Nicaragua
attempted to pursue but failed because
they ran up against a more powerful
force namely us that wouldn't permit
legal means in Latin America the support
for military action was the lowest the
highest in Latin America was about
eleven percent in Venezuela and Colombia
the lowest was two percent in Mexico the
essential fact that lies behind this was
described quite simply by carlos salinas
who directed government relations for
Amnesty International for many years
with particular concern for Latin
America what he said is that Latin
Americans know better than perhaps most
people that the US government is one of
the biggest sponsors of terrorism and
they know it from firsthand experience
of course it doesn't follow that
innocent Americans should be slaughtered
by terrorists gangsters nor did anyone
suggest that but neither should other
people and the facts are not forgotten
elsewhere let's move to another part of
the world where happens is was a few
weeks ago your buck here in southeastern
Turkey this is the sort of unofficial
capital of the Turkish Kurds that's 10
or 15 million people they had they have
suffered
the horrendous atrocities in recent
years some of the worst atrocities of
the 1990s several million refugees tens
of thousands of people killed hundreds
thousands actually of towns and villages
destroyed much of the countryside raised
in yerba cure there's nobody knows how
many but maybe hundreds of thousands of
refugees in the region right nearby
outside the city walls and living
essentially in a dungeon huge dungeon
under terrific repression I where did
that come from well came from from us we
paid for it and the if you take a look
at arms transfers to Turkey turkey was a
major ally of course and strategically
placed in the Cold War and near the
Middle East so it always got heavy flow
of us arms it shot up however as soon as
the counterinsurgency operation against
the Kurds began in the mid 80s remained
high escalated in the 90s more or less
as atrocities escalated peaked in 1997
in the single year of 1997 turkey got
more arms than in the entire Cold War
period up to the counter insurgency
combined in fact turkey ended up being
the biggest recipient of us arms in the
world outside of Israel in Egypt not for
Cold War reasons as long after the Cold
War and not for reasons having to do
with the Middle East but in order to
slaughter and repress its domestic
Kurdish population well in dr bekheyr as
everywhere there was harsh condemnation
of the September 11th atrocities but
they don't overlook what I just
described as easily as we do let's move
a little bit that south to Lebanon and
the Palestinian refugee camps there are
two there was strong condemnation of the
atrocities but it was mixed many of them
remember in fact everyone remembers the
murderous invasions through the 90s
supported strongly by Clinton again
hundreds of thousands of refugees
hundreds people killed and they're very
few who could possibly have forgotten
1982 when the invasion killed about
20,000 people half destroyed Beirut none
of this was in self-defense that's at
last being quietly conceded in the
United States at least in the case of
the 1982 war the first recognition that
I've seen is in a recent column by James
Bennett in the New York Times january
twenty fourth column on another topic
but if you look in it he says he's there
Middle East correspondent he says the
goal of the 1982 invasion was to install
a friendly regime and destroy mr.
Arafat's palestinian liberation
organization that the theory went would
help persuade Palestinians to accept
israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip that's quite accurate it was in
fact 20 years ago already openly called
in Israel a war to for the wet for the
occupied territories and it's quite
important these facts were reported
extensively in Israel 20 years ago
they've previously been accessible here
only in dissident literature of course
all of this was carried out with the
decisive military and diplomatic support
of the Reagan administration well all of
these things are extreme cases of
international terrorism if not the more
severe crime of aggression the major war
crime but let's give the benefit of the
doubt to Washington and assume that it's
only international terrorism it surely
satisfies the official US definition of
terrorism which was formulated at the
same time the early 80s that is the
calculated use of violence or the threat
of violence to attain goals that are
political religious or ideological in
nature you go back to James Bennett's
description of the US israeli invasion
of lebanon fits that case that
definition precisely furthermore by far
the more most extreme acts of terrorism
international terrorism in the region in
those years the 1980s were either us
initiated or us-backed and that included
the peak year of international terrorism
1985 as picked as the peak story of the
year these facts are misrepresented here
in a most astonishing and revealing way
I'll come back to it if you like but the
facts are quite clear you may recall
that President Reagan's special envoy to
the Middle East who was more or less in
charge of all of this was a gentleman
named Donald Rumsfeld who's now running
the military component of the current
war on terror Reagan's ambassador
Honduras who supervised the
international terrorist operations for
which the United States was condemned by
the World Court as John Negroponte II
who is now running the diplomatic
component of the current war on terror
at the United Nations this is hardly
ancient history it bears rather directly
on the current phase of the war on
terror that was declared by the Reagan
administration 20 years ago when it took
office with much the same rhetoric as
today and was and the same personnel and
was conducted in ways that may easily be
forgotten here but are not forgotten by
the victims you can do a little research
project to see how well they're
remembered here by just seeing how often
any of this is brought up in the reams
and reams of paper that have been
devoted to the war on terror in
September 11th and that's an interesting
insight into ourselves the most
important topic we can learn we can
learn more about the current phase of
the reedy clared war on terror by
considering how the current
international terrorist atrocities are
regarded right now not ancient history
like the 80s but the current ones well
in fact there is scholarly this a lot of
scholarly literature now on terrorism
big topic and in it there is some
reference to the 1980s so if take a look
at say
the journal Current history in December
the journal devoted to terrorism they
discuss scholarly articles discuss the a
dimension the 80s as an era of
state-sponsored terrorism in which the
United States played a proactive role
against terrorism meaning international
terror international terrorism sponsored
and run by the United States is action
is proactive act is a proactive role
against terrorism or will would have
appreciated that in Turkey in april two
thousand the State Department issued its
annual report on international terrorism
and it singled out turkey for I'm
quoting for its positive experiences
encountering terror it also picked out
Algeria for its positive experiences one
of the worst terrorist states in the
world and the third one that had
positive experiences was Spain as bad as
those two but hardly very pretty either
so they had positive experiences in
countering terror by carrying out some
of the worst terrorist atrocities of the
mid and late 1990s with crucial us
support now that was reported on the
front it was the lead story in The New
York Times reported by Judith Miller
who's their specialist on these topics
with no comment about what it meant in
the current scholarly literature our war
on terror I'm quoting has no better
friend and ally than turkey thanks to
the capabilities of its armed forces
demonstrated in its anti terror campaign
okay if Malaysia vich were an ally he
would not be standing before an internal
court for facing war crimes Charles
rather he'd be praised for the success
of his anti-terror campaigns and he
would be chosen to lead new ones and
much like Suharto's one of the great
killers and torturers the late twentieth
century he was praised in the mainstream
as a moderate whose
heart benign as the blood was flowing
and he was hailed as our kind of guy by
the Clinton administration shortly
before he was overthrown by popular
rebellion actually the US ambassador in
Pakistan is using the same words for
Pakistan's dictator today turkey is
grateful for us support for the support
that you and I gave decisive support for
its campaign of murderous state terror
as incidentally it was called accurately
by turkeys minister of human rights and
by very courageous Turkish intellectuals
among them prominent sociologist who
spent much of his life in prison for
recording the facts he actually rejected
an award from the fund for free
expression here because of us support
for turkeys murderous state terror in
gratitude for Clinton's enormous
contributions to massive international
terrorism Prime Minister Javad was the
first to offer troops to fight the war
on terror in Afghanistan and now turkey
has just been selected to serve as the
Force to protect Kabul from terrorism
funded by Washington there are others
too who happily enlist on the war on
terror so no one's more enthusiastic
than the Russians who are eager to have
us support for their own monstrous
crimes in Chechnya where the brutal
dictator of Uzbekistan is also our kind
of guy right now well again or will
would have been open mouth and
astonishment as all of this proceeds
evoking little comment but if we want to
break convention and have a look at what
we're doing we can learn a lot about the
war on terror and more generally about
the effects of September 11th on policy
well let's move to today's headlines
right now so take Israel Iran is a man
of peace as the president just described
them despite an impressive record of
terror
worst atrocities includes large-scale
massacres of defenseless civilians back
in the early 1950s brutal expulsion of
thousands of veterans 20 years later
under the Labour government destroying
their lands mosques cemeteries driving
them into the desert to clear northeast
Sinai for Jewish settlement the
background for the 1973 war and
including of course the 1982 war fought
in Lebanon killing 20,000 people in
order to secure Israeli control over the
occupied territories and other
atrocities all of them international
terrorism because they rely crucially on
us support since the 1970s and the last
few weeks horrible as they are or
nothing all that knew I personally saw
similar things firsthand in the West
Bank during the First Intifada 1988 in
this attack the most ferocious and
destructive weapons that destroy the
Jeanine refugee camp and the ancient
kasbah the old city and knob loose in
ways reminiscent of the Taliban if you
look closely the most ferocious weapons
were us helicopters supplied in the full
knowledge that they're going to be used
for those purposes no doubt about it
it's a pretty ugly story bears retelling
involves Clinton come and the US media
including ours right here I'll come back
to it if you like furthermore the US
government remains active right now in
enhancing terror they're on borrowing
the president's words so in December
last December the Security Council
debated a resolution calling for the
implementation of the Mitchell plan and
the dispatch of international monitors
to oversee the reduction of violence
that's the most effective means as is
generally recognized such efforts are
routinely blocked by Washington again
this was vetoed in on December 14th that
particular veto happened to be taking
place during a
21-year a 21-day period of calm that
means that only one Israeli soldier was
killed along with 21 Palestinians
including 11 children and 16 incursions
into areas under Palestinian control ten
days before the US veto the there was
conference in Geneva important
conference which the u.s. boycotted and
therefore undermined a conference that
once again concluded that the fourth
geneva convention applies to the
occupied territories that entails that
virtually everything that the United
States and Israel do there is a grave
breach of the Geneva Conventions meaning
a war crime of unusual severity grave
breach under US law the conference which
included the European Union even Britain
went along specifically declared that
the us-funded Israeli settlements are
illegal and it condemned quoting it now
condemned the practice of wilful killing
torture unlawful deportation willful
depriving of the rights of fair and
regular trial extensive destruction and
appropriation of property carried out
unlawfully and wantonly they're not
talking about the last couple of weeks
this is December 5th the United States
is a high contracting party of the
Geneva Conventions and therefore it is
obligated by solemn treaty to prosecute
those who were responsible for such
crimes including the US leadership going
back 30 years the United States has not
officially withdrawn its recognition of
the applicability of the Geneva
Conventions to the occupied territories
nor has it it's it withdrawn its
official censure of Israeli violations
as the occupying power I'm quoting
George Bush the first when he was UN
Ambassador in October and that remains
official policy in october two thousand
the Security Council reaffirmed the
consensus on this matter it called on
israel
quoting called on israel the occupying
power to abide scrupulously by its legal
obligations under the Fourth Geneva
Convention remember that excludes just
about everything that's happening there
as a worker on the vote was 14 to 0
means it becomes international law the 0
is because of one abstention Clinton
abstained presumably not wanting to veto
one of the core principles of
international humanitarian law
particularly in the light of the
circumstances in which it was enacted in
1949 in order to criminalize formally
the atrocities of the Nazis in occupied
territories well all of this is another
significant contribution to enhancing
terror all the more so because it's
scarcely reported the Geneva Conference
in fact wasn't reported and very quickly
consigned to the memory hole which is
already amply furnished with our own
quickly forgotten crimes the none of
this however is forgotten by the victims
well yes September 11th was a horrifying
atrocity unfortunately it's not new
what's new is the direction in which the
guns are pointing for the first time in
the history of Europe and it's offshoots
that is us they were the victims not the
perpetrators of horrifying crimes of
this nature and that's a historic event
why was it carried out second question
well here we have to make a distinction
between two groups one is the actual
perpetrators I assume as everyone else
does that it's either al-qaeda or
something very like them and why they
did it is there's no one who knows that
the answer to that any better than the
CIA which recruited them armed them
trained them directed them to cause
maximal harm to the Russians and not to
help the Afghans which would have been a
legitimate objective the same special
forces that are chasing them around in
Tora Bora a few years earlier
were training them to carry out
terrorist atrocities and they did the
they carried out during the 80s they
carried out terrorist acts within Russia
which were pretty serious almost led to
a Russia Pakistan war at one point that
all ended in 1989 when the
