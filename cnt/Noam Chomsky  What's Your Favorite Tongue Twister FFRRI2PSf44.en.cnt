being a renowned linguist philosopher
political activist and world's most
influential intellectual I just want to
ask you what is your favorite tongue
twister at ones that we used with the
children when they were three years old
but there are sentences that are very
hard to produce with a straight face
like for example of Britain in the
United States support democracy and
human rights I mean I managed to get it
out but only with a varied effort
