today [Music] 
good night we are tonight before an important event we are going to 
interview noam chomsky one of the world's most renowned intellectuals 
within the framework of this exceptional forum that has just taken place in buenos aires- the 
international forum emancipation and equality a forum that has brought together 
intellectuals come from practically the entire world intellectuals of enormous 
prestige come from the usa come from all latin america 'come from many 
countries in europe and that has tried to reflect on the moment that is being 
living not only in latin america but also in some european countries 
where some political organizations first like ciriza for example in 
Greece has come to power is trying to change things in Spain there is a 
organization how can we are also showing up to 
the elections that can come to power that can change things in Spain and 
in other European countries some organizations are contemplating what 
It has happened in Latin America 'in progressive countries and it tries, although not 
imitate but do reflect on the solutions that have been provided in 
Latin America 'of social inclusion in the fight against neoliberalism and what 
How could this bridge in Buenos Aires be implemented in Europe? 
this bridge between europe latin america has been witnessed between reflections in the 
two continents has been let's say at the center of this 
international forum and let's say the personality that has been the the center 
also from this general reflection as he has spent years thinking about what 
it is precisely a more just world a less unequal world a world with less 
violence is this American intellectual noam chomsky who now 
for viewers who do not know him, we will be able to meet him at 
through this tape that we are going to spread and then we can meet him and I will 
to have a conversation with noam chomsky so at the moment we see 
this tape 
what we are and what we do is just language, they assure not jones that the 
top intellectual of today linguist philosopher and 
American political activist was born in Philadelphia in 1928 he entered the 
university of pennsylvania to study linguistic and mathematical philosophy and 
he obtained a doctorate in linguistics in 1955 in 1957 chomsky revolutionized the 
field of theoretical linguistics with the publication of the work structures 
syntactics based on his doctoral thesis logical structures of theory 
linguistics in which he raises the existence of a brain device 
innate that allows you to learn and use language almost instinctively is 
emeritus professor of linguistics at the massachusetts institute of technology 
in haiti since 1961 and one of the leading figures in linguistics 
of the 20th century his academic and intellectual work throughout half a century 
covers the fields of linguistics communication 
and sociology his work is very extensive comprising more than 30 books and hundreds 
of articles chomsky is one of the linguists who have 
transformed the most essential concepts of general grammar 
founding the transformational generative grammar according to chomsky being 
human has a natural faculty that develops language as a mechanism 
necessary of militant communication of the North American intellectual left 
is recognized worldwide for having chosen the path of thought and 
political activism its critical and committed position in relation to capitalism 
contemporary and foreign policy of the us since the war years of 
Vietnam to this day this firm decision has allowed him to be a 
privileged interlocutor in debates on world order problems 
In numerous articles and public presentations, he highlights that the media 
communication are strategic instruments subordinate to large 
economic corporations that dominate the state and civil society 
good night and business welcome to the set of 
Argentine public television 
we are going to tackle a series of themes gathered around three themes 
individuals let's talk about latin america ' 
we are going to talk about the usa in the world at the present time and we are going to talk also 
mass communications communication manipulation of spirits a subject or 
two three topics on which you have reflected a lot I would like 
ask the first question 
a few days ago president obama made a statement that is an order 
executive in which she declared that Venezuela was a threat to the 
us national security what do you think of this statement from the 
President Obama 
[Music] we have to be careful to distinguish 
two parts of that statement on the one hand one part was real was the 
imposing sanctions on seven officers Venezuelans the 
another part is also a technical aspect is the way laws are formulated 
Americans today when a president imposes a sanction must raw invoke 
ridiculous statement esther saying there is a security threat 
national and the existence of the us of the island of granada or whatever 
that's a technical aspect of American law is so 
ridiculous that the lender never actually records it if they 
records in the us but only because this 
emerged in Latin America the original statement is never mentioned in all its 
context and I think it's the ninth time obama has invoked the threat to 
national security and survival usa 
because it is the only mechanism within its reach by which the law allows it 
impose a strong sanction, that is, what counts are the sanctions, the rest is 
an absurd formality that is a history of many years that we could 
which we could do without but love the case it doesn't mean anything sometimes if for 
example in 1985 president reagan 
invoked the same law saying that the state of nicaragua is a threat to the 
national security and us survival but in that cavern it was true 
it was fine at a time when the world court had ordered up 
two husbands who sustraba an end to their attacks against nicaragua 
with the side the inappropriate use of force against terrorism 
Nicaragua does not take it into account and the nations security council 
united considered at that time two functions that asked all states 
they will respect international law did not mention anyone in particular 
return and I knew they were on their way refer the United States and states and the 
second he did the same in both cases in the congress 
American court asked us to end terrorism 
international and it will pay for very large repairs and congress 
what he did was increase the financing 
of the North American forces that attacked Nicaragua is to say that the 
government did not expose its veto to the resolution and violated what was being 
seeing in that context king gun put on his cowboy boots and said it was 
a threat to the security of states that made sense will remind them of 
moments he organized a course saying that the Nicaraguan troops are only 
two days walk from some old cities 
so we were in big trouble and they couldn't have survived well that 
man unfortunately it was a reality but now it is not a truncal 
try to say it's not an extra effort to try to undermine the 
government of venezuela something that the united states does and that almost always does 
In those cases they have not met President Hugo 
chavez 
On the other hand, President Chavez had great admiration for you 
he promoted some of his books very insistently 
What memories do you have of President Chavez and what opinion do you have of him? 
he deserves president chavez as ruler in particular for his 
influence in latin america [Music] 
after the pepper and chavez after they showed the yellow radiation 
it sold very well and a friend of mine said his book was 2,600,000 in 
souls 
ovidio asked me if president chavez could not show my book the book of 
he 
that we had with him in science evaluation price I had a 
day with a friend we basically talked about how he got to 
power how the united states reacted and many 
things of that nature 
Chavez made a very important effort to try to introduce changes 
substantial in Venezuela and its role in the world is more one of its first 
Hindu acts was brought to the opep 
the notorious case of going down to production to increase a price according to what I 
he said that was the time that the us finally turned against 
Venezuela used to tolerate it and much more 
fire with oil supplied cheaply to Cuba and other Caribbean countries 
efforts to develop or improve the health system in that 
poverty the missions they got it was an effort within their community 
entire etcetera this had some degree of success from 
Steve who faces serious difficulties particularly the 
incompetence and corruption as dreamed strike etc and the other end 
it is a difficult context for a venezuela internally and the most important problem 
serious that has not been overcome and is a problem for Latin America in general 
insofar as they depend on a new unsustainable format of development 
economic based on the export of bread 
one can get with that as argentina brazil among know it but unless 
the economy diversifies in such a way that it cannot develop 
from basic car production to industrialization 
both of agricultural products but the industry that most is not its social model 
and if you take the developed countries starting with england 
united states and others all upload originally started exporting 
basic products for example the case usa was developed because it had almost a 
monopoly on commodities most important in century but that was the 
cotton made in slave camps in the usa 
that there were camps that would have impressed the Nazis if they had 
could see they failed to increase cotton productivity faster 
industry had no technical duration apart from the whip they used every time 
more for three gilded slaves with the widely used torture and other 
activities to the reptile before cotton production increased very 
quickly which did not enrich the owners we are slaves 
for they have put but also development of the manufacturing system if you go for 
example to the northeast which is a manufacturing area 
at that time the main expenses were spent on spector and cotton 
predicted cotton cloth the same as the earth 
it did not matter usa and they had their first factory and that also developed their 
financial systems themselves it was an extremely complex move 
about borrowing funds and other financial stuff and all that from 
cotton export a trading system financial systems well 
The US like other developed countries that did not respect what is called the 
healthy economy under which those principles that today are done with 
high tariffs and with other mechanisms and exports continued like this until the 
year 1945 when they could really develop the industrial production of 
textile steel and other drugs this is how development can be done if a 
country is self-imitating the importation of basic products is going to be installed and 
that's what happened in that the economy continues to depend 
terribly of oil export 
and this model is also sustainable for the export of soy or other 
agricultural products in such a way that we have to go through a format 
other than development like England and the USA and others did for 
course for example france lived in the 90's the wealth came from the torture of 
Haitians today sadly continue the same with history 
knowledge about other countries venezuela has not overcome this obstacle and has 
other serious internal problems and of course the us exacerbate those 
problems and I believe that sanctions is an effort to achieve this 
For me it is a good answer to Venezuela, it would be just letting go 
ignore sanctions cannot be ignored because they are real 
but raise what you mentioned the ridiculous claim of threats to the 
American national security it's important to remember that this in itself we 
represents like I didn't say it was just a matter of ways 
It is something that was not reported to the US It is something that is important is the role in the 
Latin America that counts in that case last December 17 
President Obama and also President Raul Castro made a 
joint non-joint statement each for his part in which they announced the 
normalization of relations between Cuba and the US President Obama in 
that statement acknowledged that 50 years of US pressure politics 
Americans with included economic blockade had not produced any 
result and that you had to change your policy what do you think of this 
normalization between cuba and the us and how do you see the evolution of relations 
between Cuba and the United States and its influence for the whole of Latin America ' 
it's not normalizing your first steps to what might be a normalism 
that is, the embargo, but it will be the restrictions on the neighborhood 
they can travel debt free but if it is a step towards 
normalization and it's extremely easy to see what the current rhetoric of the analysis is 
of obama and suppression do whatever fertile he said 50 years of 
efforts to bring democracy freedom and human rights agreements 
have failed and that other countries unfortunately were not supporting us in 
the reinforcement carmen we have against another way to continue our 
dedication to the imposition of democracy, freedom and human rights that 
dominate our benign policies in word plus word plus word 
less than eight flights the eggs fill up though when a government 
pronounce something you have to translate it into a cute what does this mean 
for 50 I have made a terrain of the great is to change an economic struggle 
simple have left the us totally isolated in 
a world in Latin America that we have not been able to undermine the government of Cuba in 
those fifty years with which how about five we close another solution is the 
translating a little bit of the speech is what it really means or what is 
can say Spanish or English it is worth remembering that most of these 
issues are suppressed the North American debates and even 
Europeans indeed usa campaigned 
terrorism terrorism against Cuba under Kennedy terrorism was we will include 
right now there is a debate sometimes about assassination attempts 
trace that is they made to saturate that those 
petrochemical facilities bombing hotels where they knew there were Russians who 
they were housed in killing cattle or a very large campaign that lasted many 
years but more after the united states will end its terrorism the 
direct appeared supporting terrorism let's say 
based on miami from the 90's but the economic war didn't play a part 
started by jce en haul but really picked up momentum during the era 
kennedy and got worse after excluding the pretext of economic war was not 
democracy and the introduction of black brothers but that is cuba was a 
appendix of the great satan who was russia straight and who had we had to 
protect ourselves in the same way that we had to protect ourselves from others 
collapsed in the Soviet union with the embargo the blockade got worse 
clinton won him the status game to extend the brito block then 
made a liberal senator much stronger or something weird from being without later 
Worse still is an effort to strangle that it obviously has nothing to do with 
with democracy and with human rights it's not even a joke because 
is the only thing we have to do is look at the North American records of their 
I support violent terrorist dictatorships not only support them and not 
impose on them with the case of those destined where the us was the strongest support of the 
Argentine dictatorship and when they reagan 
the guatemala government was carrying out a genocide 
de regan wanted to support them but the congress of the day set certain minutes 
that's why he said well how about we do it in Argentina we transform them with neo-Nazis 
to do what we have unfortunately Argentina became the 
democracy later and that's where they lost that support they had then 
They went to Israel to continue training the armies of 
terrorism in guatemala 
we analyze international relations specialists well no 
they want to talk about this but in fact it is a very important principle of 
monetary policy sometimes domain theory for example 
if the usual argument is that the us lost if the world war but not 
it's true if we look at internal planning the us achieved the most 
their goals if not perhaps the maximum goal if we think that the Philippines for 
example but if the basic objectives that were good similar to those of Cuba if 
the concern they had in the 50s was that maybe in vietnam it might 
follow a path of successful independence a radical nationalism like 
we could call it and so this would be a model for others who would like to follow 
regions along the same path which could lead to undermine this 
domain system that could later be copied in thailand for example 
and in other places governments is a big problem it was indonesia that gave 
many actions for the resources that they already had the us is worried because 
japan was sometimes called the super domain 
it could also follow this desire for independence and become a center 
industrial in asia in economics also so they lost the facet of the 
peaceful in war and then there we have the new order of japan already 
the early 1950s the us was not prepared to tolerate this loss to 
lose the second war so what they had to do was a henry kissinger 
I used special terminology to describe this these small countries are 
like viruses that could transmit diseases to infect us if by 
example to other places here chile for example that could conquer others 
countries then we have a the system 
parliamentary democracy here in chile and could bring this disease to the south of 
Europe and others could be contaminated with what we could call the car 
communism in some is a danger what we do if we have 
a virus that can transmit diseases so it must be destroyed 
to the virus it is necessary to inoculate the possible victims it is necessary to vaccinate those like 
imposing these tough military addicts baquba the virus 
in 62 
Kennedy had already led the economic war on terrorism and had also 
made a very important decision one of the most important of his government is 
change goes the mission of the Latin American military that were controlled 
For the United States, it replaced by hemispheric defense and became 
internal security and this of the hemispheric defense was something of the second 
war this internal security is not something that has no meaning is 
war against the people against the population and in the towns of 
Latin America knows what others mean by a neo-Nazi style of terrorism 
murders here argentina the new the worst cases and we see one after another 
then you well as the domino pieces were falling in the direction 
Correct this contagion of terrorism in Cuba was also subject to the 
huge pressures and why did this change good and change because states 
sustainable they had what they said is that Cuba was isolated but the opposite the 
the us are the ones who are isolated and think about the votes the voting in 
united nations year after year voting on embargo 
then we have a hundred and one votes on one hand and then we have the countries 
The United States is almost alone, and in Latin America the cases are so 
extremes that the congresses of this hemisphere 
no full agreement is ever reached by the us and canada itself 
They support the rest of the countries of the hemisphere and we have it in Cuba and Cuba. 
is a member of this us isolation got to the point where you have to 
make another kind of effort to undermine and weaken and destroy this virus and this 
is the correct translation of the words of obama 
in 1999 another virus appeared but in the opposite direction chavez appeared in 
Venezuela a number of countries adopted some 
very different anti-neoliberal programs some governments 
Progressives began to appear in Latin America 'first in Brazil 
after venezuela truth with lula then in bolivia with evo morales then 
in Ecuador on a leash then in Argentina with Kirchner 
in uruguay with tabare vazquez and mujica and this has spread throughout latin america 
and indeed, as you have just said, Latin America has left a 
little of the hands to the us I would like to ask first what 
opinion do you have of these progressive governments in general of america 
Latin and second, how is it that the U.S. has been in this situation? 
of loss of influence in Latin America what you wrote is a 
very significant change is a point of historical importance and the us are by 
course the country the power that exercises the most dominance of all the all the 
world all united no longer have the overwhelming power to destroy governments and 
impose military dictatorships where you want if you think for example the 
last 15 years there have been some coups a coup attempt in 
venezuela in 2002 yes well it worked let's say for a few 
days nothing more if the us fully supported it but did not have the power to 
impose the new government or another in haiti in 2004 so there we have the 
torturers from haiti french usa combined 
to rip kidnap the president and send him to central africa and 
keep it hidden there so that it could not even participate in 
elections well this was successful but haiti is a very weak country there was another 
case in honduras in 2009 if with obama the military if they got rid of the 
parliamentary government so there's a democratic excuse from us they didn't want 
condemn it as a military coup or were isolated in this they were led to 
After the elections, with the permission of the United States, this military coup supported it. 
successful and now this country is a mess by completely caught we have a 
terrible record of the worst human rights and if we see the migration to 
united states which is a great topic most of it comes from honduras because this 
country was destroyed by the coup that the us supported 
so you see some success stories so to speak 
but not as in the past not as formerly Latin America has now 
taken a step forward to achieve a certain degree of independence is the 
correct path forward yes so good the mercosur unasur is lab there 
different groups representing steps towards integration something totally 
Celac is completely new because we are not united and Canada remains 
excluded and this good no one could have thought of this is inconceivable 
years ago and this is reflected in various places 
a very interesting recent study if what is called for example the 
way of reflecting the worst torture in the world we take someone and what 
we send the worst military dictatorship to torture him and with impunity and 
we can have information this is the worst form of torture 
The US has been doing it for years, I live a study to see which countries 
Middle Eastern countries cooperate of course 
there we sent them to carry out this random torture syria in egypt they were 
kadafi libya well they torture well no and the European countries mostly 
england sweden france all participate then there was a region of the world 
where no Latin American country participated 
and this is really striking very interesting when you are america 
latina was under the control of the us it was a global torture center and now 
they even refused to participate in this kind of this us torture game and 
this is a very significant change and it is a sign it really is an event 
very significant there have been certain partial success stories in america 
Latina who has led the resistance to this neoliberal game 
we can call it that also other successes 
and there is still a long way to go
