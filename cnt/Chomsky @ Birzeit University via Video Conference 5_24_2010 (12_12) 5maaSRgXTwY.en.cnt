time for one more short question yeah I
i went to do to UM around up actually a
few comments as i've already heard with
a question to go back to the global
picture should speak and to the
interesting and intriguing notion of the
proximity talks between the US and the
world wondering who the moderator of
these talks would be my volunteer once
wondering about that why would I i would
i would put two questions really the
first is so how do you push the united
states to take the position that is
needed to start up with ending loser
consume israeli conflict and huh we do
and ensure the rational political action
of an irrational government where for
example while trying to expand those
realm is actually catalyzing the
palestinians on the one hand but
actually if you have a look at the
settlements as well as creating Jewish
ghettos letters wasn't a Palestinian
Jewish community living on this terribly
it sounds very irrational as a matter of
fact
and there's a need to eventually push
the Israelis to stop this Gator ization
process the Americans to stop supporting
this this process and the real question
would be well reducing the starting
point would be how do you mobilize
what's your suggestion on mobilizing the
world to to make the baby the the
populace the moderator of these
proximity talks Ashton yeah well it is
take South African example again and how
did what in the United States to change
its policy and provides apartheid to
collapse or we actually don't have the
poetic records they have not been
released but you can tell pretty well
for one thing there was a very strong
public opinion calling for an end to
apartheid in the United States as well
as i mentioned congress was passing
sanctions against South Africa which
Reagan had to evade American
corporations were running South Africa
they were opposed to apartheid wasn't
good for their business and not that
they were nice people or anything just
not good the word world pain was just
overwhelmingly opposed to apartheid and
it's finally had an impact we decided
we're watching to any better to make a
transition in which you eliminate
apartheid essentially keep the same
economic structure so the same people
are rich well there are a couple of
black faces and limousines but the
poorer may be worse off than before but
you get rid of apartheid and then we
made that decision it happened and there
are other cases like that one more
example which is moving
for 25 years the United States and
Britain primarily but other powered
Western Power Stone supported an Asian
invasion of former Portuguese colony is
Timur are the worst atrocities of the
modern world it was virtually canis idol
they wiped out maybe a quarter of the
population as long as the u.s. continue
to support it it went on and the press
were reported from the europe racket and
so on Oh in September 1999 we can pick
the date in September 1999 ballistic
pressure in the united states mostly
from the Catholic Church it was a
Catholic colony but conservative
pressure in the United States of small
popular movement and international
protests commenced common we should bet
it should be over too well up until that
day long military which ran the state
was stating will never leave this is an
indonesian province we own it we're
never going to leave Clinton late a
short quiet statement an international
conference what you said the game is
over the next day the indonesian of
horses left that's the way the world
works and how do you get to this point
that depends where you are if you're in
Europe for example Europeans don't have
to act like puppy dogs and follow along
whatever the master says I have to do
that they have choices of options or
they can become more independent and
they can become a powerful pressure on
the United States
this region is very significant made for
other reasons but I couldn't know
something outside the United States yes
that's where it really matters people
doing things that's what all the
activism is about now here there things
you can do to the positions that are
taken by the population in the region
and by the Arab states conditions in
which the US leadership will recognize
that it's in their interest to join the
world they are you right in pointing out
that the phrase proximity Procol
anything literally you don't have rocks
between the United States in the world
what happens is the United States has to
make a decision US government has to
make a decision do along the world and
if it does as in the cases that I
mentioned things change and things that
happen in the world have an effect on
how those decisions are made and
depending where you are things you can
do to help create the conditions in
which those changes will take place
thank you very much
on behalf of busy University students
faculty staff and administration I would
like to thank you very much for taking
the effort to make your speech to the
precision averse the community and to
Palestine Palestinians at large this
would be one miniseries eventually as
debates discussions and lectures on to
economize
