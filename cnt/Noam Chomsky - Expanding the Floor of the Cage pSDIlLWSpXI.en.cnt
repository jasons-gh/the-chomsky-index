I took the slogan as you say from
Brazilian rural workers I used in a
slightly different sense than theirs but
not totally what they meant is look
we're living in a cage it's a very this
is during the dictatorship very harsh
circumstances the landowners and
military forces very violently -
extremely refreshed people so we're
living in a cage but there are things we
can do to explain expand the floor of
the cage that's what they were doing
when they were trying to perform the
rural unions and farmers unions and so
on I borrowed it in a slightly different
context it was in the context of
anarchist critiques of relying on state
power to improve pretend protect
circumstances of working people the poor
you know vulnerable populations with
children and so on and my feeling is you
should support this and there are people
who think of themselves as principled
anarchists to say you shouldn't because
we're close to state power so the
analogy that I was trying to express was
that you know the cage is that kind of a
state the cage is the state and it is
repressive I agree but outside that cage
there's a saber-tooth Tiger namely
private capital which is wants to get in
there and tear you to shreds so you need
the cage and you can expand the floor of
it you can get more reforms and this is
quite concrete so things like safety and
health reforms or my inspectors for
mines we're horrible accidents take
place all the time or
the National Labor Relations Board
dimmed intervention to slightly improve
the conditions under which union
elections can take place or the social
benefit problem of pensions health care
and so on I think it's fair to regard
that as kind of expanding the war the
floor of the cage and I think it's the
right thing to do in fact if you look at
the old serious anarchist journals like
say freedom in London if a lot a large
part of each issue is devoted to
expanding the floor of the cage in this
respect or at least keeping it from
contracting so defending workers rights
and so on and as far as reform this is
reformist but as far as performant
revolution are concerned I've never seen
that as a conflict in fact if it's going
to be a meaningful social revolution the
one that will have a positive outcome
it's pretty likely maybe almost certain
that it will be after the population has
come to understand a very large part of
it has come to recognize we've reached
the limits of reform there's no reason
why anybody should turn to revolution if
reform is still possible revolution is
the danger is ugly uncertain terrible
consequences possible if you can if the
mechanisms of the society still permit
expanding the floor of the cage then I
think you should do it and only when
resistance to reform is so strong that
you just can't go any further
only then and when that is recognized by
people will there be the basis for a
revolution that has some hope for the
future so as far as I can see the same
state different stages of the same
process
