Oh
the concept of money well money was
invented at a certain level of
complexity of the economy when it just
becomes too cumbersome des bartered so
if you have something that I want safe
computers I want to take a computer from
you and I have something you want maybe
an order of you we could exchange
without you extremely cumbersome on the
other hand is a simple way of exchanging
namely having a common medium of
exchange which we both accept and using
that common medium which happens to be a
couple of pieces of paper it's a lot
easy and over the course of time money
evolved to play that role that's a lot
more complicated than that
I mean even getting to a single currency
for a particular country to belong
claude levi-strauss a famous
anthropologist once as a graduate
student going to listen to a talk of his
which i thought was a joke
but i guess it wasn't in which he argued
this is like 60 years ago so my memory
may not be exactly right i know he wrote
it up he argued that humans have three
modes of interchange one of them is
language another is money a third is
women he says if you look at cultures
they all will have some language which
is very kind of light you know where it
doesn't weigh anything so very fast
communication with words money is a
little bit heavier more cumbersome so
the interaction is slower women in many
cultures it's just like once a
generation so then plenty of cultures a
woman is handed over to another family
in exchange for something that's
received by the donor family and then
the woman becomes maybe the slave of her
mother-in-law there's nothing like that
that's communication and over generation
I could see what he's talking about well
nothing beyond simple truths one thing
is that Mother Nature doesn't hand your
answers who you on a silver platter you
got to work to find them and that kind
of work requires a creative imagination
hard work greatest genius Einstein it's
not going to come easy integrity and a
critical mind you have to you can't
question everything but you would have a
slight question about everything and
sometimes that slight question is worth
pursuing now when you turn from the
sciences to the study of human affairs
it's in a sense easier and it's harder
it's easier in the sense of the theme
it's much more what can be understood is
much more superficial so in the study of
history say or sociology you don't get
principles of even remotely the depth
that you find in studying the Natural
Sciences on the other from another point
of who is harder mother nature does not
give the answers on a silver platter but
she doesn't set off obstacles either in
human affairs there's plenty of
obstacles that of doctrinal systems are
putting up obstacles to understanding
what's going on education in many ways
is creating doctrinal frameworks which
shape your thinking and impose barriers
to understand it and it's pretty
systematic
I'm more free in just world in fact
right now what I hope for is a world in
which my grandchildren can have a decent
life and that's not obviously going to
happen they are really serious that
threats that might destroy that
possibility the threat of nuclear war
for example which is very serious the
threat of environmental catastrophe
extremely serious I think there are now
threats of a kind that human beings have
never faced before they are on the wall
you can see a picture of Bertrand
Russell he and Albert Einstein in 1955
and published a very eloquent
manifesto to the people of the world and
he said people the world have to face
make a choice that is a stark and
inevitable shall we give up war or shall
we destroy the species and we don't
really have many other choices you could
say the same about environmental
catastrophe shall we decide to do
something about it or shall we create a
world in which these and people wouldn't
want to live those are species
threatening choices of a kind that we're
never faced before and there are plenty
of others
first of all we would like to live in a
world with variation but more
fundamentally I think we'd like to live
in a world with no power system and I
think we're moving slowly toward that
now so we don't live under kings and
princes we don't have slavery that women
have some degree of right so all of that
is erosion of power systems not just a
political power like kings and princes
but also for example patriarchal
families eroding their power is a step
towards freedom for women for children
for it's not the top of the powers
direction and that's true in other
aspects of life too so instead of
looking for one power system which would
be global tyranny that we should be
looking at modes of eroding power
systems so that people run their own
lives how did we get the rights we had I
mean we have a lot of rights the freedom
of speech presented was protected in the
United States beyond maybe in any other
society it was civil and human rights to
of substance' women's rights or to
substantial extent protected
how did it happen look at the history
was it a gift from above was worn by
struggles from below people can struggle
hard some dangers might people die but
they ultimately win rights which then
power systems will try to take away from
because they were always trying to erode
that is really that's why it's been done
in the past it's the way it could be
done now
