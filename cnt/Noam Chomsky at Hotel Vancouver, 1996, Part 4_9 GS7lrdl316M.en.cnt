I just asked about your own experiences
you have to go to a know you call the
newspaper to get your subscription
change there's something are calling the
airline to get a reservation well you
know they carry you through a lot of you
know go through menu and you push
buttons and you wait and they play
pretty music and yeah you know because I
think a half an hour to get through and
the same is true of just the way the
airline industry is run the seats are
closer they don't take care of the
planes you know you try to keep right at
the margin because you can make more
profit and all of that does make more
profit but it just transfers the costs
when as far as the economy is concerned
I mean nobody measures the costs to
human beings so you can't get a number
but it's not clear that you know that
it's it's this is not even clear that
the benefits of automation outweigh the
costs if you think about it well that's
part of the reason for cutting back news
I mean you get more a bigger advertising
budget if you if it's murder or
something like that or whatever people
watch then if it's a new program the
advertisers aren't that much interested
in advertising on the news programs so
therefore just partly advertiser driven
and partly for other reasons news as
being an commentary and discussion and
that sort of thing is being cut back
also news and commentary and discussion
have a kind of a dangerous aspect to
them they are to some extent of
democratizing that is they tend to some
extent at least to get people involved
in what's going on and the goal is to
keep people atomized to keep them out of
the public arena so let's have them
watch you know one of these shows where
people will talk about their personal
lives or something then they're not
going any trouble at all you know then
they're just going to be
Adams of consumption the sort of utopia
on the other thing to get back but
remember there is a sector of the
population that does have to have
information and knowledge and so on the
management classes the decision-making
clusters the ownership classes and the
the real elite press I don't think is
changing very much for them like The
Wall Street Journal and New York Times
in the Washington Post that sector Allen
think's really going to change much
because they go to a Larry and they are
the endings to did this vetting media on
the other hand the rest of the media
yeah they may very well go the way of
the tabloids a mirror and it takes Tate
Britain where back in the 1960s the two
big tabloids the mirror and the Sun they
were Labor papers with a lot kind of a
lot of craziness you know woman with two
heads and that sort of business but a
lot of lot of news and information and a
kind of a kind of social democratic
point of view on the world and labor
oriented and so on now it's just like
you know the National Enquirer the thing
that you watch for laughs when you're
going out at the supermarket the end it
plus the racing forms you know whatever
else you can you can sort of manipulate
people with once you've driven them out
of once you've driven any out of their
heads any idea of solidarity and
cooperation and working for a better
life or you know getting involved in the
political system and so on so that I
suppose will continue and because unless
you know people who like Gus and others
like this stop it but the natural
tendency would it be for it to go in
that direction so it's a kind of
fragmentation but I think it'll leave
the agenda-setting media to the elite
media not all that different because
they do serve a function you know the
indoctrination function and also this
the informing function for the decision
making sectors of the population
how about alternatives whether clave
alternatives opening up and
unfortunately they have
I think you know people like us haven't
used them let me say take cable
television that has allowed for some
years now plenty of options the way the
laws work in the United States at least
communities in order to get a cable
contract say you know we're brothers or
one of those guys it has to commit to in
a particular say in Boston they have to
commit some resources to community cable
which means that places like Cambridge
and Chelsea and Somerville you know the
little towns around now they actually
have cable stations with equipment and
things that people could do something
with and they're just not used I mean
they they are not going to come you know
they're not going to be on a scale of
the networks but there are ways to reach
people and if they're not being used
it's our fault you know
there are ways to do it some people do
but nowhere near what the what has been
possible and the same is true of other
kinds of other kinds of information
technology it allows a lot of options
and I'm has been used and that's partly
because of the left and the labor
movements have abandoned a lot of the
turf that they ought to be developing
there's some a lot of soul-searching
that ought to be done in my opinion
about these matters I mean sure there's
big forces out there they're trying to
destroy it but there's plenty there's a
lot of opportunities that aren't being
taken the new telecommunication stuff is
another case in point it's going to be
interesting how that develops is gonna
make a big difference like the rest of
high tech it was all publicly funded so
the telecommunications systems including
the internet and everything else
Ottawa publicly run because they were
funded by the public that mostly through
the Pentagon system the way everything
else
now of course by now
like say computers or you know airplanes
or anything else what's called private
enterprise meaning publicly subsidized
public private profit enterprise what we
call free enterprise they want to take
it over just like they took over radio
and television and print and everything
else and they tell you what they're
going to do with it that's not a big
secret they want to turn it into more
ways of atomizing and marginalizing
people and making them more stupid and
ignorant and passive and obedient and so
on so turn it into a home shopping
service say or you know some some other
form of you know I can't remember of
particle a couple of years ago I think
was in The Wall Street Journal or
somewhere where they were describing the
fantastic potential of the internet
because interact or all the interactive
stuff and the idea sort of was like this
is from memory I may have by now I may
be remembering my retelling of the story
but it was something like this the the
population was broken up into two
categories women and men and for women
it would be a home shopping service so
you're sitting there looking at the
screen alone and of course not talking
to anybody you're sitting alone in a
dark room looking at the screen just who
in the PR industry and somebody
something is shown on the screen which
you don't want but of course the whole
advertising industry is designs it free
and has been for hundreds of years to
design and create once to make you think
I got to have that or else something
terrible will happen like you know I
won't look like the model or whatever
you're supposed to be so all this stuff
pours in at you maybe has two children
or
and certainly to women is and they're
gonna be trapped into once but since
it's interactive you don't even have to
go to the store you just push a button
and you know pretty soon something
arrives at your door or something so
that's for women what about for men well
for men they had a different idea also
using the interactive character every
red-blooded American male is supposed to
be sitting with a six-pack watching
professional football games alone of
course that's very important and the way
it is now you can just sort of watch and
cheer and scream and you know yell at
the coach or whatever you do but since
this is interactive it's now going to be
possible to ask the whole you know 150
million man audience what they think the
next play ought to be like do you think
it ought to be a pass or you know okay
there's something really I never got
able to push a button and say what they
think it ought to be and then it doesn't
have any effect on what happens you know
then the plate is what it is but they
will then put on the screen you know 68
percent said it ought to be a pass so
that's the interactive technology for
men and for women that's home shopping
and for children is just you know
trapping them destroy their minds and
stolen yeah sure that's what if that
would make perfect sense I mean if you
were a high paid PR you know in some
public relations office isn't that what
you would be thinking I mean that's what
you ought to be doing so I could become
that or one variant of that or other or
it could be something that really is
does bring people together in certain
ways I think it's double-edged even the
good side of it because at best it's
bringing separated people together in a
medium that doesn't involve personal
interaction so like we're human beings
you know we're not from Mars or
something and there's a big difference
