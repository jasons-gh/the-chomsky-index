good evening and welcome to our
symposium on Grenada ten years later and
us Caribbean policy we have a very full
evening so I want to go ahead and start
and let the introductions be very short
so we can get to the main event and we
actually have two main events we have
our firsthand report by students who
went to Grenada this summer and
participated in the Grenada ten years
later project and we have a description
of this project by decima Williams their
professor and Jakob Ziskin visiting
professor of sociology at Brandeis and
we also have a lot of people of after
that the students wanted to showcase and
expand upon their experience by inviting
Noam Chomsky from MIT to engage in a
dialogue with decima Williams about US
Caribbean policy so let's get going
before we start there are a lot of
people who've been very supportive in
getting the Grenada ten years later
project off the ground I want to thank
in particular the four departments at
Brandeis that sponsored this event that
is African and afro-american studies
Latin American Studies the Raab school
of summer special and Continuing Studies
and the sociology department and to give
you a little bit more information on the
tenure on the Grenada ten years later
project let me turn the podium over to
Daniel Terrace assistant provost of the
Rabb school
thanks Silvia my own involvement with
this project has been relatively modest
it began really with decima Williams as
great passion and energy and her
research project she brought it to the
summer school which is a part of the
Rabb school and we helped facilitate the
ability of students to go down to
Grenada and spend several weeks there
doing research and participating in the
life of that community learning about
its history and being engaged to me this
whole project is in certain sense one
what is most exciting about Brandeis as
a university it combines that sense of
passionate social and political
engagement with a strong academic and
intellectual context for the work it's
very exciting for me too and for the rav
school to be part of a program which
combines those things and the it's a
program that was enormous ly successful
this summer thanks to the energy that
decima and the students that you'll be
hearing from brought to it just a word
of thanks to my associate director
Gwynn's Maxwell who worked very hard
also to make it happen I'm as curious as
you are to hear the details about their
program this summer and I'm going to let
you move on to that thank you very much
and our next speaker who will provide
some information about Grenada is Carlos
Whiteman who is Harvard undergraduate
and a Grenadian
[Applause]
this will be brief and it is designed to
look back at the revolution look back at
the revolutionary leaders and sort of
get a sense in the feel for what the
revolution was all about it has been 10
years since the dissolution of the
Grenada Revolution ten years since the
murder of the revolutionary leaders
particularly the prime minister Maurice
Bishop and the other revolutionary
leaders I'd like to read a quote by
Maurice Bishop there are those who
believe that you cannot have a democracy
unless there's a situation in which
every five years and for five seconds in
those five years that people are allowed
to put an X next to some candidates name
and for those five seconds in those five
years they become Democrats and for the
remainder of the time they return to
being non people without any right to
say anything to their government without
any right to be involved in running
their country we say that when in a
particular country the question of a new
health plan has to be formulated and the
people of the country are involved in
discussing that policy and organizations
and mechanisms are introduced ensure
that the people will be able to
participate in bringing that new policy
into existence we say that Israel
democracy Maurice Bishop March 13 1980
one year after the Revolution let us now
have a moment of silence as we look back
to honor our slain revolutionary leaders
and let us look forward to tomorrow
today when the right of
self-determination of a people will be
respected and not undermined by the
forces that be let's have a moment of
silence
thank you and now giving us an overview
of the last 10 years is decima Williams
Ziskin visiting professor of sociology
at Brandeis and former ambassador from
Grenada to the OAS
either the the praying Catholic or the
diplomats in me made me Stan not sure
which it was good evening everyone thank
you all for coming and I want to thank
Silvia Rome for her role in moderating
the program this evening thank you all
for coming the Grenada ten years later
project has to be started in the context
of Grenada and I'll first talk a bit
about Grenada and then a bit about the
project the island that we call Grenada
is both it has both a single and a
collective identity it's known by many
different names its first name that we
remember Grenada by is called kama horny
and that's the name that the our first
Grenadians called our country before the
advent of columbus it has a country very
much part of the large Caribbean
archipelago where our era lacks Caribes
and Sigourney's people roamed the region
in a fleet of Navy canoes and on the the
arrival of Columbus it took another
hundred more years before European
presence would be established on the
island from 1498 until 1650 these fierce
Caribbean Nationals prevented European
element until 1650 from then on till
1783 the country was occupied by British
French French and British until 1783
when in a cessation more or less of
European rivalry on the island with the
Treaty of Paris
Grenada became a British colony and
remained so until 1974 well after the
wave of independence had swept Africa
and Asia in fact up until now there are
many english-speaking colonies in the
Caribbean the first wave of independence
came in the early 60s with Jamaica and
Guyana and barbarous in Trinidad and
Tobago
and the second wave came in the late 70s
and the third wave actually is ongoing
starting in 1981 with st. Kitts and many
other territories still on the colonial
rule the 1780s and 1790s were very
fervent organizing period in the history
of Grenada the most important date is
the period of 1795 to 1796 when we had
our first revolution for a year and a
half a very strong-willed mulatto man by
the name of Julian Feder liberated the
country from British slavery and
colonial rule fed or occupied the entire
island except sin George's where the
small administrative core of British
maintained a presence and continued to
try to keep control it took at external
intervention to overthrow that freedom
movement the British sent reinforcements
from other countries but particularly
from Barbados and with a combined
Grenada was recaptured slavery was
reinstitute instituted and Grenada
returned to what was then the normal
pattern in the calm in the Caribbean a
colony organized according to a
plantation system and colonial rule but
if we jump ahead from 1795 to 1804 many
of the leadership of this popular first
successful slave revolt in the Caribbean
many of them were hanged others were
deported and a fellow by the name of
Henri Christophe was deported to Haiti
where he participated in the first
standing successful Republic of former
slaves with the Haitian Revolution of
1804 of course with its reoccupation
Grenadier LAN languished in on the
slavery until the 1830s when Savery was
abolished and a large peasantry arose
what developed then as documented by
several studies including MMG Smith's
study on social stratification in
Grenada is a folk which was according to
him well over 80% of the population and
an elite about 7% and a small developing
mulatto and East Indian community in
between the country by then was
organized principally as an agricultural
exporting economy and it has remained
that with fishing and crafts and now of
course tourism as other social and
economic activity the early 20th century
Grenada saw that country become part and
parcel of West Indian society
as I said earlier on the mobilization
against slavery that spirit of rebellion
and the search for autonomy and justice
and freedom hit the Caribbean full force
in the 1930s and many studies many the
British in particular in an alliance
with the American organized the
anglo-american Commission to understand
what the problem was a problem was a
crisis and social development
they withdrawal of monopolies the
withdrawal of preferential treatment for
West Indian sugar these had sparked a
social revolt in the islands we need a
played its part given to the Caribbean
movement a number of very well-known and
prominent figures including Albert Mary
Shaw who in his advocacy for one West
Indian society one federated West Indian
as he said became known as a father of
the Federation a Federation which was
actually formed in 1958 only to collapse
in 1962 when Jamaica in one of his first
referendum on the subject voted for
independence and the famous equation of
ten islands under West Indian British
Federation when one pulled out the same
said one from Tenley's zero and the
Federation collapsed and those who had
ambitions for integrated region would
have to wait for a whole generation to
pass the rebellion that had swept the
region was a bit slow in coming to
Grenada in 1930s it didn't arrive until
the 1950s and in 1951 a full-scale
revolt erupted in the country again 150
years later and this time as in
first time it was based in the rural
area among those who were most socially
or economically disenfranchised and it
was led this time by a rural son of the
soil fellow who had as have been the
practice in that period migrated to more
prosperous regions Canadians and others
went to build the Panama Canal at the
turn of the century whence to cut sugar
in Cuba
went to dig gold in Guyana went to work
in the oil industry in Trinidad and in
Aruba Eric gairy
was one of those returning immigrants
who came to the helm of the popular
movement for increases in wages and for
social rights and the 1951 Grenada
national democratic uprising and some of
the literature a spot refers to it
brought forth the some of the rights
that had been denied the society as a
whole full adult suffrage was granted in
1951 wages were increased by about 50%
and we are talking about very minimum
wage here the color bar was crossed both
by the fact that the leader of the
movement who eventually became an
elected political elected political
leader himself as well as the
constituency he represented watch were
Africans people who were who had been
the descendants of the Africans who were
brought to Grenada and had been enslaved
but Eric gairy lost his way lost his
nationalist populist Pro people's
initiative and after 27 years in office
more or less he had become
papi this despised corrupt ambivalent
and I'm generally unpopular leader and
it took another social movement to
organize and bring to the fore what was
then the cries and the needs of the
Canadian public that movement was an
usual movement of the 1970s it was a
movement which after six years of
popular organizing of participating in
elections of bringing a multi class
alliance to oppose the dictatorship
seized power through military means on
the 13th of March 1979 and began what
has been referred to as the Grenada
revolution the new jewel movement
governed and built this process for four
and a half years with tremendous
advances and significant problems in
October of 1983 one of the one of the
most significant problems in fact both
the two the two major problems the
Revolution suffered both erupted one was
the lack of the institutionalization of
democracy within the process within the
organs of the process because while
there were popular and democratic
institutions at the level of people and
organ at the village level the
decision-making apparatus still remained
very elitist it erupted as one group
said that the other group was not
sufficiently political not sufficiently
revolutionary not sufficiently socialist
and what resulted was a frat aside as I
call it one group of revolutionaries
massacring the other group
throwing the country into complete
trauma disarray and painting the symbol
of the revolution the fellow that the
people had come to trust and to love and
to follow his direction was assassinated
Morris Bishop I think we have a slide of
him somewhere and the army governed in
alliance with some factions of the party
six days later Washington under the
leadership of President Reagan we should
always oppose the process in varying
degrees between the Carter and the
Republican administrations invaded
saying that it wanted to save US
citizens to bring order to the political
chaos in the country and to respond to
the cry of Granada's neighbors for
support this occupy this invasion which
began on the 25th of October led into an
occupation that what lasted about a year
and a half I'm speaking now about the
military troops in the island directing
and managing the society full year and a
half and the last over the last ten
years the effect of all of this has been
to leave the country caught between
perhaps three major currents the old
traditional apparatus and lifestyles and
biological and psychological beliefs
after 300 years of French and British
colonial presence this one current one
tendency one structure one reality the
other one is the stream I spoke about
that began with Fatah and has it smooth
its Moses had its most current
manifestation in the four years of
popular people's power
it too has left a very fruitful and
conflicted legacy and the third reality
is the reorganizing out of that there
has been ongoing for the last ten years
which brings us to the project we were
motivated or at least I was motivated to
go to Grenada this year so that we would
not leave a vacuum when the tenth
anniversary came around and we haven't
left it here we all are we wanted to
fill the vacuum not as acrimony and I
suppose not it's not just with the pain
that we do feel at this time but to fill
to fill the vacuum with something that
was more forward-looking but grounded
itself in an understanding a love and
appreciation for a small country and a
grand people but something that would
fill us the void we have as we continue
as we search for models of Education for
ideas to build and develop knowledge and
societies and so I believe that there
was some that something interesting had
happened in Grenada that shouldn't be
forgotten because it held lessons
it held lessons about development it
held lessons about international
relations it held lessons about the
dignity of citizens in this hemisphere
a lot of documentation exists about both
the Revolution and the post-revolution
era but we felt that we could add to
that and so a group of willing and
wonderful and trusting and respecting
Brandeis students and others join me on
this Odyssey to go back home not solely
to go back they say you can never go
home again
I dispute that but to go back and at the
same time to go forward and so what we
did was what we what we intended to do
was to reach into the collective
memories of the Grenadians and ask them
to share with us views and feelings and
remembrances and analyses and
understandings of what had happened and
to compare and contrast that with where
the society was poised today it was a
dialogue we were trying to engage in and
our methodology very simply was a
qualitative participant observer one and
the classic works on Grenada have used
some of these as I mentioned earlier on
MG smith's social stratification in
Grenada which was published since 1965
he stayed a year and a half and he
engaged himself in series of interviews
actually Singham sticks simultaneously
time is up okay so we were drawing on
some of we were drawing on the best
scholarship that had been done on
Grenada before because we wanted to sort
of fall squarely in that and we we use
some of that that his historical
understanding of how to how to study a
society particular post-colonial society
with a particular history a particular
legacy that we wanted to tap into and so
our elements were four or five first of
all there was a background reading like
all good summer courses he had to
prepare a big package then of readings
and I'm not gonna say who read and who
didn't read before we went and but but
part of the academic exercise was was
was put out secondly we had a series of
presentations we had in the six weeks
that we stayed in Grenada we had a total
of 13 different persons present from
community activist Grenadians with PhDs
who had worked overseas Grenadians who
were taught in high schools just a wide
array of those who had served in the in
the interim council our third method was
to conduct interviews but arranged and
spontaneous our fifth method was to to
have to establish a conversation and one
of the wonderful conversations we had
was to report back to the people and get
to their responses from them and we have
kept a number of personal journals and
you you know you might be well advised
to see whose personal journals you you
know you can you can get to read I I
want to close Sylvie I know we are I'm
extremely slow and late and I want to
close by just saying to you very quickly
I think the video is on for what were
the responses of the Grenadians
because we approach this as a
collaborative effort as joint learning
as sharing and there's about two and a
half minutes of video in which you will
see what three Grenadian said you can
start rolling the last one was a member
of our delegation and it's important
that the first two are educators and
they responded as educators but I think
an important thing happened which was
that even from the young generation
somebody who was from outside a young
Grenadian even she learned something and
I'm not sure that we expected that kind
of learning to go on so I end with the
three
[Applause]
because what has been happening in the
past is a history of Grenada and also
the Bolivia and other countries
I've always been written by those who
are outside looking in never by
Canadians coming from Grenadians the so
it could be documented with the feeling
of the Canadian and I think what the
students have been doing is a dream come
true I'm very glad that Professor
Williams managed to bring this team down
because there's nothing like coming and
seeing for yourself I think that we have
to be very careful that we don't get too
sentimental about the past the past is
gone already have is today around
tomorrow and we have to work towards
that I think also that the youths have
to realize that their futures in their
own hands and stop looking for Messiah
one of the force of Grenada is that
constantly six messiahs and not
realizing that each of us is a mini
Messiah we can make it happen so I hope
that with your energy and your feeling
come back and truly empower the youth
when we have something at my heart
culture and this is going to be
presented by David
the naturally they all stood in our last
presentation is a joint one first chemo
mullahs were presented political culture
and then David Kaufman will discuss
issues of race and class
[Music]
good evening and thank you for coming my
name is Kim Roth and before I begin my
report I like to share something with
you that happened to me last night last
night during our st. George's reception
I was too scared to stand up and give
this presentation myself but while
sitting in the audience I hope were
heard one Grenadian male class with
somewhat bitter joy when he heard Lisa
Lewis on a Grenadian present
I then realized how important it was and
how necessary it was for Canadians to
participate in this project to become
engaged I'm presenting tonight because I
feel I have a responsibility to my
Grenadian heritage to my parents and to
my grandmother who's here tonight as
well as to myself so here I am I'm still
scared but I'm doing it if my voice
shakes it's because I'm scared Canadian
political culture is one that is varied
at different times during history it has
expressed itself in different ways to
disengagement
[Applause]
now we're going to hear from four of the
students who went down it was 18
students is that right decima all right
seventeen was four of them are here with
us tonight give their firsthand report
on the project and they are and this is
the order in which they'll be speaking
Hillary luring Stephanie golden Hirsch
Victor pontus and Janice Johnson let's
start with Hillary and to be part of the
Grenada
ten years later project working with
decimal Williams has been exciting and
inspiring I myself am a former high
school social studies teacher but now
I'm a PhD student in the sociology
department at Brandeis I am particularly
interested in collaborative research and
the work of women in development so this
project was really a great opportunity
for me because it gave me a chance to
work with Grenadian counterparts to go
places and speak with people I would
never be able to learn from in any other
context we went to marketplaces church
services we attended parliamentary
debates we visited homes and schools
playgrounds
and festivals and in all these places
people welcomed us wanted to speak with
us and we're very open and honest in
their discussions and there were
reflections on the 10 years that have
passed since the American invasion it
was also a great opportunity for me to
help launch a dialogue that had been
needed for a long time the dialogue
between North Americans and Grenadians
and conversations amongst Grenadians
themselves to be part of that even as an
auditor was a great privilege and an
exciting experience academic experience
as a participant in that initiative and
as a student from North America I was
very interested to listen in particular
to what women had to say women because
the programs of the PRG the
Revolutionary Government the development
programs were in many cases very
supportive and helpful to women and
domestic situations they provided
childcare healthcare family support of
many kinds and so women had a particular
involvement in interest under the
Revolution when the Revolution collapsed
women in a way were one of its primary
casualties and so to engage with them as
they look back on where they had been
and where they found themselves today
was a very interesting and informative
exercise for me all kinds of women spoke
to me young and old from every walk of
life they touched on some common themes
however despite this diversity one of
the themes that you heard professor
Williams mentioned was the trust that
came to be among people during the
revolution the looking out for each
other
which women feel now is gone they feel
anxiety and fear some of them have been
subject to harassment when they have
sought to join a labor union or to seek
advancement at work one young lady
talked about how her family burned her
books because they were so afraid that
if it were known there were books in the
house somebody would burn the house down
another theme that emerged was the sense
of participation they had enjoyed they
felt commitment from the government
under the Revolution and they felt
committed to the process of government
and civic activism they contrasted that
with how disenfranchised they felt now
the politics did not reflect their
interest
it wasn't interested in people or
programs that supported people and they
missed it very much they felt isolated
and unable to talk to each other the
third theme I want to touch on is the
theme that you heard about the speaker
the director of Mary show in the video
house Mary show house in the video talk
about the leadership the Grenadians
looking for a messiah under morris
bishop this leadership there was a
vision articulated for people of their
future and what Grenada could be there's
a distinct lack amongst women of any
sense of
now or any sense of where Grenada has
headed the desire for an identity is
still there and they talked about this
but instead of looking for a messiah I
think more and more my sense is that
women are the missing piece on the scene
in Grenada today their participation in
activism is missing and if they look to
themselves and become involved again
Grenada they will have a major role to
play in Grenada
[Applause]
my my research in Grenada was focused on
what does something Hillary was speaking
about women's leadership part of the
reason I chose that topic that theme is
that I find it inspiring and I always
wanted to be the first woman president
until I understood what assassination
meant after spending my time doing that
research I seem to be refocusing Mac
academic career around that research
which has made it even more
inspirational to me and I'm seeing it
more and more as something that I'm
going to continue researching the
comments of women with whom I spoke with
in Grenada as well as from scholars in
women's studies and in leadership as a
field are indicative of one very
important issue and it's something that
Hillary also mentioned in order for
women to be leaders there must be women
leaders there has to be somewhere to
start but the picture of a leader must
be changed to include anyone to include
it someone of any gender and of any race
the influence of having a woman as a
leader is what is going to help during
before the People's Revolutionary
Government women leaders were negligible
negligible in Grenada however during the
PRG
there were some women leaders Jacqueline
craft was the first woman in the
Canadian Parliament and she noted that
the deliberate efforts by the PRG which
is predominantly male to involve women
at all levels and productive production
and defense was a very important aspect
of the government Ann Marie Spitzer
who's the prime minister praised women
for the girls deserve self-respect and
dignity in their self confidence in
their ability to express themselves
now rhetoric or not the comments that
they made helped because women leaders
in Grenada today still credit the
revolution for showing them what women
can do Winnifred strong who is the
leader of the Opposition has a very
interesting vantage point she did not
get into politics until 15 years after
she had retired and her comment to me
was that she saw her female students
become leaders during the revolution and
she discovered what women can do through
the eyes of her students along with what
started these women on paths of
leadership we discuss their experiences
as women leaders whether these women
feel their leadership style is different
because they are met and because they
are female rather than male and also the
reactions of the community for which
they leave their constituents and the
people that they work with their
colleagues as well by virtue of the
experiences of women most of the women
that I spoke with do believe that their
leadership styles are different one
woman said that she has a more hands-on
one-to-one approach to people a male
kind of counterpart she feels would end
up being a desk manager she says my
female side has given me a practical
approach and an ability to cope now by
her female side she's not talking about
genetics rather she's talking about the
experience that women have
one of the references was to being a
mother and raising a family especially
in Grenada which is a very interesting
society in that it is both matriarchal
and paradoxically also very sexist at
the same time these women feel that
women as leaders at least in Grenada are
different more willing to compromise or
as Winnifred strong said stoop to
conquer than men are
she says that men have not been taught
that but have been taught to fight
instead in many ways these feelings have
been perpetuated by the men they work
with by their colleagues one very
extreme example almost brought the
Canadian government to a standstill in
January of 1992 the women's steering
committee went to the Minister of Works
communications and Women's Affairs John
Purcell with very serious health
concerns
there was only one obstetrician on
Grenada on the island of Grenada and he
had passed away there were he was
replaced by a doctor who was alleged to
be on drugs and have AIDS
soon after the problem was raised the
ministry met with members of the inner
agency group of development
organizations the women's steering
committee health professionals and women
in the community to hear concerns about
the status of women's health care
John porcelain and Alexander who is the
senior official at the woman's desk
Women's Affairs met with the Minister of
Health and wrote a report containing
criticisms of and recommendations for
women's health in Grenada
upon completion the report was
disseminated to the Minister of Health
and other and other ministers when but
it was never discussed in Parliament
they were leaving it up to the Minister
of Health and he never brought it up
when John Purcell raised the issue in
parliamentary session he walked out as
an Alexander explains he felt we were
interfering in his ministry he was
suspended from office but has since been
reinstated this is just one example of
something that women leaders in Grenada
and in a lot of other places as well are
being faced with everyday a few other
women noted that a woman is allowed to
rise as long as you don't threaten
because Grenadian men always see men as
a leader and don't take it kindly when
in that role women in leadership
positions may pose a threat to the
stereotype minded male but these women
also serve as a strong role as models
teachers and agents for change just as
Winifred stron was empowered by seeing
her male students become leaders young
women and girls and certainly I gained
perspective gained perspective from the
leading women of 1993 Grenada in seeing
these women and is possible to realize
that women can be leaders and that
gender is not an issue when it comes to
leadership the women who have taken
leadership roles ten years after the
Revolution are indeed exceptional they
must fake fight great odds to acquire
and maintain their influence and
positions but without other women coming
forward as joneforsyth sadly stated I
can't do it alone
we need a brand new vision what a Fred
strode provided her version of that
vision for young women and girls in
Grenada today they must have a lot of
faith in God and faith in themselves
that they can do things they must always
feel themselves equal to men and not
inferior
inhye and always feel that they can
achieve the same educational standard as
men they must see men as co-partners
when asked how the men of Grenada will
react and when women take her advice mr.
an a strong letter cynicism show she
said but they must do it in a nice sweet
way because that is the only way it will
be taken what this project makes me in a
lot of ways was first of all
inspirational as I said before but
outside of the issue of what I
specifically researched it made me see a
different have a different take on world
relations I've never been offended by
the use of the phrase third-world
country until I went to Grenada and
really began to question which is the
third world in which is the first world
Grenada
during the PRG the phrase was to go
forward ever and backward never and
Grenada has the opportunity need to do
that there needs to be some development
it is a developing country there's
certain thing there needs to be more
women later says they're due in many
other countries but Grenada can go for
whatever in the United States in the
first world in industrialized countries
we have a bigger problem we've gone
forward for a long time and now we have
to figure out a way to plant trees and
concrete thank you okay I would like to
discuss first how the methodology which
we used in Grenada helped I think to
brown the experience of the participants
as Desmond Williams always are already
spoke about the qualitative methodology
was based on immersion into the
Canadians community as much as possible
for myself that this meant broadening my
personal experience and in addition this
created for the learning process a
dialogue between Grenadians and North
Americans and within the project
participants themselves this dialogue
took place both in a formal and an
informal sense formally with guest
speakers and interviews with
parliamentarians account economists
union leaders constitutional lawyers and
informal dialogues with a from a wide
cross-section of Canadian society from
fishermen teachers drug dealers bus
drivers and agricultural workers
I believe this helped to allow the
participants to have a greater idea of
the popular perceptions of social and
political events and how they
impacted individuals and their society
my focus of study in Grenada was
politics and popular perceptions of the
politics of the previous three political
errors I like I like to talk now about
what those perceptions were in general
the Canadians I spoke with seems very
cynical about politics especially with
regard to the three previous political
systems the first the Geary dictatorship
although many people reminisce about the
increased sense of national identity
that Gary was able to generate he was
discredited due to his use of repressive
repressive measures to maintain
political power the People's
Revolutionary Government
although Bishop is widely considered to
be a national Messiah and there was
there's did seem to be general general
popular appreciation for the increased
social services that the government
provided and the sense of internal
accountability that the government had
there's some criticism of the
government's use of heavy manners which
is repression of fluid of its political
opposition increased militarism of
society and in general there's a feeling
of betrayal that the PRG had a hidden
agenda however most of this is not
affect did not affect the perception of
Bishop as a national as a national hero
the current government is also seen
widely seen was also widely seen as
ineffective based largely on the fact
that US and international aid agencies
did not give the government the funds it
led the constituents to believe would be
available in conclusion the current
government itself is aware of the many
social and
problems like we needed faces it lacks
the means the will and and or the
popular support necessary to come up
with dynamic solutions to these problems
the political environment does no longer
seems to encourage alternate approaches
to solving these pressing problems
I can't sum up what we did in Grenada in
five minutes and nor will I try to what
I will try to do is to tell you what
I've learned in the process of five
weeks having left one week early is why
I went to Grenada first of all I heard
about the project not just in the
sociology department or from my friend
Flo but I thought about it and I said
why do I want to go to Grenada I'm a
Jamaican citizen living in America and I
had an interest and a desire to go home
right one can never go home that's a
statement but I felt in some way going
to Grenada would bring him closer to
home so after about a hundred hours of
fundraising and a few fights with
Professor Williams I was chosen and I
went home what happened when I got off
the plane was an interest it was
interesting to me I was in the Caribbean
I've never been in any other region of
the Caribbean outside of home and
Grenada was not Jamaica it was not
Jamaica in a Geographic sense or or in
the way I suspected that it would be
what it was and what was reflective of
Jamaica in me and of thing and of being
home was the faces of the people 90% of
the people of African descent are black
and that was home 10% of the people who
were not black owed their experience to
the African experience and that made it
home to me and that made Grenada special
to me in ways that is difficult to
express especially in now four and a
half minutes
what I did learn is several things about
myself I didn't know so much about
myself and get so little about myself at
the same time I didn't know myself could
break down into so many different
aspects there was the self who's a woman
there's a self who's black there's a
self who's Caribbean then there's a self
is who's a resident in North America and
of course there's a self was a student
and the self was a youth now my project
was to define or to explore the idea of
youth and the tool of youth as a tool of
social mobilization slow down right okay
so I did all these things or I thought I
could do all these things the woman in
me um explored or learned more from the
people who were doing it but also
learned socially what it was like the
woman before during the revolution and
in Grenada now the difficult hardships
the hunger the poverty that women had to
go through to see in these women a woman
who will grow up and what does it mean
for me if I wanted to go back home to
Jamaica what are the hardships that I
would face what are the real hardships
that I cannot know in five weeks and go
into Grenada as a black person I
recognize that
black people have it real hard you know
that you never really notice these
things that I remember in 1983 when I
heard about Ronald Reagan dropping a
bomb this tiny little island who wants
to kill its American citizens in medical
school I thought good for him drop the
bomb kill the people because I was
ignorant and it's ignorance that is that
affects me that without me knowing as a
black person I permitted or I allowed in
some aspect of my life the death of
other black people without knowing and
beating Grenada made me a little less
ignorant as a Caribbean I recognized or
I learned more about what it means to be
a part of the Caribbean community what
were the impacts of the character that
CARICOM the Caribbean community had on
what happened to Grenada you know how
many countries supported the efforts
that Morris Bishop
Videl Castro tried to do for for the
Canadian community how many people in
the Caribbean community really knew the
fundamental changes that were occurring
there and I was ignorant as a resident
in North America I realize that being
here has its implications both social
political economic my money is being
spent here how much money do I send back
home my social life revolves around what
I'm now college American I'm a Jamaican
absorbed with American ideals and
ideology what did that mean go into
Grenada how many people on the street
could see that in my face in my dress in
my speech those things were the things
that I could not put a hold on but after
having left Grenada some two months
later I can really see these things as a
student how much reading how much of the
history did I know a famous person once
said if you do not know your history you
don't know where you're going to and you
certainly don't know where you're coming
from I've never heard of TM era show
until I stepped foot on that tiny little
island I had never even heard of hid on
who was really what was Mars Bishop all
about why did even the average person
who was illiterate knew this one word
charismatic that's not a typical word
and that's a SAT word right there but
everyone knew what a charismatic leader
was everyone knew who he was as a youth
65% of the population is under 21 and
have made significant strides in their
lives 7,000 people were part of a
National Youth Organization what
organization have I been a part of what
fundamental changes have high made in my
life
and those were the things I learned in
Grenada what does this mean for me now
that I've told you all these wonderful
things about Grenada what I realize is
that I have to step back in some way and
contribute some tremendous effort to the
fact that blacks whether it is blue
black in North America South America
blacks worldwide must recognize and
understand the impact of being black and
that that is what I learned
that what happens to blacks in Grenada
is reflective of what happens to black
in the middle of Boston in the middle of
Dorchester there is an economic
conference there's a social conference
and we need to know those things if we
don't know those things then we are
somehow disjointed not linked to what
our history and our people are doing
what is happening to them
that we must become a part of the
revolutionary process that Mars Bishop
spoke up that Fidel Castro strives for
we must learn what it means to free
ourselves of social economic and
political imperialism that's what I
learned in Grenada I learned what the
structural adjustment program meant and
what the implications are what does the
IMF have to do with my life you know I
never knew what that was before why is a
structural adjustment program imposed on
Grenada if it's been shown historically
that it does not work and I think if
anything that I've left for Grenada
other than that learning and
understanding that forward ever and
backward never is that one must learn
and one last question
yeah but a very short time now to take
questions from the audience I would like
to ask the other students who
participated in this Grenada project to
come up to the stage is that what all
these notes were about Green and be here
to answer questions and be here for the
group picture I guess so if you could
come up and we would like to ask anyone
who'd like to ask a question to please
stand up and come somewhere into the
aisles so that we can all hear it and so
that the the radio can pick this up
we have any questions from the audience
please do
I'm a New Zealand
okay
but wondering if any of you could put
your finger on why it is women are so
much stronger than man what's that your
experience why why are you stronger than
Adam and more enthusiastic and more with
it that's sort of what you were saying
this is her impression and what's this
their impression of to what's right in
front of them they have to see and they
get to think about it and put it
together larger events that may not be
so close
I said
because
also about 50%
so
what
and the other comment do we have any
questions
can you step forward stand I must say
I'm a little bit offended by the tone of
a couple of the comments as a man I find
you know just sitting or listening I you
know I just get a feeling of being
offended and I would like to hear I mean
I personally I think it's it's great to
hear about to talk about it to focus on
the issues and the concerns and the
strength and the activity of women I
don't like it when when it sounds like
it's a put-down or when it diminishes
men and I I wouldn't be interested to
hear I mean I would strike it you know
it would be more natural these days to
hear a female speaker talk about women
with
and women and I didn't hear the man on
the panel talk about men and I think
that would probably be a lot less
acceptable these days and like it's what
I'm getting at is aside from in addition
to expressing quite my feeling is I'd
like to hear about a rather than this
sort of categorical statements about
women versus men as it sounds to me or
about a man or about women I'd like to
hear maybe a little bit from the do you
want to respond quickly and then maybe
we should move on to the next part of
the program
I guess so like I would have seen
something to see I just got here so I
just want to really fight him to speak
about the panel but the I think one of
the main reasons we can have a
discussion of one man in Grenada is
mostly because each of us chose topics
before we went to be NATO different
aspects of the banana culture a
socio-political life and none of the men
chose to study
I chose Invicta chose the political
science and we focused on that issue I
guess uh it's never occurred to me to
focus on on manage rene de and probably
more we discussed about almost banana in
the next subsection so you probably
generalize the talk about banana and
some other men too my name is Roy
we're going to change the next part of
our program which of our panelists will
be decima Williams and Noam Chomsky who
is Institute professor of the woodstick
philosophy of MIT and the well-known
critic of u.s. foreign policy and then
we had a dialogue on the discussion on
the Caribbean and US policy
now I had a question for the best along
you want to go first
the long yarns will be woven right no
I'd like to get into this this previous
discussion but I think Dad only started
and Dean said yes this is a good idea if
you speak to down tears you can help you
get it together
Gwen smack Smith I want to thank all
those who gave little money like a few
cents out of their pockets when the work
sort of accosted in the Student Center
and I want to thank those who sent in
thousand dollar checks because they felt
passionate about Grenada and those who
gave several thousand dollars because
they felt passionate about student
education of this kind we raised about
twenty three thousand dollars just in a
very short period of time
we got interest we got support it's it's
just an incredible beginning for an
academic exercise that has a long life
to it if we wanted to have that so thank
you all Brandeis University community
for this initiative effort
the the panel on Grenada and in the US
Caribbean policy as I said I think I
want to say two things I want to say
essentially that the Caribbean region is
is a region that is caught up in
international relations it was its birth
as a modern region is in many ways very
much that but that I wanted to define it
in a way that is not often defined that
we want to shift the the understanding
of the region from the popular version
and then secondly I want to say that
there are some things in the US and a
particular attention to the US public
and the US government that not only can
be done differently but has to be done
differently if the Caribbean is to
really come into its own let me lean on
the person of of Derek Walcott this is a
man who is now very much in the in the
public eye he was the winner of the
Nobel Prize for Literature in 1992 he's
from st. Lucia
he teaches here in the Boston area he is
somebody whom we have looked to for a
lot of words and he's given us a lot and
I want to use some of what Derek says to
launch us into our understanding of the
Caribbean and I'm quoting him from the
speech he gave when he received the
Nobel Prize for Literature last year he
said and I quote you know tourist
brochures the Caribbean is a blue pool
into which the Republic dangles the
extended foot of Florida as inflated
rubber islands Bob and drink with
umbrellas floating towards her on a raft
this is how the islands from the shame
of necessity sell themselves this is a
seasonal erosion of their dignity that
high-pitched repetition of the same
images of service that cannot
distinguish one island from the other
with a future of polluted marinas land
deals negotiated by ministers and of all
this conducted to music of happy hour
and
with a smile what is the earthly
paradise for our visitors two weeks
without Rena and a mahogany tan and at
sunset local troubadours in straw hats
and floral shirts beating out Yellow
Bird and banana boat beating those songs
to death I continued the Caribbean is
not idyllic not to its natives they draw
their working strength from it
organically like trees like the sea
almonds or the spiced laurels of the
heights its peasantry and its fishermen
are not there to be loved or even
photographed they are they are the trees
who sweat and whose bark is filmed with
salt but in every day on every island
rootless trees and suits are signing
favorable tax breaks with entrepreneurs
poisoning the sea almonds and the spiced
laurels of the mountains to their roots
a morning could come in which
governments might ask what happened not
merely to the forest and the bees but
what happened to a whole people this is
the morning this is the morning what is
happening to a whole Caribbean people I
want not to speak just a government
policy I want to speak to us Caribbean
people Jumeirah cons and I don't know
the word for Grenadian Americans yet
Janice Janice you'll have to tell me I
want to speak to all those of us who
participate in the u.s. society and to
say to you that now right now the region
faces a dilemma and I phrase it as such
whether or not we can continue to expand
social development in the region or
whether or not we are going to be caught
up in the new free-market paradigm of
development
and that historically these have been
contradictory that the free market or
even the protected market of slavery and
of early agricultural export and British
monopolies over sugar and bananas and so
on that came at the expense of social
development housing for its citizens
healthcare education basic rights and in
fact it is this schism that has led
repeatedly to popular movements seeking
to make some bitter fair approach ma
between the drive forward and the
economic front and the stagnation of the
majority it hasn't changed
hasn't changed in Grenada though it has
begun in one period it has fallen back
it hasn't changed on the Haiti
it hasn't changed in Barbados it hasn't
changed in the Bahamas doesn't change
even in Bermuda which has one of the
highest per-capita incomes in the world
higher than the US comparable only with
the Middle East oil producing countries
and yet in the region there is a pool a
large population who cannot meet its
basic human needs the decision strategy
the solution out of that is fraught with
a lot of considerations of history
consideration of politics considerations
about the ecology considerations about
gender relations and international
politics but that whether you are
looking you're speaking to governments
today whether you're speaking to those
in the social development activists and
communities whether we're speaking to
even business men the basic crisis is
how to continue to move forward in a way
that does not exclude so many people and
provoke this what is called instability
we have everything in the Caribbean
everything wealth poverty sense of
internationalism colonial history Miss
World we have a long relation with the
US Alexander Hamilton was born in the
Caribbean did you know that came up here
and made his fame many of Caribbean born
citizens have gone on to form the Pan
Africanist movement people like George
Padmore have gone on to blast their way
onto the American scream like Marcus
Garvey have gone on to serve in the
United States Congress like shirley
Chisholm born in Barbados is now
returned as the Ambassador Jamaica and
on and on and on but I think what is
important to note is that despite these
visions these individual and collective
success stories by and large it's a
region that enjoys a relatively high
standard of living compared to
sub-saharan Africa compared to certain
parts of Southeast Asia yes
very few people starve very few people
die from long term violence that's true
but by and large the structural
inability of the region to take care of
the vast majority of its people that
continues to be the challenge facing
everyone academics politicians activists
what can help what suggestions can we
make to the Caribbean itself and to the
US I want to talk about the suggestions
that I want to make to the u.s. because
this is where we I want to quote another
Caribbean man my friend
this is a Scotsman see how we define
Caribbean is a Scotsman who came to the
United States and got disgusted and went
to the Caribbean loved it married into
the Caribbean families are never left he
died not before he sent one of his sons
to Brandeis University right Gordon
Lewis I'm speaking about whose son
graduated from from the Department of
politics here god no I so became one of
the persons that Pierre speaks about
somebody who came on understood and
remained and became he said the
Caribbean writing in 1985 beyond
contradiction is on the move this means
that the Americans who visit the region
whether as tourists businessmen
government officials or professional
experts must be psychologically prepared
to meet the region on its own terms they
cannot come as conquerors or culture
carriers or experts with a quick with a
quick fix granted the right attitude
they will find a ready response from the
Caribbean for Antillean share many of
the American traits and he didn't mean
North American to me the whole American
continent they are warm gregarious
outgoing curious to learn and eager to
adapt but they are fiercely independent
now I think given that and of course the
backdrop is not only the Grenada attempt
at social and political innovation but
it is also what is happening in Haiti
right now a similar attempt to break out
from the 88 percent versus the 7% and
how that transition is going to be made
and if it is going to be made in a
timely fashion so the whole process
doesn't get set back so that you have
two three thousand people who are
massacred you have the best educated and
thinking people not necessarily in
foreign academies but the most committed
individuals sent on the ground killed
sent into exile and the leadership of
that society has to be reborn again
that's a bad job and I want
leave three or four messages first of
all I think not just governments but
everybody must get involved and I want
to applaud the work that universities do
that churches do that social action
groups do about maintaining a respectful
and healthy dialogue and we need not
name them I think for example in Latin
American Studies we know of many
institutions who have been breaking the
embargo on Cuba for many years by
bringing up a cat mmm academics and
others for dialogue I want to support
the applaud those who have in the church
community who have been doing all kinds
of humanitarian and support work for
some of the poorer countries in the
Caribbean that's important and by and
large has been a positive force bringing
medicines bringing the material supplies
and being advocates for human rights and
so on the challenge of these initiatives
is that they should not just remain
isolated actions of private citizens the
challenge is how to get this in this by
and large favorable bilateral
relationship respectful functional
positive relationship how to get that to
become the standing policy of this
country that's the challenge and that's
why I think we all have to be engaged in
it and it's a challenge that we have to
think about as we look at the unfolding
I hope and normal tell us whether or not
it is not just an unfolding but a
departure in the policies and politics
between President Clinton's
administration and the struggle that is
unfolding in Haiti so as much as I want
to applaud and I do applaud all the
gallant efforts including our all I
would say to have dialogue and to
understand and to support and to find
Communion and common ground what has
what continues to happen in the in the
field of trade politics diplomacy
international sporting and cultural
exchanges
is essentially not just an asymmetrical
relationship because you are bigger you
are richer you are more powerful but an
unfair and unjust and dysfunctional
relationship that renders the region on
able to satisfy its potential are able
to meet the mandates of its population
and I think there is a different way we
can go and we'll talk about that in
question and answers that well the
discussion this evening has been mostly
about Grenada which certainly makes
sense ten years after the invasion a
grenade is not the only country in the
region that's been invaded recently
Nicaragua has undergone ten years of
terror and slaughter thirty or forty
thousand people killed right now there's
a hundred thousand starving to death in
the Atlantic coast there are a thousand
there are thousands starving of children
starving in the streets of Managua and
so on Guatemala has undergone a sort of
an indirect invasion the US didn't
invade it directly it used international
terrorist forces called the called the
Guatemalan army to slaughter a couple
hundred thousand people there at the
same as true Panama was invaded recently
Haiti if we go a little back back a
little further the Dominican Republic's
been invaded Haiti's been invaded twenty
years under American marine occupation
and full support for tortures and
murders ever since and that's
incidentally still going on in my
opinion and and we can go on and on and
go to the Philippines that look around
the world we find very soon things very
similar in a way Grenada is lucky it
only had a brief invade
occupation others have a much more a
bitter story to tell and while we can
certainly and should look at Granada and
talk about Haiti and talk about Cuba
which is now in the thirty fourth year
of an international terrorist war that
an economic war that the United States
has been waging against it and so on and
so forth we can talk about all those
countries and we should we should learn
about them and find out about their
problems we can't overlook a certain
pattern it all comes from here all comes
from right here and as long as it as
this country doesn't change its gonna
stay that way now that's not a new
insight we can trace that insight if we
like back at least a hundred and seventy
years probably further The Liberator
as he was called Simon Bolivar in 1822
the man who led the liberation of a
certain large part of Hispanic America
from Spain pointed out that even if they
succeeded in liberating themselves from
Spanish and British and French rule
there was a grave Menace ahead namely as
he put it at the head of this great
continent there stands a powerful
country very rich very warlike and
capable of anything that was quite true
at the time he spoke the powerful
country that he was talking about was
busy exterminating its native population
it and developing the Industrial
Revolution on the basis of cheap cotton
thanks to the extermination of the
population and the importation of slaves
it then went on to extend its reach
further including finally in 1979
Grenada
the United States as it happens didn't
have much interest in or concerned with
Grenada until Maurice Bishop and the
Revolution of 1979 I was under the
Carter Administration you'll recall the
human rights administration the peak of
humanitarianism the Carter administer
the Carter Administration was bitterly
antagonistic to the granadan grenade in
the revolution
from the first minute and reacted
exactly the way the United States reacts
all moves for independence all moves for
independence independent nationalism no
matter what their coloration whether
they're carried out by priests
organizing peasants or by democratic
capitalists or by socialists or anyone
else always the same reaction it's
rooted and you can find out why I mean
it's very free country we have rich
documentary record to discuss explicitly
the great the threat to you in
Declassified planning documents which
are highly consistent and always tell
the same story and lead to policies that
are enacted with great with it perfectly
in a perfectly systematic way very hard
to find an exception the threat to our
interests is what are called nationalist
regimes which respond the pressures from
the masses of their own population for
production for raising of the living
standards and for production for
domestic needs and that's unacceptable
because the first priority for the
countries is us investors and they must
be service areas they're supposed to
provide cheap labor resources markets
investment opportunities these days
opportunities for exploitive export of
pollution and so on that's the job the
service areas and if you depart from
that job doesn't matter how or in what
way you will be punished and this
country that Simone Bolivar talked about
which is very rich and very warlike is
indeed capable of anything
and if you look around the region where
it's had the power to the capacity to
exert its power you find that Grenada as
well as everywhere else in the case of
Grenada Carter's hostility took the
standard pattern it's always two-pronged
military and economic the Carter
Administration immediately began
running entirely intimidating military
maneuvers in the region aimed at amber
and the amber means in case anybody
didn't get the idea and Grenada and the
Grenadines got the idea the American
press couldn't figure it out I've never
recorded them the idea was to intimidate
and undermine the revolution by forcing
it to you know into panic and to try to
defend itself and to crack up internally
has finally happened the economic
warfare was instantaneous and brutal so
in August 1980 there was a hurricane
which devastated the West Indies
destroyed about 40% of the granadan
banana crop Grenada doesn't have a lot
of resources and that's rather serious
the Carter Administration of course
refused aid in fact at the time they
were trying to blockade from Europe as
well they also refused aid to any West
Indian country unless the West Indian
countries agreed to cut Grenada out of
the aid program the other West Indian
countries refused and none of them got
any aid from the United States and so it
continues by 1983 Reagan invaded the
they were going to turn Grenada into
what they called a showcase for
democracy and capitalism that's been
done before - when the u.s. overthrew
the democratic government of Guatemala
in 1954 it was going to turn it into a
showcase of democracy in capitalism
same words and so on in case after case
in fact the United States poured aid
into grenaded a Grenada was the highest
per-capita aid recipient in the world
after the invasion second only to Israel
which is often a category by itself but
among countries of the world Grenada was
the highest per-capita recipient of aid
the result was the usual one catastrophe
for the population but profits for a lot
of people and the the Society has
severely deteriorated the drug abuse has
shot up political systems virtually
collapsed and so on but some things work
there was an article in The Wall Street
Journal about a year ago which described
the terrible economic situation even the
private sector is complaining about it
but they said that there's one ray of
light
Grenada they said is the Casablanca of
the Caribbean it has the it's become a
great Center one of the great centers
for drug money laundering financial
swindling of all sorts and so on
in fact the bait has one big growth
industry namely banks it has one bank
for every 64 people which is the Hyatt
if there's the world record a bank but
you know what that means a bank means a
little office somewhere with a fax
machine and a telephone and a computer
which is used by the real banks the ones
in New York and so on for money
laundering activities and handling their
narco trafficking operations and so on
so there is one growth area and
apparently a lot of jobs for crooked
lawyers and that sort of thing well
that's not unique either take another
country that was recently invaded Panama
six years after Grenada
the idea of the invasion of Panama was
to restore it to power a tiny elite of
the traditional elite of white bankers
and narco traffickers and that succeeded
and the results were exactly as
predicted at the time the State
Department a couple of weeks ago
conceded that Panama is now the second
greatest center for cocaine money
laundering in in the Western Hemisphere
still doesn't come close to the one who
has the record namely the United States
where most of the money laundering is
done by the big banks just as most of
the as the chemicals for production of
cocaine and so on are sent for American
chemical companies and so on there are
other major drug centers Haiti for
example according to the DEA that the
drug enforcement agency the Haiti is a
transshipment point for somewhere
between a third and a half billion
dollars a year of narcotics cocaine
mostly from Colombia the United States
government is quite capable of stopping
every catching every little skiff that
takes off from Haiti with a couple of
refugees trying to flee but somehow it's
beyond their resources to find the the
ships that bring half million dollars of
cocaine in and out John Congressman John
Conyers raised some questions about this
recently but never made the press of
course the there was one period when
when the the use of Haiti as a
transshipment point stopped that was a
seven-month period from February 1991 to
September 1991 when the first
democratically elected president took
power and cooperated with the DEA first
time they've been any cooperation and in
fact along with the virtual elimination
of terror and atrocities and the
beginnings of development exactly is in
the case of Grenada and applause from
the World Bank for laying the basis of
for future development again exactly as
in the case of Grenada and other such
achievements there was also a cutback in
drug flow also no refugees fleeing
virtually at that time after the coup
that overthrew our state in September
1991 things went back to normal the DEA
office was in fact closed down after
death threats from the military it's now
back but apparently not functioning and
we can proceed this is a very regular
pattern it's not that the u.s. likes
drugs it's that it likes rich bankers
and chemical corporations and investors
and so on and they happen to like drugs
because they make a lot of money from it
so that these consequences developed the
structural adjustment programs are
imposed on Grenada but not for NATO
alone there are 76 countries that have
had
structural adjustment programs in the
past 10 years there it's a little
misleading to say they are imposed as if
there is no agent they are imposed by
someone namely the people who run the
international lending institutions the
World Bank in the IMF and there in
Washington even rich big countries take
their orders from Washington so it takes
a India not a little country the Indian
press recently has pointed out the
Indian economic journals that it's
pointless to read planning programs of
the Government of India because you
might as well just read the orders that
they got from the World Bank and the IMF
and Washington a couple of months
earlier and that's the government
planning program in fact the press has
pointed out that the Indian government
planning documents are now written with
American spelling and American style
instead of the British spelling and the
British style that comes automatically
to Indian bureaucrats because in the
place where they're written from well
structural adjustment programs have
their consequences they're called
failures but that's a little bit
misleading one of their consequences is
to sharply reduce the share of labor in
national income so the labor costs go
way down and wages go way down but that
means profits go way up
mostly profits for investors so take say
Haiti the which has been a darling of
Washington of the business community
right through the worst terror and
torture of the duvets and so on the
Haiti was going to be turned into what
US aid called the Taiwan of the
Caribbean and it was going to do it by
using its a great advantages in cheap
labor and in fact US programs helped
create a very substantial labor pool
they're forced like everyone to pursue
agro-export programs which means
purchase US agricultural exports from
here and you stop producing for your own
population and you produce for export
that drives lots of people off the land
creates big labor force u.s. aid moved
in with lots of investment programs
to encourage programs to encourage
investment to encourage us investors to
move their assembly plants over to Haiti
and they advertise the terrific
advantages you can get be plenty of
people to work for mostly women
incidentally for 14 cents an hour and
there's no unions because you smash them
up pretty quick
and under structural adjust under this
program of turning Haiti into the Taiwan
of the Caribbean from 1980 through then
from about 1980 to 1988 real wages
declined about 56% and that same thing
happened that Republic same thing
happened in Mexico about 60% these are
what are known as economic miracles the
population starves and the investors get
rich so the programs are success their
success in doing exactly what they're
intended to do again there's nothing new
about this you can read about it in Adam
Smith to mention a famous revolutionary
he pointed out that the British we're
doing exactly that in the in the late
18th century then in Bango imposing
programs that were impoverishing and
destroying the population while
enriching the merchants and
manufacturers who were the principal
architects of the policy in england and
now we're doing it and doing it on a
massive scale
in the case of there was a in the case
of Haiti as soon as the RS teed the
government took over the u.s. moved
instantly to total hostility exactly as
in the case of the Bishop government in
Grenada our seed was elected he it was a
huge surprise the United States expected
that its own candidate a former world
bank official would easily win the
election he had all the resources and so
on he got 14 percent of the vote our
steed was elected with two-thirds of the
vote on the basis of a big popular
movement grassroots movement of that
nobody really knew was there
acceptations and it sort of came out of
the woodwork and swept them into office
of the u.s. reaction was exactly the
same as in every other such case instant
hostility US aid terminated all of its
investment promote
and efforts when our steed tried to
raise the minimum wage to 50 cents 50
cents an hour or magnificent 50 cents an
hour US aid strongly opposed that they
refuse to give a penny to to any of the
popular movements including the huge
peasant movement Haiti as peasants money
went only to the business community the
US government instantly began a
character assassination attempt against
our steed the reigning ruling generals
general Idris was handing out to
reporters a 200-page dossier of alleged
crimes of re steed right away
meanwhile the State Department was
telling reporters well why don't you
check with the ruling generals they'll
tell you about our esteem and they knew
all that because they had given cedrus
that 200 page document and they have
since been leaking all sorts of
ludicrous stories about iris-t the most
recent word last week or week or two ago
on CBS maybe you saw them about a CIA
profile that shows he's really a madman
and so on and so forth this is
absolutely standard as probably it's a
prelude to the the Clinton
administration's programs were not
identical to the Bush administration
programs in Haiti they were harsher as
Clinton was sort with was capturing
refugees and Bush was taking refugees
from Haiti and sending them off to
Guantanamo Clinton as soon as he moved
in harsh in that program
he put a blockade around Haiti and
forced them right back on the grounds
that they were not political refugees
but economic refugees you could tell
that by ESPE or something so therefore
they sent him right back putting a
blockade around Haiti is of course
totally in violation to international
law but the United States and extremely
lawless society pays no attention says
if Libya interdicted all air traffic out
of the United States if you can imagine
that there is a program to restore our
steede but watch it carefully you can
predict exactly the way it's going to go
and if you look at the small print you
can see it precisely we are the great we
have to
put ourselves forward as the great
lovers of democracy and it just wouldn't
look nice if somebody who won an
election with two-thirds of the vote and
was thrown out by a bunch of brutal
gangsters is just killed or you know
left outside and so on so the idea is to
get arrested back in in some fashion in
some cubicle somewhere where he is
deprived of any power whatsoever
that's crucial that's the bottom line
it's not a big secret you can read about
I mean it's for example America's watch
the main human rights organization about
eight or nine months ago had a report on
what was going on in Haiti and they
pointed out quite accurately that while
the United States starts standing by and
watching the military in Haiti are
destroying what they called Haiti's
remarkably advanced popular political
organizations referring to laa LAAS the
grassroots organizations and it's
vibrant political culture and they're
going to destroy that so fully that if
Aris deed ever gets back
there'll be no organized popular support
left for him to implement any programs
RS teen was forced and I mean forced
like Porter's to accept to throw out his
prime minister and accept the new prime
minister who is acceptable to the
Haitian business community not actually
the new prime minister is a decent
person and I'm courageous man Robert
Melville but as the press is hastens to
point out correctly he's opposed our
steeds populist reforms that's crucial
take things back the way they were
that's of course not the end of it if
you read this morning's paper you'll
notice that the latest proposal is now
being floated in a couple of days or
weeks they'll be implemented is to have
when if they can get our state back
maybe on the back of an American
invasion they will put him off in a
corner they already have as Prime
Minister someone opposed to his populist
reforms but now they'll have to broaden
the cabinet to broaden it to include
representatives of the military and the
ultra-right and so on then live real
democracy
with the popular movement that brought
our state into power demolished and
destroyed power in the hands of the old
business community and now broadened to
include the most extreme thugs and that
will be called democracy meanwhile the
u.s. intends to send in trainers to
train the military and police trainers
to train the Haitian security forces and
more humane behavior that is more humane
than carried out by chief of staff it's
the army chief of staff cedrus and the
Chief of Police
Michel Francois both of whom
incidentally received their training in
Fort Benning Georgia presumably the
School of the Americas but they didn't
parent learn well enough so now some of
the same trainers they're gonna come
back to teach them how to do a little
better the way they trained the people
in Guatemala and so on according to
church sources in around our state and
from Haiti members of the high command
in Haiti have been trained in the have
been in the United States for training
as recently as early October this month
I can't prove that I can just say that
that's what they say now we're gonna go
in and train them exactly the way we've
trained every killer and murder
throughout the hemisphere well you know
we can proceed with Cuba same with Haiti
incidentally you know stuff in Haiti air
as much too much to talk about and
besides all the same story anyway you
know in Haiti our our relationship to
Haiti does not begin in 1979 it begins
in 1791 we have a long relation with
Haiti when the Haitian slave revolt
began the u.s. sent troops and money to
try to put it down the United States was
the last country in the world to
recognize Haiti in 1862
happen even a year we recognize Liberia
and for the same reason at that point
the US was going to free the slaves and
we therefore had to get him out of the
country somehow we had to create what
Thomas Jefferson called a country free
of blot or mixture meaning you
exterminate the native population so no
reds and you somehow kick out the black
populations oh no blacks and then we
have a country free of blood and mixture
and therefore we recognized
in Liberia as places we send these guys
Haiti was occupied for 20 years first by
Wilson's Marines who destroyed the place
and then they left it pretty much the
way it is Cuba has been under attack
from the the the Cuba when Simone
Bolivar
made those statements about the country
at the head of the hemisphere exactly at
that moment Thomas Jefferson and John
Quincy Adams and others were working out
plans for eventual invasion and
occupation of Cuba they intended to take
it the British fleet was in the way at
the time as soon as the British fleet
was as that deterrent was overcome the
United States did conquer Cuba and the
guise of liberation turned in into a
plantation and a haven for rich tourists
and for gamblers and gangsters and so on
everything was fine until 1959 when the
Castro Revolution took place within
months Cuba was under military attack
from Florida you know planes were taking
off from Florida and bond and Cuba in
March 1960 the Eisenhower administration
formally determined in secret it's not
be classified to overthrow the
government Kennedy came in invaded
launched the biggest terrorist war in
history he was a complete maniac about
Cuba not only about Cuba but other
things after the failure of the Bay of
Pigs Kennedy tried to organize Latin
American support for another attack it
didn't work the reason was given by a
Mexican diplomat who said if we try to
claim that if I tried to claim that Cuba
was a security threat
40 million Mexicans would die laughing
well fortunately we're more sober here
so nobody died laughing in Harvard
Square when they made the same claim and
so it goes right up to the present after
the transition from Bush to Clinton
right in fact right at that transition
the under Clinton initiative the embargo
against Cuba was tightened there's no
longer any pretext about the Russians we
dropped that one because they're not
around anymore the embargo against Cuba
was tightened that's the Tortelli bill
called the democracy enhancement bill
robert Torricelli's a liberal democrat
pushed it one of the veto it but under
pressure from Clinton who was out
flanking him from the right he approved
of it incidentally tour cellos delicate
sensitivity for democracy is revealed by
the fact that he was opposed to the
embargo against Haiti because he said
our Steve didn't really reach his high
Democratic standards he can't see any
difference between our state and the
gangsters and killers who were torturing
and murdering these are very subtle
discriminations
well time is up and in fact long was up
so I'll stop but the conclusion is is
glaringly obvious
Simone Bolivar was exactly right and
until we learn what he had to say and do
something about it the story's not going
to change on developing mulatto and East
Indian community in between the country
by then was organized principally as an
agricultural exporting economy and it
has remained that with fishing and
crafts and now of course tourism as
other social and economic activity the
early 20th century Grenada saw that
country become part and parcel of West
Indian society as I said earlier on the
mobilization against slavery that spirit
of rebellion and the search for autonomy
and justice and freedom hit the
Caribbean full force in the 1930s and
many studies many the British in
particular in an alliance with the
American organized the anglo-american
Commission to understand what the
problem was a problem was a crisis in
social development they withdrawal of
monopolies the withdrawal of
preferential treatment for West Indian
sugar these had sparked a social revolt
in the islands we need a played its part
given to the Caribbean movement a number
of very well-known
and prominent figures including Albert
Mary Shaw who in his advocacy for one
West Indian society one federated West
Indian as he said became known as a
father of the Federation a federation
which was actually formed in 1958 only
to collapse in 1962 when Jamaica in one
of his first referendum on the subject
voted for independence and the famous
equation of ten islands under West
Indian British Federation when one
pulled out the same said one from
Tenley's zero and the Federation
collapsed and those who had ambitions
for integrated region would have to wait
for a whole generation to pass the
rebellion that had swept the region was
a bit slow in coming to Grenada in 1930s
it didn't arrive until the 1950s and in
1951 a full-scale revolt erupted in the
country again 150 years later and this
time as in the first time it was based
in the rural area among those who were
most socially or economically
disenfranchised and it was led this time
by a rural son of the soil fellow who
had as had been the practice in that
period migrated to more prosperous
regions Canadians and others went to
build the Panama Canal at the turn of
the century whence to cut sugar in Cuba
went to dig goal in Guyana went to work
in the oil industry in Trinidad and in
Aruba Eric gairy
was one of those returning immigrants
who came to the helm of the popular
movement for increases in wages and for
social rights and the 1951 Grenada
national democratic uprising as some of
the literature a spot refers to it
brought forth the good evening and
welcome to our symposium on Grenada 10
years later and us Caribbean policy we
have a very full evening so I want to go
ahead and start and let the
introductions be very short so we can
get to the main event and we actually
have two main events we have our
firsthand report by students who went to
Grenada this summer and participated in
the Grenada ten years later project and
we have a description of this project by
decima Williams their professor and
Jacob Ziskin visiting professor of
sociology at Brandeis and we also have a
lot of people of after that the students
wanted to showcase and expand upon their
experience by inviting Noam Chomsky from
MIT to engage in a dialogue with decima
Williams about us Caribbean policy so
let's get going before we start there
are a lot of people who've been very
supportive in getting the Grenada ten
years later project off the ground I
want to thank in particular the four
departments at Brandeis that sponsored
this event that is African and
afro-american studies Latin American
Studies the Rabb school of summer
special and Continuing Studies and the
sociology department and to give you a
little bit more information on the
tenure on the Grenada ten years later
project let me turn the podium over to
Daniel Terrace assistant provost of the
Rabb school
thanks Silvia my own involvement with
this project has been relatively modest
it began really with decima williams's
great passion and energy and her
research project she brought it to the
summer school which is a part of the
Rabb school and we helped facilitate the
ability of students to go down to
Grenada and spend several weeks there
doing research and participating in the
life of that community learning about
its history and being engaged to me this
whole project is in certain sense one
what is most exciting about Brandeis as
a university it combines that sense of
passionate social and political
engagement with a strong academic and
intellectual context for the work it's
very exciting for me too and for the
Rabb school to be part of a program
which combines those things and the it's
a program that was enormous ly
successful this summer thanks to the
energy that decima and the students that
you'll be hearing from brought to it
just a word of thanks to my associate
director Gwen's Maxwell who worked very
hard also to make it happen I'm as
curious as you are to hear the details
about their program this summer and I'm
going to let you move on to that thank
you very much and our next speaker who
will provide some information about
Grenada is Carlos Whiteman who is a
Harvard undergraduate and a Grenadian
[Applause]
this will be brief and it is designed to
look back at the revolution look back at
the revolutionary leaders and sort of
get a sense in the feel for what the
revolution was all about it has been 10
years since the dissolution of the
Grenada Revolution ten years since the
murder of the revolutionary leaders
particularly the prime minister Maurice
Bishop and the other revolutionary
leaders I'd like to read a quote by
Maurice Bishop there are those who
believe that you cannot have a democracy
unless there's a situation in which
every five years and for five seconds in
those five years that people are allowed
to put an X next to some candidates name
and for those five seconds in those five
years they become Democrats and for the
remainder of the time they return to
being non people without any right to
say anything to their government without
any right to be involved in running
their country we say that when in a
particular country the question of a new
health plan has to be formulated and the
people of the country are involved in
discussing that policy and organizations
and mechanisms are introduced ensure
that the people will be able to
participate in bringing that new policy
into existence we say that Israel
democracy Maurice Bishop March 13 1980
one year after the Revolution let us now
have a moment of silence as we look back
to honor our slain revolutionary leaders
and let us look forward to tomorrow
today when the right of
self-determination of a people will be
respected and not undermined by the
forces that be let's have a moment of
silence
thank you and now giving us an overview
of the last 10 years is decima Williams
Siskin visiting professor of sociology
at Brandeis and former ambassador from
Grenada to the OAS either the the
praying Catholic or the diplomats in me
made me stand not sure which it was good
evening everyone thank you all for
coming and I want to thank Silvia Rome
for her role in moderating the program
this evening thank you all for coming
the Grenada ten years later project has
to be started in the context of Grenada
and I'll first talk a bit about Grenada
and then a bit about the project the
island that we call Grenada is both it
has both a single and a collective
identity it's known by many different
names its first name that we remember
Grenada by is called kama horny and
that's the name that the our first
Grenadians called our country before the
advent of columbus it has a country very
much part of the large Caribbean
archipelago where our era lacks Caribes
and Sigourney's people roamed the region
in a fleet of Navy canoes and on the the
arrival of Columbus it took another
hundred more years before European
presence would be established on the
island from 1498 until 1650 these fierce
Caribbean Nationals prevented European
and some of the rights that had been
denied the society as a whole full adult
suffrage was granted in 1951 wages were
increased by about fifty percent and we
are talking about very minimum wage here
the color bar was crossed both by the
fact that the leader of the movement who
eventually became an elected political
elected political leader himself as well
as the constituency he represented watch
were Africans people who were who had
been the descendants of the Africans who
were brought to Grenada and had been
enslaved but Eric gairy lost his way
lost his nationalist populist Pro
people's initiative and after 27 years
in office more or less
he had become popular this despised
corrupt ambivalent and I'm generally
unpopular leader and it took another
social movement to organize and bring to
the fourth what was then the cries and
the needs of the Canadian public that
movement was an usual movement of the
1970s it was a movement which after six
years of popular organizing of
participating in elections of bringing a
multi class alliance to oppose the
dictatorship seized power through
military means on the 13th of march 1979
and began what has been referred to as
the grenada revolution
the new jewel movement governed and
built this process for four and a half
years with tremendous advances and
significant problems in October of 1983
one of the one of the most significant
problems in fact both the two the two
major problems the Revolution suffered
both erupted one was the lack of the
institutionalization of democracy within
the process within the organs of the
process because while there were popular
and democratic institutions at the level
of people and organ at the village level
the decision-making apparatus still
remained very elitist it erupted as one
group said that the other group was not
sufficiently political not sufficiently
revolutionary not sufficiently socialist
and what resulted was a frat aside as I
call it one group of revolutionaries
massacring the other group throwing the
country into complete trauma disarray
and pain
the symbol of the revolution the fellow
that the people had come to trust and to
love and to follow his direction was
assassinated
Morris Bishop I think we have a slide of
him somewhere and the army governed in
alliance with some factions of the party
six days later Washington under the
leadership of President Reagan we should
always oppose the process in varying
degrees between the until 1650 from then
until 1783 the country was occupied by
British French French and British until
1783 when in a cessation more or less of
European rivalry on the island with the
Treaty of Paris
Grenada became a British colony and
remained so until 1974 well after the
wave of Independence had swept Africa
and Asia in fact up until now there are
many english-speaking colonies in the
Caribbean the first wave of independence
came in the early 60s with Jamaica and
Guyana and barbarous in Trinidad and
Tobago
and the second wave came in the late 70s
and the third wave actually is ongoing
starting in 1981 with st. Kitts and many
other territories still on the colonial
rule the 1780s and 1790s were very
fervent organizing period in the history
of Grenada the most important date is
the period of 1795 to 1796 when we had
our first revolution for a year and a
half a very strong-willed mulatto man by
the name of Julien Fatah liberated the
country from British slavery and
colonial rule
Fedor occupied the entire island except
sin George's where the small
administrative core of British
maintained a presence and continued to
try to keep control it took at external
intervention to overthrow that freedom
movement the British sent reinforcements
from other countries but particularly
from Barbados and with a combined
assault Grenada was recaptured slavery
was reinstitute instituted and Grenada
returned to what was then the normal
pattern in the calm in the Caribbean a
colony organized according to plantation
system and colonial rule but if we jump
ahead from 1795 to 1804 many of the
leadership of this popular first
successful slave revolt in the Caribbean
many of them were hanged others were
deported
and a fellow by the name of Henri
Christophe was deported to Haiti where
he participated in the first standing
successful Republic of former slaves
with the Haitian Revolution of 1804 of
course with its reoccupation Grenadier
LAN languished in on the slavery until
1830s when slavery was abolished and a
large peasantry arose what developed
then as documented by several studies
including M G Smith's study on social
stratification in Grenada is a folk
which was according to him well over 80%
of the population and an elite about 7%
and a small
