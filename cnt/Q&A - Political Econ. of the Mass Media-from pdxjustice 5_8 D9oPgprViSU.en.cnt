he then said that according to the
American Embassy in Bangkok 1.2 million
had died not been killed since the war
was over well lectura during the review
just added those two numbers together
call them the Khmer Rouge killings and
then added the boast for good effect
well that's that's where that figure
comes from anyhow after I read the book
I read led her to lock on to her and I
know and I told him look I don't know
what the facts are about Cambodia but
the relation between your review and the
book is zilch and I think you ought to
correct it because your review is being
quoted all over the place well he
actually published corrections in the
New York Review you know I said yeah it
made a couple of mistakes he said well
maybe the number killed wasn't two
million maybe it was just in the
thousands he said slight difference you
know factor of a thousand difference but
the he said really doesn't matter you
know it's terrible anyway and with the
and so on well after his Corrections
appeared they were dismissed and people
kept repeating the two million figure
that he invented almost half of which
was attributed to the American War
notice well that's one example but it's
just typical if you read our chapter on
this you'll see a level of fabrication
which you know is mind-boggling I mean
it's just mind-boggling now this had
nothing to do with the fact of course
there was a massacre in fact as we
pointed out the massacre was probably
comparable to the massacre in Cambodia
which was a huge didn't teamwork which
is a huge massacre we also pointed out
that of all the evidence available there
was one part that was being suppressed
systematically by the American press
interestingly that part was the
information given by State Department
intelligence now the State Department
Cambodia Watchers you know State
Department intelligence they were the
only people with any evidence about what
was going on in Cambodia and they
apparently had pretty good intelligence
they claim to be able to even pick up
radio transmissions and all sorts of
stuff and they were giving a totally
different story they said that what was
going on that there was you know big
slaughter but they said it was in the
tens or hundreds of thousands and it was
not mass genocide but it was rather
mostly harsh conditions and you know
brutality and so on that was the
position of the only people who knew
anything and that was systematically
excluded it was just the wrong picture
you know wasn't bloody enough for the
purposes well we went through all of
this stuff the suppression of the team
or massacre the vast amount of lying
about the Cambodia massacres and we gave
that as at an example of treatment of
paired massacres where they were both
treated now here's the one place where
the book was not ignored what we said
about constructive bloodbath totally
ignored what we said about team were
almost totally ignore it to the extent
that was mentioned the u.s. role was
excluded what we said about Cambodia
however that elicited a huge new outrage
over the fact that we were defending
Paul Pott well we were defending Paul
Pott by saying that he was carrying out
a slaughter comparable to the major
slaughter that the United States was
backing in Indonesia and pointing out
that in fact that was the picture given
by American intelligence the only people
knew anything about it and then talking
about the way this was distorted in the
interests of the propaganda system that
didn't matter here this said what we
were doing was challenging the right to
lie in the service of the state and
that's a very important right to
maintain so therefore the standard view
is and you can read this all over the
place now is that we are usually it's me
for some reason or they decide it's me
but we were defending Paul Pott and you
know sort of apologists for Paul Pott
you take a look back and you'll see that
we started we described it as a major
massacre was it a lot is uncertain you
know and then just describe the facts as
they were and compared them with the
media fabrications and you not allowed
to do that and not allowed to expose
media fabrications and the reason why
that was discussed the one part of the
book that isn't virtually nothing about
teamwork evers discuss the reason why
that one heart is discussed is because
that can be used by further lies to
defame and undermine critics so
therefore that's done well that's the
more subtle way in which the propaganda
system works I should say incidentally
that some of this stuff is really kind
of amusing those of you read this stuff
will have seen it William Shawcross
wrote a book a little after that in
which he claimed the quality of Mercy
that's called very favorably reviewed
all over the press everybody fell in
love with it in the book he claims that
there was silence over the Paul Pott
atrocities and then he asked the
question how could this happen you know
it's called Holocaust in the modern
conscience well first of all was their
silence over the pot atrocity no there
was a vast uproar over the fall pot
atrocities that started a couple of
weeks after it at the time when they
were being accused of genocide they had
probably killed a couple of thousand
people at the most within a year as I
said it was being everywhere from TV
Guide in The Reader's Digest over the
New York Review and then I went on like
that a huge amount of huge chorus of
protest further worth tons of
fabrication but it's it's flattering to
cities if it's it's useful it's
serviceable to say there was silence why
is it serviceable because if he can
claim that there was silence then you
can raise the profound question of why
the West was silent over this massacre
and that means from now on we must be
even more diligent in exposing the
crimes of official enemies to overcome
the fact that we were silent this time
so immediately Shawcross is quoted all
over the place and every newspaper is
saying oh my god we were silent how
could we have been silent and so on then
Shawcross goes on to explain the silence
you take a look at his book he explains
the silence first this was in the
washington post in his book he says the
reason for the silence is the primary
reason for the silence is this is the
skepticism of the left primarily me so
in other words by my skepticism i
silenced all the US all the Western
media and governments it's a lot of
power furthermore this and remember what
that skepticism was it was a skepticism
about documented lies furthermore he
then he then then he cites an alleged
statement in a footnote doesn't date it
or identify the source there's two good
reasons for that one is that the
citation is fabricated the other is that
the source to the extent that there's a
source it's in a book it's in exactly
this book which appeared which went to
press after the fall of Paul Pott and
came out almost a year after the fall
fall fall off Paul Potts so what he's
claiming is that in a book that appeared
that went to press after Papa
was overthrown and that appeared almost
a year after in that book we succeeded
retrospective retrospectively in
silencing the entire Western media and
governments for four years well that's
you know not only were we powerful
enough to scare the entire West into
silence but we even could do it by magic
you know now that was quoted that was
quoted all over the place with great awe
the point is there's no absurdity so
extreme that it won't be quoted with
respect if it's useful and here it's
useful for several purposes one to
protect the right to lie in the service
of the state to to undermine and defame
critics who you can't answer and three
the claim that we didn't look hard
enough we were silent over this atrocity
well there was an atrocity that the West
was silent over it's the one we
documented teamwork and they were silent
over it because the West was doing it
and therefore you're silent over it
that's the real a you know question of
Holocaust and the modern conscience but
nobody will discuss that one well these
are all examples of more subtle ways of
the controlling thought more subtle and
complex that's the aftermath I had in
mind it's a very interesting story we
review it in manufacturing consent
newslinks uh who's next I lost track
Wisconsin Coordinating Council on
Nicaragua I think that most people here
probably know that Wisconsin and
Nicaragua I've been sister states for 25
years and the Wisconsin Coordinating
Council on Nicaragua has led in
transforming what was originally a
symbolic relationship to a vital tool
for peace and we've just published the
book as will just mention called friends
indeed
re of us Nicaragua sister cities which
is about that over 100 us Nicaragua
sister cities that have formed since the
revolution um one of my question is has
to do with that movement and some of
your insights on it because I think that
recently the popular opposition to the
war in Nicaragua has fallen out of the
major news media it's been identified I
think as a non issue and that kind of
effect of the media has a very
fragmenting effect on movements for
social change in wonderful I think that
sister cities is one way that we can
begin to institutional okay I think
you're you're quite right the coverage
of Nicaragua altogether has dropped very
significantly and I assume that that's
as usual on command the new york times
in fact removed its bureau chief stephen
kinzer and and if you look at coverage
is in fact dropped very fast well I
think that's connected with US policy
there is a shift in policy after the
Reagan period and here you have to look
back a little bit back as far as back as
1980s there has been a debate over
Nicaragua like over Vietnam the debate
is how you strangle and destroy
Nicaragua now the hawk say you do it by
terror and violence the Dove say you do
it by what are now called kinder gentler
methods you do it by economic
strangulation you know by maintaining a
low level terrorist force by mobilizing
on the border so they can't be mobilize
and turn resources to reconstruction
