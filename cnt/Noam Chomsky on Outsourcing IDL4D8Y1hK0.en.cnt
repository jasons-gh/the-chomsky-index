outsourcing has nothing to do with
economic efficiency outsourcing is one
of the operations that take place within
command economies the country the
economy is run by a network of command
economies called corporation I mean what
goes on internal to a corporation or a
mega corporation is not free trade it's
command economy a corporation is a
totalitarian institution no has a board
of directors the top of manager gives
orders it once follows them down to
bottom the very bottom if you're lucky
you can rent yourself to it and get a
job and if you're sufficiently
propagandize you may even buy some of
the junk they produce and so on but it's
certainly not has nothing to do with
what you know any classical economist
would have called the free market
outsourcing is just part of the
technique outsourcing is internal to the
corporation right the corporation picks
some supplier to outsource to and keeps
them under control because then they can
get much cheaper labor hideous working
conditions don't worry about
environmental controls they get inputs
to themselves which are very cheap that
increase for those of you have studied
economics you know that that increases
productivity if you get artificially
chief inputs that increases productivity
because productivity is measured in
terms of you know value produced divided
by the number of workers so you get a
nice measures of productivity which have
nothing to do with productivity they
just have to do with the fact that
you've got the 20 year old women off the
farms and China locked in the factories
and working until they die in a couple
of years that very healthy for the
economy but it's all internal to
big command economies that's one of the
reasons why the concept trade is so
ridiculous
I mean what's called trade would
certainly not have been called trade by
Adam Smith like you know the outsourcing
happens to send goods across the border
into the United States but it's under
the control of a command economy in fact
a network of command economies which
work the way I just quoted you know the
oligopolistic competition and strategic
interact in aggression and the same is
true of most of what's called trade I
mean we don't have nobody really studies
this much so you don't have really
accurate numbers but if we take the
numbers that are guessed at by
economists would look at it it takes a
NAFTA one of the great things about
NAFTA supposed to have been that it
increased trade between the u.s. and
Mexico
well it certainly increased cross-border
transfers of material objects but is
that trade well it depends no it turns
out that the percentage of interaction
that's intra firm internal to a command
economy went from about 50 percent
before NAFTA to about two-thirds after
NAFTA that's not trade any more than if
GM shipped something from Indiana to
Illinois you know happens across an
international border so that you can
take advantage of rotten working
conditions and the low wages and no
environmental constraints but no more
trade and if the Kremlin moved something
from Poland Hungary or something like
that it's and in fact it's very possible
if anybody ever bothered the study it
that actual trade is even declined since
NAFTA I mean nobody studies it because
it's the wrong questions to ask you know
need for ideological framework that
we're supposed to accept but if you did
ask it you might very well find that
just as it turns out after NAFTA that
and you know another great thing about
NAFTA for Mexico is that foreign
investment shot up which it did but a
little footnote is the total investment
decline because Mexican investment
declined even faster than foreign
investment went up for the simple reason
that Mexican businesses can compete with
highly subsidized US corporate the
system should we approve of it well you
know that's not the only question there
are other options for example another
option is to work to improve working
conditions labor standards environmental
conditions and so on in the places to
which they are outsourcing okay that'll
tend to equalize the conditions is that
a utopian measure not at all been used
they take a look at the European Union
before the European Union integrated
efforts substantial efforts were made
and substantial costs were assumed to
raise the level of the poorer countries
Portugal was main in Greece to raise
labor standards raise wages improve
conditions enough then get to the
northern standards but enough so that
when they finally integrated there
wasn't a very severe blow against the
wages and living standards of northern
workers well that's because they have a
kind of social market economy in a more
or less functioning democratic system
and the same could have been done with
regard to NAFTA in fact it was proposed
by the US labor movement but never
entered the discussion and the same of
the custom corporate media against it
and the elites are against it but and
the same could be true of the whole
outsourcing story so there are other
options it's not either let the command
economies maximize their own profit and
power or else you know you don't have a
job there
