I mean there was a peace agreement and
it stayed pretty much in place and then
what happened is awful the was a truth
commission that estimated about seventy
thousand people killed small country
almost all by the armed forces and their
death squads they ran us-backed forces
so a horrible atrocity you know all
kinds of torture everything else but it
didn't settle down into a peace
agreement and the FMLN the guerrillas
basically won the next elections so the
activism is not directly against the
government that was the anti-government
forces which are now technically in
power I say technically because as you
know better than I do
El Salvador's under extraordinary
external pressures a small country has
little room for manoeuvre can't escape
the grips of the United States and the
US dominated international institutions
like the World Bank which imposed plenty
of constraints but still it's it ended
the slaughter and the forces that were
resisting did win a political victory so
whatever one thinks about that it does
reduce the scope of activism not totally
like they still are no there's a memory
of the murder of Archbishop the murder
Jesuit intellectuals there's protests
about policies the government has taken
place but it's like protests in other
countries where very different from
opposition to a major a major
devastating murderers war and here too
there's still the Solidarity groups are
still functioning
you know also see space others and I
think doing good work other countries
it's different so for example in Brazil
major from the most important country in
Latin America the purpose or now very
expensive protests against the left
government the Workers Party which has
done some shaved some things but also
you know has massive corruption lots of
things to protest against and it differs
in different countries I should say to
overall what's happened in Latin America
in the past 10 or 15 years is quite
remarkable
I mean Latin America used to be in the
pocket of the United States it was
called our little region over here which
does whatever we want totally different
now
the US have almost isolated in the
hemisphere the reason why Obama finally
made some moves towards ending the US
attack against Cuba is that the US would
have been totally isolated at the last
summit unless he'd done so as it was
isolated in the previous summer that's
an enormous change the US has no
military bases left in South America
amazing even Colombia's main ally that's
a historic change
hello good afternoon professor Chomsky
my name is galina vankaya
and i'd like to know your opinion on
Vladimir Putin then what's happening
right now in Russia is Ukrainian crisis
thank you nobody looks very pretty to
this story but we shouldn't recognize
that the US version is very distorted
and fortunately there is mainstream
critique of it so for example in foreign
affairs the main establishment Journal
there's a important article that you a
featured article by a leading
international relations scholar John
Mearsheimer in which the title is
something like the Ukraine crisis is the
fault of the West and what he's
referring to is something quite real
when the Soviet Union broke down around
1990 the question is what's going to
happen to the structure of Europe and in
particular to NATO the NATO was a
military force it's alleged purpose was
to defend Western Europe against the
Russian hordes okay
no more Russian hordes what happens to
NATO if you believe the propaganda
should dissolve instead it expanded in
violation of verbal commitments it
expanded the East Germany then on to
former Soviet satellites right off to
the borders of Russia the Ukraine is of
central geostrategic significance for
Russia as Mearsheimer points out no
Russian leader could accept Ukraine
becoming part of a hostile military
alliance that would it be kind of like
during the Cold War if Latin America was
taken over by the Warsaw Pact and Mexico
had a coup overthrowing the pro-american
government and the new government said
we're going to join the
we're so back I mean us could never
tolerate that so whatever one thinks
about what Putin is doing there's a lot
going on the new Ukrainian government
the one that took up over after the
elected government was overthrown voted
overwhelmingly Parliament voted
overwhelmingly to join NATO that's a
very severe threat to the Soviet Union
no matter who is in charge
that's quite apart from historic
connections and so on so it's a mix it's
a mixed story and it's a dangerous one
could lead the war and a war means the
end you know terminal war to nuclear
state it could happen and there is a
reasonable settlement which is kind of
understood namely Ukraine should be
neutralized and not become part of any
military alliance and some kind of
federal arrangement of one sort or
another this should be instituted which
would permit the various regions to have
a degree of autonomy including the
pro-russian regions russian-speaking for
Russian regions so I wondered what your
thoughts were on what the next
substantive steps should be in terms of
anti-nuclear proliferation activism it
worries me that a lot of younger people
born after the collapse of the Soviet
Union were essentially taught that they
were growing up in a post-nuclear world
and of course that's not the case at all
and granted we do have the NPT review
coming up we have the negotiations with
nur Iran that's that's great but I feel
like there should be infinitely more
opposition to the existing nuclear
stockpiles and so forth then then there
currently is I wonder what your thoughts
were on on fostering more of that
frankly yeah you're quite right right
now for example the United States has
initiated a trillion dollar program to
upgrade its nuclear weapons we should be
doing exactly the opposite even a legal
obligation to
there are many steps that can be Ukraine
which we mentioned is a very dangerous
situation there are steps that could be
taken to mitigate the enormous threat of
nuclear weapons that one of them is
establishment of nuclear weapons free
zones it's not a panacea but it's a step
now there are several there's an African
nuclear nuclear weapons-free zone which
however cannot be implemented because
the u.s. is blocking it it has to do
with the island of Diego Garcia which
Africa the African Union claims as part
of its territory but the US has taken
over after the British kindly kicked out
its population to establish a major
military base which has been built up
which is used for bombing all over
Central Asia and has been built up
particularly under Obama to include
nuclear submarine submarines with
nuclear weapons and so on and so forth
so that blocks the Africa zone there is
a Pacific zone but that's blocked by the
United States too because the u.s.
insists that it's Pacific dependencies
must permit nuclear weapons to be stored
and used there but those are steps that
could be taken the most important would
be a Middle East nuclear weapons-free
zone if that's the most dangerous region
now the Arab states have been pressing
for that for twenty years since the mid
90s and there's an enormous
international support for it there's so
much so that the u.s. is compelled to
formally agree but only formally it says
times not right a nice idea this came to
a head
just recently December 2012 there was to
be a meeting in Helsinki to advance this
project under the auspices of the NPT
Israel said it wouldn't attend
the question is will Iran say they said
they would attend without conditions a
couple days later Obama cancelled the
conference the Arab states vigorously
protested assisted they're going ahead
anyway there was a meeting of NGOs and
Helsinki but of course nothing could go
forward
well that wasn't even reported here but
these are things that could be done and
they're important to do I think you
picked a very significant issue let's
have two more no no okay okay um hi my
name is Josie singer thank you so much
for coming I really appreciate it I have
a couple of questions for you um the
first one regards whether you think
Israel as a country has the right to be
Jewish are you comfortable with that
Israel according to its basic law 1960
supported by the stated by the supreme
court is the sovereign state of the
Jewish people in Israel and the Diaspora
so it's my state but it's not the state
of its Palestinian citizens no I don't
agree with it okay thank you
um second question you mentioned free
elections in Gaza and it's so great that
they have free elections which I am
definitely behind but you also mention
how they elected Hamas so I looked up
the Hamas charter and I just wanted to
quote a few things and then see your
thoughts on those so article 28 um
Mohammed is dead he left his arse behind
Israel by virtue of it being Jewish and
of having a Jewish population defies
Islam and the Muslims but the eyes of
the cowards not fall asleep we can agree
that Hamas charter is horrible but now
let's look at the Hamas charter how much
art was written by maybe half a dozen
people in 1988 at a time at a moment of
an extreme Israeli attack on Gaza it has
no status they've repeated over and over
again
it doesn't apply anymore and if you're
interested in charters why keep to that
and take the governing party in Israel
we could it it grew out of hey Ruth
that's its ideological center pagans hey
Ruth Netanyahu say Ruth its position
never change is that the land of Israel
that the entire land of Israel belongs
to the Jews that includes today's Jordan
okay in fact the old slogan was both
sides of the Jordan that's ours and this
is - they've never changed that so
that's their charter didn't anybody pay
attention - so you've mentioned as well
sports many times which I think we can
all agree it has significant problems
and as an activist we want to deal with
Israel's faults but you didn't hear okay
I think we can all agree that Israel has
many faults not Israel has many yeah and
that we would like to do something about
that what do you envision us also doing
about Palestinian faults and how as an
activist can we deal with what the
Palestinians have been doing what Hamas
has been doing and yeah what do you see
with it what I mean
Hamas are not my friends I don't like
what they do but they've been doing not
much what they've been doing is what I
described I didn't have time to go
through the pattern but I've all repeat
it you can find it starting in November
2005 an agreement was reached between
Israel and the Palestinian Authority
that not come us Israel completely
rejected it and Hamas lived up to it not
a single rocket
then came the January election and
Israel intensified its attack with us
support after that there are repeated
attacks Israeli attacks and cease fires
agreements every ceasefire agreement is
approximately like what I've read what
happens is Israel completely dismisses
and disregards it can maintains the
siege in violation the ceasefire
increases the violence Hamas lives up to
it
and Israel officially accepts that until
agrees to that until some escalation of
Israeli violence leads to a Hamas
reaction and then another episode of
mowing the lawn that's been going on
since November 2005 Hamas is not a nice
organization they do a lot of rotten
things that's for the Palestinians to
worry about but it has nothing to do
with us if we were supporting Hamas
nothing zero if we were supporting Hamas
it would be our problem but we're not
and what they do is for Palestinians to
deal with what we deal with is what we
are doing which is supporting massive
criminal operations all over the region
locking piece that's for us to be
concerned about those who are supporting
Hamas can worry about come on can I ask
my question okay thank you very much for
the talk that's wonderful as usual my
question is that what do you think about
the future of the Middle East about the
future of the Middle East removal
regarding what's going on Wars
everywhere in the Middle East so what do
you think how is it gonna be solved or
not nice short question the end of the
Middle East is maybe the worst state
it's been in for a long time I'm in
Egypt most important countries heading
into the maybe the darkest period in its
recent history but Saudi Arabia we just
is Mohammed destroys you know carrying
out devastating bombing of Yemen even
the u.s. thinks it's too much no but
they keep supporting Isis which is a
total monstrosity as an outgrowth of the
US invasion of Iraq that's understood
very well by Middle East specialists
including CIA analyst
others the u.s. didn't create it but it
created conditions for it and it's a
real monstrosity a horrible month
Rossiter and the Assad regime is awful
the people opposing that really doing it
are equally awful it's just it's just a
very ugly situation I mean it's kind of
interesting the way it's described here
so for example typical example the the
day after the negotiations with Iran
tentative negotiations were consummated
the New York Times of course that kind
of recording at the front page had an
article which is worth reading by Peter
Baker saying you know it's a good step
but there are dangers and so on and the
main thing he said is it's constantly
said we've got to be careful about Iran
can't trust them Iran is destabilizing
the region that supports aggression
segrete the most aggressive state
supports terror and he gives even some
examples isn't the one of the worst
examples is that Iran is supporting
forces in Iraq which kill American
soldiers right in other words when we
and that's destabilizing when we invade
Iraq the worst crime of the century and
destroy it and it creates sectarian
warfare which is tearing the place apart
that's stabilizing if someone resists it
it's destabilizing that's taken for
granted and that's our problem here as
long as this culture is so retarded that
it can even contemplate something like
this the world is in real trouble
including the Middle East
