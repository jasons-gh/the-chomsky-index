me toos and b-52s are carrying out
simulated nuclear bombing attacks right
on North Korea's borders they remember
something from the past so they're
reacting in a very aggressive extreme
way well what comes to the west from all
of this is how crazy the North Koreans
are ya they are a little bit more to say
well this is the way the world is going
and I don't have to talk about other tix
a miss fame my Spanish being devastated
by economic policies which are totally
mad you know it's perfectly obvious that
you can't overemphasize of the problem
the Spanish problem was not what Spain
was doing the budget was pretty much
balanced in 2007 its banks which
includes German banks because they do
the lending so the banks went crazy with
the bloom and when everything busted you
the population pays for X I was just an
Ireland same story they didn't Celtic
boom they called it all bank shenanigans
and crashed the government guaranteed
all the losses of the bank's government
means the population for the public
population pays off the banks and
they're doing fine you know and
meanwhile the population suffering then
the truck that comes in and says you
have to carry out policies that are
bigger worse austerity understand ation
that's the way they grow up well you
know this is not a problem at the scale
of destruction of the of existence but
it's a serious room and these things
it's not that there are no alternatives
sure there are alternatives but they're
not being taken and that's dangerous so
if you ask what the world is going to
look like it's not a pretty picture
unless people do something about it we
always can easy to paint a pretty
picture and maybe it's worth thinking
about I see one way in which the future
he is actually suggested by Barcelona in
1936 there was some very significant
developments took place in Spain not for
the first time they had a long history
they didn't come out of nowhere they've
been years and years of thinking about
it working about an experimentation
efforts we crushed but i'll be in a
second but it was a complicated
development you know first it was in the
middle of a war soon but until there was
a social revolution it was crushed with
it about a year but during that one you
answer questions in Italy by the
communists fascists and liberal
democracies operating together they
wanted but ended up in May Day in
Barcelona and went on but there was a
development of self-governing you know
autonomous free communities of a pretty
impressive kind with some interesting
literature about it interesting book
code of collectivization is just
statements by small communities about
what they were doing is very moving I
remember one by to read these things
when I was a kid when a town called
memory I don't even know if it's still
there but it described what they were
doing and said nobody i may be the
poorest found in spain but it is the
most just you know and they describe
what they were doing and there were a
lot of potential there in barcelona to
it was crushed but it was a potential
and i think it gives a fleeting image of
what a more free and just society could
be like and I think that's the kind of
thing that's within reach in the United
States for example which is well right
in Spain for example in the Basque
Country the monitor gone conglomerate is
an indication of steps that can be taken
toward
a more free and democratic society a lot
of criticisms but it's an important step
the Mondragon is now there's some
linkage being set up between Madigan and
the US Steel Workers Union the most one
most progressive unions to work together
on developing work around enterprises
and cooperatives in the Rust Belt the
area the united states where the
manufacturing industries destroyed by
again by policies that were by no means
necessary and there are work around
enterprises developing and these are
steps towards a more fluid just future
and there's many others that can be
taken but we're not going to get there
unless we pay some serious attention two
major problems major threats of your
face
you
