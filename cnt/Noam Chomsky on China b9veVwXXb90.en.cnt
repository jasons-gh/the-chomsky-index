the constitutional amendment is another
dangerous and unfortunate step towards
autocracy and repression in China it's
actually being accompanied by the many
acts of harsh brutal repression all of
this should be century as for China's
overseas activities insofar as they
involve the exploitation destruction of
resources and suppression of people's
rights while at once then of course they
should be condemned with the fact that
the United States and England used
extreme violence and gaining their
superpower status of course does not
justify anyone else doing by and large
China's international interactions to a
large extent have been commercial rather
than fortunately but that's about 100
percent true and if they if those bounds
are crossed again should be condemned
and prevented right just like the other
power but China is way behind the West
in this respect for the moment
