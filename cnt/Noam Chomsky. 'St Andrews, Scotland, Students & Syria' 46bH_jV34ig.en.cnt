Vice Chancellor in recognition of his
major contribution both to science and
to society I invite you to confer on
professor Noam Chomsky the degree of
Doctor of Letters honoris causa pay heed

well I'm a little reluctant to draw any
conclusions I mean I have a kind of an
instinctive favour a feeling in favor of
the devolution regionalization turning
to local authorities and so on on the
other hand there are costs and I don't
think you can take a casual attitude
towards estimating the costs and the
benefits without really thinking through
what the people on the scene are how
what's what's going to mean to them and
without the intimate acquaintance with
the particular circumstances I think
it's kind of irresponsible to draw
judgments my own feeling would be in
favor of devolution but there's so many
consequences that have to be worked out
that I think it just has to be evaluated
by the people are going to live with the
consequent instinctive feeling is the
more devolution the better but on the
other hand there are consequences to be
thought through and without again I
think it's just irresponsible to draw
conclusions without working through the
consequences
Queen the Diamond Jubilee well I think I
told you this story already but I have a
Australian friend kind of a radical
philosopher in Australia who in
Australia a couple of years ago they had
a referendum on whether to become a
republic or to stay within the Empire
and of course all of his friends and
associates were in favor of becoming a
republic throwing off the trappings of
Empire and he surprised them all by
writing a letter in the major journals
saying he was in favor of staying in the
Empire and then a lot of critical
letters came in and he answered back and
he said well he's in favor of it because
the Empire is so ludicrous it's just all
of its trappings just a lead to
disrespect for authority in the state
which he thought is a good thing you
know so that's okay if people enjoy it
actually my wife and I happen to be here
when in London when that Queen Elizabeth
was at the coronation we were students
knocking around Europe backpacking and
that was kind of fun you know as long as
you didn't take it seriously
as little as I can manage I mean you
can't get along without faith and
something or other you can't evaluate
work out the details of whether the next
time you take a step you're gonna fall
into a pit let's say so you have certain
faith in uniformity of nature and the
way people are going to behave and so on
but by and large when that when
something significant comes alone having
irrational beliefs I think is generally
not a good idea and if that's what faith
means I think it's not a good idea so of
course we all live by faith and this
that and the other thing because we
can't you know we can't work out the
consequences of every tiny action we
carry out and we have assumptions about
the world and what it's like and so on
but beyond that faith that interferes
with thinking problems through is a is
dubious lesson Siemens Sciences I mean
any work you do in the most technical
area the sciences is guided by beliefs
you don't question on the other hand
they should be open to question
like they shouldn't be sacrosanct so if
some reason comes along to question them
you ought to be open to questioning them
even your most fundamental premises and
principles
it has effect on the behavior but it
doesn't affect language that just this
language was the actual language that
you people's language we have a kind of
a language faculty it's a aspect of our
cognitive system it's genetically based
and that hasn't changed for at least
fifty thousand years nomads with all the
changes and culture and the variation
kinds of society and so on we have
exactly the same language instinct as
primitive tribes and Amazonia that have
never had haven't had another human
contact for twenty thousand years and
you can tell that very easily
I mean if an infant from one of those
tribes is Brooke here at the st. Andrews
as an infant it'll learn to speak like
every kid in the streets and conversely
which means that the language capacity
is the same that hasn't changed the
language use changes all the time and
that texting may have some effect on
probably quite peripheral and language
use it may not be entirely peripheral so
for example there are studies of middle
English and later English syntactic
structure and it turns out that embedded
relative clauses you know in a relative
clause inside a longer sentence tends
not to be used much in writing and
earlier English and used constantly
later it's assumed that that's probably
the effective literacy effective
literacy is to get you to use more of
your language capacity than you
otherwise might but the capacity doesn't
change
students were graduating from a place
like this are pretty privileged people
that means they have lots of
opportunities more than almost anyone in
the world or in the past history and the
only reasonable advice you can give to
anyone is think through your
opportunities think through what goals
you want to achieve and figure out ways
to advance towards those goals whether
they're in personal life for the way you
act in the world as a decent human being
and so on a lot of options and a lot of
options means a lot of responsibility so
think it through but I can't give it
I've never tried to give advice to my
own children
things that you
there are poor communities around the
world
in the United States Colombia and South
East and Turkey refugee camps for him
I've been able to do things and they're
grateful for it and I think that's an
achievement
deeply indoctrinated the Western
religious belief that pictures the
debate like this it says there are two
sides Israel and Palestinians the United
States is an honest broker trying to
bring them together or reach a solution
and so on now that's real religious
faith I mean the kind that you rarely
get in organized religions because the
evidence is so vastly against it it
takes deep the irrational commitment to
power to even entertain that thought I
mean if there were serious negotiations
going on they would be run by some
neutral party that has some
international respect like maybe Brazil
and on one side would be Israel in the
United States on the other side it'd be
the rest of the world I mean asking the
United States to mediate is kind of like
asking Iran to mediate and Sunni Shia
conflicts in Iraq yeah we'd laugh no and
we would laugh about this too if we
weren't so deeply indoctrinated for 35
years the United States been blocking
the international consensus on a
political settlement how can it be a
negotiator how could it be a mediator I
mean it's just this blind faith in power
that's so deeply indoctrinated and
embedded in the intellectual world that
prevents us from seeing such obvious
facts that some of the US and Israel
it's the way you what you read in the
newspapers is that the Palestinians are
insisting on preconditions for
negotiation Israel's is no we don't want
any preconditions that's not true the US
and Israel insist on crucial
preconditions and one of them is that
the US must be the mediator but already
undercuts the legitimacy of any
negotiations the other precondition is
the
Israel must be permitted to continue its
settlements they're all illegal there's
no doubt about that every relevant
international authority has determined
that the International Court of Justice
the Security Council repeatedly in fact
Israel itself admitted and as far back
as 1967 yeah of course they were illegal
all of them but we're going to go ahead
anyway and Israel and the u.s. insists
that they be not only that their
presence be a condition for negotiations
but that they must be permitted to
expand now theoretically the US claims
to oppose that but that's pure theory
but when it come when push comes to
shove the u.s. backs it in fact it did
it pretty dramatically at the United
Nations February 2011 when a Security
Council resolution came along calling on
Israel to stop expanding the settlements
that's official US policy it was vetoed
by the Obama administration
they won't permit it you know so you
really have to have it going back to
faith you have to have a lot of faith
and not to see what's happening in front
of your eyes
England is worse Tony Blair's just made
a fool of himself on this he's a he's a
laughingstock and most of the region the
so you can't really begin to talk about
these questions until you kind of
extricate yourself from a lot of
illusions
look I could be an algebraic apologist
same things they do in the world of
human affairs I mean it has some very
abstract level there's some kind of
connection so concerned about the
sources in our nature of the search for
the freedom and independence and
creativity it manifests itself in a
crucial way and the nature of language
may be our fundamental cognitive trait
and it manifests itself in social
relations and ideas about how they
should be constructed but the
connections are so tenuous that you
can't draw conclusions from one to
another there could be people who do
exactly the same work in fact there are
it's pretty much the same work I do in
linguistics I've absolutely opposite
political views and commitments and
there are people in the fields with or
no field maybe just dedicated activists
within my work who couldn't care less
about linguistics
well there are some principles things
going on around the world that are
pretty general but then there are things
specific to particular regions and
places like take say Europe Europe is
kind of like lemmings walking off a
cliff the societies committing suicide
which is it's a little misleading
there's the designers of the policies
are under I think understand what
they're doing and it may significantly
harm the society but it'll benefit
interests that they serve so the some of
the basic policies of austerity and
during recession or stagnation are
suicidal for the society that's you can
read the studies by the International
Monetary Fund reviewing dozens of cases
all of them collapse and you can see the
consequences just in the last couple of
years
England for example that's you know
every the quarter is worse than the last
one that Greece was Spain Portugal
driven Ireland ruined two places growth
declines a debt increases getting
nowhere the one example that's claimed
to have been a success is Latvia but
that's extremely misleading when you
look at it for one thing was a total
economic disaster there's some recovery
from it but largely because Latvians
gonna leave their part it's a small
country and they can go to get you know
jobs and IT and Sweden or something like
that so I think about 10% of the
populations left and that's most exist
these policies are it can't work in some
respects on the other hand they can work
for other purposes they'll dismantle the
social contract though dismantle the
welfare state they'll weaken labour
strength and
concentrated private power well from
another point of view that's a success
actually there's an interesting it's not
very much hidden mario draghi for
example at an ECB recently had an
interview with The Wall Street Journal
in which he wasn't particularly praising
it but he simply said that the policies
that the ECB the other the troika you
know the big institutions are following
is going to eliminate the social
contract that Europe was based on well
from certain points of view that's a
success why should we accept workers
rights or the rights of the poor and so
on do something comparable in the u.s.
there's a very good economics Institute
in the United States called the Economic
Policy Institute which is the main
source of regular data on the nature of
the economy from the point of view of
working people it's the standard
database so they came out with a short
monograph recently reviewing their own
work of the last 30 years and pointing
out what you know a high concentration
extremely high concentration of wealth
stagnation or worse for most of the
population a decline in benefits
increase in working hours of people
getting by on a debt and bubbles and so
on they reviewed it the title of the
monograph is failure by design what they
point is yes it's a fair the policies
that have been followed or failure for
maybe you know 90% of the population but
it's a class based failure of there's a
sector of the population not
coincidentally the designers of the
policy for whom its own or enormous
success so it's and it's designed
because there always have been
alternative policies and there still are
so its failure by design and I think
something like that's pretty much true
in Europe except Europe may really do
itself in
severely if these policies continue and
you look at other parts of the world and
you know there's differences I mean but
in general the impact of there have been
over the past roughly thirty years and
one or in most of the world you know
some exceptions but a lot of the world
has been subjected to what are called
general neoliberal policies and almost
invariably it's been failure by design
its harmed the general populations
benefited small sectors that led to
increased corruption and harshness of
life breakdown of social order some do
spectacularly well in the City of London
they're not suffering you know okay and
or in wall street in fact they're richer
than ever you know banks are bigger than
ever and the the power and the policies
aren't great you know they're not
there's no economic laws that require
them it has it doesn't have to do with
what's called the globalization they
could have quite different policies at
every stage of the game but they would
have different effects on you know the
outcomes on who gains and who loses and
those who design the policies are
essentially achieving now they're
achieving the kind of goal that I
presume they want you know otherwise it
wouldn't continue with the policies and
they're benefiting from it and it's
everywhere let me take the Arab Spring a
lot of it on the surface a lot of it had
to do with getting rid of dictators
which was true but right underneath that
was massive protest against neoliberal
policies which were highly praised by
the international financial institutions
World Bank IMF were praising Egypt
Tunisia for magnificent policies great
social economic progress by their
standards it was doing fine except the
meanwhile for the population things are
getting worse and worse support systems
were collapsing wages were declining
that was gross but very few pockets
enormous increase in corruption had to
be an increase in violence state
violence just to keep people under
control so it's one kind of success
another kind of failure and that's
something like that is true almost
everywhere there are exceptions so for
example in the Santa seventies in the
80s and the 90s that one major exception
was East Asia that was the period of the
rapid growth period in East Asia but
they rejected the rules or they rejected
the whole Washington Consensus the
neoliberal rules and they did fine China
is pretty much the same South America
which is maybe the most interesting case
it was a very religious adherent of the
neoliberal principles in the 80s and the
90s and the economies went into a
tailspin there was some look for a while
as if they were working but it was
illusion and it crashed the past decade
they've pulled out of the system and
they're doing pretty well they've you
know for the first time very very well
by historical standards now they're kind
of various weaknesses and the approaches
they're taking but it's been pretty much
a success so you have to look at you
know what happens depends very much in
the policies you pursue I tend to be
sympathetic towards the suggestions that
are being made by groups you know as
varied as Keynesian economists and the
business press literally the business
breath which is who are saying that for
Europe to face its current problems it
has to have an increase in growth and
the increase in growth is not going to
come from corporate investment under
current situations because demand is too
low so there has to be an increase in
demand and the only way to do that is
through government spending which is
perfectly possible
and that can stimulate the economies
which will grow and over time that'll
reduce you can then later turn to the
problems of deficit and debt to what X
whatever extent their problems so the
way say they in read say bloomberg
businessweek main Business Journal in
the United States what they say is that
what's needed now is to push the
accelerator and you can worry about
pushing the brake later on after the
accelerators develop the economy you
read the main you know the most
respected commentators and the Financial
Times like Martin wolf same thing pretty
much and there others like Joseph
Stiglitz Paul Krugman and others are
saying pretty much the same and I think
that's in the short-term probably
correct there are other questions you
can ask deeper questions like who ought
to be making the decisions so I take big
concrete let's say when a couple years
ago the Obama administration pretty much
nationalized the American auto industry
they took them out and took it over
bailed it out public basically owned it
now there were a couple of possibilities
that could have been followed that one
is the one that was followed namely
restructure the industry at taxpayer
expense hand it over hand it back to the
former owners or people very much like
them maybe some new faces but
essentially the same and have them
continue to produce what they were
producing namely automobiles and trucks
and so on another possibility would have
been take the effectively nationalized
industry I hand them over to the
workforce and the communities to run and
help them in producing things that the
country really needs like if you've ever
traveled in the United States you know
that one of the things the country
desperately needs
efficient mass transit system I mean you
know it's way behind almost the rest of
the world and high-speed rail and
infrastructure development so those are
all things that can be done by the
workforce that's sitting idly and
so-called Rust Belt okay that was an
alternative policy that would leave
industry under popular control okay that
that was not contemplated but it's an
alternative and it's an alternative all
over the place and in fact to some
extent it's being pursued in England to
their case there's cooperatives there's
worker run enterprises that's an
alternative economic model which could
be substantial changes not like the
narrow question of shouldn't you have
government stimulus of growth when you
need to increase demand so there are
questions that can be raised all across
the board
well there's I think universal agreement
that what's going on in Syria is a human
catastrophe and among those who know
something about Syria there are people
in those zones not many but there's some
you know Patrick Seale Jonathan Steele
and the glory and the Charles glass
correspondent among anyone who knows
anything about Syria who I can find
there's the conclusion is that their
their conclusion about what should be
done is essentially negative that any
international intervention it'll make it
worse will make a bad situation worse it
will drive a ongoing vicious Civil War
into an even more vicious one that'll
spread throughout the region a little
sharp and as soon as she conflicts which
are already very dangerous so that looks
like the worst is possible options well
are there better options if there's a
better option than essentially Kofi
Annan's I haven't heard it that's not a
good one in fact the mission just pulled
out because it wasn't getting anywhere
and if you look at what they said
they're not getting anywhere because
neither side is willing to abide by the
conditions that they the ceasefire
conditions that they were trying to
implement still that's the hope for some
kind of negotiated settlement that will
permit the I think everyone I think it's
pretty reasonable to assume that the
Assad regime can't really remain and the
best idea would be to give it away to
leave without them without setting up a
situation in which their choice is shall
we commit suicide or should we just keep
on murdering people you know want to
leave them with that choice you don't
want to leave the Alawite community
with the option of either being wiped
out in a civil conflict or just going on
carrying out murder so you have to
figure out negotiating options and
diplomatic options that would permit
those some-something within that range
it's not very nice this means that
people keep killing each other but if
there's a better idea it's been kept a
secret I don't know of any there are
situations where it's just hard to think
of a decent way out unfortunately an
expanding civil war with the Syrian army
going wild the various groups of rebels
getting more and more military support
from the outside and carrying out their
own atrocities and for the general
population increasing disaster my
feeling is that all outside forces
should stop interfering
that means Russian Russia Qatar Saudi
Arabia u.s. which is probably behind the
organization of weapons float they're
all just made a turkey they're all
making the situation worse they're
pursuing their own interests they're not
the interests of the Syrian people and
they're the victims that holds of the
Russian ships that holds of the arms
going to the Free Syrian Army there's
another point that should be made the
the US and Britain basically or in
France are saying that they're a block
from intervention and because the UN is
paralyzed by the russian-chinese veto
that's a joke if they want to do
something they won't care one way or
another whether it's authorized by the
Security Council just take a look at
past practice if they don't like what
the Security Council is doing they go
ahead and do it anyway
so I if we had internal documents no my
guess is what they would be saying is
that at the on the White House and 10
Downing Street they're probably pretty
relieved that the Russian
- because gives a pretext not to do
things which they don't want to do
anyway
well you can I mean there are very good
independent journalists actually
mentioned a couple Jonathan Steele with
the Guardian and Charles glass is a
freelancer there's others who do serious
honest work on all sorts of issues and
there's enough you know there's enough
freedom and openness so people can
manage to survive the main thrust of the
media is going to be framed by almost
necessarily by concentration of power
and subordination to power and that just
gets built into people's consciousness
it's not necessarily that they're
fearing repercussions as you can't see
the world differently than that what you
see the world the way you see is like
what I said about Israel Palestine you
see the world a certain way that's the
way you're taught that's the way you're
trained as we see in the communities
around you and to break out of those
patterns of conformity and obedience is
not easy some people do but people most
people who try get punished in one way
or another so it tends to reinforce
itself so the media is institutions are
going to tend to be a conformist power
you can see it all over the place
don't pick almost any issue you like so
it takes a I take say that the way
dissidents are treated in the United
States France England dissident means
Eastern European dissident and there's
enormous attention given to the way they
were treated under the so in the Soviet
Union
you know fought Slav Havel suffer of
others huge literature on it actually I
just was looking at a book on civil
civil disobedience nonviolent resistance
to state oppression by two well-known
really
kind of left liberal journalist
commentators about 99% on Eastern Europe
few things elsewhere okay that's the
point of view that Western power takes
the only dissidents who matter are those
who resist the pressure and violence of
our official enemies actually if you
take a look at distance around the world
that's not the way it is so for example
uh say in Latin America which is us
domains there's plenty of nonviolent
resistance and it's it doesn't get very
far because it's usually just smashed by
state violence backed by the US so maybe
in say Czechoslovakia that's LOF Havel
was you know imprisoned for a while
which is not nice but his counterparts
and also other just had their brains
blown out by security forces armed and
trained by the United States and if you
look at the record since in the post saw
an era say since you know roughly 1960
the record of atrocities torture murder
massacres and US domains in Latin
America far exceeds anything in East
Europe but that's not the way we look at
it if you write a book on resistance to
state oppression you're right about
Eastern Europe not about Latin America
if you write a book about courageous
dissidents you talk about the ones in
Eastern Europe not the ones in Latin
America who faced much worse you know
what much worse farce actually the
victims understand this very well so if
you read the you know the the church
press mainstream intellectual commentary
and Latin America they're perfectly well
aware of it but Western intellectuals
it's not that they're suppressing it you
just can't see the world that way
because it would require looking at
yourself and that's very unpleasant
you know it's unpleasant to look into
the mirror and say this is what I'm
doing now for one thing it's unpleasant
to think about it and for another thing
if you do it then you you're in a you're
morally obligated to do something about
it
which can be hard and costly on the
other hand if you kind of lament the the
other fellows crimes that's makes you
feel good you're being humanistic and
you know it's a good thing to do you
should be doing it that you win praise
you you don't feel that you're under any
moral compulsion to do anything more
about it then lament then support them
which is fine but easy and that's you
know the and you pick any issue you like
you're gonna find something like that so
it ends up with a highly conformist
intellectual class which reveals itself
in the media and in the media themselves
it's reinforced by other factors like
ownership corporate pressure advertising
you know government pressures and so on
which kind of reinforced the natural
tendency towards conformity and
obedience in the intellectual classes as
far as I know this goes back through
history as far as you can trace it it's
very hard to find the society where this
isn't true I just try well if you go
back to sit go back to classical Greece
who drank the hemlock was it the person
who was repeating the proper truisms or
the person who was accused of misleading
the youth of Athens by worshipping false
gods okay take a look at the biblical
records at the same time now there are
people in the biblical records they're
called prophets you take a look at the
badly translated obscure Hebrew word
that they weren't prophesying anything
now they were what we would call
intellectuals they were criticizing the
crimes of state you know crimes of the
king
getting geopolitical analysis warning
about the consequences of antagonizing
Masseria and so on the calling for mercy
you know orphans and widows and so on
that's what we would call dissident
public intellectuals how are they
treated they were imprisoned and driven
into the desert to denounced as haters
of Israel you know the origin of the
word self-hating Jew actually the
prophet Elijah but centuries later they
were honored as prophets centuries later
the people who were honored at the time
are the ones who centuries later were
condemned as false prophets in the
Gospels and so on and if that that
pattern runs right through history it's
extremely hard to find an exception that
you see it's unjust issue after issues
so that takes a the term the term
intellectual in its modern sense it came
into use with the Dreyfus Arts in France
and we honor the Dreyfus Arts but they
weren't honored at the time ml's all I
had to flee France the French Academy
with the other immortals were bitterly
condemned the Dreyfus Arts as
intellectuals in all what they're
talking about and they should leave
issues to those who understand and
they're just a bunch of rabble rousers
and so on later attitudes changed but
not then if you go on a little bit to
the First World War which is a striking
case there were in every country England
the United States Germany every single
one intellectuals lined up
enthusiastically in support of the war
overwhelmingly there was a scattering of
dissidents
it's like Bertrand Russell in England or
Rosa Luxemburg in Germany or the Eugene
Debs
the United States they added up jail
maybe looking back hundred years we can
say it was a ridiculous hideous war and
they were right but not the way they're
treated at the time and to see if you
can find an exception to this in the
historical record it is so consistent
that it's just like one of those truisms
about history and a better on culture
that we can't see and that's real
conformity if you can't see something
that's glaringly obvious and that
governs your current behavior so the
wave right now we treat say dissidents
and Iran who are properly supported we
should be supporting them and maybe we
feel noble about supporting them versus
dissidents and our own domains were
treated maybe much worse we even don't
even know about you know refused to look
at yeah are you going to have haggis
while you're in Scotland am I gonna a
caucus no I don't think so a tough time
okay I'm leaving
