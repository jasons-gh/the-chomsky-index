gnome are you hopeful in the future or
do you think that we've forgot some of
the things that you're mentioning that
happened in the 40s or we forgot times
where a lot of our basic human rights
were not there do you do you think we're
destined to repeat this or are you
hopeful for the future pretty generally
speaking there was regression but over
time the range of Rights and recognition
of rights has been extended so for
example the Forbes magazine cover story
that I mentioned couldn't appear today
there's greater sensitivity to the needs
and rights of broader groups
snoring people but even a bit of animals
so plenty of animal experimentation that
was done right where I live and work 40
50 years ago would not be permitted
today virtually no experiments on
invasive experiments with apes and
monkeys is permitted now so similarly
with people the things you wouldn't say
about women that people made jokes about
four or fifty years ago okay just don't
do it it's a growth of sensitivity human
decency the recognition of other
people's rights now it can at the
extremes go to the point where it goes
to four okay let's be careful about that
but at the core at the base is a very
positive development of expansion of
recognition that people have rights they
have their dignity they have their
self-respect we should honor that you
famously said that we can't have a
capitalist democracy and yet it it feels
like that's what we've all been sold is
that the root of many of the problems we
have in the world or in the US
but I know in my opinion just about
every developed society for the last
hundred years or so that's been one or
another form of state capitalism that
includes the ones that are called
socialist and communist but and the
state capitalist systems all have
features that we don't think about much
or well again but that are very dubious
like take the concept of having a job
wage labor deciding that for most of
your waking hours you will rent yourself
to a tyrant a tyrant who has total
control over you way beyond anything
that Stalin had Stalin didn't tell
people when that you're able to go to
the bathroom but what clothes you're
allowed to wear or do you take this path
or that path if you're going to pick up
a package and put it somewhere if you're
a driver for a truck didn't tell you
when you're allowed to have a coffee
stop well you love the backup that's
what it means to have a job total
subordination for most of your waking
hours to tyranny now that hasn't always
been Nellis except that as normal should
it be when you go back to the early days
of the Industrial Revolution was
considered by working people to be in
outrageous assault against fundamental
human dignity taken for granted and
working people you read the labor press
very free back in the nineteenth century
full of the enunciations was this the US
Republican Party under Abraham Lincoln
condemned it as a crime said the only
way we can accept wage labor if it's
temporary until you become a free man
again
now we don't think about should we think
we should that's the core the core of
all of these societies
including the ones that called
themselves communists I still have the
same that was different for motherfucker
well those are questions we mostly
should be raising lots of things that we
don't think about a very important to
look into whether it's the dedication to
kill the Russians and brag about it in
the 1980s when you're reading a New York
Times headline today or whether it's
fundamental features the Society for
whether its sensitivity to other
people's dignity and self-respect you
know the kinds of things that aren't
thought about are often the most
important ones and in fact that kind of
a good rule of thumb I think as if
there's some issue on which there seems
to be total consensus though it's not a
truism you should be suspicious it's
probably something serious going on but
you oughta look into
