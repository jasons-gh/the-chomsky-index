imagine a different relationship between
Europe and Africa and the light of
history but that couldn't even be
considered I mean it was like two
outlandish to discuss and still is so
Africa was to be exploited by Europe for
its reconstruction with consequences we
know us has since gotten into the act
well that was Kenan he was removed from
office soon after because he was
considered too soft-hearted not up to
dealing with this harsh world and he was
replaced with real tough guys Dean
Acheson Paul nette-c and others and
there's no time to go through it but if
you ever won an education on hysterical
jingoist fanaticism you really should
read their documents if you've studied
these issues you've heard of at least
NSC 68 which is discussed by everyone
but its rhetoric is omitted and you have
to look at its rhetoric to see what's
going on in these crazed heads of the
great thinkers and this is true of the
whole national security council culture
there's a wonderful book on it that came
out a couple years ago by James pack
sign ologist who called Washington's
China is the first scholarly book to go
through the whole national security
culture and it's like reading a
collection of Mad Men you know the work
was very much worth studying much more
worth studying than most of what people
study in their courses on these issues
well anyway that's what do we do about
Latin America the the one we just nobody
has you know our domain well Kenan was
pretty explicit about that too he said
in Latin America we should prefer police
states the reason is and he said that
harsh government measures of repression
should cause no qualms as long as the
results are unbalanced favorable to our
interests in particular as long as we
guarantee the protection of our
resources the resources happen to be
somewhere else but that's a historical
accident there are our resources and we
have to protect them
if you have to do it by the mailed fist
okay that's the way you do it as I say
he was removed the there is a long ugly
history there's no time to go through it
but the Cold War history essentially
follows this pattern the Cold War was a
kind of a tacit compact between the
super v superpower and it's on the
smaller power the United States and
Russia the compact was that the United
States would be free to carry out
violence and terror and atrocities
limitless in its own domains and the
Russians would be able to run their own
dungeon without too much us interference
so the Cold War in effect was a war of
the United States against the third
world and of Russia against it's much
smaller domains in Eastern Europe and
the events of the Cold War illustrate
that each great power used the others
threats as a pretext for repression and
violence and destruction the United
States way more than Russia if you look
at the record reflecting its their
relative power but that's essentially
the picture you can see the in fact for
the United States the war was basically
a war against the cold war was a war of
basically a war against a independent
nationalism in the third world what was
called radical nationalism the radical
means doesn't follow orders so constant
struggle against radical nationalism in
particular the leading thesis all the
way through is that even the smallest
place if it becomes independent is a
serious danger it's what Henry Kissinger
called a virus that might infect others
like even a tiny place you know Grenada
or something if it has successful
independent development others might get
the idea that we can follow the rot will
spread as matches and put it so you got
a stamp it out right at the source it's
not a novel idea any Mafia Don will
explain it to you
The Godfather does not tolerate it when
some small storekeeper doesn't pay
protection money that not that he needs
the money but kind of a bad idea of
theirs going to get the idea and in
particular small weak countries have to
be we have to crush them with particular
violence so that others because they are
it's easy you know nobody can stop you
and others get the point that's a large
part of International Affairs right to
the present well to learn about what the
Cold War was about the obvious place to
look is what happened when it ended okay
so November 1989 the Berlin Wall fell
Soviet Union soon collapsed so what did
the United States do how'd it react I
mean the pretext for everything that had
happened in the past was you know the
Russian monster the monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy attempting to take
over the world as john f kennedy called
it well now the monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy was gone so what do we do
well what turns out what we do is
exactly the same thing but with
different pretext and that was made
clear instantly a couple of weeks after
the blinn Berlin Wall fell the United
States invaded Panama killing unknown
numbers of people we don't count our
victims according to Panamanian human
rights groups maybe a couple thousand
people bombing the slum Algeria slum the
Panamanians take it seriously in fact
last December they once again declared a
national day of mourning about the
referring to the invasion I don't even
think it made the newspapers here and
when you crush ants and your path you
don't pay much attention to their you
know what they may have to say about it
but the invaded Panama had the veto of
the Security Council resolutions the
point of the invasion was to kidnap a
kind of a minor thug Noriega who was
kidnapped brought to the United States
tried sentenced long sentence a sense
for crimes that were real but he had
committed them when he was on the CIA
payroll almost without
small footnote so but but for that we
had to invade Panama kill however many
people it was a couple of thousand
probably and install a government of
bankers and narco-traffickers a drug
trafficking shut up and so on about a
successful invasion and applauded here
it was kind of a footnote to history
that's the kind of thing the US doesn't
its domains all the time but it was a
little different for one thing the
pretexts were different this time it
wasn't we're defending ourselves against
the Russians it was we were defending
ourselves against the Hispanic narco
traffickers who were going to come and
shoot up our kids and destroy the
country and so on and in fact Noriega
was a minor narco-traffickers mostly
been working for the CIA but he became
unacceptable when he started dragging
his feet on following orders like he
didn't participate enthusiastically
enough in the US terrorist war against
Nicaragua and so on so he obviously had
to go well one difference was that it
had different pretexts another was that
the United States was much freer to act
that was pointed out right away by
Elliott Abrams was now after he's not
back in office running the least affairs
he pointed out right away that the
invasion of Panama was different from
what had preceded because we didn't have
to be concerned about the Russian
stirring up trouble somewhere in the
world we were free to use force without
impediment and correct observation
counts it was on right until today many
of the violent acts that the US has
carried out since then it would have
hesitated seriously about if there was a
deterrent but now there are no
deterrence anymore so you do what you
like that was a change the again if you
want to learn more about what the Cold
War was about have a look at the
documents that were produced right
afterwards this is George Bush the first
right after the early nineteen ninety
gives me a budget request there was a
new national security strategy and they
described what the post-cold war world
would be turns out
Lee as before we still have to have a
huge massive military force but we have
to maintain what they called the defense
industrial base that's a euphemism for
high-tech industry in you know for the
public and so on you talk about our
belief and free trade and free
enterprise and so on but anyone who
knows anything about the US economy
knows it's based on state extensively on
the state sector high-tech industry is
very largely within the state sector and
under a government it's under typically
under Pentagon cover as long as it's
electronic space and that's called the
defense industrial base so we have to
maintain the huge public subsidy to
high-tech industry called the defense
industrial base we have to have a
massive military but it has different
targets the as they pointed out before
this we were aimed at a weapons rich
target mainly Russia now we're aiming at
a target rich region mainly the third
world no any weapons but there are a lot
of rich targets there so that's what we
need the major military forces for in
fact that's pretty much what it was in
the past two but now it's openly
conceded we have to with regard to the
Middle East specifically we have to
maintain intervention forces directed at
the Middle East and then comes this
interesting comment we need same
intervention forces directed at the
Middle East where the problems that we
faced could not be late could not have
been laid at the Kremlin's door okay so
sorry folks we've been lying to you for
the last 50 years claiming we're
defending ourselves against the Russians
but now that the Russians aren't there
it turns out the problems couldn't have
been late at the Kremlin store which is
correct the problems were independent
nationalism and they continue to be so
but now it's said open and clear because
the pretext is gone
we also we have to also be concerned now
about what they call the technological
sophistication of third world powers
it's a really overwhelming threat kind
of like Hillary Clinton there two ago
saying that if he ran a tax Israel with
nuclear weapons will obliterate Iran and
the chance of Iran attacking Israel with
nuclear weapons is somewhere below an
asteroid hitting Israel but it doesn't
matter that it's a nice throwaway line
but but that's the kind of threat we
have to worry about it's not like Ronald
Reagan 1985 strapping on his cowboy
boots and declaring a state of national
emergency because of the threat posed to
the national security of the United
States by the government of Nicaragua
which was only two days away from
harming in Texas so we really had to
tremble and terror well that's you know
that that's standard and it had to
increase after the end of the cold war
with the main pretexts gone and it and
it has the this is also is all
consistent with a conception of
conception of aggression that has
developed through the period and right
up till today it's very lively today
regression aggression has a meaning but
that meaning doesn't apply to us the
vitac by us leaders aggression means
resistance so anyone who resists the
United States is guilty of aggression
and that makes sense if we own the world
you know so any act of resistance is
aggression against us so when the u.s.
invaded South Vietnam in the early 1960s
under Kennedy Kennedy said we're
defending ourselves against what he
called the assault from within and the
leading liberal light Adlai Stevenson
described it as indirect internal
aggression so internal aggression by
South Vietnamese against us and of
course we're there by right because
we own the world the and that that
continues right to the present so skip a
lot of time there's nothing much changed
and come right up till today so the big
problem Middle East now read The
Washington Post a couple days ago is the
growing aggressiveness of Iran that's
what's causing the problems of the
Middle East well you know aggression has
a meaning it means sending your armed
forces into the territory of some of the
state where when the latest case of
Iranian aggression a couple of centuries
ago unless we count Iranian aggression
that was carried out under the Shah
which we approved of the tyrant who we
imposed conquered a couple of Arab
islands but that was okay but
nevertheless we have to defend ourselves
against Iranian aggression in Iraq in
Lebanon and in Gaza where Iran is
carrying out aggression meaning people
they were doing things we don't like and
Russia isn't around so we'll blame it on
Iran that's aggression and there's even
there's a lot of discussion about
aggression inside Iraq I carried out by
the renegade cleric moqtada al-sadr if
you read the press you might get the
idea that without his first name is
renegade it's hardly a phrase that the
reference to him that doesn't talk about
the renegade osada why is he a renegade
well he opposes the US invasion of his
country okay that makes him a renegade
or a radical obviously and that's
routine nobody questions that it's kind
of like reflexive description
Condoleezza Rice was asked a little
while ago on a TV interview how could we
end the war in Iraq and said it's very
easy way to end the wars that it's quite
obvious stop the flow of arms to foreign
fighters stop the flow of foreign
fighters across the border that'll end
the war in Iraq well if somebody was
looking at this who hadn't been
adequately brainwashed by a good Western
education
they would collapse and ridicule I mean
yes there are foreign fighters in Iraq
and plenty of foreign arms in there
namely from the country that invaded
Iraq but they're not foreign remember
they're indigenous because we are
indigenous everywhere that follows from
owning the world going back to the
nascent empires spread so therefore
we're not foreign fighters there or
anywhere else we're indigenous and it's
the foreign fighters who have to be
stopped on and actually the concept of
aggression has expanded recently a
couple of back in January you may have
seen there was an important statement by
five former NATO commanders which was
reported the big issue was that they had
said we have to base our military
posture on possession of nuclear weapons
but it's nothing new it's always been
true it was strongly advocated by the
Clinton administration but much stronger
terms and thing but that was what was
reported however it was interesting was
and the one thing that was new was their
expansion expansion of the concept acts
of war they said acts of war against
which we must have list defend ourselves
by the use of nuclear weapons if
necessary is using weapons of finance ok
so the country uses weapons of finance
against us that's an act of war and we
have to be ready to use nuclear weapons
if necessary well two months after in
late March the United States Treasury
Department warned the world's financial
institutions against any dealing with
Iran's state-owned banks now those
warnings have teeth thanks to the
Patriot Act a little-noticed element of
the Patriot Act permits the United
States to bar from access to the United
States financial system any country that
violates its orders a meaning if a
German are
Chinese or other Bank tries to have
dealings with Iran they can be barred
from the US financial system which is a
cost that very few are willing to bear
and might and it could and is in fact a
declaration of war and by the judgment
of the five NATO commanders an act of
war against which grant is entitled to
respond anyway it likes perhaps with
nuclear weapons or terror or whatever
according to these judgements now you'll
notice that there's a serious logical
fallacy and would have just been saying
it overlooks two fundamental principles
which are the crucial principles of
world order the rest is footnotes the
first principle is that we own the world
and Iran doesn't so therefore the
principle is not apply to us they only
applied to others and kind of a
corollary to that is that everything we
do is necessarily with the best of
intentions that's a tautology you don't
have to give evidence or arguments and
that's a constant feature of the
intellectual culture almost without
exception across the spectrum so for
example during the invasion of Vietnam I
don't hope I don't describe it to you
but it killed several million people
destroyed three countries it's just a
monstrous atrocity but and it was if you
if you look over there was vast
discussion of a mainstream discussion
but if you look closely you'll find that
there was never a principled critique of
the war that was not permissible the
typical just to keep the kind of left
critical end and the rest gets worse at
the end of the war anthony lewis of the
new york times wrapped it up he said
speaking from the left liberal extreme
that the united states entered the war
with blundering efforts to do good
notice efforts to do good as a tautology
we did it so therefore its efforts to do
good
so it's not saying anything blundering
because it didn't work as well as they
wanted at least worked pretty well but
not as well as they wanted so we started
with blundering efforts to do good but
by 1969 it was clear that we could not
establish democracy in south vietnam at
a cost acceptable to ourselves well
established democracy in South Vietnam
is on a par with some Soviet commissar
saying that Stalin was trying to
establish democracy in Eastern Europe
but that doesn't matter it's us so we
were doing and but the cop at the
problem with it was the cost to us ok so
that meant we had to sort of start
pulling out well that's the critique at
the very left end take one more example
the leading American liberal historian
maybe the most famous historian of his
generation Arthur Schlesinger who was at
first a super hawk like the whole
Kennedy administration was no
alternative to victory and said in their
invasion of south vietnam this is what
it was but by the late 60s he was having
second thoughts and he wrote a book
expressing them and he said that he said
we all pray that the Hawks will be
correct in hoping that the surge of the
day big influx of troops will be
successful and if they are we will be
praising the wisdom and statesmanship of
the American government in winning the
war and he was aware of what it was he
said leaving a land of wreck and ruin
with its institutions destroyed may
never recover but will nevertheless be
praising the wisdom and the
statesmanship to the American government
and we pray that they're right the Hawks
but he said they probably aren't right
it's probably going to be too costly for
us no question about the cost of the
Vietnamese and land of wreck and ruin so
therefore maybe we ought to rethink it
well that's the criticism at the
critical end of the spectrum the dovish
critical end then from there on over to
the jingoist end of the spectrum you
have a kind of a debate could we have
one with more force or was a lost cause
anyway and so on rather striking that
the population is
this so in 1969 the year that Lewis
pointed to seventy percent of the
population I thought that the war was
fundamentally wrong a tomorrow not a
mistake try to find anything in the
literature of educated sectors that says
it was anything but a mistake that it
was fundamentally wrong a tomorrow
that's not unusual internally the
government was aware of this one of the
things that is not taught but should be
read because it's very illuminating is
the final part of the Pentagon Papers
pentagon papers are not Declassified
archives their stolen archives so we
know a better idea what they were
thinking the Pentagon favors end in 1968
right after the Tet Offensive in january
nineteen sixty eight which convinced the
business world this is going to cost us
too much we better start separate
winding it down there was a request from
the government to send another couple
hundred thousand troops to Vietnam but
they were dubious about doing it and
didn't do it finally because they were
fate afraid that there would be an
uprising in the United States a popular
uprising of unprecedented proportions
and they would need the troops for civil
disorder control because of protest
among underprivileged people women youth
and others who just weren't going to
take anymore well that tells you that
they were they didn't admit that they
were listening but they were and they
always do if they needed the troops for
control and they source slowly started
backing off another six years of war
devastated Laos and Cambodia and much of
Vietnam but at least they started
winding down well that was nineteen
sixty-nine notice that you can take the
rhetoric about the Vietnam War and
translated almost verbatim at the
discussion of the Iraq war there is no
principle critique within the mainstream
and nobody can buy principle critique I
mean the kind of critique that we would
carry out reflexively and
ooh when somebody else commits
aggression I say when the Russians
invade checks lochia or Afghanistan or
Chechnya we don't ask is it too costly
in fact it wasn't costly at all
practically killed nobody in
Czechoslovakia Chechnya after reducing
the place to ruin apparently it's
functioning pretty well in fact if
according to Western correspondence if
David Petraeus could achieve anything in
Iraq like whether Putin achieved in
Chechnya I'd probably be crowned king or
something like that but nevertheless we
condemn it rightly doesn't matter
whether it worked or not or whether it
was costly for them or not or when
saddam hussein invaded kuwait the
killing probably a fraction of the
number of people that Bush killed a
couple months earlier when he invaded
Panama but we nevertheless denounced it
as aggression no that's a principled
objection but when we carry out
aggression it's inconceivable and that
goes back to the principles that I
mentioned we own the world and
everything we do is by definition good
and intention so the worst that it can
be is what barack obama calls a
strategic blunder or what hillary
clinton calls getting into a civil war
which we can't win in fact iraqis
overwhelmingly blame zoo or on us but
that's irrelevant to that's the level of
critique and it's and it follows from
you know from the principles that i
mentioned and it governs news coverage
too in fact pretty openly here's John
Burns is the Dean of correspondence most
the senior most respected correspondent
for the in Iraq after a long long career
he says that the United the United
States is the prominent economic
political and military power in the
world and has been the greatest force
for stability in the world certainly
since World War two it would be a dark
day
if the outcome in Iraq were to destroy
the credibility of American power to
destroy America's willingness to use its
power in the world to achieve good to
fight back against totalitarianism
authoritarianism gross human rights
abuses okay in other words that's the
framework of reporting reporting must be
cheering for the home team nothing else
is conceivable because of the depth of
these principles which are instilled
into people in the educational system in
propaganda you can't see the world in
any other terms so it's neutral
objective reporting to say we're
cheering for the home team and it's
quite open that's interesting that he
said it's so clearly but he says that's
particularly true he says in the Middle
East notice that makes not the slightest
difference what the people of the world
of the Middle East think that's not
relevant or for that matter with the
people in the United States state so the
Vietnam War was benign efforts to do
good which were too costly to us even
when seventy percent of the population I
said that's fundamentally wrong and
immoral not a mistake population here is
as irrelevant as the population and the
rest of the world unless you're
frightened of them and have to keep your
troops here for civil disorder control
what what the people think well what
people think we know from international
polls that are regularly taken they
think that the United States is most
frightening dangerous country in the
world not John Burns's line what about
the and there's overwhelming opposition
to us force this everywhere the it's
also true the Middle East and there's
nothing new about it so George Aaron
current George Bush after nine eleven
asked why do they hate us and went on
they hate our freedoms and so on you
remember that
but the press should have recorded is
that he was just repeating a question
that President Eisenhower asked in 1958
Eisenhower asked his staff why is there
a campaign of hatred against us among
the people of the Middle East and the
national security council the highest
planning agency had provided an answer
is that the people in the Middle East
their perception is that the United
States supports brutal tyranny and
blocks democracy and development and
does so because we want control of their
oil and then they went on to say our
perceptions more or less correct and
that's why it ought to be so therefore
there's a campaign of hatred against us
and so it continues after nine eleven
The Wall Street Journal to its credit
conducted some polls in the Middle East
they didn't care about the general
population what's demeaning Lee called
the arab street they pulled what they
called money Muslims bankers managers of
multinational corporations and you know
kind of guys we like and they found
pretty much the same thing as 1958
there's a campus it's not then I have
any objection to neoliberalism or any of
this stuff in fact they love it but they
condemn the United States for supporting
and a harsh tyrannical regimes which it
does and opposing democracy and
development which it does because we
want to control their energy resources
by 2001 they had other objections namely
Israel's us-backed vicious repression
and dispossession of Palestinians which
is ongoing and also the sanctions
against Iraq the sanctions against Iraq
didn't get much play here because we
don't pay attention to our crimes that's
crucial that's part of the principle
that everything we do is good but they
do pay attention and
