yes of course always with the protection
of the nanny state closely related
development was the offshoring of
production that's within a global trade
system that is very carefully designed
to set working people in competition
with one another worldwide along with a
very high level of protection for wealth
and unprecedented rights for investors
that's the usual interpretation of
market discipline again fine for you but
not for me please these developments set
in motion a vicious cycle of
concentration of wealth and with it
concentration of political power and in
accordance with Smith's maxon for the
past 30 years state corporate policy has
been very precisely designed to
accelerate this cycle so inequality as
you probably know has soared to the
highest levels in US history but less
known is that this is actually
misleading the radical inequality
results primarily from the extraordinary
wealth of the top 1% of the population
actually more accurately the top
one-tenth of one percent it's a group so
small that it's missed by the u.s.
census which vastly underestimates
inequality for this reason it's been
studied by economists meanwhile for the
majority of the population real incomes
have pretty much stagnated that people
are getting by with heavier workloads
much more say than in Europe
and debt and asset inflation like the
last housing bubble the minuscule
category of Victor's and it is extremely
small that's primarily CEOs hedge fund
managers and the like and they use their
political power to enhance the process
so tax cuts for example are carefully
crafted to benefit the super-rich if you
look back until around nineteen eighty
until reagan that taxes were in the
united states were somewhat
redistributed its according to the
analysis the Internal Revenue surface as
in most countries that's what they're
supposed to be since then with a couple
of blips that effect is declined and if
other factors are introduced like say
tax havens and other evasion options
they redistribute upwards that's
carefully designed so take say the bush
tax cuts ten years ago I which are a
huge burden on the economy they were
designed very carefully the they started
in the first year with a tax rebate to
people small rebate so you get a couple
hundred dollars in the in the mail you
think this is great tax rebate but they
were designed so that over the years the
benefits would shift towards the rich
and by the tenth year when they were due
to expire more than about when more than
half of the tax benefits went to the top
1% people who count but then it's kind
of in this
if it happens that way there's a name
for it it's called the sunset technique
you make sure that by the time the Sun
sets things are happening the right way
you kind of delude people at the
beginning and only those who were inside
the game can see what's planning down
the road there's these are perfectly
normal kind of policies for the people
who are called conservatives who now
want to make make it permanent take a
look at the front pages of the
newspapers they want to make these cuts
permanent but for jobs the same as here
the reason we have to give a huge amount
of money to the top 1% of the population
or a fraction of that which spends on
whatever they feel like is for jobs
actually there's a interesting change
that's taken place in the English
language in this respect there is a word
which has become obscene so since there
may be children in the audience I can't
say it but I'll spell it PR 0 F I TS you
know I say that in fact has a
pronunciation it's called jobs so if and
that's kind of by now like routine the
and that's what this is about the same
here well all of this is in fact these
kinds of things that was the bush tax
cuts but the same things happening right
at this moment like the you know the
lame-duck session of Congress that mean
you know the session after the November
election before the next Congress takes
office Obama was greatly praised for his
achievements during the lame duck
session you know statesman like display
of bipartisanship and so on him praised
by his own supporters in fact well there
were some achievements the main
achievement
was a tax break for the super-rich and I
mean super rich like I'm pretty well off
but I'm below the cutoff for that one it
was super rich tax cut of course that
increased the deficit and which was
supposed to be the big thing we're
worried about carrying that off required
some pretty impressive footwork but it
was done also at the same time there was
a tax increase for federal workers but
it wasn't called that because you're not
supposed to talk about tax increases it
was called a freeze think 45 minutes a
freeze for maybe five seconds a freeze
for public sector workers is identical
to a tax increase for them so this is a
tax increase for public sector workers
and disguised as a freeze there was also
a payroll tax decrease for Social
Security the Social Security is paid by
working people doesn't prove anything to
the deficit contrary to what you read
workers pay for it and there was a
decrease in that payment which kind of
sounds good people need the money but
again it was a Trojan horse take a look
at the way it was designed it was the
sunset technique again the freeze was
carefully designed so that it ends right
before the presidential election now
political figures understand perfectly
well that was an election coming up and
nobody's going to say let's raise the
payroll tax so that essentially makes it
permanent which is a way to defund
Social Security Social Security is
actually in pretty good shape despite
what everybody screams about but if you
could if you can defund it it won't be
in good shape and there is a standard
technique of privatization namely defund
what you want to privatize like when
Thatcher wanted to privatize the
railroads first thing to do is defund
them then they don't work and people get
angry and they
change you say okay privatize them and
then they get worse you know and in that
case the government had to step in and
rescue it but that's the standard
technique of privatization defund make
sure things don't work people get angry
I hand it over to private capital well
that's the Social Security scam if they
can succeed in the funding it trying for
decades it's too popular to do much
about and very efficient incidentally
minuscule administrative costs you know
nothing like the outlandish privatized
health care system so it's kind of hard
to get rid of but if you can defund it
it might work out that's the point of
this decision in the lame duck session
and that's kind of important social
secure it for all if it can be
privatized it's a huge bonanza for
investors there's a ton of money in the
Social Security system it's kept in a
trust fund or invested in government
bonds and goes back to working people
but if that can get into the hands of
financial institutions they can make a
ton of money by using those funds to
enrich themselves and as usual when the
system crashes to going back to the
taxpayer to bail them out so it's a
great technique also the Social Security
has really has defects like it's almost
have no use whatsoever to wealthy people
I mean they may get it but they're not
going to notice it tooth bake on a
mountain so who cares but for a large
part of the population it's their means
of survival that's particularly true
right now people had a tremendous amount
of their fake wealth which they believed
it in in housing was all fake bubble but
they believed in it that's what was used
for borrowing for education for anything
that's gone a trillion dollars over
there gone those people are going to be
surviving on social security but that's
of no significance to the wealthy of
course there's a kind of a deeper point
the social security is based on the
principle that Kamala boss was talking
about namely solidarity social
solidarity social security is based on
the idea that you're supposed to care
what happens to people who are in need
so like if there's a disabled Widow
across town and should have food to eat
you're supposed to care about it that's
what social security is and that's a bad
idea now you're supposed to look after
yourself not care about other people the
social security is dangers it kind of
undermines preferred doctrines and it
can even lead to action it could change
the way the world works so we don't that
in fact there's a large-scale attack on
public education that's based on the
same principles you can privatize and
the same techniques are being used
defund it so it doesn't work complain
about how it doesn't work privatize it
gets worse but then you've undermined
social solidarity and it's fine for the
wealthy anyway they'll get what they
want well all of this is part of a quite
impressive campaign of class war which
has many aspects that a lot of them
aren't immediately visible but they're
there so for example the government sets
rules on corporate on how corporations
are run what's called corporation
corporate governance and the rules that
have been set up during this passionate
class war period the rules are that CEOs
can pick the boards that set their
salaries and they can and that work out
techniques like say stop stock options
which conceal short
term gain and you can imagine how that
works when you pick your own board well
there have been efforts to try to get
this to be more transparent but they
were beaten back by Congress same is
true of deregulation during the period
when New Deal regulations were
maintained there were no financial
crisis system went along smoothly since
Reagan have been regular financial
crises each one worse than preceding one
but the rich and powerful make out fine
for the reasons I mentioned the public
pays rich benefit well that's at all of
this is a kind of a new stage of state
capitalism loyalty to firms is wasn't
less necessary when the goal of
management is short-term profits which
of course comes mostly from financial
manipulations so who cares about the
firm if it goes under fine umbrage
domestic unemployment is not a problem
so there's no need for a domestic work
force when Mexico and China and Vietnam
and other sources of cheap and brutally
exploited labor can be used as assembly
plants and they are assembly plants
China as well major industries
increasingly have their workforces
overseas like the General Electric while
I have to say that word I'm afraid sorry
while profits come home back to the
pockets of a few so take IBM it's a
quite an interesting example the
business press recently ran a big
article about them and said that
correctly that IBM may strike many
people as the quintessential American
company but over seventy percent of its
workforce was outside the United States
at the end of two thousand eight and the
following year they while continuing to
reduce its US employment the company
announced a program
to offer employees the opportunity to
move their jobs to emerging markets in
other words you have the opportunity to
move to India say where you can live in
a much lower standard of living nice
opportunity but that increases the if
what's called the efficiency of the
company and it provides wealth for the
masters now if employees don't take this
opportunity that is so benignly offered
to them they have options they can join
the people standing in line for food
stamps but IBM is a benevolent company
the article points out there offering to
foot some of the relocation costs so
they're really nice guys the report and
the business press didn't explain why
IBM should be regarded as the
quintessential American company but
there are in fact good reasons one is
that IBM relied on the taxpayer for its
wealth it that's how it learned to
forget about earlier things like helping
out and Nazi Germany but just in the
recent period it had learned to shift
from punch cards to computers modern
computers it learned that at pentagon
funded labs like MIT where i work for
example when finally in early sixties
the firm was able to produce its own
fast computers but they were too
expensive for businesses so than any
state state stepped in to purchase them
now in general a procurement by the
state is a major device of taxpayer
subsidy well many years later actually
decades later IBM was finally able to
make profits in the market and was also
able to spin off wildly successful
enterprises like Microsoft and others
which also benefit
a plea from public subsidy so indeed
it's true the it is the quintessential
American company and management is
following sound economic principles in
shifting affluent employment abroad what
happens to the country is not their
business well it's worth noting that
this really is new not very long ago the
long-term future of the firm was an
important consideration for management
less and less so under modern forms of
state capitalism and rather
interestingly these issues were
four-seat foreseen by the great founders
of modern economy Kaname Adam Smith for
example that he recognized and discussed
what would happen to Britain if the
Masters adhered to the rules of sound
economics what's now called
neoliberalism he warned that if British
manufacturers merchants and investors
turned abroad they might profit but
England would suffer however he felt
that this it wouldn't happen because
these people would be the masters would
be guided by a home bias so as if by an
invisible hand England would be spared
the ravages of economic rationality now
that passage is pretty hard to miss it's
the only occurrence of the famous phrase
invisible hand in wealth of nations
namely in a critique of what we call
neoliberalism the other leading founder
of modern economics David Ricardo he
drew similar conclusions he hoped that
home bias would lead quoting him now
would lead men of property to be
satisfied with the low rate of profits
in their own country rather than seek a
more advantageous unemployment for their
wealth in foreign nations and he said
these are feelings that I would be sorry
to see weakened well there
predictions aside the instincts of the
classical economists were quite sound
well I mentioned before that one well
known market inefficiency effect of the
market and efficiency of dismissing
externalities that is the effect of a
transaction on others in the case of
financial institutions of the
externality that's dismissed is a
systemic risk the risk that the whole
system will crash as a result of them
failed transaction you don't take that
into account when you make a transaction
well in that case the taxpayer can come
to the rescue and it makes sure then
that way you can make sure that those
who profit from risky transactions will
be saved but that's not always an option
and the consequences can be severe in
fact perhaps awesomely severe so
nobody's going to come to the rescue if
the environment is destroyed and that it
must be destroyed is close to an
institutional imperative under
contemporary state capitalism just think
it through business leaders right now
are conducting massive propaganda
campaigns to convince the population
that anthropogenic global warming global
warming with because of human
interference is a liberal hoax the other
succeeding like in the United States
probably two-thirds of the population
believes this by now well the CEOs who
are running these campaigns they
understand what all of us understand
they understand that the threat is very
real very grave that it will destroy
everything they own
wreck the lives of the grandchildren
they know all of that but then as CEOs
of a corporation in that institutional
role they have no choice they can pull
out of course but if they stay there
they have to maximize short-term gain
and market share actually that's a legal
requirement in under anglo-american law
if they don't do it they'll be out and
somebody also come in who does do it so
it's an institutional property not an
individual one and it does set off a
vicious cycle that one that could be
lethal and to see how imminent the
danger is and just have a look at the
new Congress in the United States the
one that was propelled into power by
large scale business funding and
propaganda almost everyone there is a
climate change denier and they've
already been acting on those assumptions
they've been cutting limited
expenditures there are four dealing with
environmental problems and if the United
States doesn't do anything significant
the rest of the world isn't either well
worse than that some of them are true
believers so for example the head of the
new head of one of these committees on
the environment he explained that global
warming can't be a problem because God
promised Noah that there wouldn't be
another flood takes care of that well
you know if that was happening you know
like in andorra or some small remote
country you know maybe we would laugh
but it's not laughable when it's
happening in the richest and most
powerful country in the world and before
we laugh we might bear in mind
that the current economic crisis is
traceable in no small measure to the
fanatic faith in such dogmas as the
efficient market hypothesis and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz 15 years ago called the
religion that markets know best the
religion made it unnecessary for
economists and the Federal Reserve to
notice that there was an eight trillion
dollar housing bubble that had no basis
at all and economic fundamentals was way
off historical trends and that
devastated the economy when it burst no
need to look at it because we have the
religion markets know best so forget it
well all of this and that religion is
resuscitated despite what happened we'll
all of this and much more can proceed as
long as the general population is
passive and apathetic the vote of the
consumerism or maybe hatred of the
vulnerable as long as that's true the
powerful can do as they please and those
who survive will be left to contemplate
the ruins
thank you now I'll be my name is 770
I'll be the moderator for the Q&A
session with that could follow so what
we'll do is we'll take questions from
the floor in the great hall and to
overflow rooms as well if you have
questions with two volunteers I'd like
for you to kind of line up to my left or
my right well left and right and the
volunteers will have the microphones
they will give it to you you had it at
half a minute to ask your questions I
ask that you keep your questions happen
it because there's so many people and
we'd like to get through as many people
as we possibly can so all recognize you
and then you can ask your question
cluster chomsky will respond to it
exactly professor my name's Shane jazz
and my question is actually in regards
to the ambiguity that's surrounding the
Goldstone report in specific the
retraction that has recently been
documented professor my question is that
in essence is the Goldstone report in
itself a retraction because the the
premise of the original allegations that
were made in terms of Israel's
utilization of white phosphorus as well
as the deliberate destruction of
civilian communities that is something
that's a systemic part of the Israel
foreign policy so I just want you to
sort of refer back and to perhaps
comment on the packet is the goals to
report really in essence of attraction
in itself thank you well if you actually
I think personal Goldstone did not
retract the report read the statement he
in fact didn't
would practically mention nothing that
was in the report that was pointed right
without right away by Human Rights Watch
and others he he did refry that he
changed if he knew now what he'd known
anything he would have written it
differently well they thought about what
he knows now what he knows now turned
out to be that Israel's conducting
investigations in fact as Human Rights
Watch pointed out the investigations are
totally meaningless the nothing has come
out of any investigations one person one
soldier was charged with I think
stealing a credit card or something and
that's the results so far the
investigations well it's not unique to
Israel that's what happens when
countries investigate themselves that's
why nobody pays any attention so if it
ran and up in investigation of Iranian
policy would have laughs but cold stone
from whatever his reasons may be decided
that that was important that's it other
than that the allegations are exactly
they were I should say you may not
notice if you look at what I've written
about this I never mentioned the old son
report except for a few critical phrases
pointing out that it was a gift in the
United States and Israel remember that
was a joint attack the US and Israel
were supposed to say that it was a joint
military attack and Wilson gave a gift
he wrote the mandate supposed to exclude
the only crucial issue did they have a
right to attack that's the crucial issue
when some act of violence takes place
well he wrote the mandate to exclude
that and he find why he said yeah he
thinks they had a right to it that well
okay after you can see that you're left
with footnotes like what can we discover
long
the event about the nature of the attack
that's all you see Bella was always
going to be in definite you know who
knows if there was some guy with a gun
hiding United the word and so on and so
forth I mean even with that limitation
is very damning but the crucial issue
was out and it's worth leave that
crucial issue because they certainly did
not have a right to attack if it had
fired a single pistol single shot we
would have been a crime and the reason
is very simple of the discussion you
know by Goldstone and the press and so
on it points out that a country has a
right of self-defense which is perfectly
true and totally irrelevant the question
was does it have a right of self-defense
by force that's a totally different
question sure everyone has the right of
self-defense so Russia had the right of
self-defense against Afghanistan and
there was Afghan terror in the Soviet
Union but did it have the right to
invade that's the question and the same
question here and the answer to that
question is very straightforward you do
not have a right to use force unless
you've exhausted peaceful means that's
both in law and in common morality you
know whether it's a family or
international affairs where they're
peaceful means yeah certainly were for
example Israel could have agreed to
renew the ceasefire which it broke there
was a ceasefire in place Israel broke it
November forth by invading Gaza during
the ceasefire as Israel officially
concedes there wasn't a single Hamas
rocket well there were offers to renew
the ceasefire Israel considered them
decided to ignore them choosing instead
to invade and again that's the us-israel
that's a crime that's the major crime
that's the reason why at least
personally I never even cited the
Goldstone report except this in this way
I mentioned it's plenty of serious
allegations in it but they're missing
the main point it's like say discussing
a Russian crime
in Afghanistan while not asking did they
have a right to invade well you know
once you give that away yeah it's kind
of footnote okay so we'll take another
question on that side and then we'll
move over and I'm Mohammed a Victorian I
thank you for your penetrating study of
state corporate complex I'm wondering
whether this can be extended to the
emerging and consolidating University
and corporate complex and what happens
to the nature of public education
