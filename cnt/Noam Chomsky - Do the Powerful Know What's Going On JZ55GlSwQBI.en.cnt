yesterday you said that in the last 20
or 30 years the standard of living
before 80 percent of this country has
been either stagnant or declining today
said that the particle know what is
going on do you think that the
significant portion of those people can
learn what is going on and well you know
I can't say everybody knows what's going
on but sit but it's like what I was just
described what you just described this
is completely open in public I mean this
I'm not giving you any news you know
this is all over the newspapers if you
want real details I mean I'm the place
to look for details there's a every two
years there's a big study that comes out
called state of working America the
addition for 1996 just came out
I think it's called 1996-97 it's edited
by Lawrence Michelle and Jared Bernstein
a couple of others and that's like a
huge statistical compendium that has all
of this data in it if you really want
but this basic story is known by
everyone you can read it I mean it's
nobody anyone who wants to bother to
know I mean maybe you don't want to
bother to know but it's also perfectly
public information right in the
mainstream you know completely obvious
it's not interpreted the way I
interpreted it it's interpreted as the
Murrah is the mysterious workings of you
know the market and its wisdom and so on
and so forth and there's all kind of
phrases for it there's much to do with
the market it's very definite social
policy do the people who are involved
know what they're doing well and I mean
of course they do it takes a Newt
Gingrich this morning
okay this morning you read the
newspapers you'll I mean even USA Today
you know I happen to pick up USA Today
in the hotel you know place where they
serve coffee so there's an editorial USA
Today is not a big radical rag they have
an editorial pointing out the obvious
you know the obvious I mean to anybody
who has one gray cell functioning Newt
Gingrich made a speech yesterday in
which he called for cutting off capital
gains taxes and estate taxes well who
benefits by eliminating capital gains
taxes and estate taxes well the top one
percent of the population overwhelmingly
then you know tiny effect going down I
mean the editors of USA Today are
perfectly aware of that they're also
aware they may not if they're aware of
it they didn't say it but they may not
they say well Gingrich our Gingrich also
has a statement which is well this is
really important because that'll free up
more funds for investment well you know
I don't know if he reads like exotic
journals like Businessweek but if he
does he or maybe somebody in his staff
knows that the business world the United
States has a big problem though what
Businessweek calls a vexing problem they
have about six hundred and eighty
billion dollars of liquid assets that
they don't know what to do with and
that's a vexing problem for companies
like Intel and Ford and you know GE and
a bunch of others that they list so
therefore the solution is to free that
apparently that two-thirds of a trillion
dollars won't do for investment fund so
we have to give them some more money for
investment funds meanwhile cutting down
food stamps for hungry children you know
not if you ask the people know this well
you know it's it's pretty hard to answer
if they don't know it it's even worse
than if they do know it because it is so
obvious it is so on the surface you know
you don't have to look at any hidden
document you don't even have to bother
reading about the headlines you know so
yeah if you want to know it you know
and but I think that way you put the
question is mistaken at least I think
for the reasons I mentioned they know it
and it doesn't make sense to ask them to
join with other people to try to change
it they're the ones who are implementing
it and benefiting it from it not because
they're bad people because that's the
way the institution's work if they
weren't doing it somebody it's like
suppose you convinced the CEO of General
Electric that he shouldn't be doing that
he should be a voice for the voiceless
he should be organizing in the slums and
suppose he agrees with you said okay I'm
gonna recognize in the slums what
happens to General Electric does it
change no somebody else is appointed CEO
and it continues to increase profit
market share because that's the
institutional role and it's got to do
that so telling trying to convince these
people look to go down to speak to Newt
Gingrich and say hey look here's what
you're doing he knows that I mean Newt
Gingrich knows certainly that he holds
the national championship in bringing
subsets federal subsidies to his rich
constituents
he knows that certainly he knows that
just as the editors in the New York
Times know and they don't report it but
they know it to be precise he's actually
third for suburban counties in the
country the top federal subsidies go to
Arlington Virginia which is part of
Washington so that's where the Pentagon
is and so on so they get it's part of
the federal government the second one is
Brevard County Florida which is the home
of the Kennedy Space Center so that's
part of the federal government but as
soon as you step out of the federal
government Cobb County Georgia is the
chief recipient and he's determined to
make sure that his rich constituents
keep in their cycle of dependency he
understands that there's no point
telling you they can therefore talk
about their conservative values and
their entrepreneurial this and that
while they're getting more federal
subsidies than anyone else in the
country okay he knows that no point
going down and telling him there's no
point going to the newsroom of
the editor of The New York Times or for
that matter the Star Tribune and telling
them because they know what to if they
decide not to report it that's their
business but they certainly know it okay
that's what's point telling him it's for
precisely this reason that I think that
the slogan of speak truth to power
though I admire the people is the wrong
idea they're not the people to whom you
want to speak truth and in fact you want
to speak to anyone but that's not the
way to direct one's actions it's exactly
the way that us that routine yoga Rhonda
Eugene debb's and Archbishop Romero and
others were saying that's the way to do
it it's the only way that's ever worked
in history by working with the powerless
