what can individuals do to help promote
change here in the United States and
abroad well alone they really can't do
anything very much which is exactly why
every social change in history and every
advance in history and there plenty of
them has come from concerted to organize
public action that's why we don't live
under feudalism that's why we have
slavery that's why there's we've
achieved the level certain level of
civil rights that's why women's issues
got onto the agenda in the last year's
that's why you know questions about the
environment meaning the possibility that
our children or their children may have
a world to live in became issues it was
never given by a gift from above it was
always given by struggle sometimes the
struggle was achieved sometimes they're
beaten back and it takes a labor
struggles in the United States the
United unions have typically been in
many countries in one of the dominant if
not d dominate agency of progressive
social change of improving the welfare
of the general population the United
States is a business run society to an
unusual extent that's why we are off the
spectrum on things like health care and
so on it also happens to have an
unusually violent labor history US
workers didn't get the rights that were
pretty standard in Europe until the
nineteen thirty is about fifty years
afterwards after a very violent and
brutal struggle i should say with
hundreds of workers killed by security
forces and so on so then they finally
got say the right to organize and the
40-hour week those rights were quickly
lost the there was a tremendous business
offensive to try to beat back those
games business was terrified by them you
read the business press in the 30s after
the right to organize was finally one
and there's talk about
how the rising political power of the
masses is the greatest hazard facing
industrialists and unless they're
thinking is redirected we're going to
face disaster the kind of vulgar marxist
rhetoric is normal for business
publications i should say the values are
opposite could be beliefs is the same
about how the world were the immediately
after the Second World War those
victories were beaten back the 40-hour
week is a thing of the pet the right to
organize is a thing of the past okay
thanks and unions are declining and with
them the woman one of the means by which
people can participate in a meaningful
way and changing their lives the history
about the effort of working people
through their organizations to enter the
political arena shows you just how much
is at stake but it also answers your
question what you should do is exactly
the kinds of things that are going to
lead to hysteria among the privileged
and power
and they indicate very clearly what
those things are and just follow the
lead
