was the US are strongly opposing this
massive losses for exciting rainy of
course all the oil is it was concerned
that's right secular nationalism might
try to in control of the oil resources
music for regional development not for
enriching dictators and the west and
rolling companies and Israel destroyed
it it destroyed secular Arab nationalism
and that was a tremendous gift xmen
us-israeli relations really took off in
their current form increased later in 71
during black September's when the
Jordanian army was slaughtering
Palestinians looked for a while as a
Syrian like a dream to protect the
Palestinians us in want egg got it as a
threat to the ground monarchies the US
was all tied up and loading it that good
listening Israel mobilized envelops your
rid withdraw and the massacre continued
us-israel Evan gonna score Drupal go
through them one so it continues your
point was driven home to me when I was
over there before the First Intifada on
a National Lawyers Guild delegation with
abdin Jabara we were investigating the
Israelis snatching secular Arab leaders
these were not particularly political
people in artists and writers doctors
snatching them in the middle of night
from their homes and setting them out
into the desert because these were like
secular figures in the community and
they didn't want any kind of leadership
cut yelling it was way back in France
reported become also the early days
Israeli used to bus students from the
Islamic universities to pierce a
secretary University breakup student
strike symptoms okay exactly noam you
mentioned that when we asked about
possibilities for change that the United
States really had to join the rest of
the world with regard to Israel and
Palestine and come down directly for a
solution and when you read now every day
it seems to me that more and more
Palestinian land is just being gobbled
up both in the East Jerusalem as well as
in the West Bank and of course we have
the prison of Gaza it seems to me
getting less likely that the United
States is going to do that although
world opinion is shifted even more in
favor of the United States doing
something so what do you make the
current attempt to do negotiations today
of all the stuff about stopping
settlements and well everything you read
in the normal paper every day waitresses
I just say it but it it's just farcical
I mean if there were serious
negotiations going on they would be run
by some neutral party and one side would
be the world and the other side would be
the US and Israel and then that's what
the conflict is as far as the you know
what's supposed to be a conflict between
the US and Israel is a joke it's about
expansion of settlements the first of
all Obama's position is just repeating
the wording that we famous roadmap which
is supposed to be the grid position on
steps to be taken in the first stage of
the road map says no expansion of
settlements even natural growth Bush
needed that that's in fact more or less
his administration's plan and of Oz
repeating it but is he going to do
anything about it well we mental which
number one he at least composed some
very mild sanctions when Israel was
expanding settlements in ways that he
and Baker didn't like cut back on Long
general please Obama was asked about
that so he going to do anything about it
if he and his spokesperson the rest jump
from said notices we're not going to
impose any penalties like Pusha number
one did our position is completely
symbolic well that's telling Benjamin
the tiny little area like we will
continue funding moving under the
diplomatic support and the military
sport and so on so do you like in other
words we're saying stop but with a wink
week says go ahead that's traditional
and the mouths more extreme furthermore
the whole issue of settlement expansion
is a minor footnote I mean Israel
already controls about forty-two percent
of the West Bank and in fact in the area
that Israel totally controls area see
living conditions are alleged to be
worse than jazz all the international
agencies that you been looking so yeah
maybe it'll expand it a little more but
they've already got everything they want
they can take more Obama's that just
offering them more in the Jordan Valley
which still of course gladly pick up ray
keeping Palestinians Abaddon the issue
is the settlements not expansion there
are legal that's understood Israel
recognized back in late nineteen sixty
seven they're leaving legal authority
theater in their own very respected
international buist advised them that
any settlement and occupied territories
in violation and kinetic inventions core
of international humanitarian law
institute incidentally to criminalize
Nazi actions be very general in Israel
engines appear I he agreed yes legal
Moshe Dayan who was in charge of the
occupied territories fence minister he
agreed to insurance and violation of law
but countries violate laws so we'll go
ahead which means as long as the master
in Washington condemns it with a wink
who cares that's been underscored by
security council resolutions by the
International Court of Justice and by
the US Justice on the court filed a
separate declaration that he basically
agreed the Geneva Conventions applied to
the occupied territories meaning all
settlements illegal in fact not I is it
illegal but it relates any chicken it's
designed carefully they think it's
designed carefully to ensure that there
cannot be any viable Palestinian self
our nation and that's the Shan plan
charm called it it will leave from bad
to stands in fact that's an exaggeration
because South African needed the black
population and so they they kind of and
furthermore the US and Israel and this
is crucial I've heard about 15 years now
have been working hard to separate Gaza
from the West Bank that is in direct
violation of the wording of the Oslo
agreements and that's quite different
and die now that's virtually achieved
well all of this makes Constantine
self-determination almost meaningless as
long as the u.s. persists and mrs.
policy in your book you refer to the
Palestinian Authority or maybe a boss
but the use of the word Quisling you
just explain to our listeners what that
is and why you think that of the PA it
might have been pop aid is a gear right
I apologize good there's something to
you know in fact just take the way
they're viewed by the United States
which is what's important Obama's a
point man on the Middle East is John
Kerry Italy percent Foreign Relations
page you get an important speech on this
for maintenance teacher from the
administration on Israel Palestine mr.
Brookings Institute he about a year he
said Israel of course it described the
United States as an honest broker
trihard so on and so forth but putting
side the use of patriotic imagery he
said something important he said for the
first time Israel has a legitimate
negotiating partner Palestinian
Authority and they gave the reason the
reason is that there's an army in the
west bank run by a US general keep
statements replace the baton armies it's
supported by the Jordanian dictatorship
and by Israel will take garden training
it and so on and the army he said was
proven itself very effective and it
gives one example during the Israeli
invasion of Gaza the army was so
effective that it put down
demonstrations in the West Bank insert
any sign of opposition to the attack and
general Payton himself later said we
were so effectively Israel was able to
take forces out of the West Bank can
send them to send them to attack gasm
well what's the right word for that
Quisling Noam Chomsky thank you very
much for being on law and disorder we
urge our listeners to go out and get the
new Haymarket book Gaza in crisis that
gnome wrote along with the great Israeli
historian Ilan Pappe it's a very fine
book and people should have this on

it and study it so thanks gnome we

show thank you if you want to hear low
