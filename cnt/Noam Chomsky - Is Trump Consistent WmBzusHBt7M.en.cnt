Donald Trump's statements are all over
the map
he said about everything you can imagine
but there's some things on which he's
very consistent very consistent one of
them is that he wants to drive the world
to disaster as quickly as possible and
literally that is that is not an
exaggeration and it's a remarkable
comment on the media in the United
States and internationally that they do
not comment on this
it's an astonishing fact his positions
there one of the major crises that we
face
everyone should be completely aware of
this is the threat of environmental
catastrophe I barely mentioned it and
that's just the beginning his position
is very clear climate change is not
happening
we should increase the use of fossil
fuels including coal the most
destructive we should eliminate
environmental regulations and eliminate
the agencies that's responsible for them
we should abandon the Paris negotiations
cop21 which are just coming into effect
which are insufficient but at least
provide some kind of a basis for hope we
should that we should withdraw from that
we should refuse to give any aid to poor
countries say like Bangladesh that are
trying somehow to move to sustainable
energy and in general we should race to
the precipice as quickly as possible
that's his core program and it's not
just Donald Trump it's the entire
Republican Party if you follow the
primaries you would have noticed that
every single candidate either denies
that climate change is happening or says
maybe it is but we shouldn't do anything
about it
in other words major political party in
the world's richest and most powerful
country the most powerful in history
which is sure to set its stamp on future
history immediate history
that party is calling explicitly for
destruction of the species virtual
destruction of the species more
astonishing than that is the fact that
there's no comment on it try to find
comment on this amazing fact virtually
nothing that's one of his policies
the domestic policies on which he's
pretty consistent are radically reducing
taxes on the rich and the powerful on
the corporate sector and the wealthy
increasing the military already way
beyond about as great as the rest of the
world combined much more technologically
advanced and adding no new sources of
revenues you can figure out the domestic
consequences on another issue his
position is more hopeful for human
survival than Clinton's he is calling
for reducing tensions with Russia and
marking Li China which is a very serious
matter of the tensions at the Russian
border notice the Russian border not the
Mexican border the tensions at the
Russian border are severe mounting both
sides are carrying out provocative
actions which could explode by accident
even into a terminal nuclear war both
sides are building up their military
forces NATO forces are carrying out
exercises couple hundred meters from the
Russian border jet claims are buzzing
each other it's an extremely dangerous
situation a lot of it traceable back to
decisions in 1991 when the Soviet Union
collapsed which we should be thinking
about seriously there were two visions
of the world presented at a time one was
Mikhail Gorbachev's what he called a
common European home a integrated
security system throughout all of Europe
and European Asia with no military
bloc's and integration that was
abandoned the West insisted on something
different
collapse of the Soviet Union expansion
of NATO at first to East Germany then
right to the Russian border offers to
Ukraine to join NATO severe threat to
Russia
it's just simple geopolitical terms
Russia's carrying out its own repressive
and violent actions all of this is
building up and Trump to his credit is
saying let's try to say something to do
something to dampen this down instead of
intensifying it so I think those are the
kinds of things we can anticipate
although the idea of somebody like Trump
in control of the option of initiating a
nuclear war which is literally terminal
for everyone that's very frightening to
security analysts across the spectrum
which is why almost all of them are very
frightened of his possible presidency
