so professor Chomsky thank you so kindly
for taking the time today to converse
with me about ecology and anarchism it
is a true honor to have this opportunity
to speak with you before we pass to
these subjects though I would like to
ask you initially about ethics and
solidarity would you say that a manual
Kant's notion of treating humanity as an
end in itself has influenced anarchists
and activate a thought in any way the
concept of natural law arguably has a
natural affinity with anarchism
indirectly but I think it's actually
more general my own view is that
anarchism flows quite naturally out of
major concerns of and commitments of the
Enlightenment which found an expression
in classical liberalism and classical
liberalism essentially was destroyed by
the rise of capitalism inconsistent with
fanatic ISM I think is the inheritor of
the ideals that were developed in one or
another form during the Enlightenment
Kant's expression is one example
exemplified in a particular way in
classical liberal doctrine wrecked on
the shoals of capitalism picked up by
the libertarian Left movements which are
the natural inheritors of them so in
that sense yes but it's broader
