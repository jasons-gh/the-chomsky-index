ok thank you I hope you can give me
welcome to everybody specials or
distinguished yes i would like to start
from going to very general question to
bali more concrete things and my general
question concerns global social
movements now some skeptics argue that
no matter how powerful or how forceful
these administration's and various
actions are there is not really a
coherent central ideology behind these
movements others say that that's in fact
it would think that diversity is
basically the major force that is making
these things work and that's the
advantage behind these movements my
question concerns this that being faced
with extremely centralized very very
well-organized organizations as such is
there a moon for subsidies memorization
within the movements themselves or what
that really need to move with falling
apart as such well the movements that
exist are a reflection of central
reality I mean you can't make a decision
to impose a central authority on white
widely decentralized movements all over
the world but should have their own
interests and concerns and share some
general framework but they're working in
particular problems so landless workers
in Brazil and the peasants in India and
co-workers and the United States and so
on have some over overall general
concerns like they protecting an
environment in which their grandchildren
or preventing nuclear war and so on
those are general concerns that they're
very specific ones is that and it just
would make no sense for someone to come
on and say okay let's have a fixed
central ideology that we all have here
could goes to the extent that such
centralized ideological ideological
positions develop it's a reflection of
the level of consciousness and
commitment and engagement of the people
is it a strength or weakness that I am
feeling the strength the central I that
I mean this is ever since the you live
in history ever since the origins of the
modern left a vague notion of 19th
century basically there have a long-term
goal has always been to develop the some
kind of an international so every labor
union is called an international even if
they don't go beyond their own City and
there were first second third and fourth
internationals they were all highly
centralized and under pretty narrow a
leap control the first international
that you destroyed by Marx personally
when he couldn't control it any longer
the second one collapsed at the times in
World War third was just an instrument
of Russian state policy and the feluccas
Trotskyist tearing and this was
happening now for the first time ever is
the rise of a gin
international if you look at the purpose
to come together say in the world Social
Forum they represent a variety of people
of a kind of fun imagined by the first
floor internationals in fact or the
reason they need in the South first
Brazil and India is because that's what
a rose they arose and sudden what's all
this out the third world and the north
of rich countries became both later on
the and this tremendous diversity of
people walks of life men and women ever
you anything you can imagine is involved
there and they share plenty of concerns
and they work on very specific issues
and it's developing into what could be
the seeds of the first annual
international but it then it is where
such social movements will go if there's
ever date one of the best things about
the world Social Forum more than its
annual meetings is that it has spawned
lots of regional social forms regional
local and common small towns of their
own social forums and they adapt the
narrow concerns so at their own
particular by interest or it can be
rather local and then it sort of feeds
back into the general system in fact the
world social forum itself meets
alongside of other international
meetings so blessed when I went to
happen to be Porto Alegre last year but
I out of the airplane I didn't go to the
world social forum and I'm into the Via
Campesina international meeting that's
the International peasant Association
which was being parallel with the word
but remember the part of it the
International peasant organizations
which peasants are after all a large
majority of the world's population they
have feather unpro and they were working
on them some interaction with the world
Social Forum it's friendly and so on but
separate and I that's a healthy sign
it's a sign that people are dedicated to
working on the real problems for them
not mouthing some ideology they learned
somewhere but also interacting with one
another whatever level is productive so
so so I personalities produce a healthy
son but whether you think it's healthy
or unhealthy you can't decide to change
from outside I mean does reflect the
social reality of popular activism
purpose which is very very widespread
probably more than ever in history but
extremely disorganized I mean it takes a
the United States the level of activism
in the United States is beyond anything
in my lifetime at least on the other
hand if you take city the city where I
live Boston people in one part of the
town don't know that somebody the other
part of the town's working on the same
issues in fact one of the reasons for my
cell phone I'm just going around giving
talks and one main reasons for the talks
it's just bring people together who
even if their new body similar interest
so very atomized to society much any
world is like that that's in fact part
of the kind of class words going on keep
people separated from one another but
it's real and it has its strengths and
weaknesses but the wish
