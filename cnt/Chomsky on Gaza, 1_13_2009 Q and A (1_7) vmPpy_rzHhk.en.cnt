and my questions about the consensus the
American census about the support or
Israel's role as part of America's
geopolitical future recently there was a
letter in the Financial Times about how
our support for Israel is such a huge
duty geostrategic gift to China and
other competitors it's a huge one geo
strategic gift to China to try and the
other competitors yeah does are we sing
a crack in the consensus about the role
of Israel it's a serious question one
can debate whether it's been wise for
the United States to take the position
of extreme support for Israeli violence
and terror expansion criminal acts to
reject political settlement that's a
question that can be asked what we do
know is that American elites think it's
right I mentioned the military which is
very happy with it partly because Israel
is just a major and obedient military
base in fact back in nineteen fifty
eight US intelligence concluded that
support for Israel is a what they said
the cold I think a logical it's a
logical corollary of our opposition to
what they call radical Arab nationalism
radical just means independent not
following orders so yes it's a logical
corollary to support for to opposition
to our independent Arab nationalism and
if you look at in 1967 when the
relations really became firm there was a
reaction immediate reaction to a major
service that the United States that
Israel performed for the United States
and for its major allies Saudi Arabia
namely destroying the basis for secular
Arab nationalism in the region Abdel
Nasser Egypt and so it continues and up
till today the military is quite happy
to have a an obedient powerful military
force according
Israel's air and armored forces small
country but its air and armored forces
are larger and technologically more
advanced than any NATO power outside the
United States of course it's because
it's an offshoot of the United States
Israeli and US military industry are
very highly integrated so much so that
one of israel's major arms producers
actually shifted its executive offices
to the United States American high-tech
industry is very enthusiastic about
Israel you can tell that just by looking
at investment flows they've been
shooting up including the major
corporations hewlett-packard Microsoft
Intel Warren Buffett and so on so they
apparently think it's fine American
educated elites think it's fine ever
since nineteen sixty seven they were
very impressed by Israel's military
capacity and have maintained that you
know that delight and being supportive
of a major powerful military force of
course always with a humanistic cover
but that's normal so the fact of the
matter is that across the spectrum of
major actors well they seem be pretty
happy about it is it wise you can debate
it I mean I don't think it's wise as I
said I think I think it's good for
Israel I think they made a terrible
mistake in 1971 by refusing peace
security and insisting on expansion in
fact they were later compelled by force
to back away from that expansion that's
Camp David and continue with other
expansion but you know that's my
judgment I don't determine policy but
yes it's a fair question could could be
