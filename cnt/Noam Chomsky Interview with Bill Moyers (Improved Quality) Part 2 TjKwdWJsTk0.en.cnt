this program is made possible by a grant
from the John D and Catherine T
MacArthur Foundation a world of ideas
with Bill Moyers he's one of America's
most brilliant men but in some circles
he's treated as if he were a pariah an
intellectual leper whose ideas might
prove dangerously contagious Noam
Chomsky is a scholar of linguistics at
MIT his breakthrough work their revised
how we think about language but it's
been his criticism of power that has
earned Chomsky so much disdain in
establishment circles angry over the
u.s. role in Vietnam he started speaking
out twenty years ago and he's never let
up he's blunt and unyielding and gives
no quarter to comfortable parties take
his newest book manufacturing consent it
suggests that unlike a totalitarian
regime a democracy doesn't stoop to
violence to control its citizens it uses
propaganda instead we talked about this
subject during a recent conversation in
Boston you have said that we live in
tangled in webs of endless deceit that
we live in a highly indoctrinated
society where elementary truths are
easily buried elementary truths such as
such as the fact that we invaded South
Vietnam or the fact that we're standing
in the way of significant and have four
years of significant moves towards arms
negotiation or the fact that the
military system is to a substantial
extent not totally but to a substantial
extent a mechanism by which the general
population is compelled to provide a
subsidy to high technology industry
since they're not going to do it if you
ask them to if you have to deceive them
into doing it I think there are many
truths like that and I we don't we don't
face them we have an interesting
political system in the United States
it's different from those of the other
industrial democracies this is a very
free country I mean the individuals are
by comparative standards the state is
very restricted in its capacity to
coerce and control us was very
they can do police can't come in and
stop us from talking or anything
remotely like that in fact even as
compared with other industrial
democracies we're very free in this
respect on the other hand the practical
limits on those freedoms are unusually
high this is the article limit well
there are sophisticated mechanisms that
have been devised to prevent us from
making use of those freedoms and
furthermore it has been understood for a
long period that in a society that's
free in a society where the state does
not have the right the power to coerce
other mechanisms must be found to ensure
that the pub the population doesn't get
in the way other mechanisms being
indoctrination elimination of secondary
organizations say unions you know other
political clubs ways in which people if
for a single isolated individual to
participate in a meaningful way in the
political system is almost impossible I
mean you have to have you don't have to
have means to inform yourself to have
ideas to interchange those ideas with
others to to turn them into possible
programs to press for those programs now
that takes access to information it
takes independent media it requires what
sociologists call secondary
organizations means by which isolated
people to the real together local it
active political parties political clubs
unions have often played this role in
many countries the United States is
unusual in the in the extent to which
all of these structures are weak so
we're very the level of unionization is
extremely low and under the Reagan
period is declined even further
furthermore the American unions have
always been basically a political or
largely so the political system is also
unusual we're the only major industrial
democracy that doesn't have a political
party which is basically labour based we
only have one political party with two
factions it's the business party we have
two factions of the business party
called the Democrats and the Republicans
and that's unusual
in fact these
these this perception is transmuted in
an odd way into political terminology so
for example in the 1980s each election
in the 1980s the Democrats have been
accused of being the party of the
special-interest and then they hotly
deny it and they say no they're not the
party of the special-interest but who
are the special interests we'll take a
look behind the rhetoric and you find
that the special interests are women
labor youth the elderly ethnic
minorities the poor foreigners in fact
it's the entire population to point-b
the entire population are the special
interests now if you look closely
there's one group that's never
identified as being among the special
interests that's corporations and that's
correct they are the national interest
and both parties are basically beholden
to them just a whereas the special
interests have to be marginalized the
population so everyone denies that they
represent the special interest that is
the people and they don't say who they
do represent but there is somebody that
group notably lacking in this list of
special interests and in fact it's the
group with anyone with his head screwed
on those has inordinate power in
controlling economic decisions and
setting the parameters for political
life and controlling the ideological
system and so on they are not among the
special interest do you think it is
corporations or it is it is it the
capitalist business system whose first
priority is the well-being of
profit-making for the general welfare as
it is so of course everyone asked the
chairman of the board and he'll always
tell you that he spends his every waking
hour laboring so that people will get
the best possible product at the
cheapest possible price and work in the
best possible conditions and so on and
so forth now there's an it's an
institutional fact independently of who
the chairman of the board is that he'd
better be trying to maximize profit and
market share than if he doesn't do that
he's not gonna be chairman of the board
anymore if he were ever to succumb to
the delusions that he expresses he'd be
out now he can hold those delusions as
long as he performs his institutional
role
and the same is true across the board so
for example you can be takes a water
Lippman specialized class the experts
some of them are candid enough to tell
the truth like Henry Kissinger who
defined an expert as a person who is
capable of articulating the consensus of
people with power that's what made him
an expert that's true if you want to be
an expert part of the specialized class
you have to be able to serve the
interests of objective power that's an
institutional role that has to be played
and if you do that you can be in it if
you want to be a journalist let's say
you have to Accord to the needs of the
institutions and the institutions have
very definite needs I mean the major
media are corporations they're major
corporations based like any other
business they have a product and an
audience a product in a market the
market is other businesses they sell
their product to advertisers that's what
keeps them going and the product is
audiences and in fact for the elite
media privileged audiences because that
improves advertising rates so what the
media are fundamentally from as far as
institutions are concerned they're major
corporations selling relatively
privileged audiences to other businesses
but it's not very surprising to discover
that those are the interests they
reflect furthermore if you take a look
at the managing positions the managerial
positions the cultural managers more or
less editors and so on there first of
all very privileged themselves they
share associations and concerns with
other privileged people there's a close
interaction and in fact the flow of
people even between corporate boardrooms
and government decision-making centers
and media and so on and there are many
other factors in fact which yield the
consequence that the independent media
without government coercion there's also
some of that but even without government
coercion tend to accept and adopt as the
framework for discussion the interests
and concerns and the perspective of the
privileged sectors of the society that's
true of the information system through
the political system
the distribution of resources alone
determines it as other modes of
organization and articulate expression
and so on have declined isolated
individuals find themselves marginalized
and they end up by voting for a
ceremonial figure if they bother to vote
at all are you suggesting that there are
that there's a conspiracy that there are
people who gather and decide we're going
to eliminate unions we're going to we're
going to eliminate popular participation
in political parties we're going to do
this we do is there a conspiracy well my
point is in fact exactly the opposite I
mean I think and stress again that these
are institutional facts these are the
ways the institution functions let's go
back to the chairman of the board
there's no conspiracy in the board of
managers to try to raise profits and
market share in fact if the board of
managers didn't pursue that program they
wouldn't be in business any longer it's
it's part of the structure of the social
system and the way in which the
institution's function within it that
they are going to be trying to maximize
profit market share decision-making
capacity and so on doing what comes
naturally it's not that it's yeah it's
part you might say it comes naturally
because they would never have gotten to
that point unless they did internalize
those values but it's also constrained
if they stop doing it their stocks going
to decline and so on and so forth and
somebody else or you know they'll be
bought up and so on now pretty much the
same is true of these other institutions
if the if some segment of the political
system suppose we had an authentic
political party reflecting the needs of
the special interests the population it
would no longer be supported it would be
denounced by the information system they
would be condemned for being
anti-american or subversive and so on it
would not even have the minimal
resources to keep functioning and since
we don't have a network of popular
structures to sustain it it would
disappear you've said that the primary
function of mass media is to mobilize
public support for the special interests
that dominate the government in the
private sector but that's not how the
media see it they claim we claim that
our news judgments rest on unbiased
objective criteria
that's how we see it but in fact the
chairman of the board also sees what he
is doing as service to humanity you know
we like our lobster in the trap we can't
see it close behind us well the point is
that no one would even make it to a high
decision-making position in the media
whether as columnist or managing editor
or whatever unless they had already
internalized the required value
internalized they believed them the
number of things you have to believe to
make it to top managerial positions you
have to believe that the United States
is unique in history in that it acts
from benevolent motives not benevolent
motives are not properties of States
whether it's the United States or any
other one they don't have this is a
meaningless to talk about AMF you ask
anime for I mean it acts because of the
interests of groups that have power
within it like any other society but
anyone who believes this truism is
already excluded you have to believe
that whatever the United States does is
defensive if we bomb South Vietnam we're
defending South Vietnam
if the Russians invade Afghanistan
that's not defense now of course if you
if you go to the pelipper they'll tell
you the defending Afghanistan they're
defending it against terrorists
supported from the outside and of course
there's a you know we know that there's
a bill in fact II can tell you they were
invited in and there's a kind of an
element of truth to all of that but if
we naturally dismiss it as nonsense on
the other hand when we create a
government in South Vietnam to invite us
in and we attack the population of South
Vietnam and we bomb people to drive them
into concentration camps to separate
them from the guerrillas who we concede
they're supporting and so on we're
defending South Vietnam and anyone who
doesn't agree with this is not part of
the system you're equating the Soviet
Union in the United States and and the
Jean Kirkpatrick's and others would say
of course that's the fundamental fallacy
of dr. Chomsky's approach is that he is
saying there is a moral equivalency
kind that's a that's that's in the these
notions are in fact inventions of the
Jean Kirkpatrick's and other reactionary
jingoist the Soviet Union in the United
States are at opposite poles among
contemporary political systems what I'm
saying is that even though they are at
opposite poles in some respects they
behave alike and that's that's for
deep-seated reasons that have to do with
the exercise of power and institutions
and so on and you do it as 92 amoral
equivalent to admit that we that we are
our free society then we're admitted I
insist upon it I insist that we are a
free society and that Soviet Union is a
dungeon and therefore we have completely
different methods of population control
completely different methods in fact
I've written a lot about this it's no
moral equivalence here the totalitarian
I mean there's no you know nothing no
state is truly totalitarian but as we
move toward the totalitarian end of the
spectrum the technique of control is
roughly that satirized by or will you
have a center of truth you have a
Ministry of truth it announces official
truths people can believe it or not
nobody cares very much it's sufficient
that they obey totalitarian states can
be more or less behaviorist ik they
don't really care what people think
because they always have a club at hand
to beat them over the head if they do
the wrong people to do what they want as
long as they can think what they like in
private but they better do what we tell
them at public that's that's the model
towards which the pellet Aryan states
tend as a result the propaganda may very
well be not too effective on the other
hand democratic state can't use this
mechanism you can't force anybody you
can't force people therefore you have to
control what they think since since
power is still concentrated but in
different hands in our society largely
in private ownership and you can't
control people by force you'd better
care what they think
so that's why you have to have other
forms and in fact more sophisticated
forms of indoctrination
I didn't interview once with Edward
Bernays who was considered the
pioneering figure in American business
public relations and he talked through
there about the engineering of consent
that's his phrase he thought it's
wonderful thing in fact he described it
as the essence of democracy he said if
we consider the government but
presupposes that efforts at persuasion
at trying to persuade people to see
things your way
picture the picture is certain people
are in a position to persuade and the
essence of democracy is that they have
the freedom to persuade now who has the
freedom to persuade well who runs the
public relations industry it's not the
special interests they're the targets of
the public relations industry public
relations industry is a major industry
closely linked to other corporations and
those are the people who have the power
to persuade that's the essence of
democracy and they must engineer the
consent of others there was a vice
president of AT&T in 1909 he said he
thought the public mind was the chief
danger to the corporation exactly the
general public might have funny ideas
about corporate control for example you
know people who really believe in
democracy people who take 18th century
value seriously people who really might
merit the term conservatives that much
of use term are against concentration of
power they remember that the effort all
the the doctrines of the Enlightenment
held that individuals should be free
from the coercion of concentrated power
the kind of concentrated power that they
were thinking about was the church and
the state and the feudal system and so
on and that you could sort of imagine a
collect a population of relatively equal
people at least equal white male
property owners who would be not
controlled by those private powers but
in the subsequent period a new form of
power developed namely corporations with
highly concentrated power over decision
making in the in economic life that is
the control over what's produced what's
distributed what's invested and so on
and so forth it's very narrowly
concentrated is this why the
vice-president or is corporate he
doesn't say the public mind is public
mind might have funny ideas about
democracy which say that we should not
be forced simply to rent ourselves to
the people who own the country rather
and own its institutions rather we
should play a role in determining what
those institutions do that's democracy
if we were to move towards democracy and
I think democracy even in the 18th
century sense we would say that there
should be no Mel
distribution of power in determining
what's produced what's distributed
what's invested and so on rather that
should be that's a that's a problem for
the entire community in fact there are
in my own personal view unless we move
in that direction the human society
probably isn't going to survive why well
we now face the most awesome problems of
human history problems such as the
likelihood of nuclear conflict either
among the super powers or through
proliferation the destruction of a
fragile environment which finally were
beginning to recognize those obvious
decades ago that we're hitting for
disaster other problems of this nature
they're they're of a level of
seriousness that they never were in the
past why do you think more participation
by a public by the public more democracy
is the answer because well more
democracy is a value in itself
so quite a part because democracy is a
value doesn't have to be defended
anymore in freedom has to be defended
that's just it's a part of it's an
essential feature of human nature that
is people should be free that should be
able to participate they should be
uncoerced and so on I told edges in
themselves but why do you think if we go
that route us I think that that's the
only hope that I can see that other
values will come to the floor I mean if
the society is based on controlled by
private wealth it will reflect the
values that in fact does reflect the
value that the highest the only real
human property is the desire is green
and the desire to maximize personal gain
at the expense of others now any society
made that small society based on that
principle is ugly but it can survive a
global society based on that principle
is headed for massive destruction and
that's what we are we have to have a
mode of social organization that
reflects other values that I think are
inherent in human nature that people
recognize and that would be able to see
exactly I mean what are human beings I
mean in your family for example it's not
the case that in the family every person
tries to maximize personal gain at the
expense of others or if they do it's
kind of pathological it's not the case
that if if you and I are say walking
down the street and we see a child
eating a piece of candy and we see the
nobody's around we don't spend we're
having to be hungry we don't steal it if
we did that would be would be
pathological I mean the idea of care for
others and concern for other people's
needs and concern for a fragile
environment that must sustain future
generations all of these things are part
of human nature these are elements of
human nature that are suppressed in a
social and cultural system which is
designed to maximize personal gain or I
think we must try to overcome that
suppression and that's in fact what
democracy could bring about it could
lead to the expression of other human
needs and values which tend to be
suppressed under the institutional
structure of a system of private power
and private profit but do you believe
that by nature human beings yearn for
freedom or have do we settle in the
interest of safety and security and
conformity do we settle for order these
are really matters of faith rather than
knowledge on the one hand you have the
Grand Inquisitor who tells you that what
people what humans crave is submission
and therefore Christ is a criminal we
have to vanquish freedom that's one view
you have the other view of se Rousseau
and some of his moments that people are
going to be free and that their basic
instinct is the desire to free
themselves from coercion Authority and
oppression it's the answer to which you
believe is more or less where you stake
your hopes I'd like to believe that
people are going to be free but if you
ask for proof I couldn't give it to you
you've dealt in such unpopular truths
and have been such a lonely figure as a
consequence of that do you ever regret
either that you took the stand you took
it I have written the things you have
written or that they listened to you
earlier I don't I mean there are
particular things which I would do
differently because do you think
things come differently but in general I
would say I do not regret it and I think
law traversal no no it's a nuisance
because this mass medium pays little
attention to the views of dissenters not
just Noam Chomsky but but but most
dissenters do not get much of a hearing
in this meeting Oh in fact that's again
completely understandable they wouldn't
be performing their societal function if
they allowed favored truths to be
challenged because after all their role
their very institutional role is to
establish certain truths and beliefs not
to allow them to be challenged society
does in order to cohere does need a
consensus does it not I think it needs
tentative assumptions but we should
remember what Justice Holmes said in one
of his famous dissents that fighting
faiths have repeatedly been seen to be
false we should recognize that yes we
need tentative assumptions in order to
continue with their lives but we also
ought to be open to a healthy society
would not only tolerate but encourage
challenge that's what happens in the
sciences and the sciences where the
world is keeping you honest and you
can't be dishonest fundamentally not
only is challenge tolerated but it's
stimulated the student comes along with
a new idea that threatens established
beliefs you don't kick them out of your
office
you pay attention you're struck but in
politics
well political life is preserving
privilege and power but that's not a
value that should be protected that's a
property that should be overcome I'm not
suggesting I'm not saying question
everything always that's hopeless like I
walk out the door I don't think the
floor is going to collapse of course you
accept things you have faith beliefs and
so on and you operate on the basis of
them but you should if honest recognize
that they're subject to challenge and
that if the past is any guide they're
probably wrong because beliefs have
generally been wrong in the past
also we unjust understand more we
understand more about ourselves as
history continues it's hard to look at
the 20th century and be an optimist but
still there's some moral progress in
history now takes a slavery it wasn't
very long ago that slavery was
considered moral not just
do it slave owners didn't normally say
look at nice for me so I'll do it they
offered a moral basis for slavery nobody
does that anymore that's an improvement
just in our own lifetimes this has
happened I'm take the issues raised by
the by the feminist movement that women
do have equal wise where things that
many people simply did not see 30 years
ago now the problems are still there at
least we see them that's that's greater
insight into our own nature its insight
its discovery of forms of repression and
authority that we know we do not accept
as moral human beings and we have to try
to overcome and I think you can sense
such progress at the same time you also
have decline I mean Nazi Germany and
Stalinist Russia or genocide of this
century the Holocaust all describable so
there's that's why I say it's hard to
look at the 20th century and say that
you're an optimist about a 21st century
well I don't think we're going to get
far into the 21st century unless these
problems are overcome because the
problems are no longer localized I mean
Hitler's genocide was probably the worst
moment in human history but it was still
in a sense localized it was a huge
massacre but it was bound the problems
we're now facing are not going to be
bounded a nuclear war for example if
there's superpower confrontation or even
a confrontation among lesser nuclear
powers that's not going to be bounded in
any sense that wars were in the past or
if we all unplug the environment or if
we do not if we if we continue to act on
the assumption that the only thing that
basically matters is personal greed and
personal gain the Commons will be
destroyed we didn't have to worry about
that too much in the past it was
happening but now it is clear that
they're going to be destroyed other
human values have to be expressed
if we hope even to if future generations
are going to even be able to survive
from Boston this has been a conversation
with Noam Chomsky I'm Bill Moyers
