I'm going to start with a bit of humor
not to trivialize matters but to try to
make a point there's an old military
joke about soldiers being out in the
field for six weeks living in the grime
living in the ditches unable to shower
unable to change clothes and they come
back to the barracks they're ordered
into the main barracks and the general
comes to the front of the room and says
to the soldiers I have some good news
and some bad news what do you want to
hear everyone says for good news we want
the good news says okay the good news is
today we change underwear everybody
celebrates yes today we change underwear
the bad news is you change with you you
change with you you change with you so
we we thought that a piece of humor is
quite revealing about how the whole
system of indoctrination works
we're often given surface-level good
news good news in quotes and there's a
hidden bad news that always accompanies
it and to start we would like to talk
about the war against the poor in the
United States in relation to so-called
good news and bad news now there's a
quote in The New York Times says that
the Republican plan to abolish AFDC
rests on a huge and risky leap of faith
the plan heading for President Clinton's
desk would turn over welfare to the
states with less money and strict time
limits on benefits most people could
receive no more than five years of aid
throughout their lives and most states
would probably set limits much lower
those changes would be accompanied by
significant reductions in food stamps
Medicaid housing and disability programs
no my just wanted to ask why it's so
easy for middle-class Americans to allow
this to continue why it's so easy to
beat up on the poor so to speak well
first of all on the quote this statement
that it's a leap of faith is pure
propaganda nobody has any doubt how it's
going to turn out including the people
who are I mean it's as if somebody were
to say when the Nazis put Jews in
concentration camps it was with a huge
leap of faith that they would be happier
in their yeah maybe somebody talked
themselves into that but it's not a leap
of faith they know exactly what's going
to happen the purpose of moving things
down to the state level and cutting
funds is to ensure that as little as
possible gets to poor people
well now what is it that allows the
wealthier sectors to agree to this here
you have to be a little cautious for one
thing for these people it's obvious what
does if they get more money in their
pocket if you're trying to enrich
yourself and you want the state to be a
powerful welfare state for the rich and
nothing else the Gingrich Heritage
Foundation army system including our
governor if that's what you want well
this is fine I mean you just crushed
poor people because they don't do any
good for you it's like social cleansing
in Colombia on the other hand if you
look at the general population attitudes
are somewhat more complicated for
example a large majority of the
population thinks that it's the
responsibility of the government to
assist we're people who need help
in fact the substantial proportion last
time I looked at a polo the majority are
willing to raise taxes to help poor
people overseas so the idea that you
should you have a responsibility to help
queer people that's very widespread on
the other hand the polls also shows
strong opposition to welfare so the same
people who say it's the responsibility
of the government to help the poor are
opposed to welfare
and the reason is because there it
sounds contradictory but it isn't I
don't think if you look at the
propaganda that people are being fed the
propaganda is that welfare does not go
to help queer people welfare welfare
goes to keep the you know rich black
women breeding like rabbits and driving
Cadillacs well I don't want my money to
go for that you know so yes I'd like to
have money go to help the poor but not
welfare and similarly with foreign aid I
don't want to give those people money
for you know rich people are going to
just hate America if it could go to poor
people in Africa fine no now here's what
the propaganda has been successful in
dissociating the actual facts about
welfare an aid from the idea that you
have a responsibility to help people now
like as in any propaganda it's not
totally falsified so an awful lot of
foreign aid is putting money in the
pockets of rich people and a lot of
what's coming even what they call
welfare which is a very narrow part of
welfare you can find welfare fraud and
so on and so forth but I mean even the
most crazy propaganda is a Hitler's
propaganda about the Jews had some
fringe of plausibility or else you
couldn't get anybody to accept it the
propaganda is more elaborated in the
rest of that story if I remember it it
starts by saying that everyone agrees
even liberals that AFDC has been a total
failure and that it has not gotten rid
of poverty and so on and so forth well
that may be what the author of the
article of whoever is giving him his
lines believes but it's certainly not a
fact that people who know anything
should believe because it's just not
true the fact is that if the what failed
about AFDC is that it was eliminated
AFDC which was never very high has been
cut back by close to 50 percent since
around 9:00
in 70 you take a look at AFDC in real
terms from 1970 to say 1990 through the
Reagan years it's not a close to half in
fact it got to the point where it was
lower all such payments AFDC food stamps
and I forget the third third one we're
lower than just food stamps alone before
this period so sure if you cut down
support systems for poor people you're
going to have a lot of poor people
that's for sure so one factor in the
fact that we haven't gotten rid of
poverty is that the so-called war on
poverty was called off right away it in
fact didn't go into effect until the
late 60 and it was and by the end of
Nixon's term that was over and Nixon was
over the last liberal president you know
even toward the end of his term was
being attenuated but when you get into
Carter Reagan and so on that's the end
it just goes down down down so yes these
programs didn't have much effect because
they were never applied now they had
some effect you know like some poor
children did get enough food to eat but
and in fact they were out the effect of
cutting them down is quite marked or at
least you know cause effect relations
are hard to determine but at least this
much is correct several years after the
decline in welfare as welfare declines
you know regularly steadily as it has
been doing since around 1970 a couple
years later you get an increase in
broken families child abuse illegitimate
births and so on and so forth now
whether that's a cause effect relation
or before/after relation you can argue
but there is a temporal relation at
least between cutting back of support
systems and disruption of families and
that's not I think you can imagine why
that should be and it gets worse
instantly there's another factor
intervening which overwhelms all of them
and that is that starting around that
same time real wages began to stagnate
and from 1980 they've been going down
and for poor people much further down
and for younger people even worse
so say entry-level wages you know your
first job remember the numbers but for
males it's dropped about 30% I think
since 1980 and for females I think it's
dropped about 18% well that's you know
that's a steady effect on your long term
future
meanwhile real wages have been going
down steadily high school graduates
which is probably 70% of the workforce
or so what they call non skilled workers
funny term for it but considerable
majority the work for something like 70
or 75 percent of lost males have lost
about I think over 20 percent of their
purchase of their income since about
1980 now furthermore this has had an
effect this has had the effect of
driving a second parent into the
workforce you know if women want to work
that's fine but this is forcing them
into the workforce when they don't want
to do it because you have to have food
to put on the table so you have two
parents in the workforce to try to keep
at least family income steady support
systems are collapsing hours of work are
increasing so by the early 90s it took 2
hours more 2 weeks more of work a year
to make a 1980 salary so you have two
people working very heavily that just
try to keep things going no support
systems if they get in trouble like say
it's an abused teenager and she can't
live with their parents and she goes off
somewhere to try to get some help
that kind of payment is going way down
well what's the effect of all of that
stuff got to be you know have to be a
genius to predict I mean what it's going
to mean is child abuse neglect of
children malnutrition violence against
children by children and drug
use unwanted pregnancy is all sorts of
things in fact all of these consequences
are exactly what has been the clear
determinable result of social policy by
the people who call themselves
conservatives they have been fighting a
war against families and children and it
goes back to the early 70s the
propaganda there people are being fed is
what you read in that article that it
was a failure of the attempt to deal
with these problems on the contrary it
was a conscious attempt to create those
problems and I say conscious in the
sense in which you use the term you know
in law I mean if a consequence is
completely predictable to a sane person
that's evidence for intent and this was
all completely predictable to a sane
person
justice is completely predictable to a
sane person that this that these changes
that you quoted in your first statement
are going to have very severe effects
which means it's equally clear that when
he said it's a gamble that's just not
true there's no gamble you know exactly
what's going to happen it is a cover for
something else well when you have that
kind of propaganda and that's what's
being done this is what's being given to
the you know the educated folk so it's
in big words on the New York time we can
review but you're getting it at some
level over and over again everywhere
from television sitcoms to you know
radio soundbite advertising to the
schools to everything people are being
dead huge with this propaganda as a
result they probably believe that the
war on poverty was a failure and that it
didn't get rid of welfare and all these
things that the author there says
everyone believes yeah sure that's what
you would believe if you were totally
subordinated to the propaganda system
and you didn't have a way to think
yourself out of it now most people don't
but the author of that article does he
knows enough or at least could know
enough easily to find out just what
happened to the war on poverty so what
happened to AFDC you can find out the
answer to that
question that's his field he covers
those things so he can find it out as
soon as he finds it out he knows what he
wrote is put it charitably nonsense to
put it probably accurately is nothing
much worse well the end result of this
is you get the kind of confusion for you
talking about that we were talking about
yes we should help the poor and it's the
government's responsibility to do it but
welfare is the catastrophe it's created
poverty another part of the war against
the poor is the increase in prisons on
the surface they tell you that the good
news is that's going to end crime
putting more police in the streets and
building more prisons one of the
pitfalls quoted in The New York Times
last Friday was that there will be
overly generous contracts to private
prisons that are now being built and the
hiring of companies that are difficult
for the government to supervise I was
wondering what the effects of the
privatization of Prisons might be could
that lead to the privatization of
punishment well first of all I don't
know what article you're quoting but who
was Friday was probably reported on the
latest figures on number of prisoners
which last year increased there was a
record increase last year for the
federal and state prisons been going up
quite steadily since 1980 but last year
was the record increase I think it's now
something like five hundred fifty four
hundred thousand something like that
it was around 100 per hundred thousand
very some such number back then I may
have the numbers a little off but that
scale the United States has been
oscillating for a first or second place
in proportion of the prison population
of the population in prison by the late
80s the United States was in first place
it had passed South Africa quite a few
years before and it had passed Russia
after the so-called capitalist reforms
took over in Russia the prison
population there shot up and for the
early 90s the US was in second place
Russia was ahead of us this year because
of this increase the United States is
back in first place so now the united
states locks up more of its population
than any country in the world and that's
rising fast in fact if you project
people talk about projecting medicare
and what a catastrophe will be well try
projecting prisons that's going up much
faster and if you continue to project
that every you can show every sense and
you know in the in the budgets are gonna
be spent for prison in fact RAND
Corporation actually did it for
California a couple years ago and
predicted that at the current rate of
increase of prisons there the state
budget would be entirely used for
prisons meaning they have to cut back
education which is the thing you cut
first to either to the bone or maybe
this euro after or not very many years
part of this increase the increase in
prisons has nothing to do with crime as
far as anybody knows the level of crime
has been fairly constant a violent crime
other crimes I mean you know this shifts
around and so on but there's certainly
been no big change according to FBI
statistics at least it's been quite
constant for a long time a threat this
whole period of increase in prisons it's
been constant furthermore if you look at
the constitution of the prison
population you see it as almost nothing
to do with crime I don't want to guess
the numbers because then they get him
along but a large portion I think the
majority in the state prisons and maybe
a third in the federal prisons are there
for what they call drug crimes
well drug runs are often victimless
crimes it means you catch a kid with a
jointness pocket so so there are plenty
of victimless crimes which are filling
up the prison and I think fit again you
have to assume that the predictable
results of the policy are the intended
result this looks like a form of social
cleansing now these aren't random people
who are being picked up these are blacks
and Hispanics the kind of people you
don't I mean that
the exact same people you're going after
with the cuts in a social service system
so it all seems to me a natural form of
social cleansing now like we're a
civilized country so we don't send out
death squads to murder them in the
streets the way we armed the Colombian
police and military to do we do a
different way we kick them out of a city
like they can't live in New York because
there's no room for them or no support
for them or we throw them in jail and
the drug wars a terrific way to do that
the drug war has no effect on drug use
except to send drug prices up but it it
does give you a very good way of
criminalizing a large part of the
population and getting rid of them all
right now coming to privatization the
prison system is by now a substantial
part of the state system it's not at the
scale of the Pentagon you know but it's
substantial and growing and the way our
society works is the state is a welfare
state for the rich that's its
fundamental purpose it's always been
that way but it's been extreme since the
1940s it's a welfare state for the rich
and there are big components typically
the security systems which are ways of
funneling public resources to the
wealthy the building we're sitting in is
a small part of that system mit is part
of the funnel by which public funds get
transferred to owners and managers and
investors in high-tech industry that's
what it's there for so I get a salary
ultimately the well okay here's another
big that's exactly why Newt Gingrich and
the Heritage Foundation and the people
who call themselves conservatives one
are increasing the Pentagon budget
because they're increasing the system of
state support for the rich public
welfare for the rich they want that they
plainly want it to be not a big but huge
as it's been in the past well here's
another system coming along not on the
scale of the Pentagon but substantial
growing again it's a security system so
it's just the right kind of thing it
punishes people and it also
Trent and it does involve resource
transfers so building prisons cost money
and there are people who make that money
for example the construction business or
lawyers or law firms or investment firm
so for example now the big investment
houses like Merrill Lynch and so on
are floating bonds for prison
construction and that's a fairly
lucrative business the privatization is
now substantial the since somebody's
going to it's just like privatization of
aircraft I mean in the in the aircraft
and the aircraft industries call the
civilian industry so Boeing is called
the biggest civilian exporter but that's
the approach being a joke I mean these
are publicly subsidized private profit
systems public pays the costs through
the Pentagon system of you know the
avionics and the metallurgy and you know
it's about everything and then it's put
together by Boeing and they make a you
know the thing you fly in when you're
going in to California which is a
modification of some military aircraft
and using all the technology and from
from the military aircraft which the
public paid for then well that's what we
call private private industry and that's
most of industry it's not I'm an
aeronautical industry is a dramatic case
but the same is true of computers and
electronics and pharmaceuticals in fact
and just about everything well okay
here's another one here's a growing
security system which is putting a lot
of public funds in it going up very fast
well okay that has to enrich the same
people so therefore not only that we get
the big investment firms and the
construction industry but let's get set
up private corporations who the public
can pay to run these people that's
private prisons and that's growing very
fast the concern about not supervising
them is about as much like they gamble
about welfare you're not supposed to the
point is they're supposed to these are
private enterprises private enterprise
works just the way Milton freed
says you give the worst possible service
at the highest possible profit that's
what it means to be in the business if
you try to be benevolent you're out of
the business because somebody undercuts
you so the nature of the system is good
insight goes way back to Adam Smith is
to be as mean and rotten as you can to
try to maximize profit and market share
and give the worst possible service same
with HMOs and everything else that's the
nature of a you can't call it a
capitalist system because it's too much
state subsidy to it but insofar as it is
a capitalist institution that's the way
it behaves so of course they'll give the
worst possible care and the worst
possible treatment and so on sure that's
the way you make profit that's the goal
it also incidentally creates a slave
labor force so there's now a growing
labor force which other businesses can
use which they do they've been doing it
for quite a while but it's growing fast
here is a controlled labor force not
going to unionize and I got caused any
trouble you don't pay him much you don't
worry about benefits the public's paying
all that stuff to the extent that anyone
is going you just have this cheap labor
force which is not only good money but
you can use it to undercut your own
labor force because you can transfer you
can transfer jobs over there it's like
it's like what they call work fair you
know taking women who are raising
children and therefore not working
because everybody knows that's not work
just fun so they take women who are
doing nothing you know like just raising
their children and force them to do work
real work you know like cleaning streets
or something like that which hasn't a
good punitive effect but also it alls it
undercuts other workers because you
don't pay any wages like you don't so
that and that same is true of the
private prisons and the growth of
prisons and so on incidentally there's
another angle to this the prison system
has gotten big enough so that the high
tech companies have taken notice and
they are considering ways of ripping off
the public through the prison system the
same way they do through the
that is developed high technology
control and surveillance systems that
can be used to deal with a prison
population and that just is another scam
by which the public will pay for high
technology so if you figure out how to
monitor people with super computers and
you know you stick electrodes into them
so they're walk the wrong direction they
get a shock and the super computer tells
you where they're supposed to be and so
on that's about it I mean that is useful
as an f-22 you know it's a way of
getting more public funds into dual-use
technology technology that can be used
yes for control and surveillance and
smashing people up and so on but it's
really intended to make profit and a
so-called private economy in the market
and what there is of a market economy
after the public's paid for it and
that's going up to about a year and a
half ago the Wall Street Journal already
had a an article and the opportunities
for high tech companies and they went
through I forget which ones but the big
military companies so-called defense
companies turning to prison surveillance
and control as a new way of you know
using their resources meaning getting
money out of the public so all this
stuff goes together and in a way it's a
small-scale Pentagon the Pentagon has
the side use of being people up overseas
and this has the side use of controlling
them internally but that's exactly what
you'd expect to grow you know this is
all part of a bigger pattern social
policy designed to turn the country into
a kind of a third world I mean you take
a look at a standard typical third world
country meaning a country that's been a
Western colony either us or the British
here or somebody like that for you know
for long periods of time they all have
pretty much the same structure they have
a small sector usually quite small
sector of very wealthy people I mean
super rich people you know maybe more
than here they have these with people
who mostly link to foreign
investors use the local big landowners
or they work for some foreign
corporation or the you know they run the
local bank or whatever it is they're
linked to the international system that
controls the thing and they may be
extremely well off the int'l there's a
class of intellectuals who are usually
also pretty well-off some of them were
considered themselves dissident but they
live very and maybe even are but they
tend to live quite well you know
remarkably so in fact and then there's a
periphery around them you know Harrison
and doctors and so on who serve service
groups for those sectors well that's a
small sector of the population then
comes a really big sector of the
population which is suffering or in
misery depending on where you are and
then there's usually just superfluous
people I'm either Street waves
you know kids sniffing glue on street
corners or the ones you send the
paramilitary forces after for social
cleansing or the death squads or kick
them out into the you know into the
desert or something like that so there's
these categories and that's where we're
moving the category of superfluous
people here are the ones are getting
locked up and of course that's growing
because social policy has been designed
to create more and more of a third world
structure so yes you're gonna get this
sector you have to do something with
them and you might as well do something
with them that private in the private
industry can make money out of if you
just if you send death squads out after
them first of all you know we're too
civilized to do that we only do it in
other country but also nobody's going to
make any money out of it stick em in
jail it's actually profit-making
and the jails are there they're other
sort of I don't know sort of cultural
factors I guess I mean if you when
you're turning people a country into a
third world country you know that people
aren't going to like it and you want to
make sure that they don't do anything
about it that's constructive and there's
a technique for that to get them to hate
each other to be afraid of each other
you know
they'd be look terrified and so on and
so forth and building up the perception
of crime is a very good way to do this
people are crime is serious but the
other side hasn't really changed for a
long time and most of the crime is poor
people attacking each other you know the
extent to which rich people are affected
by crime is rather slight but yet the
fear of crime has gone up very fast
and of course fear of crime has good
side effect close crime is a code word
which means black or Hispanic or one of
those bad jean guys so you get people to
feet be authentically frightened you can
understand the fright of the right kind
of people it's like it's like two people
in Germany fearing Jews you know you
want to get it you want to get them to
not pay attention to what you're doing
to them fine let them hate the Jews
blame it on them so here okay well hate
the blacks and the immigrants and
Hispanics and so on and look how
dangerous they are we have to throw them
all in jail and besides they're killing
each other and they're killing us and if
we don't throw em in jail this what
they're going to do all right so it
improves at and then you can feed on
this by being extremely punitive the
United States is one of the very few
countries that a death penalty and it's
gone up
furthermore the new the the US has been
seriously condemned by the International
Human Rights monitors for its inhuman
prison conditions which are
international scandal and they're
getting worse I mean it's now back to
the days of changing literally the state
of Alabama or Mississippi one or the
other I forget is advertising the thing
and proud of it you know that there's
putting people in Chains and taking them
out to break rocks and they're even
shipping in the rocks to be broke they
don't want the rocks broken but it's a
way of punishing people and that appeals
to the that engenders the same fear and
anger in the general population that
you're trying to engender so that people
will hate each other and be afraid and
so on instead of cooperating realizing
we've all got the same problem let's go
after those guys who are causing the
problem that has to be prevented now any
system of control understands whether
it's a totalitarian state or one with a
democratic framework they still
understand that point that's a general
fact about control and this is a
terrific way to do it no could you
briefly talk about the re-emergence of
the conditions that Charles Dickens
wrote about at the in the late 18th
century early 19th century
you mentioned debtors prisons I think
there are other factors involved in
social control occurring around those at
that time maybe you can talk a little
bit about that well there was actually a
study done of that in England just the
right place by a very old and highly
respected charity that goes back to the
mid 19th century queen of sponsor and
that sort of thing they did a study of
the nutritional level of children in
England on benefits welfare I think it's
about a quarter of children and they
found that their nutritional level was
lower than it was in work houses in the
for children orphans and in Dickens
years so that's an exam it's the idea
we're going back to it is not you know
it's not just something that afford
getting back to the surface good news
and what lies beneath it I think no word
has been used more in the last few weeks
than peace headlines all over the place
for peace peacemakers perils the
president promises mission of peace no
troops no peace etc so the good news
seems to be that the United States is
embarking on a mission of peace in
Bosnia what's what's really going on
here well the US has been standing on
the sidelines pretty much well the whole
Balkans affair erupted the reason is
that getting involved would be costly
and difficult and no immediate gain from
it
meanwhile sort of behind the scenes
there have been various conflicts
between Europe and the United States for
one thing on just how to work this thing
out and what the US has apparently been
doing we don't have documents on this so
you kind of have to reconstruct so I'm
speculating it looks to me what's been
going on for the last couple of years as
the US has been standing around waiting
let the Europeans do the dirty work let
them be in the front line will carp and
criticize no proposals except we'll bomb
somebody if you like and from a safe
distance incidentally I and meanwhile
the US has been building up Croatian and
military forces probably building up
other others at least Albanian and
moving towards trying to set up a
situation in which Bosnia can be
effectively partitioned between greater
croatia and greater serbia now in a
certain sense that was also the European
plan but somewhat different anyhow the
u.s. been waiting for that things to get
to that stage it finally sufficient
armed Croatia sufficiently so that it
was able to set that stage up on the
ground the arms are of course illegal
and everything but pay attention to that
there's now they've now forged what they
call a Croatian
in bosnian federation but that means
croatian dominated federation and sooner
or later will be part of croatia
President Tudjman has said as much and
it's in the cards the Serb Republic
that's being set up will sooner or later
become part of Serbia Bosnia may have
some name but it'll be partitioned well
that's sort of in the cards now and the
that meet makes it possible for the for
the u.s. to enter as a pure military
force which will essentially try to
separate two warring armies now that's
about the only job that the US can
undertake the US has a unique military
at least unusual maybe unique military
doctrine for one thing US forces can't
be under any other command this is
called NATO but it means us so they're
under US command but the other and more
important thing is that US forces can't
come under any risk other countries
don't have that so like when Canada or
Ireland or Norway or you know the Fiji
Islands or somebody's and peacekeeping
troops they that they're going to be
facing a certain degree of risk and
since they are in a civilian environment
they can't respond with massive force
the u.s. doesn't accept that if a
teenager looks at you in a funny way you
call out the helicopter gunships
that's why Somalia ended up the way it
did with teenagers with rifles and I
think it ended up with about a couple of
dozen Americans killed and somewhere
between seventy five hundred and ten
thousand Somali civilians killed yeah
that's what happens if you call out the
helicopter gunships there's nobody looks
at you funny way well those are US
ground rules and that was made explicit
in the Bosnia case the president the
national security advisor was secretary
defense when they announced it said that
the US will follow robust rules of
engagement none of this european-style
pussyfooting as anthony lake put it if
anyone fools around with our forces
we're going to hit them and i'm hard and
immediately and use deadly force the
very defense
you know and then some there's Clinton
put it so anybody should understand that
you don't look at us in an odd way or
else you get smashed so there's nothing
about peacekeeping it's just pure
military force with deadly force at its
command the minute it feels anything's
out of sight
what you hope is as they said this all
sufficiently intimidate people so that
they will accept the regime that we've
pretty much worked out which is in fact
the partition of Bosnia between Serbia
and Croatia Croatia is already pretty
much a US client I think they anticipate
that down the road the same will be true
of Serbia so they'll be just as they're
no US military missions in Croatia will
sooner or later be there in Serbia and
so on for other relations Albanians
already happening if it works out there
are two long-term effects for one thing
this region the Balkans region will then
be part of the bigger us greater Middle
East system just pretty much what it's
always been considered so the Middle
East has includes Greece and Turkey and
this area too there's part of the big
system where the u.s. does want
unilateral control and everything else
and also it's a it's a kind of a wedge
towards Eastern Europe
there have been conflict between
European community and the United States
not only about who's gonna run the
Balkans because they'd like to do it but
also about the bigger story of who runs
Eastern Europe here's this third world
opening up it's actually an old third
world but it's reopening up as a new
third world and the question is well
who's going to be who's going to make
the profit from it and the Germans and
the Americans have slightly different
ideas about that and it's been
conflicted and a position of strength
and the Balkans gives the u.s. a kind of
a leg up on that operation so one of all
these are reasons why the Europeans have
been very critical and on half
about the US move so it seems to me
that's essentially the way it's shaping
up you could argue it's better than
having them kill each other
maybe but to call it peace is to degrade
a worthy word it's not the only such
case can you comment on why progressives
around the world and in particular in
this country have failed to mobilize
against the u.s. involvement in Bosnia
is there some principled position that
progressives can take to try to get this
message out to the public well I don't
mobilize against it either or even
agitate against I mean if you look back
a couple of years there were other
options but that's water over the bridge
the options have gradually been narrowed
over the past years no one virtually no
one has suggested anything constructive
a lot of breastfeeding about it and
lamenting and talk about the end of
civilization and so on but you have to
look pretty hard to find a constructive
suggestion there are people who say well
we put a lot of force in there it will
work out but you know not so simple and
the constructive proposal I have yet to
see so we run mean but meanwhile that's
kind of academic because the options
have in fact in there and they've been
narrowed by outside force to the point
where the short the operative choice is
really now now pretty much come down to
let them fight it out or we'll separate
them and partition Bosnia well you know
between those two choices I don't see
anything to agitate for maybe the best
thing is try to separate the forces in a
way it's similar to what the other the
other big piece of process that everyone
is celebrating is a great achievement I
mean if the only options are crush the
Palestinians and give them nothing or
crush the Palestinians and give them to
sins
well maybe the second one is the
that's the one that's called just be
there in that case happen to be plenty
of other options but as long as the us
runs that region and runs the propaganda
system those other options can't be
disguised so if you ask for example
would I support the Middle East the
peace settlement well you know given the
choice of alternatives that the powers
have established yes given a realistic
and reasonable set of alternative it's
horrendous
speaking of narrow choices and also the
good-news bad-news some might argue that
the good news is that they're going to
be national election elections in the
United States coming up soon what's the
bad news bad news that there's only one
candidate with three or four different
names you know and slightly different
programs so I mean if right now if the
election were held personally I would
with enormous discussed and the
reservations vote for Clinton not
because I expect anything but because
the alternatives are worse so there are
slight differences and they don't line
up very easily in fact but they're
probably significant and however they're
all they're all radically opposed to
public will that we know for sure
there's a very well hold public you know
very much what people think what they
think is overwhelmingly opposed by all
the candidates that goes case-by-case
now you know you know if you bother to
copy it but if you take the other
articles the same day and other days
about the but there's an article about
the budget the same day and it starts
off by saying well you know people it
was debate about in the
New York Times Sunday edition it said I
think either there's a week or somewhere
it said there's debate about who's
responsible for the budget budget
deficit and the Republicans are saying
this and the Democrats are saying this
and you know they're all wrong it's in
between and there's responsibility all
around for this terrible problem that we
have to resolve well you know that
formulation
first of all Biggs a lot of questions
and secondly it puts them it puts the
whole spectrum of choices off the
spectrum of public opinion there is
first of all a question whether the
budgets problem well there are people in
the country you think it's a problem in
the latest poll that the New York Times
published where they asked people what's
the biggest problem domestic problem
five percent picked the budget that's
the same percentage who picked
homelessness so for the public as a
primary problem it's at the level of
homelessness when people are asked do
you want the budget do you want the
deficit overcome here there's two
questions one for the headline writers
and another for the people are trying to
figure out how to craft policy for the
headline writers the question is just
what I said
would you like to get rid of the deficit
well that's like asking people would you
be happy if all your debts magically
disappeared and people say sure you know
be great wouldn't have a mortgage you
know it so on and so forth and that's
for the headline writers public wants
you know deficit overcome and you listen
to tune into all things considered on
NPR and they say the public wants the
deficit overcome you know they voted for
a balanced budget yeah that's for them
for the commissar class that's that
question then comes the next question
which is the serious one would you like
to have all your debts eliminated if
that meant your house was taken away and
your car was taken away and your kids
couldn't go to college and so on and so
forth and then the answer is no you know
I think you can take it away by magic
fine but not if I have to give up
everything well when that question is
asked get the same answer if people are
asked would you like to have the budget
balanced at the cost of and
any reasonable answer like cutting back
education or medical aid or whatever
then you get overwhelming objection so
the idea that we must balance the budget
and that this is a big problem that's
the idea of the elite I mean it's true
that investors want that and the
business class wants it
so therefore the press wants it but the
public doesn't public's against it then
comes a question about who's right and
in fact the question about the question
that's begged they're like who's
responsible for the deficit who's
responsible for this crime well first of
all is it a crime I mean if if if you
spend if you take the household example
again if you borrow money and because
you want to gamble in Las Vegas yeah
it's a bad debt if you borrow money
because you want to buy a house or you
want to send your kid to college or or
you want to invest in a business maybe
well it's not a bad debt it's just dead
it's a good did you know kind of death
that gets you somewhere no take a look
at the things that they say the various
people are responsible for well everyone
agrees incidentally that 80% of the debt
is that Reagan did the Reagan years you
know so but there's a small part that
they say the Democrats are especially
responsible for and that's the social
spending Social Security Medicare and so
on
well are you does somebody have to be
responsible for the is that a crime that
you're responsible for I mean giving
people enough to live on yeah
is that a crime that somebody has to say
okay with my fault I'm sorry I did it
that's the Assumption when you talk
about who's responsible for getting us
into this hole well it happens that you
know a lot most of the population feels
and I agree that's a very good
expenditure of public funds it's a very
good expenditure of public funds to have
elderly people taken care of if they're
not taken care of through the tax system
there's going to be a regressive tax
their children are going to take care of
them even if they can't afford it and
they'll sell their homes and so on and
so forth so it's not you know nobody's
suggesting let's let them die in the
streets or maybe these guys are but
people are going to do it the same is
true of Education I put money into
education is that a bad expense well
yeah even on there I mean forget hey you
consideration even on the narrowest
consideration of economic growth that's
a very good expense I mean economic
growth comes from an educated skilled
population living under decent
circumstances with appropriate
infrastructure that's what leads to
economic growth healthy and so on so all
expenditures that build that up well you
know that's expenditures that are
building up the growth system in fact if
you look at American history for well
over a century the US was running big
had a big debt and it was turning over
the debt wasn't trying to get rid of the
debt it was turning over the death by
using it for increasing growth faster
than debt payment so that's like a
business getting into debt wisely gets
into debt wisely uses the debt to invest
makes more money pays off its debt and
still has something left over that's
sensible day well what about our current
debt and deficit which is it the answer
is it's a mixture I mean a big part of
it is in fact just pouring money into
the hands into the pockets of Newt
Gingrich's constituents like most of the
Pentagon's budget right that's like
gambling at Las Vegas that was not total
waste because you there's a side effect
you get high-tech out of it there's much
better ways to do that but it's it's
basically bad debt well that's the part
that's going up the Pentagon system and
the and the and the other security
systems are going up so we're increasing
the bad debt what about the other things
with a good debt they're going down so
is this wise to overcome the deficit not
in this way these questions about you we
get rid of the debt or deficit are
totally meaningless it's like asking
shall I go into debt well it depends
what for sometimes yes sometimes no
there's no answer to shall I go into
debt I mean if if say businesses were
told you can't go into debt anymore the
whole economy collapse and the families
couldn't go into debt we'd be living in
the street yeah
of course that can be very good in fact
it can lead to not only good for your
life but even good for your economic
welfare because it can be used to create
a situation in which you know you can
pay off your debt but you can do more
that's how any system works that's based
on money at least how about our present
debt in deficit is it sort of out of
sight well not by historical standards I
mean with even with all of this huge
Reagan craziness you know borrow and
spend and forget tomorrow and all that
kind of stuff which did create about 80
percent of it even with all of that it's
still not high by historical standards
and it's not high by comparative
standard so in fact if it is handled
wisely without any crazy budget
balancing and so on it can lead to
economic growth and health and a better
society and better lives for our
children and so on and so forth but
you're not allowed to say that the
discussion is set up it's framed so that
that question can't arise it's framed on
the assumption you have horrible crime
we got to stop it that is it's framed on
the assumption set by the investor
community period nothing else is in
under discussion I think that's probably
a bit high yeah will be another tell
Susie I'll be few more but everything
you're discussing here is based on a
system of money and one conceived of a
system operating without money
are we on yeah yeah I think that we are
talking about very concrete questions
can we think about a different social
order yeah I think we can think about a
very different social order getting rid
of money is one part of it which I don't
think is the crucial part the crucial
part is getting rid of tyranny we happen
to be living in a system which
would have driven the founding fathers
up the wall and which any enlightenment
figure like Adam Smith or someone would
have found her renders its ass it's a
tyrannical system and which power is
more and more going into the hands of
totalitarian structures which are
unaccountable namely private
corporations the the as has long been
understood these are tyrannical
structures they are like totalitarian
states they combine in the command
center judicial legislative and
executive powers they're pretty much
unaccountable to anyone they're huge and
scale by now they they involved they
were created for distorting markets and
they carry out extreme market distortion
like in they internalize risk they don't
they free participants from market
discipline and I have a million other
ways of undermining markets whether one
thinks markets are good or bad in any
event these are tyrannical systems which
have no right to exist any more than
other tyrannical systems and they have
an extraordinary effect over life I mean
they are the media when we talk about
the media reflecting their interests
that's you know like saying I reflect my
interests yes of course they do the it's
not just the media it's the
entertainment industry and you know
advertising and so on this is all a
reflection of network of private
tyrannies they have an overwhelming
effect on government they don't like
government because government has a
defect
it's harshali influenceable by the
public whereas GE is not influenceable
at all
so the idea so they've been trying to
create for 50 years they've been trying
to create a mood of anti politics you
know hate the government true we have
the government pretty much by the throat
but it's not totally those guys out
there can still influence it so let's
get them to hate the government in
particular to hate the federal
government state governments aren't so
bad they're small enough so we can
really run them totally federal
government is fairly large and you know
you can
come around too much that's the point
behind the devolution getting things
down to the state level under some
circumstances it might be democratic
under these circumstances
anti-democratic you move things down to
the state level and even middle sized
businesses can tell them what to do so
the government national level well okay
maybe you know Microsoft and GE but not
small guys so let's get power down
decision when you when you when you take
say AFDC and any kind of so-called
welfare system you put it down to the
state level you're guaranteeing there's
not gonna go to poor people because at
that level even middle sized businesses
can insist upon the regressive fiscal
measures and shift in the tax code and
this that and the other thing which will
mean that the money goes to the rich at
the federal level it's harder you're
pushing around the bigger things so the
idea is get reduce the federal
government except for the parts that
work for us like and those increase like
the Pentagon say so increase that one
because that works for us but cut down
the parts that work for anyone else go
down to the state level reduce them even
further put even more precision making
into the hands of private unaccountable
power that's the core of the system and
that's what's got to be dismantled
totally has no legitimacy comes out of
the same intellectual roots of fascism
and Bolshevism and ought to be
dismantled the same way where you go
from there well you know there one could
discuss there are lots of ways in which
you could have a democratically run in
society it's worth discussing and
thinking about but the existence of
money it seems to me as a side part of
it may be money should be part of a
decent society maybe it shouldn't I
suspect it probably should some form of
means of exchange but it's kind of like
a technical question on the side the
real question is tyranny
okay but not much because they're really
waiting for me a lot of lines of your
last answer you mentioned Bolshevism
right now the mainstream media has
resurfaced the term anarchism and
socialism in the negative light
particularly when it refers to Timothy
McVeigh the the guy who bombed the
building in Oklahoma and the Unabomber
maybe you can give our audience some
example of what true anarchism and
socialism is is compared to what the
media is saying democracy is I mean it's
something that exists in bits and pieces
here and there there has never been any
more than a very partial democracy there
are partially socialist and partially
anarchist structures like take for
example one of the most successful
industrial commercial installations and
for in Spain quite big in fact Mondrian
it's a big collection of industrial
works schools
you know social systems health systems
and so on very substantial very
successful one of the few parts of the
Spanish economy that's competitive
internationally even after joining
European Union it's worker-owned and
it's partially socialist anarchist its
worker owned but manager control workers
pick the managers but they theoretically
at least control the managers how much
they control them you can debate and it
but in but there's no outside investors
telling what to do that their own banks
their own Development Bank's they have
their own social services and so on and
it's been dramatically successful well
okay that's pieces of a more free and
democratic society pieces only because
workers are not really participating
directly it's they're still picking
somebody to tell them what to do at
least they're picking them and they have
the authority ultimately which in
principle they could use well ok that's
a piece of a democratic society and you
find pieces of democratic societies all
over the place very often in periods of
revolution very democratic societies
emerge fast and spontaneously and
similarly like workers councils to
control industries they come up all the
time I mean they come up after the
Bolshevik Revolution they were
immediately crushed by the back to
before the Bolshevik Revolution they
developed and they were immediately
crushed by Lenin and Trotsky and Italy
at the same time they developed after
the Hungarian Revolution they developed
in Spain they not only developed that
flourish in fact these things have
happened over and over again
spontaneously the reason is it's
unnatural
you don't have to read big books to
think that the workers in the plant
ought to get together and run it back to
go back to 19th century America you know
the mill towns around here
the workers were saying
factory girls as they call them young
women from the farms or you know local
craftsmen the mills ought to be run by
the workers who are owned and run by the
workers in them that's just natural
that's like saying that people who vote
their own representives in Congress well
ok those natural ideas are crushed but
there's no reason why they can't be
realized and implement so yes and
they're all over you know so there are
lots of fun you can and you can see why
there's an effort to defame them to tie
them up with the bombers and that sort
of thing sure you want to make sure that
people don't understand what these
things are about you understand that
this is the core of the libertarian
tradition American and European those
changes would be accompanied by
significant reductions in food stamps
Medicaid housing and disability programs
gnome I just want to ask why it's so
easy for middle-class Americans to allow
this to continue why it's so easy to
beat up on the poor so to speak well
first of all on the quote this statement
that it's a leap of faith is pure
propaganda nobody has any doubt how it's
going to turn out including the people
who are I'm it's as if somebody were to
say when the Nazis put the Jews in
concentration camps it was with a huge
leap of faith that they would be happier
in their yeah maybe somebody talked
himself into that but it's not a leap of
faith they know exactly what's going to
happen the purpose of moving things down
to the state level and cutting funds is
to ensure that as little as possible
gets to poorer people well now what is
it that allows the wealthier sectors to
agree to this here you have to be a
little cautious for one thing for these
people it's obvious what does if they
get more money in their pocket if you're
trying to enrich yourself and you want
the state to be a powerful welfare state
for the rich and nothing
the Gingrich Heritage Foundation army
system including our governor if that's
what you want well this is fine I mean
you just crushed poor people because
they don't do any good for you it's like
social cleansing in Colombia on the
other hand if you look at the June year
that you have a responsibility to help
people now like as in any propaganda
it's not totally falsified so an awful
lot of foreign aid is putting money in
the pockets of rich people and a lot of
what's becoming even what they call
welfare which is a very narrow part of
welfare you can find welfare fraud and
so on and so forth but I mean even the
most crazy propaganda is a Hitler's
propaganda about the Jews had some
fringe of plausibility or else you
couldn't get anybody to accept it the
propaganda is more elaborated and the
rest of that story if I remember it it
starts by saying that everyone agrees
even liberals that AFDC has been a total
failure and that it has not gotten rid
of poverty and so on and so forth well
that may be what the author of the
article of whoever is giving him his
lines believes but it's certainly not a
fact that people who know anything
should believe because it's just not
true
the fact is the day of the what failed
about AFDC is that it was eliminated
AFDC which was never very high has been
cut back by close to fifty percent since
around 1970 you know you take a look at
AFDC in real terms from 1970 to say 1990
through the Reagan years it's down a
close to half in fact it got to the
point where it was lower all such
payments AFDC food stamps and I forget
the third third one we're lower than
general population attitudes are
somewhat more complicated for example a
large majority of the population thinks
that it's the responsibility of the
government to assist we're people who
need help
in fact the substantial proportion last
time I
Apolo the majority are willing to raise
taxes to help poor people overseas so
the idea that you should you have a
responsibility to help queer people
that's very widespread on the other hand
the polls also shows strong opposition
to welfare so the same people who say
it's the responsibility the government
to help the poor are opposed to welfare
and the reason is because there it
sounds contradictory but it isn't I
don't think if you look at the
propaganda that people are being fed the
propaganda is that welfare does not go
to help poor people welfare welfare goes
to keep the you know rich black women
breeding like rabbits and driving
Cadillacs well I don't want my money to
go for that you know so yes I'd like to
have money go to help the poor but not
welfare and similarly with foreign aid I
don't want to give those people money
for you know
rich people are gonna just hate America
if we could go to poor people in Africa
fine no now here's what the propaganda
has been successful in dissociating the
actual fact about welfare an aid from
the idea going to start with a bit of
humor not to trivialize matters but to
try to make a point there's an old
military joke about soldiers being out
in the field for six weeks living in the
crime living in the ditches unable to
shower unable to change clothes and they
come back to the barracks they're
ordered into the main barracks and the
general comes to the front of the room
and says to the soldiers I have some
good news and some bad news what do you
want to hear everyone says the good news
we want the good news says ok the good
news is today we change underwear
everybody celebrates yes today we change
underwear the bad news is you change
with you you change with you you change
with you so we we thought that a piece
of humor is quite revealing about how
the whole system of indoctrination works
so we're often given surface-level good
news good news in quotes and there's a
hidden bad news that always accompanies
it and to start we would like to talk
about the war against the poor in the
United States in relation to so-called
good news and bad news now there's a
quote in The New York Times says that
the Republican plan to abolish AFDC
rests on a huge and risky leap of faith
the plan heading for President Clinton's
desk would turn over welfare to the
states with less money and strict time
limits on benefits most people could
receive no more than five years of aid
throughout their lives and most states
would probably set limits much lower
there's food stamps alone before this
period so sure if you cut down support
systems for poor people you're gonna
have a lot of we're people that's for
sure
so one factor in the fact that we
haven't gotten rid of poverty is
the so-called war on poverty was called
off right away it in fact didn't go into
effect until the late 60 and it was and
by the end of Nixon's term that was over
and Nixon was sort of the last liberal
president you know even toward the end
of his term was being attenuated but
when you get into Carter Reagan and so
on that's the end it just goes down down
down so yes these programs didn't have
much effect because they were never
applied now they had some effect you
know like some poor children did get
enough food to eat but and in fact that
we're out the effect of cutting them
down is quite marked or at least you
know cause effect relations are hard to
determine but at least this much is
correct several years after the decline
in welfare as welfare declines you know
regularly steadily as it has been doing
since around 1970 a couple of years
later you get an increase in broken
families child abuse illegitimate births
and so on and so forth now whether
that's it cause effect relation or
before/after relations you can argue but
there is a temporal relation at least
between cutting back of support systems
and disruption of families and that's
not I think you can imagine why that
should be and it
