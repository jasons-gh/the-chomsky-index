okay so my first question is it's happy
May Day and what are some things on this
May first that you want to memorialize
what do you take inspiration from and
what struggles are especially important
to you my wife
Valerio who's Brazilian just reminded me
a few minutes ago five years ago and she
was in Brazil visiting I was here I was
giving a talk at Harvard on May Day and
she wrote me a letter saying don't
forget it's maybe in every nation of
world workers did and of course nobody
remember what is it - Spain Madrid a
couple of years after Franco's full I
had to make a decision which was many
made a demonstrations to take part in
there were two huge demonstrations from
the CNT the anarchist labor union many
others as well so which of the two
anarchist labor movements demonstrations
was they going to take part of if he
were in the United States in that same
year was nineteen daily try you've known
that it's law day Reagan had quote
instituted more day so that people to
get together to support the attack on
the garage well it changed a little bit
this made it today there are a lot of
people in the United States
mostly young people wife you know it and
made it is a day of an international day
of support for the struggles of American
workers here it's been worked well
people know about is something for Labor
Day
early September when you celebrate the
fact that you're going back to work
summer vacation
that's a triumph of propaganda in a free
country
what is pretty spectacular
think about it a day and support for the
struggles of American workers unknown
and maybe the freest country in the
world instead celebrate the day when you
go after work it's changing today in the
United States there are significant
actions taking place strike by some of
the most oppressed workers in the
country when Amazon which the work
places indescribably or meatpacking
plants others with the workers if you
look at them are Mexicans actual
Americans Guatemalans Salvador and their
strike okay
no they're being supported by others
like T there has been a labor movement
was almost completely crushed under
first Reagan the weakest has been since
the 1920s when it had been there had
been a vibrant lively labor in with him
in the United States when it was crushed
by force mainly deliverance Woodrow
Wilson would spearhead wipe out the last
remnants of a 1920s essentially blowing
one of the great books in labor history
David Montgomery it's called the fall of
the labor movement was writing for the
1920s it revived in the 1930s some time
the revised became very powerful
spearheaded the way to the New Deal went
on to move towards all sorts of
achievement
after the war the counter reaction by
the business classes were very class
conscious our reaction began continued
they finally got their champion Reagan
his first act was to smash labor unions
they're bringing in scabs to break up
strikes illegally when we country in the
world of practice outside of the court
head South Africa
what do you can to do it for the
corporations would walk through the door
they started bringing in scabs to
protect strikes master which offered
employers the opportunity to break
strikes by putting up signs saying the
transfer operation to Mexico and
flooding the workplace with propaganda
same you try to work that must be
illegal but it doesn't matter if you
kill carry a crime to get a criminal
billing it doesn't you force the boys
because it's a legal actions playing
businesses continue finally to get to
the but reviving when interesting ways
part they were described about the day
but also what leaders earlier beginning
teachers reactionary places in the
country the world labor unions a boy
the teachers were spiking not just for
higher wages which they deserve but for
educational opportunities for children
they were converging on state
legislators singing seven hey enough for
classroom for kids facility so the
children can learn that
look what I'll try Oh David joined in
it's been a ride some major strike you
know there could be but what took place
in the nineteen thirties like a long
time thing the Depression hit in 1929
there's five years before the strike
lady meant that the strike waves when
they began I mean I have childhood
memories of this finally they're all
involved the first generation immigrants
strictly once it began what a number of
significant significant effect one thing
is that overcome that overcame the
racist antagonisms within the blacks and
whites started to organize into building
didn't see I own strike the racism this
woman not happened before the 1890s
labor movies really those tremendous
racism not just blacks but Huns
anybody from Eastern Europe Italians
labor moving again we're working
together for common for the other thing
that happened which is of great
significance is the Vitamix attorneys
injured by the workers we're starting
the caveat sit down strips
suppose you're sitting in the management
office then you see us if thankful you
know something in five minutes this
guy's sitting there I say we're done the
whole system
all with a very fragile it relies on
consent of the subordinates that have
built into them by definitely intense
propaganda so that you were taught to
believe that having a job is the most
wonderful thing in the world
what's having the job I mean job means
selling yourself for your entire almost
your entire waking life to a
totalitarian leader who goes beyond
anything that Stalin ever thought of
Stalin didn't tell you you can have a go
use the clues you have to be like so so
you're turning yourself into virtually a
slave for most of the waking life well
that's your highest ideal enough wasn't
always on four go back to the 19th
century early Industrial Revolution
literally composed to the industrial
system which was taking the way they
never needed a dignity that freedom was
taking them and turning them into
virtual slaves of absentee owners they
wanted to destroy the system the slogan
of the major labor movement Knights of
Labor was those who work in the middle
Cydonia a long time to beat that out of
people's heads they were picking up on a
tradition of 2,000 years back to
classical Greece and Rome and all the
way through the worst attack on human
dignity and rights was to make a person
dependent on someone else it's
considered virtually slavery different
from slavery only in that was temporary
but that was a slogan of the Republican
Party under a ninja Lincoln himself
class
mm good condition what was commonly cold
with age slavery was essentially slavery
well as I say took a long time I don't
think it's I think one of my favorite
quotes from you I think it was from a
Bill Moyers interview was that democracy
isn't really a political system it's a
human value like truth or justice or
love it's one of these things that's
endemic to us and I feel like one of the
people you introduced me to gar
alperovitz and the new economy movement
provide a vision for what the future
could look like and just about what
you're speaking about you know why what
are some things that we should know
about things like cooperatives community
land Trust's participating economics
even credit unions actually black lives
matter in Minnesota started an
initiative to start their own credit
union to have a economic power
consolidated if you could please speak
on these I'm bursting with that's right
George ISM dream America it's the most
democratic political movement in US
history
where's the populist movement it's not
populism in the sense that the term is
used today was just a vulgarity began in
Texas Texas fun moved to Oklahoma Kansas
took over the entire Midwest radical
farm they're saying we don't want to be
controlled by the northeastern bankers
when the guys the guys who lend us money
for planting seeds and then these guys
who run the more active labor
with inner the incipient labor and I
would tried to organize in places like
Louisiana had a tough time facility
tried to organize blacks and the racism
boys mind but they were trying to get
together they were beaten back by force
during force private security
legislation finally managed to bleep it
up the title is radicals the most
radically Democratic movie in history
straight out of mainstream America and
now being revived like to say it's like
less matter instead of genius the girl
the girl hair which has been doing this
to organize it started in the old
respite so Young's I think the first
place with Youngstown Ohio a US Steel
decided to close the major steel play
that's the plan of we're working people
but essentially built the community
Youngstown was a working-class community
workers in the plan so they say let's
destroy it as we can make a little more
money by moving the connects but these
are not deeply lives they're not they
don't work there they live in New York
where their bankers they said okay let's
get rid of this well the workers said no
rule by the plan the union said let's
buy the plan and run it ourselves the
owners don't want it I mean be
profitable for them to settle it instead
of closing them but it puts the wrong
idea into people they don't need us you
can do it yourself that's very dangerous
so if you sit down strike you know let's
rather lose money then let people have
that for you because then it's
the school brothers started to move
destroyed it take it to set up her own
enterprises that were integrated into
the community let's show well this means
things the community around Cleveland
there's a lot of public agenda providers
public institutions they need services
so let's set up work around the laundry
which will provide the service it works
very well spread delivery it's it's it's
turned into which what you described the
new democracy movement trying to
organize and development cooperatives to
work around the enterprise use a lot of
other things like a localized effort
he's get together to meet
self-supporting that's free from the
should had also stored meal and the
other person in Brawl stole a music he
was a radical in story and Jane from
Atlanta Spelman after they threw out his
colleague Howard gin plus he was
supporting students and civil rights
activities started purchased they went
on to become a radical lawyer control of
the factory blanket threw down so this
is going on needed lunch the movements
are import spreading is not just the
actions but getting through to people's
heads you don't have to be slaves they
are
no as always happens whenever I listen
to you talk I'm bursting with more
things to elaborate and more things to
it's a question so many of the things
you've said have resonated with me
one of which the there I'm going to
consolidate some questions so please
bear with me one of the things you
mentioned was things like you know
localism being endemic to American
culture
I actually know for a fact that you know
the American South
uhsorry and I wanted to bridge that gap
between cooperatives worker ownership as
well as public institutions like the
kind you mentioned in Cleveland
cooperatives forming around things like
schools and hospitals public ownership
even in the American South Chattanooga
Tennessee I believe has a community
owned Internet broadband and will it
works very well and I'm recognizing
those is right outside of Tucson and as
we go out of the business sectors
Internet is very weak infrastructure in
general in the United States is
collapsing mm-hmm unless you happen to
be close to vision centers you know
every few minutes I get a thing up here
I don't over you see it's a signal is
weak but in Chattanooga they did it
really I thought we could do it too
there happens to be a country called
sorry to say the word China the United
States trying to kill it which produces
high quality 5g internet at very low
cost as many countries in the world us
wants to kill it because we don't want
others to have technology we have to
have it so therefore let's try to stop
Chinese development and make them poorer
and less developed because we want to be
on top that's
she supported you a lot of people maybe
they could be a security yeah maybe they
run by Indians from so we could Arizona
where I could make a treaty with time
and we could have like already but in
some places like maybe just under
control well this just because we
switched to technology I want to ask you
this question as well one of the people
who I can't believe I didn't know about
because they were supposed to be working
at the university I went to Simon Fraser
David F Noble a technology critical
technology theorist which again I
learned about from you he wrote about
things like forces of automation and
production and kind of the the I guess
you could call the political economy
around technology and I wanted to ask
you
with the recent increase in whatsapp
misinformation social media internet
trolling and so on what your commentary
is on the state of Technology today and
what are some tactics we can use to
combat this and allow technology to help
us public ownership and and worker
cooperatives or one of the things we
mentioned but you could just elaborate
on it if noble person friends his work
is tremendously unknown that's just
there's plenty of technology technology
is pretty neutral
it doesn't care how you use it we can
use it it's kind of like I used to build
a house and use it to smash somebody's
head it's pretty much the same with
these technologies what's a sew-in
I mentioned my wife's Virginia in Brazil
practically everybody
what sir it was used by the for rights
to demonize
pickle opposition and to win a
fraudulent election which has driven in
the country into disaster what's up was
used with the opposition is flooded with
things like the Labour Party says Jesus
is good the Labour Party wants to the
government to put nipples on the
children's bottles that look like
penises as Labour Party wants to educate
about a population there's a lot of it
they get their information through water
that's the circumcision you can use it
that way I mean it's pretty much swung
the election the other thing they did
was put a most popular candidate jail on
fraudulent charges and even insist that
he couldn't make a statement on like
mass murder mrs. Lula in solitary
confinement
yeah majesty that helped them win the
election to but they might be very harsh
less conscious lately and they wanted to
destroy
so that's a way to use whatsit you can
you also use a set of demonstrations and
organized like yeah I don't know for
sure but I suspect the French strike
other strikes going on right now the
organisation stole their the powerful
reactionary use it for their purposes
you let them do it break them up so they
can't do it when you can use it yourself
and I have a follow-up questions because
we talked about organizing which it's
something that I've always resonated
with in the early 2000s ish you know one
of the big movements there were Ron Paul
libertarians in the United States
Ron Paul libertarians libertarians and
this was a constituency in the kind of
right-wing base which was interesting
because they stood for at least on paper
civil liberties and so on and there were
there was a lot of talk and still is
about whether that would be a good
constituency or part of the kind of
current right-wing base to organize and
reach out to along progressive
principles so I wanted to ask whether
you thought that might be a productive
effort or whether decades of Fox News
and Rush Limbaugh type media had kind of
made matters too far gone or in some
words I mean I should say that there are
points of convergence you may recall
that in the nineteen sixties early
seventies there were all sorts of
radical publications lots of openings it
kind of died out by the late seventies
until Z Magazine in that interim period
I was publishing with a libertarian
Journal run by the Cato Institute that
we agreed on some things like anti
intervention but can you reach out yes
you can I think the people I think
people are the people involved in the
libertarian movement I don't think I
understand it and if you bring if you
discuss with him what it is they so what
is the so-called libertarian was
personal is the American concert
libertarianism traditionally meant
something totally different
let's liberate Arianism which was
basically an American based
libertarianism is what you'd expect
business worrying American
libertarianism says we should all live
under private charities that says we
should rely on the market
the government when you get rid of the
government in our society the cars when
you rely on the market what happens our
shifts from an institution that's
partially under public influence to
institutions which are totally
unaccountable and our pure tyrannies
private enterprise what is private
anything on account of the Pope and if
you listen to the libertarian gurus like
Friedman corporations have one goal to
enrich themselves
that's why aiming at this property I
think but enriches us there's no
responsibility anyone else so pure greed
absolutely totalitarians decisions from
the top go down you don't have a say
public is out of it let's transfer
decisions today
furthermore by lament the big fish eat
the small fish so no stones
monopolization was obvious at the
beginning we've not seen 40 years
that's libertarianism when Reagan came
and in his inaugural speech the
Institute introduced neoliberal doctrine
which is basically
remember his first speech government is
the problem not the solution
translation move decision-making from
government which was a floor partially
under public infants move it to some
institutions that have no floors
publicly out it's just pure tyrannies
move it over to then of course that's a
little bit of a joke because as soon as
the private tyrannies get into trouble
they run to throw away their copies of
in bag run to the government says please
bail us out ok Reagan to that everyone
I mean right now and what's the so but
it's kind of a half-ass truth you guys
are stuck and isolated no market we guys
preach market principles but we operate
with huge government subsidies and
government protection until we get out
of trouble
let's go back to the financial
institutions which under the main part
of the economy overwhelming profit
there's actually an interesting IMS
study English who investigated I think
the maybe the largest American what's an
entrance to a conclusion that the profit
comes almost entirely from a classic
government subsidy is old too big to
fail public that means if you get into
any trouble the public that has a lot of
effects not just the bellows but access
to cheap credit estimated those this is
all the masses fraud take a look at
Trump's latest budget looking at it
should February 10th
I didn't on the internet middle of the
pandemic people are dying like flies
he's denying there's his budget with the
cut in the Center for Disease Control
which it means if I had been to funding
for four years so let's make sure that
we can't deal with a virus crisis but
increase in front of our fossil fuel
industries more subsidies to the people
are trying to destroy the world but our
my constituency of course my my name for
that
military which is out of sight more
money for the wool is protect us from
the rapist push some buttons for me my
popular base that's the budget that
tells you the mentality first of all
he's an extreme form of course you come
away pathological form of
instance of the larger disease and
that's the basic concept subsidies for
the rich and powerful in the corporate
sector anybody else one of the other
great quotes from you that I like is the
only ISM you believe in is truism which
i think is great because I think that
what you described cuts across so many
different isms like a liberal an
American libertarian for example would
decry the subsidies on big oil in the
financial institution just like a
progressive what and I just have a
question regarding but the implement
implement yeah functionally they
implement it in the real work in the
real world they do and my my question to
you is do you still believe that say
isms matter do political philosophies
that kind of in the abstract to find
things matter and are these kind of at
the core of a lot of fractional ISM that
we see on the left are progressives
takes a physics vision I mean there's
anybody in mind stylist is they make
sense they don't make sense
well furthermore you learn more and you
change them I mean there is something
called Darwinism but nobody who calls
himself a door when it's believes in
Toyland right he had great ideas and
good insulation it's open but to the
side that's kind of a slogan but it's
not an ideology and why shouldn't that
be true in the part of human affairs and
really matters for their lives
we have to be stuck in some ideology
that maybe made sense at one point you
have to vitalize it's a funny way to
look at the world furthermore when you
look at these isms and try to define
what they are you know no consistency
yeah if anyone comes up with Chomsky's
I'm all right some angry letters I
promise one of the I'm glad we laughed
because this tends into the good a good
question you were one of the first I
think at least one of the first that I
heard that were pointing out how
right-wing media used the mockery of
Georgia W Bush to consolidate its base a
lot of pundits and so on were making fun
of george w bush and this kind of formed
a sense of identity and organization
appoint for the right do you think this
has been intensified under trump and do
you think that comedy social satire or
infotainment can ever be helpful i think
it's a double-edged sword I mean it's
kind of fun for the people when you see
some Center that's making me look like a
baby okay I'm the one maybe I was wrong
so if he's you think I'm one of the
deplorable
okay I'm gonna hate you even more able
meets anything we're talk to those
elites terrible and you're showing me
that's
right what do you do he leads do you
make fun of me you say I'm a redneck
that case it works without him so I mean
I say I do it too sometimes I kind of
fall into it but it's the wrong thing
one of these are human beings HM maybe
something to Florida breach but they
have interests have concerns like what
we're just saying about libertarianism
money of young libertarians think it's
great to be free of government controls
let's look into it more closely if
you're not free of influence by the
government who is influence are you
really free how many free not to take a
job anybody making decisions about
policy I think one of the things that is
resonates with me a lot is this concept
of the double-edged sword it seems to
pervade a lot of things and this is
actually um I should say a question from
subreddit on called are Chomsky where we
have a little online community that we
are broadly familiar and entered the
name yeah
well change the name bradley familiar
with your work and one actually question
from there was um what one someone was
asking what is the most consistent thing
that has produced positive change in the
world so because of all of these i know
there's no general answer as a is a big
thing you know you know in a lot of
these cases but there is something that
you would thread that you could pull out
of history or now or your knowledge base
that could consistently produce good
results comment like my old close friend
I wish I could remember the exact words
as it was eloquent but it was something
like the important people are in the
world in the world of history are those
unknown people whose small acts provided
the basis on which great events took
place so for example I don't remember
the names and whom you don't remember
the names of the four black students in
Greensboro North Carolina in 1960
decided to sit at a lunch counter
of course they were immediately arrested
and taken away could have been the end
it was the next day organization was
formed Smith Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee our
main supporter which they spread some
working kids joined it but they began
working through the South they became
the Freedom Riders
they were the ones who were joining
buses throughout the South going to get
black people to free themselves from the
very justified future
they finally felt a basis for major mass
movement there were major figures like
Martin Luther King very much respect
it was writing that wave it hadn't been
for that sure he would have said well
but there's unknown people they're the
ones who get Simmons tonight happening
all the time
you know the names of the kids in the
sunrise movement the movie
I'm occasionally someone stands out but
mostly but somebody's better it's about
the movements one of the things I had
speaking of knowing things this is a
great segue so I've mentioned a few
times like you know one of the great
things about you know him is you've been
the source of things that you know I
wouldn't have known otherwise I mean
David F Noble I've loved his work and he
was at my university likes I was
supposed to teach it as a view and I
didn't know about him until you
mentioned it in a talk one time
and the same thing goes with the
unspoken truth about Obama's nuclear
modernization program barely mentioned
in the news and it tripled nuclear
capacity you know I one of the few
sources I heard it from same with the
with ha-joon Chang and a bunch of other
sources you've been a very valuable
resource for a lot of people and kind of
getting news that's that informs our
perspectives but isn't necessarily in
the mainstream and so I wanted to ask
you basically how do you expose yourself
to such information what is your
research method like and specifically
well this is more related to the point
about Obama's nuclear modernization how
should activists factor geostrategic
factors into their own activist take
that kids mm-hmm in case his personal
goal it was a compromise with the ultra
who wouldn't let anything pass
you remember Mitch McConnell yes senator
Raoul was elected he said our sole
purpose is to make sure he can't do
anything then Mitch McConnell is the
most extreme opponent of democracy
probably in American history Munson said
straighter so Obama's maybe he should
have done it in different ways my
opinion is he couldn't use those first
two years of his presidency do a lot
more things I think he actually killed
it by the blocking the foot legislate
congressional attention but in this
particular case I was trying to make
some kind of a deal with Congress okay
I'll give you the huge I think I don't
agree with it what's the research maybe
I get a flood of letters from people
saying that wouldn't research method do
you use you know with the research
measure they look at what's happening
maybe the newspapers see what I did this
is doing see what's happening around the
world it's not quantum physics anybody
can do it right I happen to grow up as a
kid I can I'm thinking a lot about the
thirties these days because a lot of
childhood memories are coming back
country but my family was a
working-class first generation some of
them barely went to school I remember
childhood discussions everything from
domestic politics to various subgroups
the second level it acoustical better
than some other guy there's a working
class people without formal education I
use everybody everyone
so pretty much on the surface there's
nothing deep no you want to study
quantum physics yeah you have to learn
from Tori you want to understand what's
happening in the world almost nothing
doesn't almost no theories these things
that are called theories so thin
basically moderate descriptions so it's
all right available didn't work on it
you have to know a lot of things you
can't just take what you see on CNN and
Fox News or even worse on Facebook right
mentioned this before but not here but
maybe the biggest influence on my life
as a child was his uncle but never going
past fourth grade the worst thing about
this interview is that I have to look at
the time I wish I didn't have to but I
have to two final questions if that's
okay just very briefly one of which was
I did mention we do have this kind of
online community of people who are
broadly familiar with your work and
resonate with a lot of your work you
message to the general population has
been very you know clear and great and
well-documented is there any message you
have for the people like you mentioned
or a couple questions ago you know
reading a lot of your stuff and so on
what message do you have with people who
are kind of familiar with you to what
you're talking about
well one of the striking things today I
noticed in 1930s is that at that time
the objective conditions were much worse
than they are today but there was a
sense of hopefulness since we can get
out of this we can work together we have
rich lives mostly centered around the
labor movement and the opportunities
gave
we'll be okay work together we'll get
out of these bar very different today
that so take the Sanders nothing Sanders
didn't win the nomination all over you
[Music]
was a tremendous success the whole arena
of discussion and debate the country
that things that couldn't even be
mentioned ago I was a democratic party
program to the list of any Democrat any
candidate I can think of since maybe
Roosevelt it didn't happen cuz they had
a revelation
let's go to live a lot of energy young
represent it is like Ocasio Cortes make
a difference fantastic
done with no corporate funding no
worldly funding no media support just
have to get a greater success than that
and you don't despair you say yes it was
a mild setback but no picked up and
doing I'm gonna was a setback when the
civil rights activists in the South were
murdered right that was a setback they
didn't give up okay any popular movement
anyone you think of from history that's
had said that can't be otherwise well
yeah the choice you say okay I'm gonna
pick it up plenty of opportunities now
all over the place so let's pick it up
even the things that got means dream
like electoral reform and worker
ownership were part of the Sanders
campaign and that was invisible in the
public eye none but yeah
perfect sorry - I have one last question
because I feel like at the time you've
done so many interviews and and and and
you see thousands of emails like you
said I wanted to ask you is there
anything you haven't been asked that you
wish you've been asked or wish you've
been asked more often and is there
anything that you would like to say that
you don't often get to say and also I
know you hate to do it but if there's
any reason reading you'd recommend very
important which I found impossible
let's take a very specific one of trumps
malignancies there are many was the
terror of the Iran they did it sort of
disgusting reasons Obama's doing the
same sort of thing standard confidence
that was very important to all worlds
but the u.s. is so powerful but even the
countries the u.s. kicks him out of
international interests and malevolence
so the world hates the United States but
is terrified it's very straight so they
go what's the problems and it's gonna
lead to serious danger quickly - as far
as the demon is going as far as we could
award certainly raised - - it's supposed
for the sake of argument we accept the
propaganda which is totally for
but it really looks exactly is there a
way to do trivia for the other way is to
institute a nucleus that gets rid of
what's blocking not Iran not the our
expression for in three thirty years not
the global south it's Europe opposed why
doesn't it work one country locked the
United States most recently Obama 2015
comes up regularly international
meetings us blocked why we think the
research methods open your eyes if you
have a nuclear free weapons own Israel
do that in fact the United States
doesn't even consider that it exists why
if you can see that it exists outside
the framework so in order to safeguard
Israel's nuclear weapons and our massive
aid to Israel it's worth threatening the
world to blow up I don't know how many
thousands of times they've said it's
kind of heard right I mean people talk
to Maureen said they understand but you
talk to somebody left me outside of
people involved in arms
and this is coming up regularly it's
coming up early next year once again
there are a lot of things including
things you've talked about like why take
why should we have jobs what's great
about being asleep it seems like the
obvious isn't respected sensibility
that's part of I hope you know I
plagiarized one of your phrases
intellectual self defense for the videos
I upload and I think that's it's perfect
example you need to have a framework in
which you can question these things and
get outside of dogma well no I want to
be respectful of your time thank you
back to back is the life of Noam Chomsky
thank you so much for joining me and
thank you so much for all you do
until next time thank you Cheers
