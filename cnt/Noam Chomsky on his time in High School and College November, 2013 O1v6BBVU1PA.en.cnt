I hated high school it was the academics
high school in the city the one that all
the kids went to who were going to go to
college teachers didn't really have to
work very hard because we were passed
the exams anyway and I couldn't stand
and this is 1945 there were no questions
about going to some college somewhere
else you lived at home work went to the
local college fury local college
happened to be the University of
Pennsylvania I as the high school
student looked at the look through the
catalogue with really exciting all these
great courses and all sorts of different
fuels I was really looking forward to
getting out and going to college after
my first year of college each course I
took in every field was so boring that I
didn't even go to the class I'm in the
way I was I was quite interested in
chemistry but the way I asked the
chemistry course was because I had a
friend a young woman about my age to the
extreme limit
she lent me her nose so I didn't go to
class you had to go to there was a lab
and I knew if I tried to carry out a lab
experiment it's not going to work it was
a live manual it was obvious with the
answers had to be so I just filled in
the answers and I never even went to the
lab and then I had my comeuppance when I
had to apply the next semester because I
was charged 17 dollars which was a lot
of money in those days for lab breakage
and I couldn't tell them look I never
went but it sort of went on I started
mainly taking the scattering of
graduated courses without much
background didn't and then was lucky
enough forget for your fellowship
graduate fellowship just didn't work and
essentially never had I never had much
of a formal education it was one of the
greatest education educational
experiences I ever had in those four
years was Harvard was to have a desk in
the stacks in those days the stacks
broken not anymore
that a graduate student had the best in
the stacks and yet the whole of Widener
Library this amazing library there you
kind of walk around pick things out from
place things you never heard
pursue them that was fantastic
experience I think it's a great way to
get an education and then I was again
very lucky I got to MIT which is a
research institution they didn't care
what didn't care about credentials you
could work how much you wanted to think
about very well but it's just a series
of accidents I think very few people are
looking enough to have an experience
leading them so I'm not suggesting that
they go to college and do your work
