first of all we should avoid the term
free trade because the agreements that
are signed are not free trade agreements
they have highly protectionist elements
they're basically investor rights
agreements so then they privilege
investors and corporations and very high
protective tariffs for major
corporations international electoral
property rights are essentially Paris
and though the and in many ways and a
lot of it them unitive trade so for
example the so-called free trade
agreements grant investors special
rights in the countries where they
invest so if a US companies that invests
in Mexico they have to be treated like a
Mexican company that's got nothing to do
with free trade in fact a lot of the
interactions among countries aren't even
traded in any reasonable sets so it
takes a u.s. Mexico probably
corporations don't give us data so it's
guesswork but probably about half of the
commercial interactions across the
border are actually internal to a
multinational corporation so say General
Motors will assemble parts in a state
say Indiana send them to northern Mexico
for assembly and then return the car to
Los Angeles for sale
that's called trade in both directions
but it isn't trade it's an interaction
inside a closed economy then with the
multinational corporation so the free
trade rooms aren't aren't free trade
agreements there's nothing else and
they're they do have complex effects I
mean the one effect often is to increase
poverty so for example pick say
us-mexico of the the North American
so-called free trade agreement inside
the 1994 it was predicted pretty widely
that this would be quite harmful
Mexican farmers and small business
working people and so on and indeed it
has been it's it's been valuable to the
corporate system that's been in Mexico
it's led to a huge growth in the number
of billionaire on the other hand for
concie knows you know peasant Sunday and
agricultural work predictably it
undermined them I mean they may be
perfectly efficient that they can't
compete with highly subsidized US
agribusiness it's another respect which
is not treat raid so they flock to the
cities there's less work for them in the
cities because Mexican businesses can't
compete with the US multinationals they
come across the border and gotten what's
called the immigration problem and this
is the kind of effect that these
neoliberal programs typically have it
leads to concentration of wealth to our
level of corruption and to cutting back
benefits for the general population and
harming the workforce
so people are were stagnating while
wealth is accumulating in very few and
standard consequence perfectly
predictable and it happens over and over
and it leads to popular uprisings
