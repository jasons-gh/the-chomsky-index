we invited those of you who have
questions to use the microphones in the
aisles and we'll just go back and forth
from one night to the next professor
Chomsky a few Weeke a few days ago our
president at a news conference announced
a new program to help provide food to
the children of Afghanistan even Peter
Jennings of ABC News sort of hinted that
that was a touch of propaganda spurred
on by bipartisan complaints that bin
Laden was winning the propaganda war
worldwide um are you aware of any
organizations that we would do best
funneling money that we would like to
donate to help increase the food supply
in that country yeah plenty I mean this
is obviously just couldn't even pass ABC
News the extremely poor timing you may
have noticed that Bush went to the Red
Cross office with a box or something
[Music]
from the children of America to give to
the Red Cross and he arrived just at the
time of the news that bombers that
destroyed a Red Cross compound that was
storing food in Afghanistan I'm not the
greatest timing but yeah that's a joke
but there are plenty of organizations I
mean the world champ program
Oxfam Christian Aid Save the Children
there are lots of mollified
organizations
I mean Oxfam's right here in Boston yeah
you don't go very far and they do very
serious honest work they can't do it now
because the way to get food an is to
truck it in dropping food by air is
almost meaningless every organization
has poured this pointed this out the
world food or going to program which is
the main one and the most serious one
they've pointed out I don't think it's
been reported here but it's all over the
British press room Financial Times and
others that if you want they said they
might consider air drops but if you
don't you have to prepare it and you
have to prepare an area so that it has
to be a safe area you don't want to draw
people the places where there's mines
all over the place or something like
that
so you prepare a safe area you have
people there who are going to pick up
the food and distribute it to the people
who need
to the sick the children the women you
know the people aren't going to get it
if you drop food all over if there's
people there who give it to the people
who need it has to be organized there
has to be information saying it's safe
to come here the worst way to do it we
probably causes more harm than good is
just to drop packages around who knows
what the effects or even if anyone gets
it so but trucking is the right way way
beyond and that has been pretty much
either stopped or cut back because of
the threat of mana that's why the UN and
the aid agencies are pleading with the
United States to stop the bombing well
there's still some people alive there
and yes there are organizations right
here in Boston and elsewhere which you
certainly can give to them and should
you know this is a major catastrophe
professor Chomsky thank you for coming
tonight and I know we're all honored to
have you here I wanted to go back to
something you said at the beginning of
your speech you mentioned this silent
genocide that you blame America for or
will blame America in the coming weeks I
know that you don't believe that America
put these Afghan people on the brink of
starvation in the first place you may
ascribe that to the world economy there
are many reasons why these people were
on the brink of starvation in the first
place so certainly you don't blame
America for putting them in the position
second of all I thought it was
conspicuously absent from your
discussion any mention of blaming the
Taliban which could end this genocide
that you mentioned
by simply turning over a sama bin Laden
to an international court they could end
it immediately and that was
conspicuously absent from your
discussion also you mentioned you also
mentioned by analogy you said that if
there were a madman who were down the
street it would be wrong for us to turn
an assault rifles on our neighbors and
to shoot everyone without knowing where
he is I suggest that your analogy is
perhaps flawed and I'd like to pose
another one if you'd humor me instead of
a madman a killer being down the street
who knows where we know it's
where he is let's say he's taken over a
large mansion we don't know which room
he's in but the family that lives there
has said that they will take up arms and
oppose law enforcement from entering the
home to obtain this known criminal now
how would the government react to a home
in this situation they might cut the
power they might cut the gas they would
probably cut the water perhaps they
would threaten that if these persons
were to aid and abet the criminals and
prevent law enforcement from entering
the home to take them into incarceration
perhaps in fact violent means would be
threatened against these people how do
you respond to this hypothetical and
also my own hypothetical its dealing
with a house it's in other country it's
not a sovereign nation all hypotheticals
and analogies are thought in this way
and so we're dealing here with a serious
problem six thousand people are dead if
we turn to economic retaliation if we
turn to economic sanctions certainly the
poor Afghan people will be hurt first
and foremost by economic sanctions so I
know you're opposed to that you're
obviously opposed to military sanctions
so having ruled out economic and
military sanctions
I don't suppose spitballs would be in
order well I already gave you the answer
why I think we do but let's go through
your questions first of all you said I
believe America and that is false
secondly secondly when you say that the
United States had nothing but it's the
world economy that had to do with
Afghanistan it's just not true
well the Afghanistan has always been a
very good place and there are many
reasons for its current straits but two
primary ones are called Russia in the
United States the United States Russia
in the United States and when I've
counted 80s technically destroyed the
place not to help the Afghans as soon as
the place was destroyed they pulled out
and the forces that the United States
are organized to harass the Russians
Rights Watch calls the worst period
Afghan history as these various forces
with its allies just tore the place of
perfect probably killed 50,000 people I
mean they'll carry on mass rapes and
slaughters and destroy cuddle in fact
they were so horrendous that when the
Taliban came in in the 1994-1995 they
were actually welcomed because at least
they were bringing something to order to
the place and driving a big mad madman
who had been left behind from the US war
meaning for me so when you say like you
can do something about it there's no
abstract into the America that acts and
when we had a lot to do with this quite
a lot to do with it there plenty of
other forces to you say the Taliban
could solve the problem by just handing
him over to equipment business out the
Taliban could solve a lot of problems by
disappearing I'm sure been strongly in
favor of that for a long time however I
have no
way of making them disappear so like
it's supposed to be were in Russia in
the 1980s no somebody could have some
and some dissident was criticizing the
Russian invasion well a commissar could
have stood up and said look what do you
buy a criticizing the Russian invasion
why aren't you criticizing what the
Afghans are doing to each other yeah
that's the standard connoisseur align we
know what to think about it you and I
are responsible for what you and I can
do we have no moral responsibility for
what other people then we cannot affect
we may hate it we can't do anything
about it like we could have a debate the
discussion right now about the crimes of
Genghis Khan and we might be correct
about it it would have no moral value
whatsoever might have some historical
value same with the primary line you
know can't think of it on do about them
fine then have an academic seminar but
don't think it hasn't any moral value
when you tell me what the Taliban can do
it's exactly the same the moral value of
that is yeah they could do a lot of
things for example one thing they could
do is what you said turned over to a
third party
oh the problem of that is the US has
refused to allow it now are they serious
in that offer that's been going on for a
couple of weeks well we don't know
because every time the offer is made
George Bush stands up and says where I'm
going to talk to you
we're not gonna negotiate with you we
don't want to turn it over
let's has nothing to do with how rotten
the Taliban are yeah they're rotten
Waddle rotten things in the world they
should be if we're serious we should be
concerned with what we do and what we
can do if there's an elementary moral
truism that's it people don't understand
that
what about you and now what about your
analogy so let's say there's a killer in
a house and then suddenly we don't
nobody knows where he is
firstly they don't even know that he's
the person notice they don't have any
evidence against him I mean there was
evidence that his networks are in the
background yeah that's um almost
certainly true although no evidence is
presented like I said it's put on a
fascia plausible but they don't know
that it's him he may be telling the
truth when he says he wasn't involved
and there's some reason to believe it in
fact a good deal of the foreign press
and commentators believe it because it
just doesn't seem credible that he could
have carried it out or initiated it so
they don't know that he's the
perpetrator and they don't know it they
haven't a clue where he is so what the
writer so let's pick your house analogy
you feel like you say that there are
people there we're going to defend him
are those the seven to eight million
Afghans and they're trying to starve to
death are they defending the people were
killing our innocent Afghans not people
were defending Osama bin Laden they're
the victims of the Taliban they're the
ones we're attacking is that your the
analogy you made is an interesting case
and you could talk about it in some
seminar it's got nothing to do with this
what's going on here tells us that food
shipments have been cut back to the
point where the number of people now at
risk of starvation since September 11th
has increased by 50% so to seven point
five million that's another two and a
half man people at risk of starvation
since September 11 as a result as they
point out correctly of the threat of us
bombing and the terror it's caused and
so on and that withdrawal of aid and of
international workers well those people
are not defending men Laden those are
perfectly innocent civilians who have
none
do with it except that they're victims
of the Taliban you know not some
abstract entity are consciously acting
to murder okay if we can't face that we
have no right talking about this problem
[Music]
okay so tell me why it's a lot of crap
you only have like let her talk
[Music]
I'm not blaming the country at all yes
that's
[Music]
systematically for you
[Music]
okay thank you for your comment let's go
on yeah it's gonna be tough to follow
these two acts I have two quick
questions one is uh what do you think
what do you think the role of oil plays
in US desires to dominate the region and
any of them can you allow somebody else
to say something can you allow somebody
else to say some try it allowing someone
else to talk there's a lot of other
people who have been waiting to you're
not the only one go ahead stand in line
and you'll have your chance go ahead I'm
wondering what you think what you think
US interests in the region are in terms
of oil in general and also specifically
in the war and also I know you won't
want to answer this question but what do
you think the chances of us living for
one more year
well you know actually it's not it it's
not an unreasonable question I mean one
of the reasons where the Bush
administration drew back from its
initial plans to have a massive visible
slaughter was the concern that
throughout the region this would have
extremely disruptive effects for example
it might lead to a revolution to a
Taliban style revolution in Pakistan
Pakistan has nuclear weapons I tell our
own style revolution which you know we
don't know how far away that is if you
take a look at the Gallup poll in
Pakistan whatever it means in Pakistan
I'm not sure the latest none showed
about I think three percent of the
population supporting the United States
and maybe all the ones are quoted in
those papers and like about 85 percent
oppose in the war against Afghan
civilians well you know who knows where
that's gonna go and it's supposed to
spread the Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is
a Qatar it's a brutal oppressive regime
sponsored by the United States since its
origins very strongly disliked but much
of its population or even hated at
because of the oppression in these
countries there has been an opening to
radical Islamists as a way of react
when they're blocked from political
participation that's well none all right
suppose those forces happen to take
control in Saudi Arabia now we're
talking about major nuclear war that's
the source of the major energy reserves
in the world you know it's this I'll
never let that happen I mean you know I
don't think any of this is going to
happen but you know it's not that remote
on your first question and that's why
the Bush administration backed off
certainly and are now playing of trying
to follow a very delicate line the I
mean you know anything in that region
oil was in the background I mean if
there wasn't well if it wasn't the major
energy reserve of the world world you
know west would pay as much attention to
it as they do the Congo you know we have
a lot of responsibility for the
atrocities in the Congo major
responsibilities goes back to the
assassination of Lumumba 40 years ago
and a lot of stuff since so when you
just talk about those savages killing
each other remember me and I don't mean
an abstract America I mean nice folks
like us including me we have a lot of
responsibility for big responsibility
but always trying to do anything about
it because there isn't that much at
stake in terms of you know profits and
power and so on plenty of resources but
we'll get them later after they kill
each other in the case of the major
energy reserves of the world it's a
different story they happen to be in the
Gulf region primarily in Saudi Arabia
secondarily in Iraq a lot of natural gas
and other countries and in Central Asia
it's not at the level of the Gulf but
it's substantial and anything that's
done you know that's somewhere in the
background now there's a lot of
speculation now that the reason the u.s.
is fighting in Afghanistan is because of
oil pipelines that they want to put
through and that sort of thing I think
that's pretty implausible I mean it's in
the background undoubtedly it can't be
the reason I mean if it were the reason
why did they do it a year ago two years
ago when Unocal also wanted to build a
pipeline I mean it can't be the
immediate reason you know it's all over
the Internet
and I see it everywhere lots of
speculation and what is being said is
not false there are concerns about you
know the so-called no great game that
sometimes called you know the effort to
try to come of imperial powers to try to
control this region the way the Russians
and the British did you know 100 years
ago and yeah that's going on and there's
a lot of jockeying for power who's going
to get control of getting the gas and
oil out of the Central Asian region the
US wants to make sure it's corporations
do it not the Russians not the Iranians
and a lot of interplays so sure that's
in the background but it's always in the
background the events that are happening
now had a different cause they have that
in the background but a different cause
yeah just tommix think you already
answered my question but I'm wondering
what you have to say about other
economic interests that could be at
stake
you've been very vocal about
militarization of Israel for example
you've been very vocal about that the
role of militarization has played and
during during the Cold War the role that
it played and how important it was to
satisfy certain very specific interests
I'm sort of at a loss when you when you
say that that those interests couldn't
be at stake here
couldn't be ya know there are at stake
there in the background but there's a
difference between issues that are in
the background and an immediate cause
those issues are constantly in the
background but if something is happening
now and not a year ago when the
background issues were the same we look
for a different cause look if you're an
MIT student you've studied the sciences
you should know this that's what you do
that's the way you do science a lot of
background things all the time
if something happens at a particular
moment when the backgrounds conditions
remain the same you look for what
changed at that moment I guess I just
don't see how it wouldn't be immediate
how these causes wouldn't be operative
and then a maturing sense how these
causes wouldn't would only be background
causes and and not operative at an
immediate level they are awkward
the way background causes are always
operative there waiting you know they're
part of the background which some
circumstance triggers okay now as far as
my authorization goes you may have
misunderstood me
I don't exactly what you mean but I mean
yes my authorization is extremely
dangerous it's hazardous to human life
but its economic role is primarily I
mean everyone at MIT or don't know this
it pays their salaries its economic role
is as a cover for development of the
high-tech economy and yes that's a
background issue all the time if anybody
at MIT doesn't know this they haven't
looked at their Patriot
thank you for your colleagues just first
like to say that it's obvious from the
turnout in the in the overflow room
several overflow rooms apparently also
how what what how much hunger there is
for this kind of alternative an
opportunity to have this kind of
alternative discussion of these issues
to support what you said earlier about
public opinion referencing articles in
the Wall Street Journal somebody from
the State Department Bureau of
intelligence and research earlier today
talked about how the leak on October 1st
about the US policy regarding
recognizing a palestinian state and then
Bush's comments on October 2nd
anticipating some statement sometime in
the future on the so-called vision that
for a Palestinian state actually one of
the sources of that was telling that is
being done even though they're not
democratic countries that there is
apparently extensive polling going on in
Arab countries I guess in particular
indicating the overwhelming public
opinion turning against the United
States in that region because of
possibly what's happening to the
Palestinians
okay I'm referring to what
the State Department has to take polls
to discover this but anybody who knows a
thing about the region has known that
all the time right just some additional
support for that my question has to do
is what I think is still unanswered and
in the minds of many of us even from
what what what you've said about it and
that is when you talked about finding
the perpetrators and allowing them to
trial or that's an acceptable
substitution would be bringing them to
justice and I think there are really
serious questions about how much
evidence there ever you know reasonable
standard of evidence in a situation like
this it actually is and I would like him
specifically the pose address and I
would guess you've read the article that
Richard Falk wrote in the October 29th
issue of the nation where he argues for
that this is a case of a just war if
there is a case for a just war since the
Second World War this would be it and he
argues for the emetic ends and Lebanon
limited means totally vacuous I mean if
you want to if you want to find these
nice words hit locate a personal friend
of mine an old personal friend I just
didn't understand what he was saying if
you if there are somebody carried it out
okay if you can't find out who did it
you can't punish anybody that's just a
fact
you can't find out who did it you can't
punish any and you certainly do not
reach justice by carrying out activities
which are aimed at hundreds of thousands
maybe millions of people who had nothing
to do with it and they're the ones who
are being attacked at this minute okay
that's as an undo just war I mean if you
cannot if evidence can be found that
supposedly don't find the perpetrators
and you have a really solid case against
them well then problems arise
for example the problems that Nicaragua
faced in a much more serious terrorist
war remember you know what happened on
September 11th is bad enough but killing
tens of thousands of people in a poor
country and practically wiping it out or
doing what Time magazine in the New York
Times were so happy about in their own
words that's worse and they know the
perpetrators were no secret and they had
a judgment against them from the highest
judicial body namely the World Court and
they could have had a Security Council
resolution if the perpetrator hadn't be
towed it and yes they couldn't do
anything about it
it's not easy to bring perpetrators to
justice I mentioned another case Haiti
they cannot bring American stunts to
justice and remember it's only talking
about four or five thousand black people
right and that's it by comparative to
the United States that's hundreds of
thousands of people killed but they
can't do anything about it and they
can't do anything about it not because
of an abstract entity called America but
because people like us aren't doing
anything about it don't put the blame
anywhere else let's look in the mirror
you know we want an honorable constant
brought to justice we can do something
about it we could have done it years ago
I and yes if we don't do it they'll
never be able to handle it they're
running up against a much bigger force
if the United States could have had any
substantial evidence they against Osama
bin Laden they would have him in their
hands right now I mean there's you know
I don't see any reason to doubt I mean
the Taliban maybe you know think
anything you like about them I mean the
worst criminal since you know it alone
or whatever you like there's every
reason to believe that they're quite
sincere and not wanting to be bombed to
smithereens and if they could prevent
that by handing over bin Laden probably
do it just like they've offered but
their request that there be some
evidence is not an unreasonable request
you don't think that you don't think
I don't know if it's a ruse there's one
way to find out you know it's exactly
one way to find out and that is to try
it now obviously the United States
doesn't think it's a ruse otherwise they
would try it and when they see well
they're not handing them over okay then
you proceed but they're not take that
chance
no no do they not want to take the
chance but the government has a deeper
principle the one that I mentioned we do
not need author a governor our fellate
does not not authorization because that
make ins its power if you have to have
authorization from someone you want or
not
you know powerful enough to do anything
you choose the same reason why the Mafia
Don does not run a court order suppose
some mafia doing isn't being paid by a
you know some guy a grocer or something
here's ago after a court order to get
the money he doesn't want he wants to
send his goons in to beat him to a pulp
you know that's called credibility and
this and it happens that that's the way
States operates some of them can get
away with it the more powerful ones most
of them can't get away with it they
maybe they'd like to but Luxembourg
can't handle you know or Andorra but
countries like the United States can
unless we stop them and the only place
that a powerful state can be stopped is
within so yes there are problems in
bringing them to justice but I don't
think the u.s. wants to for the reasons
that I mentioned for then they probably
don't have evidence for another thing if
he is brought the trial it's going to
open up all sorts of questions that they
certainly do not want opened like the
kind that I mentioned so yeah there are
problems and other countries have faced
them very hard problems like they can't
do it if it's the US was carrying out
the terror or you know who's
safeguarding the terrorists know there's
nothing they can do we can do it but
Haiti and Nicaragua can
but the United States is not going to
have those impediments in some way on
the Palestinian state business don't I
think we should be a little cautious
here
I mean calling something a state is
actually nothing I'm in South Africa for
example in the worst days was the
knotted the world to recognize the
states that it had set up like Tron sky
and there were states you know had their
own presidents and armies and everything
else and so the bantha stands the
homeland in South Africa was trying to
get the world to recognize him no one
would do it properly the first if you
really want to know the truth the first
government in Israel that was willing to
officially consider a Palestinian state
was the Netanyahu government most
reactionary war its Minister of
Information door a gold I think is an
American judging by his accident he had
an interview with someone he said look
if they want a state will allow him to
call it a state and then he said they
can call it chop chicken if they like
you know call it whatever they want to
call it a state okay as long as we
control it and its advantage then they
can call it a state the bush proposals
were not taken seriously by anyone even
the articles that reported them you
didn't have to wait for leaks if you
made the way to read the newspapers say
the New York Times always is beginning
from the end of the column you know
beginning from the end of the column on
the continuation page there you may
learn something the first couple of
paragraphs you get the what's given to
the editorial writers and the
propagandists and so on if it's an
honest journalist toward the end of the
column they'll say something usually on
the continuation page and that was true
in this case a lot of Hull up a little
about the Palin Bush you're talking
about a Palestinian state and go into
the continuation page they start quoting
high officials and this and that and
they say well look we're not gonna go as
far as Clinton did certainly and where
Clinton winning know we're here
is called the magnanimous and wonderful
but as soon as you look at a map you
knew that isn't true
I suppose that's one of the reasons that
maps were never published try to find
one the of the proposals and in the
region everybody knows including the
Israeli press but they said that knowing
I'm gonna go that for it well you know
maybe they'll change who knows they
don't have to take polls to find that
out they but the change is not so simple
I mean every year it gets harder you
know it was hard ten years ago it's much
harder five years ago it was harder
still harder a year ago it's still
harder now and the reason is that the
settlement and integration of the
occupied territories and the takeover of
their resources continues who's paying
for it you and me in one or another way
we're indirectly paying for it there's
you know the US every time Israel
assassinate someone there's a mild tap
on the wrist
dozens of assassinations so far have
they done it I mean when they
assassinate somebody by helicopters as
they do regularly where are they getting
the helicopters they don't produce
helicopters that's one of the advanced
military system but they don't produce
helicopters we didn't helicopters know I
am what they're gonna do it and then as
soon as the helicopter tacular us
helicopters began to attack civilian
compounds last October October first and
second there's no fire you know it's
just attacking civilian targets doing
dozens of people instantly Clinton
arranged for the biggest shipment of
Telecasters in the decade to Israel
October 3rd couldn't get in pressing the
United States to report it
not not that they weren't efforts that
were I was involved in them than others
that women reported what had happened
you know reading the Israeli press if
you want or the international military
press yeah that happened the Bush
administration sent no attack
helicopters more advanced ones the ones
that are being used to murder people
like the ones who killed Wally Mustafa
the leading the most important political
leader killed assassinated and that was
the mean everybody knew at that time
there's going to be revenge and
yesterday there was they killed in
Israeli right-wing parliamentarian in
revenge but who sent the helicopter to
kill the political leader in the first
place well we did all right so yeah as
long as that goes on the cycle of
violence we're going the u.s. knows
exactly how to maybe not to stop it but
certainly mitigated and lessen it in all
sorts of ways but they're not under
internal pressure to do it and for their
own reasons they don't want to do the
vacuous this of that definition how
terrorism can be defined depending on
which side you are on as either freedom
fighting as Reagan did or as destroying
a country as the Nicaraguans did in that
instance or etc and then you and one
thing I found implied and everything you
were saying is the notion of peace as
possibly also being a another vacuous
concept that we cling to and define
subjectively for all purposes as it can
be if conscience or trying to become no
more than unit conscience with the
intellectual understanding what's going
on now how can you well there are a lot
of peace peace demonstrations in
Washington DC recently and as a person
of conscience understands concern
understands issues who is difficult to
separate the vacuous needs of the nation
of peace that is being that's used on
both sides in order to achieve goals or
they're unrelated to what look what just
happened and the notions of terrorism
and the man of conscious pretty do
understanding how what would you do with
you were president okay if you're a bush
right now well if I was
design before I get tried by a criminal
court but the CI if I if I'm gave that
impression I wasn't being clear I don't
think these are vacuous concepts and I
don't think they're just subjective I
think they're very clear reasonably
clear concepts no not clear like quantum
physics but reasonably clear okay
international law is reasonably clear
for example when the World Court reached
its decision condemning the United
States for international terrorism it
had good grounds and a solid argument
runs through hundreds of pages if you
read it the u.s. knew that it was a
solid argument that's why the u.s.
refused to accept the jurisdiction of
the court and yes that was pretty clear
wasn't vacuous same with terrorism if I
didn't make it clear let me say it now I
think the definition given in the US
Code and US Army manuals is the right
definition I've always accepted it the
definition that I quoted I think is
exactly the right definition okay it
doesn't answer every imaginable question
you know you can have a philosophy
seminar or you can make up cases or
doesn't deal with but in the real world
it covers almost everything
there's nothing subjective about it what
is the point is that it cannot be
accepted because of its consequences its
consequences tell us that we're doing
terrible things and therefore we don't
accept it I mean the Nazis weren't
carrying out counter-terror they were
carrying out terror I mean they called
it counter terror and the US military
agreed with them but for their own
reasons oh we don't have to accept that
it's not a vacuous objective concept
that's true you know if you're you're a
lawyer so you know better than I do I
mean the legal system does not apply
trivially to every situation that comes
up that's why judges have to think but
nevertheless it's a framework no
sometimes you think it's a wrong frame
or CLE changed the laws but it's a
framework and the same is true of
international law and the same is true
of terrorism and the same is true of
peace perhaps I overstated doing moral
relativism in your position but what I
was trying to get at was the
that the moral court other other UN
organizations or institutions that the
United States played a major role in
creating enhance have a major role in
shaping how they define the language the
discourse of justice if that's the case
and you see these institutions can't
hold up in the face of something that
affects United States or change their
stances in the face of what affects
United States then what would you do in
that situation if you oppress the United
States understanding you have a
political imperative to seek retribution
ci if I can restate your question let's
put it this nice to see if I get it
wrong suppose you're the president of
the leading terrorist state in the world
and the World Court condemns you for
terrorism and orders you to stop and the
Security Council tries to pass a
resolution calling on you to observe
international law and you veto it then
what do you do as president in the
United States
well you don't try to change the world
chord you don't try to change the UN you
stopped your terrorism okay so is that
what we should as students as students
is that what you would you want to ask
us to rally for now is that your sorry
is that your invitation to all of us
here to rally for them to stop specific
acts you want you figure out what you
think is there I'm not telling look I
think it's the wrong thing to do to come
to the plans that they are now
announcing is their plans they're their
assumptions or that what they're doing
may very well kill a couple million
innocent people in Afghanistan okay I
happen to think that's wrong if somebody
else think it's right okay I think it's
wrong terribly wrong in fact monstrous
and I think we to do something about it
thank you
