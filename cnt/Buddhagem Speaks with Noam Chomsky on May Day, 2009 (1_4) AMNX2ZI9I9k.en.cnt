happy made a dome it's a pleasure to be
here with you today
it is International Workers day and I
thought maybe most international workers
that everywhere else oh I think I have
it correct United States the one country
where nobody knows where did this yeah
that's why I think it's so important
that maybe talk a little bit affected
Ronald Reagan designated May 1st as what
he called law Day a day of jingoist
fanaticism like an extra twisting an
extra knife into the labor movement any
before that was it
loyalty loyalty do ya today of loyalty I
mean there is a day in celebration of
workers but that's Labor Day when you go
back to work yeah but I don't think
100,000 Americans would know that May
Day was a day of N is in most places a
day of support for American workers and
their struggle for an eight-hour day
yeah it's ironic considering that it all
started here I started here but then
became an International Day in support
of the American workers who were being
brutally subjected to brutal violence
and judicial punishment yeah that's
actually something I wanted to talk to
you about the well before we get into
that they were fighting for the
eight-hour workday and anarchists at
that time or the driving force of the
unions in Chicago and I thought maybe
you could talk a little bit about that
dichotomy that scene between reform and
revolution and anarchist certainly and
during the Haymarket affair realized the
importance of fighting for something
like the eight-hour work day with a
grander vision and because it's always
been true yeah I mean if you take a look
at I suppose the most venerable
anarchist journal in the world at least
in english-speaking world is freedom
which comes out of London but if you
look at its pages
a large percentage of it is dealing with
reformist programs sporting for workers
rights for human rights for decent pay
benefits and so on I mean there's no
contradiction there I mean you want to
if you're a serious revolutionary and
you really are looking for a not an
autocratic revolution but a popular one
which will move towards freedom and
democracy that you want to have an asset
of population who are implementing it
and carrying it out and solving problems
and so on and they're not going to do it
unless you they have discovered for
themselves that there are limits to
reform so sensible revolutionary will
try to push reform to the limits first
of all because it's helpful to people so
it's better to have an eight-hour day
than a 12-hour day and you want to do
things that are just an ordinary ethical
grounds sure you'll support them but
secondly on strategic grounds you have
to show that the system if it's true
maybe the system will collapse to reform
okay that's fine
but if it won't you have to reach the
point where it resists and there's
nothing left but to take things over
maybe by force that's basically
self-defense but unless people recognize
coercion as a form of self-defense
they're not going to take part in it at
least they shouldn't you learn to free
or I mean you know if you get to a point
where the existing institutions simply
will not bend to the popular will
eliminate the institutions I wonder if a
quote maybe see a little on the minds
that was American workers faced in
forming unions and Lucy Parsons in the
aftermath of Haymarket she she this is a
quote from her she said a reign of
terror swept over Chicago and they
organized bandits and conscience of
consciousness baganz of capital
suspended the only papers which would
give the side of those who they cram
into prison cells they have abated homes
of everyone who's ever known to have
raised a voice or sympathize with those
who have ought to say against the
present system of robbery and oppression
they have invaded their homes and
subjected them and their families to
indignities that must be seen to be
believed could you speak to the violence
of the American labor movement in
comparison to say our European
counterparts well what she described
continued and there was really
significant labor activism in the late
nineteenth century at some of the peak
achievements were in Homestead
Pennsylvania were which really became a
worker run town democratically worker
run town took over the beginning take
over mills and so on and the reaction
was brutal this is the famous pacifist
Andrew Carnegie took off on a trip to
Scotland and had his his manager Frick
call in first security forces the
private security forces Pinkertons in
the National Guard
they're just suppressive by violence and
it wasn't it was thirty forty years
before Homestead began to emerge from
anything but a company red run prisons
yeah famous mother jones tried to appear
there I think during the Second World
War
to just to speak just driven out of town
it was people were afraid to talk you
know reporters sitting it's like a
prison and in general the history of
American labor is extremely violent not
violence by the workers with violence by
this by the owners and the security
forces sometimes the state security
forces like national guards and
sometimes private security forces like
the Pinkertons in fact that went on
until the into the 1930s
I mean late 1930s workers were still
getting killed here nothing like that
was happening in Europe in fact the
right-wing European press was appalled
the violence of the repression of
working people in the United States the
right-wing press no London Times and
someone in fact by one of the worst
defenders was Woodrow Wilson great
idealist to launch to personally put the
leading labour leader Eugene Debs
was just jailed for the impertinence of
speaking to workers saying that they
should if they're called into the army
they should consider their
constitutional rights and went to jail
for that and in fact Wilson was so
vindictive that around 1920 when he did
declare an amnesty for the people who'd
been jailed for willingness to speak
freely during the war he made sure that
Debs wasn't released took Warren Harding
the ultra-right president followed him
to finally release Debs he was not only
the leading labor leader but he was a
presidential candidate you know major
figure but Wilson was extremely
vindictive and that read purged as it
was called which really followed the war
nothing to the war sent thousands of
drove thousands of people out of the
country anarchists activists and so on
and it was the harshest period of
repression in in American history worse
than much worse than McCarthy
and it went on I mean by the 1920 there
had been a very vibrant and lively labor
movement right through the late 19th
century but it was there were places
like homestead where was just crushed by
force and it was crushed and it arose
again during the First World War but
we'll some pretty much crushed by the
1920s it was almost going owners and
commentators were exalting about you
know the end of history capitalist
utopia David Montgomery main labor
historians as the book called the rise
and fall of the American labor movement
and the fall as in the 1920s was
essentially gone well during the 1930s
it revived and very significantly you
know it got to the point of sit down as
I said there was state violence and
honor violence but it got to the point
where the violence was no longer
effective and other techniques were
devised to try to suppress labor rights
and labor activism that's when what were
called scientific methods of control of
labor were devised scientific methods
were mostly propaganda the owners under
state recognized that violence has
reached its limits and workers were at
the point of almost taking over factors
so it sit-down strikes are which really
strikes the fear of God into the
ownership class because that's just one
step before picking over the factory and
they turned to these scientific methods
which are now a major industry the
standard technique was what was called
at first the Mohawk Valley formula which
is where it was tried first
the idea was to go into a town where
there was a strike brewing and spread
massive propaganda through the media you
know the churches and civic groups
whatever he could giving a picture of
what was called Americanism Americanism
is we all live in harmony we all work
together
there's the loyal worker carrying his
lunch pail was his wife preparing the
meals of the friendly banker very eager
to give everybody loans a good manager
working 2030 hours a day for the benefit
of the workers and we all live together
in harmony in America it's Americanism
then these Outsiders come in the Union
agitators and they're trying to disrupt
our harmony but a spread poison and you
know vilified people and so on and we
got to protect ourselves from the
outside agitators and that worked pretty
well
