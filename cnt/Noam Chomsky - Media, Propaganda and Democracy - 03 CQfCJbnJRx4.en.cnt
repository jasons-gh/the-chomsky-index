on ideas the 1988 Massey lectures about
media propaganda and democracy a series
of five talks 1-inch night this week
divided into 16 sections including
questions from a panel of distinguished
Canadian journalists the massive
lectures have been an annual event on
cbc radio for the past 27 years the
Massey lectures are commissioned by the
CBC to present original work by
prominent intellectuals and the social
sciences and the humanities the physical
sciences and literature the 1988 messy
lectures are given by lone Trump's key
institute professor in the Department of
linguistics and philosophy at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
Boston professor chomsky's work in
structural linguistics is world-renowned
and he's also very known for his
controversial books of political
criticism focusing especially on the
place of the United States in
international affairs last month
pantheon published his latest book
written with co-author Edward Herrmann
it's called manufacturing consent
professor Chomsky says that a primary
function of the mass media a system he
suggested more properly called elite
media is to mobilize public support for
the special interests that dominate the
government and the private sector this
views in contrast to the common
assumption that the media act
independently of power elites and are
committed to discovering and reporting
the truth professor Chomsky has
demonstrated by assembling a massive
data from the mainstream print and
electronic press but the common
assumption is wrong but the mass media
in fact constitute a propaganda system
devoted to convey what Reinhold Niebuhr
called necessary illusions about the
world devised by the intellectual elites
without these necessary illusions
there's a danger that democracy will
function altogether too
well that there will be in the words of
the trilateral commission a crisis of
democracy that will threaten elite power
and privilege one way to see how the
mass media function to support the
necessary illusions required by
governmental business elites is to
compare style and content of news
reports where the actions of official
friends and official enemies are
concerned professor Chomsky does that
tonight examining the treatment of
Israel an official friend of the United
States a literal hua an official enemy
in the US media which is also our main
source of information about
international affairs the 1988 messy
lectures part 8 Noam Chomsky fabrication
of necessary illusions for social
management is as old as history but in
the democratic system the necessary
illusions cannot be imposed by force
rather they must be instilled in the
public mind by more subtle means a
totalitarian state can be satisfied with
lesser degrees of allegiance to require
truths it is sufficient with people obey
what they think is a secondary concern
but in a democratic political order
there's always the danger that of
independent thought might be translated
into political action so it is important
to eliminate the threat at its root
debate cannot be stilled and indeed it
should not be stilled in a properly
functioning system of propaganda the
reason is that it has a system
reinforcing character if it is
constrained within proper balance
whereas essential is to set the bounds
firmly controversy may rage as long as
it adheres to the presuppositions that
define the elite consensus a matured
furthermore being
urged within these bounds that helps to
establish these doctrines as the very
condition of thinkable thought and it
reinforces the belief that freedom
reigns one crucial doctrine standard
throughout history is that the state is
adopting a defensive stance resisting
challenges to order into its noble
principles thus the United States is
invariably resisting aggression
sometimes what's called internal
aggression accordingly it's a logical
impossibility that anyone should oppose
us aggression that's a category that
cannot exist Westerners have no problem
in perceiving the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan as brutal aggression but the
US invasion of south vietnam in the
early 1960s cannot be perceived as such
true US forces were directly engaged in
large-scale bombing and defoliation in
an effort to drive the population into
concentration camps where they could be
as we put it protected from the enemy
whom it was conceded they willingly
support true a huge us expeditionary
force invaded and ravaged the country
and later its neighbors with the
explicit aim of destroying what was
clearly recognized to be the only mass
based political force and eliminating
the danger of political settlement that
was sought on all sides but throughout
we were resisting aggression and our
yearning for democracy throughout the
war there was no departure in the
mainstream from the doctrine that the
United States was defending South
Vietnam and wisely the doves came to
believe years later the doctrine remains
beyond challenge a most remarkable
demonstration of the effectiveness of
democratic systems of thought control
similarly in the case of Central America
today the United States is defending
free
in what are called the fledgling
democracies and restoring democracy to
Nicaragua we frame this view even at the
extreme of expressible dissent in the
elite media in a bitter condemnation of
the US attack on Nicaragua Atlantic
Monthly editor Jack Beatty writes that
democracy has been our goal in Nicaragua
and to reach it we have sponsored the
killing of thousands of Nicaraguans when
could hardly feel more consistent critic
of US policy in the corporate media then
colonists Tom wicker of the New York
Times he can use the application of the
Reagan doctrine to Nicaragua because in
his words the United States has no
historic or god-given right to bring
democracy to other nations critics
assumed without a second thought that a
union for democracy has indeed guided US
policy towards Nicaragua since July 1979
when our client somoza was overthrown
though admittedly we were not guided by
this policy before the miraculously and
curiously time transformation took place
Central America has an evident interest
in handing semesters to honor their
pledges to democratize so the editors of
the Washington Post admonish there's no
problem of ensuring democracy in the
us-backed terror states of Central
America firmly under military rule
behind the theorem civilian facade the
same editorial in The Washington Post
warns that from the incursions into
honduras in march 1988 it is pleading
what nicaragua's threats to Honduras or
the references to military operations in
Northern Nick
agua in which Nicaraguan forces in hot
pursuit of contra invaders penetrated a
few kilometers into areas of Honduras
that had long been ceded to the
countries in the United States these
actions elicited renewed outrage over
the threat of the Sandinistas to
overwhelm their neighbors in the
interests of their Soviet Minister this
heartfelt concern over the sanctity of
borders is perhaps somewhat tainted by
the curious conception of a border is a
kind of a one-way more so the sanctity
of a border is not violated by us supply
flights to its proxy forces who have
entered Nicaragua from their Honduran
basis but putting aside these matters we
can assess the seriousness of the
concern by turning to the results of a
controlled experiment that history
obligingly constructed just as the free
press was consumed with rage over this
latest proof of the aggressiveness of
the violent communist totalitarians and
Central America with major stories and
angry commentary our client State of
Israel launched another series of its
periodic operations in Lebanon these
operations were north of the sector of
southern Lebanon that Israel has
virtually next as a security zone
integrating the area with Israel's
economy and compelling its 200,000
Lebanese inhabitants to provide soldiers
for the south Lebanese army an Israeli
mercenary force as the Israeli press
observes the Israeli operations included
bombing of Palestinian refugee camps and
Lebanese towns and villages with
large-scale destruction dozens of people
killed and many wounded including many
civilians all of this was barely
reported and there was no noticeable
reaction the only rational conclusion is
that the media outrage over the far less
serious and were justified Nicaraguan
incursion was entirely unprincipled near
fraud the absence of comment or even
serious reporting of the Israeli actions
in Lebanon is perhaps understandable
these operations were after all rather
muted by Israeli standards they do not
compare with the murderous Iron Fist
operations in Lebanon in 1985 or the
bombing of villages in the Bekaa Valley
a year earlier with 100 killed and 400
wounded mostly civilians including 150
children and a bombed-out schoolhouse in
one raid these were reported but without
affecting the elevated status of Israel
this tiny nation symbol of human decency
as the editors of the New York Times
described it just at the height of the
repression of the current Palestinian
uprising with beatings killings gassing
and collective punishment it is a
country that cares for human life in the
ignoring words of the Washington Post
editors in the wake of the Iron Fist
atrocities the fact that Israel
maintains a security zone in southern
Lebanon controlled by terrorists
mercenary army backed by Israeli night
also passes without notice and the same
is true of Israel's regular practice of
hijacking and piracy and international
waters and other actions that are rarely
even reported if Soviet Jews were to
suffer the treatment meted out regularly
to Arabs or if some official enemy such
as Nicaragua were to impose repressive
measures approaching the Israeli
standard the outcry would be deafening
during Israel's March 1988 operations in
Lebanon there was no issue of hot
pursuit Israel is not an impoverished
country attempting to survive the
terrorist attack of a superpower aunt
Letha economic warfare but Israel is a
u.s. client and therefore it inherits
the right of aggression Nicaragua in
contrast is denied
I'd even to drive attacking forces out
of its own territory this is on the
tacit assumption that no state has the
right to defend itself from us attack
another crucial doctrine that underlies
responsible debate it's remarkable to
see how deeply this doctrine is
entrenched to site mean striking example
nothing arouses greater hysteria in the
United States and reports that
Nicaragua's planning to obtain MIG
fighters when such reports were floated
by the Reagan Heights to eliminate the
danger of honest reporting of the
Nicaraguan elections in November 1984
even outspoken gloves warned that the
United States would have to burn
Nicaragua to destroy the invented makes
the reason is that they're also capable
against the United States a dire threat
to our security as Massachusetts Senator
Paul Tsongas a noted of put it at the
time another propaganda coup of December
1987 assuming the list of defector was
presented with elaborate accompanying
fanfare in the media he produced a
series of revelations about sandanista
intentions the most sting of which was
that Nicaragua was hoping to obtain jet
teams to defend its territory from us
attack plainly an intolerable outrage it
is of course well understood that
Nicaragua had no other way to prevent
the CIA from supplying the forces it
directs with in Nicaragua or to
interfere with the surveillance flights
by US aircraft that provide these forces
with up-to-the-minute intelligence on
Nicaraguan troop deployments so that
they can safely attack soft targets and
accordance with Pentagon and State
Department directives the logic is clear
Nicaragua has no right of self-defense
it is intolerable tantamount to
aggression for Nicaragua to interfere
with us violence and terror by
attempting to defend its airspace or by
attacking the US proxy forces for the
same reason the report by the same
defector that Nicaragua
intended to reduce its military forces
while providing light arms to the
population for defense against possible
US invasion elicited further outrage as
it was transmitted by the Free Press
into a threat to conquer the hemisphere
we might ask why Nicaragua is so intent
on obtaining Soviet planes why not
French Mirage Jets instead in fact the
same ministers would be quite happy to
obtain jet interceptors from France and
quite openly say so they cannot because
US pressure has blocked supply from any
non-communist source all of this is
unreported because it would give the
game away a corollary to the principle
that official enemies do not have the
right of self-defense is that if
Nicaragua attacks contra forces within
its own territory the United States
plainly has the right to provide
military aid to its proxies the bird of
in event on assistance for the
Nicaraguan resistance voted by the
Senate in August 1988 with the effusive
support of leading doves permits
military aid to the proxy forces within
nicaragua in the event of an unprovoked
attack against the countries or a
continued unacceptable level of military
assistance by Soviet bloc countries all
other sources having been barred and
Washington of course being the judge of
what is acceptable the August fifth
Senate debate on the bird amendment
games heightened significance from its
timing three days earlier the Contras
had attacked the crowded passenger
vessel mission of peace after allowing
an army patrol boat to pass by they had
killed two people and wounded 27 all
civilians including a Baptist minister
from New Jersey a member of a u.s.
religious delegation the Senate dogs who
bitterly condemned the Sandinistas made
no mention of this event perhaps they
had missed the tiny notice it received
the day before in the New York Times
tacked on to a column reporting their
deliberations there was no subsequent
commentary for logic is again clear
if the Sandinistas seek to root out the
us-run terrorists who carried out this
atrocity that proves that they're
communists totalitarians and we are
entitled to send military as well as
so-called humanitarian aid to the
resistance so that they can pursue their
tasks more effectively the general
outlines of US policy are presented in a
lucid manner by a cutter administration
latin-american specialist Robert pastor
who is actually at the dovish extreme of
the political and ideological spectrum
he explains that the United States
encoding that the United States did not
want to control nicaragua or other
nations in the region but it also did
not want to allow developments to get
out of control it wanted Nicaraguans to
act independently except when doing so
would affect us interests adversely in
short Nicaragua should be free to do
what we determined to be right in proper
and Nicaragua should achieve
self-determination in the manner that
the United States defines as appropriate
all ideas you're listening to the 1988
messy lectures by low Chomsky part line
the bounds of expressible in the first
lecture you mentioned some of the ways
of approaching the study of the media
and evaluating models of media
performance one appropriate method is to
consider the spectrum of opinion that is
allowed expression according to the
propaganda model one would expect the
spectrum to be bounded by the 8-week
consensus while encouraging tactical
debate within it consider US policy with
regard to Nicaragua that's probably
elicited more controversy and
impassioned rhetoric than any other
single topic during the past several
years there is debate between the Hawks
on the one side and the dogs and the
other the position of the Hawks is
expressed by a declaration of the State
and Defense Department on international
human rights day in December 1986 they
asserted that in the American continent
there is no regime more barbaric and
bloody new regime that violates human
rights in a manner more constant and
preeminent than the sonesta regime
similar sentiments are widely voiced in
the media and the political system and
follows that we should support the
Democratic resistance to communist
terror at the other extreme the doves
generally agree that we should dismiss
the World Court the United Nations and
other hostile forms as they're called
the pan dirt the Communists and
pathological third-world
anti-americanism the doves offer their
support for the noble objective of the
Reagan administration to somehow
democratize Nicaragua but they feel that
the Contras are Nate the instrument that
will achieve that objective I've been
courting Representative Michael Barnes
who was one of the most outspoken
critics of the Contra option a leading
Senate of Alan Cranston recognizes that
the Contra effort is woefully inadequate
to achieve democracy in Nicaragua in his
words so we should find other means to
isolate the reprehensible government in
Managua and leave it to fester in its
own juices Media dubs observe that mr.
Reagan's policy of supporting the
country's as a clear failure so we
should acquiesce in some negotiated
regional settlement that would be
enforced by nicaragua's neighbors that's
time liquor of the New York Times
expressing the same thought the editors
of the Washington Post see the country's
as an imperfect instrument so we must
find other means to fit Nicaragua back
into a Central American mode and impose
conduct by a regional standard other
doves feel that we should need to
quickly reject the State Department
argument that agricultural cooperatives
or legitimate targets for
counter-attacks the reason reporting is
that in a Marxist Society geared for war
there are no clear line separating
officials soldiers and civilians what is
required is careful cost-benefit
analysis of the termination of the
amount of blood and misery that will be
courting and the likelihood that
democracy will emerge at the other end
those are the words of the Republic
editor michael kinsley neither he nor
the State Department explain why similar
arguments do will justify attacks by
uglydoll on Israeli kibbutz in which are
far better defended against an
incomparably lesser threat what is the
regional arrangements needn't be imposed
on our Salvadoran and guatemalan friends
who have slaughtered perhaps 150,000
people during this period or on our
clients in Honduras who kill fewer
outright but have left hundreds of
thousands to starve to death while the
country exports food for the profit of
agribusiness their countries already
conformed to the Central American mode
of repression exploitation and ruled by
privileged elements that accede to the
demands of us power what we call
democracy so even hideous atrocities or
of no account and they merit aid and
support with occasional expressions of
regret if the terror torture and
mutilation becomes invisible to ignore
by 1986 that control option was opposed
by eighty percent of American leaders
polls report the propaganda model would
therefore predict debate over Contra aid
that we're Union
the opposition to the Sandinistas to
test the hypothesis consider the period
of maximum intensity of debate over
Nicaragua policy the first three minutes
of 1986 my attention was focused on the
issue of contra eight during these
months the New York Times of the
Washington Post the two major national
newspapers they read more less than 85
opinion columns on the matter that
includes their regular colonists as
expected they were divided over country
eight but of the 85 columns all 85 were
critical of the Sandinistas the vast
majority harshly so thus one hundred
percent conformity was achieved on the
major issue it's not that more
sympathetic voices are lacking in the
mainstream there are many who would
easily qualify for admission to the
debate if they had the right things to
say this includes Latin American
scholars whose opinion pieces are
regularly rejected by the press or the
charitable development agency Oxfam with
long experience in the region which
found nicaragua's record to be
exceptional among the 76 developing
countries in which it works in the
commitment of the political leadership
to improving the condition of the people
and encouraging their active
participation in the development process
I'm quoting here in Axum report well
consider the finger of Costa Rican
democracy Jose figueres just that the
time we're speaking of early nineteen
eighty-six he had described himself in
an interview as pros and minista and
quite friendly toward the Sandinistas he
was an observer in the nineteen eighty
four elections and he said that the
two-to-one margin in favor of the
Sandinistas in these elections certainly
seemed to reflect what you find in the
streets figueres condemned where he call
Washington's incredible policies of
persecuting the Sandinistas and
Washington's efforts to undo Costa Rica
social institutions and to turn the
whole economy over to the local
oligarchy or at the US or European
companies of course as a dedicated
supporter of the United States he found
these efforts and his words no doubt
well-intentioned the United States he
said is turning most central americans
and two missionaries for its attack
against Nicaragua I've been familiar
with Nicaragua almond life he said and
never before have I seen as I do now a
Nicaraguan government that cares for its
people in another interview at the same
time he reiterated that for the first
time Nicaragua has a government that
cares for its people his words
commenting on a recent visit he said
that he found a surprising amount of
support for the government and what he
called an invaded country adding that
the United States should allow the
Sandinistas to finish what they started
in peace they deserve it such comments
as these lack ideological serviceability
the same is true we'll figure is a
statement that he understands why Allah
Prince Oh was closed having censored the
press himself when Costa Rica was under
attack by somoza in the 1950s hence
Central America's leading Democratic
figure must be censored out of the media
as he is though his name can still be
invoked for the anti sandanista crusade
thus New York Times Central America
correspondent James annoying in one of
his indecent minister diatribes refers
to figures as the man who is widely
considered the father of Costa Rican
democracy but he does not tell us nor
would he or his colleagues ever tell us
what figueres has to say about the
Sandinistas the front pages of the New
York Times present a picture of
Nicaragua as seen through the aisles of
their reporter James the line as he
briefly passed through a brutal and
repressive state under one part
rule with crowds of pot-bellied
merchants in the streets state security
agents ubiquitous the army everywhere
growing support for the peasant army
resisting sandanista oppression and the
population reduced to bitterness and
apathy that's his description though see
how they are resisting a foreign attack
under which any other state in the
region and most elsewhere would have
quickly crumbled the Europeans does not
present the picture that was seen by the
CIA appointed press spokesman for the
country's Edgar tomorrow a three-week
visit at the same time speaking to
dozens of people in the streets after a
semanas to Raleigh he found them in his
words though we're very politically
educated very committed they thought for
themselves they were there because they
wanted to be there the days are gone
when a dictator can get up and her own
people what I have seen here he said is
very very positive people are walking on
their own two feet regaining the dignity
and nationalism that they had lost none
derson versa he saw very little
militarization and a deep sense of
equality what he called one of the
accomplishments of the revolution I
didn't see people who he he said most
people work very healthy strong and
alive and he saw a few beggars unlike
hundreds or even in the city streets of
the United States he added the
opposition he described as the old
oligarchy reliant on the United States
the war has led to a sense of
nationalism and patriotism on the part
of the youth who are drafted the
Sandinistas continue to be a People's
Party with commitment and goals that
inspire so many people there are
Nicaraguan nationalists revolutionaries
who want a more
Italian model to improve the lives of
the majority the elections were good the
government is legitimate and we should
try to change from inside I've just been
quoting Chamorros actual words from an
interview that appeared in any tiny and
obscure journal and tomorrow himself
points out that after he left the
Contras he found media access difficult
although when he was the spokesman it
was quite simple the general reading
public does not receive a range of
perception such as these but only one
the one that records with the needs of a
mac and power a year after these visits
by Lemoine and tomorrow severe
malnutrition began to appear in Managua
and parts of the countryside as US
terror and economic warfare continued to
take their bitter toll in a pathetically
poor country that is utterly dependent
on economic relations with the United
States for obvious historical and
geopolitical reasons George shorts
Elliott Abrams and their cohorts may not
have overthrown the government that they
can take pride in having vanquished the
programs of development preventive
medical care and welfare they can take
pride in a notable increase in dying
infants epidemics and other normal
features of the Central American node to
which Nicaragua is to be restored by us
benevolence the propaganda system they
cover their tracks today but history
will render a different judgment now
let's return now to the 85 columns in
the Washington Post in the New York
Times at the peak period of contra
debate still more interesting than the
uniform hostility to the Sandinistas
with the choice of topics there are two
very striking differences between the
Sandinistas and the u.s. favorites who
adhere to regional standards the first
of these is that the cinnamon East is
whatever their sins had not conducted
campaigns
slaughter torture mutilation and general
terror to traumatize the population in
the 85 columns there is not one phrase
referring to this matter the second
major difference between Wasilla
ministers in the u.s. class is that the
scene meniscus had diverted resources to
the poor majority and had attempted
measures of meaningful social reform in
fact they had done so quite successfully
until US economic and military warfare
succeeded in reversing the unwelcome
improvement in health and welfare
standards literacy and development these
facts merit to passing phrases in 85
columns one in a bitter condemnation of
what's called the generally appalling
leadership in this repressive society in
the 85 columns there is no mention at
all of sending this to efforts to
maintain a neutralist posture for
example there is no mention of the fact
that at the time of the US embargo that
has virtually wiped out private business
and reduced the economy to bear survival
Nicaraguan trade with the Soviet bloc
was about twenty percent of total trade
that's well below the figure for Europe
and most of the third world the fact is
inconsistent with what time map another
sample of opinion in the media a year
later in the first six months of 1987
the same two generals the New York Times
in the washington post when 61 columns
and editorials relevant to US policy in
nicaragua of these 13 said nothing about
the Sandinistas of the 48 that expressed
an opinion 46 were anti sandanista again
most of them bit early so of the two
columns that expressed some sympathy for
the Sandinistas one was by Nicaraguan
ambassador Carlos tenormin the other was
by dr. Kevin Cahill he is the director
of the tropical disease center atlanta
Hill Hospital in New York the only name
Nicaraguan commentator in the sample who
could draw upon personal experience in
Nicaragua and elsewhere in the third
world his column was also the only one
that took note of the successful
Nicaraguan health and literacy measures
and what he called the struggle against
oppression and corruption waged under
conditions of extreme adversity imposed
by us terror and economic warfare
Cahills is also the one of the two
contributions among 61 that mentioned
the World Court decision and
international law once again in these 61
columns there is not a single phrase
referring to the fact that unlike the
u.s. clients and the so-called fledgling
democracies the Sandinistas had not
launched a campaign of terror and
slaughter to traumatize their
populations the totalitarian Sandinistas
are contrasted with the struggling
democracies of Central America the
imperfect but working democracy of
Guatemala and Honduras and El Salvador
which although under communist guerrilla
siege is an imperfect democracy but at
democracy with an elected government
notice that it is unlike Nicaragua where
there were no elections so Washington
has decreed well after the 1984
elections that established democracy in
El Salvador to the applause of the free
press the human rights organization
Socorro juridical which operates under
the protection of the archdiocese of san
salvador observed that the continuing
terror is still conducted by the scene
members of the armed forces who enjoy
official approval and are adequately
trained to carry out these acts of
collective suffering saw the door in
society affected by terror and panic a
result of the persistent violation of
basic human rights shows the following
traits they said collective intimidation
and generalized fear on the one hand and
on the other the internalized acceptance
of the terror because of the daily and
use of violent means in general society
accepts the frequent appearance of
tortured bodies because basic rights
including the right to life have
absolutely no overriding value for
society these comments also apply to the
supervisors of these operations in
Washington fact was underscored by
George Shultz in one of his limitations
on terrorism a talk that he delivered at
the very moment of the u.s. bombing of
Libya in el salvador he declared the
results or something all Americans can
be proud of at least all Americans who
enjoy the sight of tortured bodies
starving children terror and panic and
generalized fear and James the line of
the New York Times concludes that
American support for elected governments
in el salvador guatemala and honduras
has been a relative success which is no
doubt true by some standards the problem
throughout according to the media is to
find some way to compel nicaragua to
rein in its revolutionary army as
democratic senator terry sanford demands
an army that is illegitimately rampaging
inside nicaragua when it seeks to defend
the country from us attack apart from
regular unsupported allegations of
sendin is to aid to the Salvadoran
guerillas the proclaimed basis for the
fears of sandanista aggression is
another coup of the State Department
propaganda services in there what they
called their operation truth this is
based upon a speech in which commandante
Tomas Jorge expressed his hopes that
Nicaragua would be an example that
others would follow he explained that
Nicaragua cannot export our revolution
but can only export our example while
the people themselves of these countries
must make their own revolutions in this
sense he said the Nicaraguan Revolution
transcends and national boundaries in a
conscious and purposeful fraud
State Department psychological warfare
operations converted these words into
the threat of military conquest in
pursuit of a revolution without borders
that phrase was used as the title of the
pathetic September 1985 State Department
white paper on alleged Nicaraguan
aggression and it's constantly been used
since often accompanied by the claim
that this is a sunless tan line come as
George Shultz want Congress the same
fabrication served as the climax for a
Reagan successful effort to obtain a
hundred million dollars from Congress
for the proxy army just as the World
Court called upon the United States to
terminate its aggression and the phrase
remains a media staple in news columns
and commentary the hoax was publicly
exposed at once but this did not deter
media agitprop in service of the worthy
project of demonizing the sandanista
government and turning it into a real
enemy and threat in the minds of the
American people as a Reagan
administration official phrased the goal
more are these exercises deterred by the
evident absurdity of the idea that
Nicaragua could pose a threat of
aggression while the United States
stands by and helpless impotence adiemus
is a most impressive demonstration of
what can be achieved by immobilized
independent press there was to be sure a
basis for the perception that Nicaragua
poses a threat as oxfam observed
Nicaragua posed the threat of a good
example like arevalo and our veins in
Guatemala I am they in Chile and many
others Nicaragua was perceived as a
rotten apple that might infect the
barrel a virus that might infect others
a cancer that might spread this is the
terminology that is constantly used by
planners when we contemplate the dread
prospect of independent development
geared to domestic needs the real fear
was expressed by Secretary of State
Schultz in watch 1986 he warned
that if the Sandinistas succeed in
consolidating their power then all the
countries in Latin America who all face
serious internal economic problems will
see radical forces emboldened to exploit
these problems his words it is therefore
necessary to destroy the virus and
inoculate the surrounding regions by
terror that's a persistent feature of
u.s. foreign policy but these truths to
live far beyond expression in the media
the range of opinion that is permitted
expression and the way the news is
filtered and adjusted ensures that
public opinion will not stray from
proper bounds at least among the elite
groups that count the 1988 messy
lectures continue tomorrow night on
ideas presented by Noam Chomsky several
weeks ago professor Chomsky presented
some of the material in these lectures
to an audience at Ryerson Polytechnical
Institute in Toronto after which he was
questioned by a panel of Canadian
journalists you hear parts of that panel
discussion each night this week this is
david from associate editor of saturday
night magazine professor Chomsky you
argue for a model of the media in which
the media argue for and defend the
established institutions of society and
any deviation from that defense is is
dismissed or even even suppressed so
that views that are just descent from
the overwhelming consensus that
characterizes our society cannot get to
hear it now here you are tonight in a
large lecture hall Canada's most
prestigious journalism school speaking
to an audience of journalists who are
hearing your marks with apparent
approbation your marks being broadcast
on the government-owned radio network as
part of the most prestigious lecture
series on that network how'd that happen
recall that what I said was that this is
a very good first approximation to the
description of a complex social
institution now i remember that i
mentioned i'm afraid this we mark may
sound a little insulting but let me try
to say it without sounding that way i
specifically mentioned that in the
united states for example the i wasn't
talking about say listener supported
radio in a small community in fact as
you get away from the elite centers that
matter things open up okay now the fact
of the matter is that Canada is a much
more open society in this respect in the
United States and the reason is it's
less important this generalizes I can
talk this way in Belgium you know in
Israel in Latin America I can't talk to
I mean I can talk this way in the United
States but not on national radio and
television because it's just too
important what people think about
international affairs in Canada just
doesn't matter that much to establish
power if it did matter that much I
Canada would close up to if CBC then is
just a small publicly funded station in
some small town look upon about
perspective why don't we turn to the CBC
person on stage here and Margaret daily
perhaps you can have a turn well I was
intrigued by the thesis of end up
particularly impressed by the volume of
surf actual documentation that I look
forward to reading this stuff in a long
version I guess the question that I want
to ask though is given that this
information is so given with this
information is a discussion evade all
out supposing people knew it and
obviously individuals do know what more
these intellectuals that before if
there's bust if you want to call them
that those kinds of people can assemble
all this information then what what does
it doesn't seem to make any difference
and why is that well I think it does
make a difference
I think it makes a lot of difference I
mentioned not entirely jocularly that if
a third world country today were to put
forth the American Constitution we call
it a reversion to none scizzum and I
mentioned that that's a sign of hope and
progress there has been moral progress
over 200 years there's also been
progress over 20 years 30 years and my
active life again I'm talking
mostly about the United States but it's
a different country than it was 20 or 30
years ago now elites are not different
well pretty much has indoctrinated as
they always were a leaker contrary to a
lot of necessary illusion a late groups
including liberal intellectual elites
did not oppose the Vietnam War they
supported the Vietnam War supported it
enthusiastically they began to turn
against it somewhat after Wall Street
turned against it and more or less for
the same reasons because it was to cost
with the the media were almost totally
closed the critics of the war but among
the general population this crisis of
democracy did take place and they
changed the society I think it led to a
probably I hope a permanent cultural
change outside the elite centers and the
United States it's just a different
country than it was 20 years ago in a
lot of respects everything from
interpersonal relations to treatment of
ethnic minorities to concern over
international affairs and so on you can
see it and the reason is because outside
of the outside of the while the major
institutions of indoctrination continue
on their natural course other modes of
interaction did develop and they remain
you know their informal they're they're
inefficient they may I mean I spend an
80 person I don't know some huge percent
of my time traveling around the country
giving talks well you know that's less
efficient than writing for a major
journal but people do this and
ultimately it makes a difference there
are solidarity groups there are all kind
of organizations and so on and them to
make a difference you can see it so
for example I mentioned the US attack
against South Vietnam in the early 1960s
you compare the early 1960s with the
1980s it's 20 years when ronald reagan
came into office he his administration
in my view intended to emulate john f
kennedy and lyndon johnson that they
their target with central america but
they came out with a white paper in
February 1981 right after they came into
office virtually a declaration of war
the Communists are taken over the world
we've got to go in there and stop them
it was a precursor to direct US military
intervention in Central America now what
happened what happened when incidents
got the whole story there was virtually
no criticism of the white paper when it
came out just enthusiastic support for
it however the general population didn't
because the population is not what it
was in the early sixties when John F
Kennedy started sending the American Air
Force to bomb South Vietnam on a regular
basis there was no protest you couldn't
get two people together in a living room
to talk about it it was and it didn't
have to be hidden either it was on the
front page of the newspapers nobody
cared we want Obama another country
great no let's go to the next thing when
Ronald Reagan's administration announced
ort of indicated that they might try to
turn to direct military intervention
there was a convulsion in the country
people started coming out of the
woodworks it ranged from a massive flow
of letters to Washington to
demonstrations to church groups getting
involved the whole array of protests
began to develop spontaneously without
any organization and structure the
reason is the country is just a lot
different well what happened what
happened is that the Reagan
administration backed off they in fact
told the media to cool the rhetoric to
cut back the inflammatory rhetoric they
were afraid that much more central
themes of their program would be
endangered after all remember that they
were trying to ram through a program
that the population was strongly opposed
to a domestic economic program they were
trying to ram through destruction of the
limited welfare measures that exist in
the United States a huge transfer of
sources from the port of the rich a
massive increase in state power and huge
public subsidy to the high technology
industry through the Pentagon system and
so on all of these things are contrary
to what the public wanted and they
didn't want any protest about them so
what they did was back off from there
inflammatory proclamations about Central
America and they went underground that's
what the ole and Contra hearings were
about the administration was driven
underground the domestic population
would not tolerate the activities that
they wanted to carry out and they
therefore had to turn to illegal
clandestine activities now the Reagan
administration was notorious for the
level of its clandestine activities and
clandestine activities are a pretty good
measure of popular dissidents if there
isn't any popular dissidence you don't
have to carry out clandestine activities
you can carry out overt international
terrorism and violence which is much
more efficient overt violence is much
more efficient than clandestine violence
for obvious reasons I mean for one thing
it's just more efficient to do for
another thing there isn't any risk that
will be exposed which all cause you know
a scandal and so on and so forth so the
and in fact the state was driven
underground by popular dissidents well
that's important no those those are I
think that's one of the many reflections
of the difference between the 1960s in
the 1980s I think there's and in fact
even the meteor different bad as they
are I mean as you can see I'm no great
enthusiast for the elite media but
they're better than other were 20 years
ago I mean the they're not as closed and
restricted and constrained as they were
20 years ago and that includes the elite
media so there are slow changes and I
think there is a slow move towards
general democratization much too slow
but not insignificant and
those are things that first of all one
can be somewhat hopeful about their it
also teaches you a lesson that means
there things you can do after all these
are our societies our societies like
Canada United States have one tremendous
virtue the state is very restrictive in
its capacity to use force against
citizens by comparative stats on zero
but by comparative standards it's low
and that means there's a great range of
options available people want to make
use of them and many do and it has it
makes a difference noam chomsky this has
been the third program in a series of
five this week presenting the 1988 CBC
messy lectures on media propaganda and
democracy we continue tomorrow Noam
Chomsky is Institute professor in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology his latest book written with
co-author Edward Herrmann is called
manufacturing consent it's published by
pantheon and it's in bookstores and
libraries now
