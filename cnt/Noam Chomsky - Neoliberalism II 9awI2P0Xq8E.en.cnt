what's called neoliberalism
is an attack on democracy and is an open attack
on democracy. it's not secret.
The goal is to minimize the state
and, if you minimize the state,
you're maximizing something else.
What is the thing that you're maximizing?
Well, private tyranny. The state is the arena
within which the public has some role,
at least in principle, in determining policy.
In the private sector, it has no role.
So, the more that the public arena is minimized,
and private power is maximized,
the less you have democracy.
Now personally,
in my view, the state is an illegitimate institution.
It should be dismantled,
but not as long as private power is there,
because that's much worse.
That's a system which is unaccountable to the public
and the main thrust of neoliberalism
is precisely that: is to restrict the arena
within which the public can make some difference.
[Question: "Then what is your suggestion?"]
My suggestion is to extend the public arena
and in the classic fashion
namely, as I said before, working people
should have control of the places in which they work.
Not private tyrants.
The people of the community should have control
of their communities, and they should interact
with one another; that increases the public sphere.
If the heavy concentration of private power is eliminated,
then, I think, moves toward dismantling
the entire state system are entirely legitimate--proper
But, you face what the world you are in right now.
Incidentally, these neoliberal moves
are not moves towards establishing a market system.
A private corporation is outside the market system.
If you look at world trade, about, say, the United States,
about half of US trade is not trade at all.
It's just transactions internal to a corporation,
run by a very visible hand
of which just happen to cross borders.
So, half of US exports to Mexico
don't even enter the Mexican economy.
They're just -- parts are being assembled
in the United States, transferred to Mexico,
to another branch of, say, the same Ford Motor Company,
it's called exports,
they come back to the United States, it's called imports.
That's not trade, that's mercantilism,
and that's a huge part of world trade
It's kinda corporate mercantilism in which
the market is functioning only at the margins
and functioning mostly to control people.
The ones who are running the world economy have
protected themselves very strongly from market discipline [unlike the poor].
In fact, if you look at the -- There's some good studies,
by good economists,
of transnational corporations and there's one major study
by two British economists of the top 100 transnational corporations
every one of them has benefited from the interventionist
policies of its home government
and 20 of the 100 have been saved from complete
collapse by state takeover and bailout
Over and above that, the corporation itself is out of the
market system - its internal transactions are centrally directed
- these are command economies
so you have -- The neoliberal system is an attack,
in my view, both on the market and on democracy.
