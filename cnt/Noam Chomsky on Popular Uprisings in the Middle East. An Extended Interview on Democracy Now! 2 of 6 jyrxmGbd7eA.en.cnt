right after 911 The Wall Street Journal
to its credit did a ran a poll in the
Muslim world not of the general
population of the kind of people they
they are interested in I think what they
called the money Muslims or some phrase
like that professionals directors of
multinational corporations people
bankers people deeply embedded in the
whole US dominated neoliberal project
they're so not what's called a day
American I was an interesting poll in
fact the results were very much like
those that were described in 1958 that
was tremendous there wasn't a campaign
of hatred against the US among these
people but there was tremendous
antagonism to US policies the reason and
the reasons were pretty much the same
the u.s. is blocking democracy and
development it's supporting dictators by
that time there were the salient issues
that some of which didn't exist in 1958
for example there was tremendous
opposition in these groups to the
murderous sanctions in Iraq which didn't
well as much tension here but they
certainly did in the region hundreds of
thousands of people were being killed
the civilian society was being destroyed
the dictator was being strengthened and
that did cause tremendous anger and of
course there was a great anger about a
us support for Israeli crimes atrocities
illegal takeover of occupied territories
and so on settlement programs those were
other issues which also limited extent
existed in 58 but not like nine
2001 so that in fact right now exactly
we have direct evidence about attitudes
of the Arab population I think I
mentioned this on an earlier broadcast
strikingly not reported but extremely
significant last August the brookings
institute released a major poll of Arab
opinion done by prestigious and
respected polling agencies one of they
do it regularly and the results were
extremely significant they revealed that
there is again still campaign of hatred
against the United States when asked
about threats to the region the ones
that were a pict Bible near unanimously
from were Israel in the United States
eighty-eight percent Israel about
seventy-seven percent the United States
regarded as the threats to the region of
course they asked about it ran ten
percent of the population thought he ran
was a threat in the list of respected
personalities Aragon was first I think
there were about ten no one neither
Obama or any other western figure was
even mentioned Saddam Hussein had higher
respect now this is quite striking
especially in the light of the WikiLeaks
revelations the the most the one that
won headlines and it was led to great
enthusiasm in euphoria was the
revelation wither accurate or not we
don't know but the claim at least by
diplomats that the Arab dictators were
supporting the US
in its confrontation with iran and fizzy
astok headlines about how Arab states
support the Arabs support the United
States that's very revealing what what
the commentators and the diplomats were
saying is that the Arab dictators
support us even though the population is
overwhelmingly opposed everything's fine
everything's under control it's quiet
there passive and the dictator support
us what could be a problem in fact Arab
opinion was so antagonistic to the
United States in this as revealed in
this poll that a majority of the Arab
population 57% actually thought the
region would be better off if Iran had
nuclear weapons nevertheless the
conclusion here and in England and the
continent was it's all wonderful the
dictator support us we can disregard the
population because they're quiet as long
as they're quiet who cares people don't
matter actually there's an analog of
that internal to the United States and
its of course same policy elsewhere in
the world all that reveals a contempt
for democracy and for public opinion
which is really profound and one has to
listen with jaws dropping when Obama and
the clip Iran talks about how of course
governments depend on the people our
policies exact opposite noam chomsky I
wanted to read to you what Robert Fisk
has written from the streets of Cairo
today Robert Vesco well-known reporter
from the independent of London he said
one of the blights of history will now
involve a US president who held out his
hand to the Islamic world and then
clenched his fist when it fought a
dictatorship and demanded democracy no
Chomsky your response
well Fisk's reporting as usual has been
inspiring phenomenal and yeah he's
exactly right and it is the old pattern
as I say goes back to 50 years right to
the air in Egypt in the region and it's
the same elsewhere as long as the
population is passive and obedient it
doesn't matter if there's a campaign of
hatred against us it doesn't matter if
they believe that our official enemy can
perhaps save them from our attacks in
fact nothing matters as long as the
dictator support us that's the view here
we should remember there's an analog
here it's not the same of course but the
pop the population in the United States
is angry frustrated full of fear
irrational hatred but and the folks not
far from you on Wall Street are just
doing fine they're the ones who created
the current crisis they're the ones who
are called upon the deal with it they're
coming out stronger and richer than ever
but everything's fine as long as the
populations passive if one-tenth of one
percent of the population is gaining
preponderant amount of the wealth it's
produced while for the rest there are 30
years of stagnation just fine as long as
everyone's quiet that's the scenario
that has been unfolding in the Middle
East as well and just as it did in
Central America and other domains
