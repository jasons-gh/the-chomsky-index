but one thing is it's grossly
misinterpreted and so it's worth
remembering that the early classical
liberals say Smith theme humble that
we're pre-capitalist later ones like
John Stuart Mill were basically Social
Democrat not classical liberal than many
much of its thinking but Social
Democratic and policies that he
advocated in fact one of the policies he
advocated whose workers self-management
I thought that was an ideal society
ought to move towards but the if you go
to the interpretations it's kind of
interesting so for example and I once
wrote a review of the the Bicentennial
scholarly edition of wealth of nations
put out by the University of Chicago
with an introduction by a Nobel laureate
Chicago economist George Stigler
practically everything he said about it
was wrong as obviously never looked at
the book and in fact it was so extreme
that even some of the most important
parts were not even in the index so for
example takes a division of labor
everyone is familiar with the early
paragraphs about the butcher and the
baker I wonder if elitism so on but when
Smith continues a couple hundred pages
later he sharply condemns division of
labor and says it's a kind of an
abomination that any civilized society
will have to overcome by government
intervention and the reason is goes
right back to the roots of classical
liberalism
the reason is that division of labor
will turn every human being into a
creature as stupid and ignorant as a
person can possibly be because of this
be repeating the same actions over and
over doesn't have a chance to exercise
his intelligence and reaches full
development so and that's the core of
classical liberalism well interestingly
that passage on division of labor didn't
even indexed in the scholarly edition so
if you look up the vision of Labor's not
there another interesting case is the
notion of invisible hand dodgy Smith
rarely used the phrase but the few times
when he did use it are interesting it's
used once and wealth of nations so it's
hard to miss and if you look at the
context in which it's used basically a
critique of contemporary neoliberalism I
mean what he points out is that he says
talk about England of Greece as if in
England the merchants and the
manufacturers that decided to invest
abroad and import from abroad they might
profit but the people of England would
suffer however he says their natural
inclination to
operate within their own country what's
called home country bias will lead them
as if by an invisible hand not to carry
out these actions and therefore things
will work out of England that's an
argument against neoliberalism that's
the one use of the phrase invisible hand
and wealth of nations they use it again
in his other major book moral sentiments
and what he says there is interesting he
says that the Ark is that even if you
have a cruel and vicious landlord who
takes all the land and so on
nevertheless his natural concern for the
happiness of other people will lead him
as if by an invisible hand to make sure
that the necessities of life are
distributed as equally as they would be
if there was an equal distribution in
the first place that's the second use of
Invisible Man exactly and of course
that's based on his conception shared
with David Hume and others that are core
element of human nature sympathy fact
the equal ocean so for Smith we have a
natural inclination to appreciate and
enjoy the happiness of others even if we
don't gain from it at all and he
contrasts that natural instinct which
what he calls the vile Maxim of the
Masters of mankind all for ourselves and
nothing for anyone else and he evidently
thinks that the benevolent element which
is the core of human nature will
overcome the impact
the vile Maxim those are his uses of
invisible hand and weak the one case by
case he's this is pre-capitalist
thinking now he wasn't entirely
pre-capitalist by any means so for
example if you look at Smith's
recommendations to the newly independent
to American colonies after during during
Revolutionary War he gave advice to the
colonies where it was now the United
States to as to what policies they
should follow and the policies he
advised are what are called sound
economics basically the Washington
consents neoclassical economics just
what's told of the third world today so
concentrate on what you're good at you
know with leaders both comparative
advantage for the colonies that produce
primary products that agriculture kind
of overlooked slavery but the parameter
products fish for agricultural products
and don't try to develop industrial
products because England as much
superior so everyone will gain if you
import advanced industry in this you
know but standards of the day was
advanced industrial projects from
England instead of producing your own
that will be a benefit beneficial to
everyone that's contemporary economics
well of course the colonies were
independent so they didn't have to
follow sound economics so they did
exactly the opposite what they did is
block British manufacturers with very
high tariffs necktie
arsenal world well into the 20th century
we're able to develop a textile industry
for stage and industrial revolution then
all the accessories to a textile
industry you know like making equipment
so later in the century of steel
industry the blocking superior British
steel and finally the u.s. developed
actually followed Britain's own course
that's we've written it developed by
radically violating sound economics and
in fact I generalized to every develops
the myths also urge the colonies not to
try to monopolize the agricultural
products that where they had a natural
advantage we was thinking of primarily
was cotton covers the oil of the early
Industrial Revolution and again that's
what sound economics is that the
colonies did the opposite so they first
did develop a huge cotton production for
slavery the most radical violation you
can imagine market principles and also
by conquering half America one of the
goals of the conquest of half of Mexico
to Texas what's known south southwest
and western United States was to try to
monopolize calm and the reason was very
straightforward the enemy in those days
was England England had a big military
force it was preventing the United
States from conquering Canada from
Concord Kimba them the idea was we the
take a look at the Jacksonian presidents
you know polka most has revolved in the
conquest of Mexico what they said
straight out is that if we can
monopolize cotton we can bring England
to earth to our fee will be able
overcome so if you take a look the
record they did exactly the opposite of
South
genomics prospered on the other hand say
takes a agent to go back to say the
early 19th century Egypt was touted in
the same not identical but it was rather
similar to the early United States and
its prospect it had a developmentalist
dictator mohamed ali he it had cotton
didn't have slaves but they had
you know put it developed that there was
rich agriculture that's why I fully in
Concord it in fact and it had the
conditions that could have led to an
industrial revolution but they had to
follow sound economics by force the
British simply announced straight out
that they were never going to allow
independent economic development in
eastern Mediterranean French cooperated
and so Egypt did followed the principles
of economics and Egypt as Egypt United
States as the united states that
generalizes worldwide
