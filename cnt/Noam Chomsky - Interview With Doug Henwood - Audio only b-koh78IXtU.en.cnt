this interview with noam chomsky was
recorded in october 16 2002 and
broadcast in october 17 on Doug henwood
show behind the news on WBAI New York
Noam Chomsky what do you read is the
motives of the bush war cry against a
rock is it oil is it gesture t Jake is a
domestic politics I think all are
involved anything involving that region
of the world we can be quite confident
that oil is a major factor it's been
understood for a long time that the that
by far the most abundant and easily
accessible energy resources in the world
oil resources are in the Persian Gulf
region and after the Second World War
the US was determined to take control
over them the State Department regarded
them as quoted the stupendous source of
strategic power and one of the greatest
material prizes in world history the
u.s. itself didn't need the oil in fact
didn't use it and North America was the
main producer up until around nineteen
seventy but it wanted control over and
the reasons have to do in part just with
the enormous profits that come but also
because and it isn't just the oil
companies it's also the return of
massive petrodollar flows to the United
States for lots of lots of different
ways but also because as they pointed
out it's the source of strategic power
it's a lever of world control it control
the energy resources you have a
tremendous influence over the world so
that's been true for a long time turning
the iraq it has the second largest oil
reserves in the world a lot of it is
unexplored so there may be even more
than people know to easily accessible
cheap it's been pretty clear for a long
time that the US would somehow or other
move to pursue the policies it has been
committed to for over 50 years namely
restoring that those resources back to
us control so they don't get wasted on
their own population but that the
profits flow to the right sort of people
like people around bush and that the
lever of world control is back in our
hands but that's a long-standing policy
it doesn't account for the timing of the
current drive to work and to look at the
timing i think their turn to the other
factors you mentioned primarily domestic
i think the first of all and this number
11 gave a pretext you know that there
was before that was hard to conjure up a
reason that would sell but after
September 11th you could provide very
flimsy but protects but at least maybe
you can sell them that's what the
propaganda systems trying to do
connecting it to the so-called war on
terror so there's a pretty most serious
people aside from the administration
Christopher Hitchens don't seem to find
much link between al-qaeda in Iraq it's
very unlikely that there's a link I mean
Saddam Hussein and bin Laden are both
monsters but they're very different
kinds of monsters I said I'm Hussein is
secular Osama bin Laden is a religious
fanatic I'm they've hated each other for
years in fact the one of the reasons I
saw bin Laden turned against the united
states around 1990 was that the US and
Saudi Arabia wouldn't allow him the
launch of jihad against the iraq scott
ritter pointed out recently and he's
probably right that if Saddam were to
give weapons of mass-destruction osama
the first target would probably be set
up you know anyhow no links have been
found and it's pretty unlikely not you
know they're both monsters the time so
there's a pretext September 11 and
there's also a reason the reason I think
has to do with I'm just imagine yourself
a republican party strategist you're
coming up to elections eight 2004 it's
hardly a secret that the Bush
administration is literally carrying out
a serious assault against population
these are recycled Reaganite mostly they
did pretty much what they did in the
early days of the Reagan administration
they drove the country into deep deficit
which has the good effect of undermining
social spending so Alan green skin pack
and shouldn't soberly talk about the
need for fiscal discipline with that
translates into is tax cuts and other
measures to benefit the extremely
wealthy and crumbs for the rest well
they don't want people in early two
thousand four when the election
campaigns going on they do not the last
thing they want is for people to be
asking of questions about you know how
do I take care of my elderly mother or
where's my pension or other you know
what's happening to the environment
which my children might survive or
where's my job and so on they don't want
those questions to be uppermost in fact
they're uppermost right now and as a
massive effort to suppress them by
turning the war and there's only one
standard technique for getting people
not to pay attention to what a hard line
right wing repressive regime is doing
and that's to terrorize you frighten
them you want them to be by two thousand
four you want them to be cheering the
grand leader who saved us from total
destruction or Acula slee and by then
we'll be off on the next campaign that's
just so standard it's hardly worth
mentioning it's the device that
instantly comes to mind to any political
leader who's trying to control the
population and they have a real need for
it because they are harming the
population seriously and I suspect that
that's the prime motive for the timing
the war has to be over the winter for
technical reasons and they don't want it
to be the winner of 2004 right in the
middle of the presidential campaign they
want a victory by then they want to be
able to say look we destroyed the
monster and save save the American
people from destruction and now we got
to go on to the next month and they also
having staked out at a so-called war on
terror as their prime commitment they
got out of victory
this could be one the plans are much
more ambitious if you look at what these
guys have been writing and saying for
years they have extremely ambitious
plans not only for reconstructing the
whole Middle East region but going on
beyond many of them want to go after
China China is a much much harder nut to
crack today after they possibly go after
China so it was Russia I mean there
within the administration i want to say
they're running the show but within that
group there are extremists jingoist
fanatics who say look we destroyed
russia we can destroy china in fact we
can take over the world by force if it's
not just my view incidentally you can
read it in very respectable mainstream
sources so take a look at the pathology
event well known respected analyst is a
senior associate of the Carnegie
Endowment he just read an article about
it in which he said the administer us is
becoming his words a menace to the world
because of the intent of the long-term
intent of these sectors which is not a
secret to rely on their overwhelming
military power to intimidate the rest of
the world and dominated that's pretty
much the message of the national
security strategy document that came out
and they're very serious they're also
regard to the Middle East there they're
very closely linked to the ultra
right-wing in Israel so people like
Richard Perle for example have been told
is called Darth Vader but wasn't press
corps uh who's a recycled Reaganite to
he's been he was writing position papers
for Benjamin Netanyahu who's to the
right of Harry L sharone they have an
idea about they have ideas and about
reconstructing the region I'm imposing
what amounts to a kind of Ottoman
ization of the region with the major
power centers in the prime power center
of course is the US but offshoots
the US like Israel which is by now
practically a US military base and
turkey though it's a little less
reliable that's more independent so yes
that's that's a plan could work on this
they're probably already going after
Iran this pretty good evidence for that
and that's likely next target and it's
could succeed for some time to come also
as in fact Yemen correctly points out
part of the goal is to as he puts it to
offload the ecological destruction that
flows out of the American economy to
offload it on to the rest of the world
without any cost to us elites us
capitalism that's not an unserious point
during the Clinton years it was a more
collegial multilateral approach to
running the world took a lies and their
opinions at least on the surface of
things more seriously what do you say
with the contrast between that style and
this aggressive America first style of
the bush crowd the bush Reagan crowd
because they are Reaganite yeah there's
a difference actually Bush number one
was closer to the Clinton style whatever
you think about him he was some kind of
a statesman like Nixon yeah these are
these are these people are at an extreme
point of the spectrum but it's a pretty
narrow spectrum remember so during the
Clinton years yeah there were vast
internationalism but they take the
doctrine of preemptive strike which is
supposed to be new it's not new Colin
Powell's quite right when he says it has
antecedents and they go far back as I
could go right back to the Kennedy
administration for example explicitly
but also in the Clinton years so
Clinton's Strategic Command in 1995
produced a very important document their
major study on what they called
essentials of post Cold War deterrence
it's a horrifying document I suppose
that's why it's never discussed but in
it you find the interesting notion of
what they call pre-emptive response
including nuclear weapons pre-emptive
response with nuclear weapons just means
we attack anyone we like back 40 years
ago when Kennedy was as he put it
through his staff secretly ordering them
to unleash the terrors of the earth
against Cuba because of its successful
defiance of the United States and an
economic embargo and so on just at that
time Dean Acheson senior statesman
addressed the American Society of
international law 1962 and he instructed
them virtually quoting that when the
u.s. responds to a challenge to its
power position or prestige no legal
issue arises that's not even protection
against that's not even protection
against you know a threat just a threat
to a challenge to the US position power
or prestige on that goes way beyond Bush
and that's that's a Kennedy
administration publicly incidentally why
do you read as a state of rocky opinion
how popular is sought on the affected
population will at least initially
welcomed his dad being deposed well I
don't have no information of course but
there are some good reporters there
probably the best of them is Hugh Pope
who has a lot of background in the
region writes for The Wall Street
Journal he has a real story this morning
as you have it right in front of me and
which he says that he's there you know
wandering around like everybody and he
says that the he finds first of all
obviously the population is you know I
can tell that what they think with
minders around the frightened but he
says partly the what you have to concede
is the Iraqi population feel solidarity
with the regime while under the threat
of us
back that's probably right does that
mean they won't standing on rooftops
welcoming US troops not done when a
conquering army marches in people
usually cheer no matter who it is but
but that's no criteria you mentioned
Israel earlier and this is a matter of
some controversy there are people who
argue that Israel has now outlived its
strategic usefulness to the US after the
Cold War and it would make sense to
distance ourselves from Israel and make
more friends in the Arab world and
people who take this position often
claim that the reason for the continuing
loyalty to Israel is the strength of the
Israeli Lobby and Jewish pained in the
u.s. what woody what's he react to that
the israeli lobby which is large by now
largely right wing christian
fundamentalist is significant you know
it's a swing vote and it's a swing it
has a swing effect and because of its
hat is extremely strong in intellectual
opinion which means there's a it sharply
Narrows discussion and debate
nevertheless I think one shouldn't
exaggerate it will not confront the US
government we have example after example
when washington wants something it tells
israel it has to do it and they do it
and the lobby disappears so i think it's
there and it's influential but one
shouldn't exaggerate that's not the way
US domestic politics works the as for
Israel's a role in u.s. planning I tend
to agree with the high level Israeli
strategic analysts and the US analysts
who say that after the end of the
collapse of the Soviet Union its role
simply increased because its role had
nothing to do with protecting the Middle
East against Soviet Union that was a
pretext in fact the government's long
ago conceded don't really have to argue
it the most probably one of the most
important documents that the first Bush
administration produced was its message
to Congress right after the fall of the
Berlin Wall its annual message to
Congress calling for
huge military budget that's very
interesting what are they going to say
now that the Russians are gone well it
is interesting wrote about at the time
the with regard to the Middle East what
they said is we must maintain the
massive intervention forces that we've
always had poised at the Middle East
then comes the following phrase where
the threat to our interests that might
require military force could not be laid
at the Kremlin's door okay so wasn't the
Russians contrary to what we've been
telling you to 40 year for 40 years its
indigenous nationalism and the rest of
the document goes on to explain that
notice incidentally that the threats
couldn't be laid at Saddam Hussein's
door either because at that time he was
a great friend and ally of George Bush
it was indigenous nationalism as it had
been for a long time and how do you
control indigenous nationalism well and
I'm back as far as 1958 US intelligence
recognized that what they said is a
logical corollary of our opposition to
Arab nationalism which was in secular a
logical corollary is support for Israel
as one as a reliable base for us power
in the region that was firmed up in 1967
and it's the basis for the us-israeli
alliance int a is Ray alongside of
Turkey and in earlier years he ran under
the Shah is a kind is what the Nixon
administration called a local cop on the
beat not to protect anyone against the
Russians but to protect the corrupt and
brutal regimes against their own
populations the US understands the
effects so when bush asks why do they
hate us he knows he doesn't know the
answer his advisers surely do eisenhower
brought the same thing up 1958 he
discussed with his staff what he called
a campaign of hatred against us in in
the Arab world the National Security
Council gave the reasons and they were
right
I said it's based on a recognition in
the region that the u.s. supports
corrupt and oppressive regimes and
blocks democracy and development and we
do so because of our interest in
controlling near East oil that was
correct then and it remains correct now
and when that's the way of dealing with
the region yes you want to need powerful
military bases and Israel is not small
I'm a small country but not as a
military force according to the idft
Israeli army their own analysts claim
probably rightly that their air and
naval forces are larger and more
technologically advanced than those of
any NATO power outside the US about our
ten percent of them are now permanently
based in eastern Turkey along with
armored forces in case they have to
crush the Kurds in their own local Kurds
and they're operating out of us bases in
eastern Turkey Nia according to US
specialists they're flying over the
Iranian border that's their real target
this is a reliable base for us power and
that has nine to the Cold War the
Europeans are filing some kind of
objections to this bush policy what do
you think the prospects are for their
developing some kind of political and
military independence from us domination
I think they would be making a big
mistake if they tried to construct a
military counter to the United States
and that doesn't make any sense Europe
can be extremely influential in the
world and powerful but through what's
sometimes called soft power through its
economy it's a social system its model
with other kinds of cultural influences
and so on that's extremely important and
in those respects Europe is on a par
with maybe even more advanced than the
United States but they have to get their
act together that's be willing to do it
and European elites are you know not the
status
with a situation in which they ride on
the coattails of the u.s. and us power
maybe the populations will change that
just as we could change it here but it's
not going to come from a lead opinion
there'll be some bleats of protest but
not much more than that so take say the
case of your wrecked that takes a France
France is leading the protest against
the u.s. measures and we can be pretty
confident in fact it's even stated in
the press that the u.s. is working
behind the scenes to assure friends that
after the u.s. takes over Iraq it'll
grant France a share in the control of
any profits at least from the Iraqi oil
and transyl probably go along with that
Justice Russia probably will Europe
could be independent very influential
but the Europeans have to want it they
have to organize to do something about
it and those pressures are not going to
come from a lead sectors turning to a
domestic effects of this permanent
mobilization you've said that you don't
think that the threat to American Civil
Liberties is all that great because the
culture political culture is just so
deeply habituated to it could you expand
a little bit what I actually said maybe
not clearly enough is that that's I
think that's true for people like you
and me and in fact for the large
mainstream of us society but vulnerable
people are in deep trouble so immigrants
for example the people like John
Ashcroft have their way and to an extent
they're having it the structure of civil
liberties in the United States will be
seriously undermined and probably
demolished but the targets will be the
most vulnerable people actually what's
happening and to go even more vulnerable
what's happening in Guantanamo now is
outrageous I mean every fundamental
principle of the international
humanitarian law including the Geneva
Conventions is just being completely
dismantled well those people are without
any protection but immigrants
dark-skinned people and others who are
tend to be vulnerable they may be in
serious trouble but I do think that the
lot of rights have been one in the
United States not granted but one after
a long and hard struggle and I don't
think people are going to abandon them
easily I mean takes a freedom of speech
we sort of take it for granted and in
fact the US record is now is very good
you know maybe the best in the world but
that's not in the Bill of Rights in fact
the basic principles of freedom of
speech weren't established by the
supreme court until the 1960s and the
course of the civil rights movement and
good that they were but it's not a it's
not graven in stone and the background
record is pretty ugly but nevertheless I
think that those rights people aren't
going to abandon easily or others what
about the state of public opinion about
the war and the prospects for peace
movement I don't detect a great
enthusiasm to to conquer a rock do you
see some hopeful signs of a growing
peace movement what's your thoughts on
that public is never very much
interested in war any more than the top
military brass is but people can be
frightened for all Reagan was
frightening them with images of
Nicaraguan conveys marching time from
Texas and and he did manage great
considerable fear and people are
frightened now under conditions of fear
people tend to support power but you
know the sports pretty thin there's
plenty of dissent and an opposition
concern and I think plenty of grounds
for optimism for people who are trying
to organize and work it's it's certainly
far easier now than it was that say four
years ago when Kennedy launched actually
publicly launched the attack on South
Vietnam then you couldn't do a thing and
the 1980s situation was better you could
organize for the
words against Nicaragua and if the worst
el salvador in Guatemala but it wasn't
that easy I think now it's considerably
the suitably more opportunity although
you know that war drums are beating
people are scared us also said that the
country is more civilized than it was 40
years ago what do you mean by that
comparably more civilized I mean things
we take for granted now didn't exist 40
years ago so for example this takes a
aggression when Kennedy announced
publicly that the u.s. is US Air Force
is bombing South Vietnam 1962 began
using chemical weapons to destroy food
crops began programs to drive millions
of people into what amount at the
concentration camps there was no protest
and nobody could thought we didn't talk
about it just took for granted that
that's fine in the 1960s there was no
feminist barely a feminist movement no
environmental movement in the 1960s
there wasn't yet after hundreds of years
even the beginning of recognition of the
original sin what happened to the
millions of people used to live here
that's all changed now changed not so
much in 60s but in the 70s and the 80s
and since that's when the major popular
movements developed it has carrot they
haven't carried out institutional change
but they changed the culture and the
kind of moral level of the society very
significantly and those are real
achievements they make things very
different than they were in the past
long intellectuals don't think
anything's changed but it rarely does
but among the general population I think
it's correct to say that the level of
civilization is much higher things that
would have been considered perfectly
appropriate then or outlandish now I
don't that's a good nut & out thanks for
joining us note
