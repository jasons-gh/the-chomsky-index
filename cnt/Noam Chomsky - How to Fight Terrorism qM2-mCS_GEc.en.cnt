forgetting everything has been said
rising to minimal levels of morality
let's try to answer the question well we
can start by asking how should the long
series of countries around the world
react to Western state terrorism so to
take just take one uncontroversial case
how should Nicaragua react to us
terrorism against Nicaragua in that case
is uncontroversial because we have a
World Court decision and we would have
had a Security Council resolution except
that the u.s. vetoed so it's
non-controversial
that is much worse than September 11th
you know tens of thousands of people
killed country practically destroyed may
never recover so how should Nicaragua
have responded to u.s. terror well one
possibility is to bomb Washington did
anybody believe that's the way they
should have responded another might be
saved bioterror another maybe
assassinate the president
anybody believe that that's a proper
response I've never seen anybody
believes it I certainly don't believe it
okay but if we don't believe that that
was the right response to our atrocities
then it's not the right response to
their atrocities particularly when it's
people who didn't do it like people in
Afghanistan had nothing to do with this
the so the real question is should
Nicaragua have set off bombs and I don't
know Oklahoma or something ridiculous
so therefore the entire Western response
by Western standards is totally
illegitimate in fact let's take
contemporary terrorism now plenty of it
when September 11th was a terrorist
atrocity so is the reaction to it
literally literally by the literal
meaning of the word terrorism as defined
in u.s. official documents
terrorism is the calculated use threat
or use of violence to achieve political
or other ends through into
or fear all right suppose you announce
to people we're going to continue to
bomb you unless you turn over to us
people who we suspect of crimes though
we're not going to provide you with any
evidence and we're going to refuse
negotiations I'm quoting George Bush
that's terrorism in the literal sense
extreme terrorism or let's go on a
couple of weeks later a few weeks later
end of October the US and Britain change
their war aims they shifted it to change
overthrowing the regime so Admiral voice
the British Minister of Defence
announced to the people of Afghanistan
we are going to you have to understand
that we're going to continue to bomb you
until you get your leadership changed
textbook illustration of terrorism okay
what's the right response is it to
assassinate pushing boys to bomb the
United States and England no it's not so
any of the responses that are taken are
obviously illegitimate at least if we
rise to minimal moral levels well how do
you deal with it well actually there are
proposals that make some sense like the
Vatican radicals in the Vatican or takes
a foreign affairs you know its main
establishment Journal in the current
issue it happens to have published an
article which was actually written
by Michael Howard who is the preeminent
anglo-american military historian it's
got all the right credentials very
supportive of the British Empire thinks
the American Empire is even more
wonderful so perfect person well on a
major military historian what he says is
in the case of a criminal conspiracy
which is what this obviously was the
right approach is to carry out careful
police investigation find evidence as to
the perpetrators were if it's
international and you have the evidence
go to an appropriate international
authority which could be say the
Security Council under their
authorization carry out actions if they
won't turn them over to you which they
might have under their authorization
carry out actions to find an apprehend
the perpetrators bring them to a
international tribunal where they can
get a fair trial
okay well that's an approach and in fact
if we take that approach seriously we
would do the same thing to Admiral voice
Tony Blair George Bush Bill Clinton
George Bush the first anyone else the
people who were running the current war
on terrorism like Donald Rumsfeld who
was Ronald Reagan special adviser to the
Middle East when they were terrorizing
the whole region John Negroponte II
who's running the diplomatic side of the
current war on terrorism and was the
proconsul and Honduras organizing the
contra armies attacking the garage WA
for which the US was condemned by the
World Court and right down the list we
do the same thing to them that's
assuming that we could reach minimal
levels of morale of moral integrity and
of course all of this is so remote from
anything that you can even talk about in
the West that it's hard to say the words
but then there's a elementary conclusion
that follows from that everyone in the
West I have to include myself here
because I don't propose this either
everyone in the West is such a total
hypocrite
that for them even to talk about
questions of right or wrong is a
disgrace
