welcome to this special program
on Kyra Lee Channel
this is a panel conversation between
professor Noam Chomsky of Professor the
message Massachusetts Institute of
Technology ology and two leading experts
in the field of the mass media in India
n/r um who is editor of frontline and
also editor of business line at sports
star and Shashi Kumar the chairman of
the Media Development Foundation which
has established in Chennai the Asian
college of journalism norm Tomsky is
perhaps the world's most renowned
academic scholar he is the founder of
the modern science and linguistics he is
a social theorist activist media critic
and author of many books philosopher and
a great inspiration to people involved
in anti imperialist activism all over
the world
two issues which have appeared in norms
work
one is the to give too much prominence
to one incident you know and not see the
entire context there's yet another with
a methodological point but she always
makes is that when you assess the deaths
caused by an attack you don't assess the
number of people who died in that
incident because if you if if five
people died when you destroy a
pharmaceutical factory and that
pharmaceutical factory is producing
life-saving drugs for millions of people
then those millions must count as part
of the victims of that smells like
strawberry and its situation right
so agent exactly so it's a no and I
think this has of course appeared in
your recent controversy with cruciate
with Christopher Hitchens sensation that
you don't just measure the number of
people who die then but or look at the
director Kennedy it's not just the
people who died in 91 true but since
then and that's all over the world and
it takes a louse not one of the poorest
countries in the world in the late 1960s
there was what was called a secret
bombing of northern Laos it was secret
because the media knew all about it and
refused to print it and I can tell you
that from personal experience from
meetings with the editorial word of the
New York Times and time-life and so on
the information was there they would not
credit I happened to be there shortly
after and interviewed refugees and so on
this was bombing in northern Laos had
nothing to do with the Indochina Wars
the government admitted that it's a poor
peasant area with which at that time was
the most became the most heavily bombed
area in the world
not right now by now there are millions
literally millions of unexploded what
are called bomblets you know the little
pieces of cluster bombs that don't
explode is about a twenty thirty percent
failure rate presumably in order to kill
more people now now if a child picks up
one of these little things
flechette scum out in murder if a farmer
hits one with a hoe the same thing there
there are literally millions of them now
the number of people dying in northern
Laos is not really known but the aid
workers church volunteer demining groups
I mean they estimate thousands of killed
a year in fact the Asian Wall Street
Journal
there are Asia correspondent Barry Wayne
he accepted the figure of ten thousand
deaths a year as possible and I didn't
say it's true we think would be possible
well that's going on right now you know
this is more than thirty years after the
war is over there's a British demining
team of volunteer D mining team trying
to deal with it the Pentagon to this day
will not give them technical information
about how to defuse the unexploded
bomblets well these are all casualties
of the Vietnam War
you know the Vietnam War may be over but
these people are still dying I mean the
people still dying from cancer because
of chemical warfare in the south they're
dying and incidentally we understand
this perfectly when we study an enemy so
if you take say the Chinese famine you
know maybe the greatest crime of
communism the indictments of communism
the Chinese Famine of 1958 to 61 Mao
didn't shoot those people he they were
just decisions made at a central level
which led to a lot of people starving
and those deaths are properly attributed
to the central authorities they didn't
take a gun and shoot him they didn't
intend to kill them it was a decision
that led to the mass death and that's a
crime actually
Jean Dresden a march SN and their
comparison of India and China this
discuss this in some detail and they
correctly described it as a political
crime it's a crime that has its roots in
the ideological and institutional
structure of communist China and that
has received an enormous amount of
publicity when
then won the Nobel Prize lots of however
they say something else in the same
place they compare with India and they
say if you compare China and India which
began roughly at the same level and the
time of Independence and you look at the
policies that were taken and you compare
mortality rates they said because of
China's oral health programs and others
that no word the mortality rate what
they say is this is a virtual quote that
every eight years India puts as many
skeletons in its closet as China killed
during the Senate now when we spent that
that part of their discussion never
entered public you know the public
domain but that's correct we should
apply the same standards to ourselves we
apply to others I mean take say Paul
Pott the CIA did a demographic study
after the war was over and trustworthy
it is but their estimate at least is
that the number of people actually
killed by paul pott was fifty to a
hundred thousand but the number of
deaths attributed to him or maybe a
minute and a half or something like that
well those deaths are not people who
were killed
they're people who died as a result of
the policies the Soudan case which you
mentioned the pharmaceutical factory the
number of people killed in the bombing
was a handful you know two or three
people but this is a factory which
produced half the pharmaceutical
supplies for the country all the
veterinary medicines meaning which would
look for livestock which which mean
people's yes to them you know it
produced 90% of the essential drugs what
were the consequences well you know the
West doesn't care so nobody looks but
there have been some people who looked
the German Embassy in Sudan didn't
looked at it they their conclusion is
that several tens of thousands of people
died there is one expert a person the
regional representative one of the
major relief agencies for the Near East
who has who does field work in Sudan so
he knows the area his estimate is about
the same
tens of thousands medical does well you
know in the West this is unknown and
when when you mention it it's considered
scandalous to mention it it's scandalous
to mention the the fact that we kill
people the same way Mao does or the same
way if all Pat does so yes it's fine the
methodological point is kind of dual
we're allowed to understand it when
we're talking about an enemy it's
scandalous to apply it to ourselves now
if we apply returning to the present
case the number of deaths in Afghanistan
is incalculable and you know you're not
going to see them people don't die from
starvation in an instant I mean they eat
grass or roots and they may drag on for
a while and then their children won't
die because they are born you know to
lower birth weight or ill and they if
you calculate the actual effects of the
of the quite calculated savagery of
destroying cities and driving people
into the countryside or across the
border it could be made that number city
millions of people but to get to this
example of a natural disaster and in
India the point has also been made that
the press the media acts or acted as an
early warning system and that had
mitigated somewhat the circumstances I'd
like to take your in the case of the
famine famines it's not so in the case
of business eight million skeletons put
a deposit every eight years but I'd like
to see this in alongside with your views
on the media as as a celebrated phrase
man actually in consent and do you see
the media as responsible or accountable
for more information or more
disinformation and what's your take on
this
soshe's yeah I have a follow-up well at
the point you make first of all at the
role of the Indian media and preventing
famines that's an important one and it's
one that sin and dress also make as part
of the to the to the extent that India
has a kind of a democratic society
information flows from the ground to the
central authorities and they all know if
there's a famine taking place and I hope
you know what hopes respond to it and to
and their point is in China this wasn't
true yes they say the central
authorities simply didn't know it's a
totalitarian state there was no
information flowing back they did not
know that their plans were in fact
causing a major famine and that's the
reason that sin and resident and give
for the fact that India hasn't had major
famine since the end of the colonial
period so I neighborhood so that's a
positive contribution of the media as
part of a democratic society on the
other hand insofar as the media act as a
essentially a state propaganda agency
which they do every time you turn on CNN
or BBC you're seeing that they are
marginalizing information or eliminating
I mean they may show a picture of a
refugee camp with a child who's dying
but they're not telling you Tony Blair
and George W Bush are murdering
purposely murdering huge masses of
people when they talk about the
September 11th attacks they're very
clear about it this was carried out by
evil terrorists who have to be
eliminated and yes that's legitimate and
a great bitterness and anger and horror
which is correct you should respond that
way when they refer to the atrocities
the much worse atrocities that their own
governments are carrying out it's a
different thing altogether
I mean it's some event that's happening
unfortunate in part as part of our
pursuit of the just
war no passion of emotion if anybody's
to blame it's the Taliban or the drought
or whatever in fact we can be confident
that when all of this is over in some
horrifying way and it will be impossible
to conceal the fact that lots of people
died it will be blamed on natural
disasters the drought the Taliban that
wouldn't let relief workers in or the
something of a mistake maybe we went the
wrong place or something but not on the
purposeful calculated savagery of a
project aimed at assassination much like
Winston Churchill's I mean the people
who died from poison gas and the Air
Force well you know nobody counts them
and in fact like I say we'll never find
out about them because they removed the
record but do you see this as a
homogeneous behavior by the media ISM
they're the Opposition in media isn't
the edges either for instance which the
result is zero which is an interesting
case it's the one it's the one
independent news channel in the whole
Arab world and it is you know watch it
all the time
obviously but it has it's quite broad I
mean I've been on it for example Colin
Powell secretary of state's been on it
the hood Barak Prime Minister of Israel
Tony Blair demanded equal time how many
people thought I saw bin Laden's on it
and they have discussion programs where
people call in that apparently it's very
free and open everyone who watches it
says it's free and open it exposes the
corruption and violence of the
governments all sorts of things well all
the government's in the region despise
it naturally and have been trying to get
Qatar where it's based to suppress it
recently the u.s. joined in Powell Colin
Powell urged the Emir of Qatar to as he
put it rain in Al Jazeera that is don't
allow it to be used for purposes other
than our propaganda he didn't put it
that way
that's what it amounts to the Emir
happen to be in Washington and held a
press conference in Washington in which
he told the press well you know we've
been burned to pressure by the State
Department to rein in this television
station just as we are from the other
from the arab government but we're going
to defend freedom of press so we're
going to allow the station to continue
and he was saying that in washington
Mercenaries it was reported accurately
in one newspaper The Wall Street Journal
had an accurate honest report others had
a few sentences and didn't say what it
meant but yes al Jazeera is an altar and
in fact Al Jazeera's the head is the
only news channel that has had
correspondents in Afghanistan the
destruction of the Buddha statues that
was there you know they reported it they
saw it filmed it and reported it and
many other things and as long as they
were talking about crimes of the Taliban
they were just fine
but when they start talking about crimes
of the United States you better rein him
in because we can't allow that
after that's quite normal during the
bombing one of the major NATO atrocities
during the bombing of Serbia was the
destruction of the television station if
they bombed the television station and
Jill call a dozen people and and the
reason was stated quite clearly they
warned Serbia that this television
station would be bombed unless they
allowed NATO six hours on the television
station and that's like Hitler asking
written for six hours of TV time on the
BBC but well you know the Serbs refused
and then they bombed the station and
that was considered legitimate actually
that came up in the were crimes trials
and they considered it but of course
didn't consider it a crime it was just
part of and they accepted a ludicrous
excuse namely that
that television station was sending out
signals that were just true it's hairy
purposes follow up on manufacturing
consent may I say that media analysis
has never been the same since that book
appeared I believe in 1988 and you you
have also the chomsky nuances and
analysis I think must be so much
separately looked at because it's seen
as part of a wider system of
intellectual consensus-building which is
very very interesting analysis now know
your work with some of a lot of it in in
collaboration with Edie Herrmann is
based on you state right at the outset
on our belief on your belief that based
on the up your experience with the US
media or a long period it evolved and
you apply it to the performance of the
American media I have I'm gonna buy this
time I could like like to raise two
lines of questions first the working of
the filters the well known filters the
five filters identifier and a metaphor
is used there as a result of the
operation of the filters all the news
that fits to print that's what it's gone
as a residue after this almost chemical
process is over how how current is the
operation of these filters and I have a
follow-up on that is right what's the
second big problem the second is how do
we apply this to can this be applied
your model the propaganda model to media
performance in other countries European
countries for a start and then India
what you're thinking is a model builder
well you know is just - is it more or
less in in Europe in Britain is there
different all the time for example yeah
that's a breach in the care
let's take down the first well this was
a joint book as you said it Herman who's
an economist very good economist he
actually the work on the filters is much
like his work I mean I sort of agreed to
it but I see it a little bit differently
in fact the title of the book
illustrates it
the phrase manufacturing consent is not
our phrase we took walter lippmann
walter Lippmann the leading public
intellectual of the 20th century in the
leading figure in the in the United
States and the leading media figure in
the 20th century he used that phrase in
a book in the 1920s yes and and which
are considered progressive essays on
democracy he was a wilsonian progressive
and he talked about what he called the
art of democracy and he said the art of
democracy requires manufacture of
consent and the reason is that the
public has to be excluded from the
democratic process if a democracy is to
function the public has to be excluded
the reason is the public is ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders that's his phrase
there are the wildered heard and we have
to protect the responsible men the real
decision-makers from the rent roar and
trampling of the bewildered herd and
since we can no longer do this by force
because the country has become more
democratic we have to do it by
controlling opinion and so he's not
simply talking about the media talk
about the intellectual community the the
role of the responsible intellectual is
to ensure that the ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders namely the public
don't become involved in something
that's none of their business
like hesitation Africa beyond redemption
they didn't talk about that
didn't even have to say I'm is talking
about the democratic societies
that's rather stray Britain that had the
same same development took place in
England the two most democratic
societies in the world and it's very
striking that that should be the case
actually these are observations that go
back centuries you know back to the 17th
century first democratic revolution in
England it was recognized right away we
can't simply control people by violence
any longer we're going to have to
control their opinions David Cameron
talks about this but in the First World
War there was a radical change and big
effect on the 20th century and since in
the First World War the Britain created
a hoax called the Ministry of
Information which of course means
Ministry of disinformation and its main
purpose was to convince American
intellectuals to join the war effort
which written badly needed so they
developed all the propaganda you've
heard about you know Belgians and babies
with their arms torn off and on
atrocities and so on most of this was
produced within the British Ministry of
Information beamed to us intellectuals
who then picked it up and tried to drive
the population into jingoist hysteria
and part it was their own choice and
they're very proud of it you know this
is first war in history organized by
intellectuals the responsible serious
people not saying we're repeating
British propaganda fabrications
but the Wilson administration didn't
take any chances either it set up a
committee on public information the
first US official state propaganda
agency which was designed to convert a
pacifist population into anti German
fanatics and it succeeded and they were
very impressed a lot of people were
impressed the success of the state
propaganda agencies was very impressive
Lippmann was part of the committee on
public information
and he was using that experience when he
was writing generalizing the so the
intellectuals were McKay Mathon some of
the foundations of modern political
science if you read this standard figma
Harold Lasswell others they said yes we
should not last well it was what the
founders of the modern science so-called
we should he wrote an article called
propaganda in the encyclopedia of social
sciences at that time and which he said
we should not succumb to democratic
dogmatism about people being the best
judges of their own interests they're
not they're too stupid we're the best
judges of their interests but since they
now have the franchise and they have
parliamentary Labour parties and so on
we can't just control them by force so
therefore we have to ensure that they
have the right thoughts and that's our
responsibility as serious Democrats no
that's the academic side others who were
impressed and this is more important
really as the business world the
business world recognized that these are
fantastic tools for controlling people
and the public the huge public relations
industry which advertising is a
component it's a monstrous industry that
grew out of this the if you look at its
manuals from the 1920s and later they're
very explicit about it
these are incidentally you know
progressives Roosevelt Kennedy liberals
you know they're the commissaries of the
Western societies and they're very
straight they say we have to regiment
the public mind the same way and army
regiments their bodies we have to
engineer consent and that's the essence
of democracy the essence of democracy is
for leadership to engineer consent among
the bewildered heard public and direct
them to something else we have to impose
on them what was called a philosophy of
futility a feeling they can't do
anything we have to direct them to the
insignificant things in life like
consumption or some other things but
just keep them out of our hair
let us run we have to be the
decision-makers the analysts and so on
now a lot of this is self-serving fraud
because if you ask who the responsible
men are well it's the people who serve
real power
so walter Lippmann was a responsible man
because he is working for power but
Eugene debb's who's the leading US
figure in the labor movement was in jail
you know because he said the war wasn't
it just so you become a responsible man
if you serve real power then you see
yourself as responsible and a proper
decision maker and then insofar as you
do serve power you're allowed freedom to
act if you step outside you treated like
anyone else enters obeys orders
that's the modern system of thought
control
