correctly thus the function of
communication and so I'm just wondering
so some linguistic things that we do
practices that we engage in the Atlantic
all linguistic are speaking to one
another or speaking to one another also
correcting each other's use of language
so if I point at a dog can I say look at
the lovely kitchen somebody will say
that's not a pigeon it's done we try to
get our language used to conform so
we're all speaking using the words
insanely do you mean that kind of thing
is powerful that is so it takes place
but if you just think about it for a
minute probably 99.9% of your use of
language is internal it doesn't involve
any other people so you can't it's it
takes a tremendous act of will not to
think to yourself in language it's
almost impossible every minute of the
day you're talking to yourself you're
when you sleep you know doing the same
thing there are cases of the kind that
you describe there are all kinds of uses
of the system just like they're all kind
of uses of this mine but it doesn't tell
you much in fact if you really look
closely this has not been studied
there's another dog right here that's
blocking the study of this it's a dog mu
that in the modern period as she goes
back to pretty much decline and then
it's picked up by John Searle and others
the idea that there can't be anything in
the mind that is not available to
introspection nothing can be in the mind
unless you
it may not be conscious but it's got to
be available to consciousness although
it's not in the mind
that's totally hopeless most of what
goes on internally is completely beyond
the level of introspection for example
the the case that I mentioned I mean the
principle which is pretty
well-established that linear order is
not available for syntactic and semantic
computation you can't introspect into
that it's not conscious the same is true
of just visual perception for example
one of the most interesting results in
the study of visual perception is a
conclusion that came out of David Mars
lab Shimon almonds principle what's
called the rigidity principle is they
were able to show that if you present a
subject with tickets to to kiss the
scopic presentations you know to screen
with a couple of dots on it if you have
successive presentations not many maybe
three or four presentations of a few
dots on the screen what you perceive is
a rigid object in motion okay that's
pretty curious too in experience you
don't have no experience with rigid
object throughout all of human history
till very recently there weren't any
rigid objects like your walk in a forest
you know rigid objects around and the
but somehow the system is probably true
for other that it hasn't really tested
on other organisms it's hard to test but
it's probably true for Apes and cats and
so on our system is just designed to
impose rigid objects in motion on
virtually no data and that by now the
mathematical properties have been worked
out the neurological properties less
known but again you can't bring that to
consciousness and I think the same is
true of speaking to yourself try it
sometime think about what you're
actually doing when you talk to you what
you call talking to yours
I think you'll find that what you're
actually what's actually in your mind
consciously is just fragments the little
fragments flip by and out of those
fragments you can suddenly construct the
sentence in a meaningful sentence and
that meaningful sentence is probably
being constructed unconsciously beyond
the level of consciousness internally by
whatever these generative processes are
and bits and pieces of it reach
consciousness like a couple of fragments
of phrases and that's what we call
thinking to ourselves and by now that's
you know that seems to be true in other
domains too there's some famous
experiments the livid experiments on the
decision-making which have been widely
misinterpreted but what was found was
that if you decide to do something say I
decide to pick this up milliseconds
before I decide something's going on in
the motor areas namely the right
organization of motion to pick it up
well in the immediate conclusion was
that was drawn from this is okay that
shows there's no freedom of will unto
Antonis or what it shows is that
everything that's going on is beyond the
level of consciousness at which we know
and every other domain - but as long as
philosophy of mind is already bound by
this dogma that you can't go beyond
what's available to consciousness or
else's on the mind it's never going to
discover anything and I think and
there's a whole collection and I think
that Dogma - probably goes back to
behaviorism I mean it's pretty clear in
Klein's case it's coin they remember
distinguishes
they says actions can be in accord with
principles or guided by principles
that's all in accord with principles
means like the planets following
Kepler's laws it guided by principles
means you formulate what you're going to
do and then you do it and say virtually
all action doesn't fall in any of those
category those categories and with John
Searle that comes up is what he calls
his association principle you know
active has to be available to
consciousness somehow before it can be
attributed to the mind and whole spins
off the whole theory about rules and so
on but that's just approaching these
questions with your hands tied behind
your back and I think the same is true
of the considerations that you mentioned
they're real but it's very peripheral to
the use of language
