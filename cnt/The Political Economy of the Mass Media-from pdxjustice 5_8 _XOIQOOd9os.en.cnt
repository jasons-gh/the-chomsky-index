the beautiful type of system you don't
ever express the propaganda that's
vulgar and too easy to penetrate
he just presuppose it unless you accept
the presuppositions you're not part of
the discussion and the presuppositions
are instilled
not by beating them beating you over the
head with them but just by making them
the foundation of discussion you don't
accept them you're not in the discussion
so in the cases that say the Vietnam War
which was you know major topic of debate
if you look over the media there was a
big debate over the Vietnam War there
were the Hawks who said that if we
continue to fight harder and were more
violent and so on and so forth then we
can achieve the noble end of defending
South Vietnam and the free people of
South Vietnam from communism and then
there were the doves who said it's
probably not going to work and it's
probably not going to be - it's going to
be too bloody and it's going to cost us
too much and therefore we're not going
to be able to achieve the noble end of
defending the people of South Vietnam
from communism now again there's another
view and that is that we were attacking
South Vietnam and that other view has
the merit of being true obviously true
but it was inexpressible that's outside
the spectrum of debate you can enter the
debate only if you accept the assumption
and if you check the media over the
entire period as far as I can see I've
Herman and I on this book review the
media from about 1950 to the present on
Indochina and I don't think you can find
an exception to this I mean even
statistical error that's the spectrum
you got to accept it and the same is
true and there's a liberal bias in the
sense that towards the end of the war
like by about 1969 or 1970 after Wall
Street had turned against the war then
you got a preponderance of doves saying
probably aren't going to succeed in
defending freedom and democracy and
South Vietnam the country that we're
attacking well that's this this this
conception of the media which noticed
challenges the factual assumptions of
the entire debate that says that the
media function in the way that Herman
and I called the propaganda model in
this same book they function in accord
with the propaganda
model now propaganda sounds like a bad
word but remember that in more honest
days like an international encyclopedia
of social science propaganda was
considered a perfectly good word and in
fact something that we ought to have
more of it
because it's needed for the reasons that
last well explained well notice the
propaganda model has lots of predictions
it predicts the way the media are going
to behave and test those predictions but
it also has a prediction of that's kind
of reflexive about the propaganda model
itself it predicts that the propaganda
model can't be taken seriously there's a
reason for that if you think it through
the propaganda model states that the
debate has got to be within assumptions
that are serviceable to powerful
interests and the propaganda model
challenges those those assumptions so
therefore it's got to be out of the
debate okay that prediction is instantly
very well confirmed it is outside the
debate so that one bit of positive
evidence for the propaganda model notice
incidentally that this model has a kind
of a disconcerting feature to it if you
think about it obviously the claims of
the propaganda model are either valid or
invalid if they're invalid we can
dismiss them if they're valid we have to
dismiss them right so one way or another
you're going to be sure that this model
isn't going to be discussed and that's
in fact true well now the basic
questions from this point on are factual
is the factual assumption that bounds of
debate correct or is it wrong that's a
factual assumption you can study and the
real topic you know the topic that ought
to be investigated is that now there
isn't time to do that now so I'll just
make a couple of comments about it and
give a few illustrations three comments
first first notice that the propaganda
model has a number of features one
feature that it has is that it's
advocated by elites that's that is it's
the it informed with the normative
opinion the proposal that the public is
dangerous you've got there you've got to
ensure that they don't get out of
control they have to be controlled by
deception and propaganda since you don't
have the means to do it by force and the
propaganda model simply says well yeah
they work the way elites say they ought
to work so one point about the
propaganda model is that in fact it's it
has elite advocacy a second point about
the property
the model is that it's it's got a kind
of prior plausibility in fact it's
almost natural on completely
uncontroversial assumptions if you look
at the structure of the society you
don't must predict the prop again in the
model without even looking at the facts
why is that true well simply ask
yourself what the major media are now
the way the media work there are some
media which kind of set the agenda you
know the most important ones like the
New York Times in the Washington Post
the big national media they set the
agenda if the government wants a story
to get into television that evening what
it does is leak it to get into the front
page of The Washington Post in New York
Times on the assumption the television
will pick it up and say okay that's
important so we'll give it the front
news the same is true of national
television it sets its you know sets the
agenda that makes people think the New
York Times front page is sent over the
wire services the afternoon of the day
before there's a thing if you read the
you know you look at that stuff that's
ground out of the AP wire you'll notice
around four o'clock come something that
says the New York Times front page
tomorrow is gonna look like so and so
well if you're a an editor of a journal
in some small town you read it you say
oh that's what the important news is and
you frame your own reporting that way
you know it's not sent but there is a
kind of an agenda setting media New York
Times Washington Post the three
television channels few others but
participate to some extent in this well
ask yourself what those institutions are
answer those institutions are first of
all major corporations some of the
biggest corporations in the country
furthermore they're integrated with and
in many cases owned by even larger
corporations you know like General
Electric and so on so what you have is
major corporations and conglomerates now
like other corporations they sell a
product to a market the market in this
case is advertisers that's what keeps
them alive the product is audiences they
sell audiences to advertisers in fact
for the major media
they try to sell privileged audiences to
advertisers that raises advertising
rates and those are the people they're
trying to reach anyway so what you have
is businesses corporations which are
selling relatively privileged audiences
to other businesses well just ask
yourself the natural question what do
you expect to come out of this
interaction major corporations selling
privileged audiences to other
corporations what would you expect to
come out of it on no further assumptions
is an interpretation of the world that
reflects the interests and the needs of
the sellers the buyers and the product
that wouldn't be very surprising in fact
it'd be kind of surprising if it weren't
true so on relative and that of course
means the propaganda model so what you
expect on relatively uncontroversial
sort of free-market assumptions with
nothing else said is that you'll get the
media will function and accord with the
propaganda model now if you look more
closely there are many other factors
which interact to lead the same
expectation the ideological managers the
editors and the columnist sand you know
the anchor men and all that stuff there
are very privileged people there wealthy
privileged people whose associations and
interests and concerns reflow slee
related to those of the groups that
dominate the economy and that dominate
the state and in fact is just a constant
flow and interaction among all those
groups they're basically the same group
they're ultimately the people who own
the country are the ones who serve their
interests and again it wouldn't be
terribly surprising to discover that
these people share the perceptions and
concerns and feelings and interests and
you know attitudes of their associates
and the people they're connected with
and the people whose positions they
aspire to take when they move on to the
next job and so on and so forth again
that wouldn't be very surprising and on
and on I won't proceed there are many
other factors which tend in the same
direction well that's my second point
second point is that the propaganda
model has a kind of prior plausibility a
third point which is not too well-known
is that the propaganda model is assumed
to be true by most of the public
that is in poles country to what you
hear it when when people are asking
poles you know what you think about the
media and so on the general reaction is
there to conformist the to subservient
to power you know there to obedient
that's the either plurality or sometimes
even majority view the and then they're
not critical enough of government for
example that's the standard view well we
have three observations now the
propaganda model has elite advocacy that
is elites believe that's where it ought
to be the media oughta be it has prior
plausibility it's very plausible on
uncontroversial free market assumptions
and it's accepted as valid by a large
part probably the majority the
population well those three facts don't
prove that it's valid of course but they
do suggest that it might be part of the
discussion
it's not it's off the agenda exactly as
the propaganda model itself predicts
that's interesting that's an interesting
collection of facts well what about the
factual matter of how they media behave
