noam chomsky you were just talking about
the significance of what's happening in
the Middle East and you were bringing it
back to President Dwight Eisenhower well
in 1958 Eisenhower this is in internal
discussions in stick classified
Eisenhower expressed his concern for
what he called the campaign of hatred
against us in the Arab world not by the
government's but by the people remember
1958 this is rather striking moment just
two years before Eisenhower had
intervened forcefully to compel Israel
Britain and France to withdraw from
their invasion of Egyptian territory and
you would have expected enormous
enthusiasm and support for the United
States at that moment and there was
briefly but it didn't last because
policies returned to the norm so when he
was speaking two years later there was
as he said a campaign of hatred against
us and he was naturally concerned why
well the National Security Council the
highest planning body had in fact just
come out with a report on exactly this
issue they concluded that yes indeed
there's a campaign of hatred I said
there's a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports harsh
and brutal dictators and blocks
democracy and development and does so
because we're interested in we're
concerned to control their energy
resources no I wanted to go for a minute
to that famous address
of the general of the Republican
president of the President of the United
States dwight d eisenhower my fellow
Americans this evening I come to you
with a message of leave-taking and
farewell and to share a few final
thoughts with you my countrymen we have
been compelled to create a permanent
armaments industry of vast proportions
three and a half million men and women
are directly engaged in the defense
establishment the total influence
economic political even spiritual is
felt in every city every state house
every office of the federal government
we recognize the imperative need for
this development yet we must not fail to
comprehend its grave implications in the
council's of government we must guard
against the acquisition of unwarranted
influence whether sought or unsought by
the military-industrial complex the
potential for the disastrous rise of
misplaced power exists and will persist
that was president dwight d eisenhower
and his farewell address a 1961 special
thanks to eugene jarecki in his film why
we fight that brought it to us in the
21st century Noam Chomsky with us on the
phone from his home near Boston Nome
continue with the significance of what
Eisenhower was saying and what the times
were there and what they have to teach
us today about this Middle East uprising
yeah the military industrial complex
beach the same as one was after what
I've just been talking about that was as
he was leaving office and important
speech of course needless to say the
situation he described not only persists
but indeed has amplified it should be
mentioned that there's another element
to the military-industrial complex issue
which he
bring up at that time in the 1950s as he
certainly knew the Pentagon was funding
what became a lot of Pentagon funding
was going into creating what became the
next phase of the high-tech economy at
that time computers micro electronics
shortly after the internet much of this
developed through a Pentagon a subsidy
funding procurement other mechanisms so
it was a kind of a cover for shifting
for a basic theme of contemporary
economic development that is the public
pays of costs and takes the risks and
eventual profit is privatized in the
case of computers in the internet after
decades so that's another aspect of the
military-industrial complex which is
worth keeping in mind but eisenhower was
speaking particularly about the the
military aspect which called defense
though in fact it's mostly aggression
intervention subversion doesn't tend the
country arms at most of the time but
that's separate from the amount of
course unrelated but distinct from the
Middle East problem there what
Eisenhower and the National Security
Council were describing is a persistent
pattern he was 2 squared they were
describing it in 1950 repeat the basic
conclusion the United States does
support a brutal and harsh dictatorships
blocks democracy and development the
goal is to maintain control over the
incomparable energy resources the region
incidentally not to use them the US
one of the things that Eisenhower was
doing at exactly the same time was
pursuing a program to exhaust US energy
reserves rather than using much cheaper
Middle East energy for the benefit of
Texas oil producers that's a program
that went on from the late 50s for about
15 years so at the time it was not a
matter of importing oil from Saudi
Arabia but just ensuring the maintenance
of control over the world's major energy
resources and that as the National
Security Council concluded correctly was
leading to the campaign of hatred
against us the support for dictators for
repression for violence and the blocking
of democracy and development that was
1950s and those words could be written
today you take a look at what's
happening in the Middle East today
there's a campaign of hatred against the
United States and Tunisia against rants
against Britain for supporting the
brutal harsh dictators repressive
vicious imposing poverty and suffering
in the midst of great wealth blocking
democracy and development and doing so
because of the because of the primary
goal which remains to maintain control
over the energy resources the region
with the National Security Council wrote
in 1958 could be restated today and
almost the same words
