professor Chomsky
first question comes from john bersia
political practice often surprises
political vocabulary for example the
recent revolution the Middle East is
said to demand democracy can we find
multiquote words isn't the use of the
old and frequently betrayed words a way
of absorbing this shock instead of were
coming it and transmitting it further
well I just to begin I think the word
revolution is a bit of an exaggeration
maybe it'll turn it into a revolution
but for the moment it's a call for
moderate reform short there are elements
in it like the workers movement that are
trying to move beyond that but that
remains to be seen
however is correct but there's no way
out of that it's not just the word
democracy it's every word that is
involved in discussion of political
affairs has two meanings as its literal
meaning has a meaning that's assigned to
it for political warfare for ideology
for doctrine so either we stop talking
or we try to use the words in a sensible
way and it's not just democracy it I
mean take the word a simple word like
person sounds simple let's take a look
at it the in the United States it's
quite interesting the United States has
guarantees of personal rights go beyond
maybe any other country would have a
look at them be a constant the
amendments to the Constitution a state
very explicitly that no person can be
deprived of Rights was the rights
without due process of law well that was
it reappears in the 14th amendment was
in the fifth amendment and it was
intended to apply to freed slaves but it
had never been ever been applied to them
the courts narrowed the meaning and
broadened the meaning crucially they
broadened the meaning to include
corporations
fictitious legal entities established by
state power so they were given the
rights of persons by now rights way
beyond persons on the other hand was
also narrowed because the term persons
you might think would apply to those
creatures walking around to do the dirty
work in the society but don't happen to
have documents and that wouldn't do
because they must be deprived of Rights
so the courts and their wisdom decided
they're not persons the only persons are
people with citizenship
so now nonhumans corporate entities like
the Barclays Bank meeting next door
they're persons with rights way beyond
persons humans and the people you know
sweeping the streets are not persons
they don't have rights and the same is
true in just about every term you look
at so it takes a free trade agreements
for example there's a North American
Free Trade Agreement Canada the United
States and Mexico the only accurate term
in that is North American certainly not
an agreement at least if human beings
are part of their societies because the
population in all three countries was
against it so it's not an agreement it's
not about free trade in fact it has it's
highly protectionist you know tremendous
protections for monopoly pricing rights
for pharmaceutical corporations and so
on a lot of it isn't about trade at all
in fact what we call trade is a kind of
a joke so for example in the old Soviet
Union if parts were manufactured say in
Leningrad and shipped to Warsaw for
assembly and then sold in Moscow we
didn't call that trade although it did
cross national borders it was
interactions within a single command
economy and exactly the same is true if
General Motors manufactures the parts in
Indiana sends them to Mexico for
assembly then sells them in Los Angeles
but we call that trade both ways in fact
if you look at the trade it's about 50%
of it not small at a lot of the
agreement is just about investor rights
say granting General Motors of the
rights of national companies in Mexico
for example which Mexicans of course
don't get in the United States and it
pick the term you want you're going to
find exactly the same thing so yes
that's a problem and we get around it by
trying to be clear about the way we use
our own terminology second questions
come from award-winning journalist Chris
Hedges Julian bender in the treason of
intellectuals argued that it is only
when intellectuals are not in the
pursuit of practical aims of material
advantages that they can serve as a
conscience and as a corrective can you
address the loss of philosophers
religious leaders writers journalists
artists and scholars whose lies were
once lived in direct opposition to the
realism of the multitudes and what this
has meant for our intellectual and role
life well the only I understand his
feelings and share them but I don't know
what the loss was when was it ever true
and at no time that I can remember the
term intellectual came into pretty
common usage in the modern sense at the
time of the Dreyfus ARDS they were a
small minority a small vilified minority
the massive intellectual supported state
power during the first world war shortly
afterwards the intellectuals of every
one of the countries passionately
supported their own statements on the
violin
now there were a handful of exceptions
like Bertrand Russell in England or the
Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht in
Germany or Eugene Debs in the United
States they were all in jail they were a
margin and they were in prison yes oh
yes they were there in the John Dewey
circle the liberal intellectuals in the
United States passionately pro-war there
was one member Randolph Bourne who
didn't go along with it
he wasn't put in jail the United States
a pretty free country but he was thrown
out of the journals you know
intellectually exiled and so on that's
the way it's always been
during the 1960's big activist period
they take a careful look intellectuals
were very supportive of Martin Luther
King and the civil rights movement as
long as he was attacking somebody else
as long as the civil rights movement was
going after racist sheriffs in Alabama
that was wonderful everybody praised it
big high rhetoric and so on as soon as
he turned to class issues and he was
marginalized and suppressed people tend
to forget that he was killed when he was
taking part in a sanitation worker
strike and on his way to Washington to
help organize a Poor People's Movement
well that crosses the boundary that goes
after ice because after privilege in the
north and so on so the intellectuals
disappeared with regard to the Vietnam
War is exactly the same thing it was
almost a note among known as look you
know there's of course people on the
fringes they were young people and so on
but among well-known intellectuals and
practice
nothing at the very end after after the
Tet Offensive in 1968 when the business
community turned against the war then
you started getting a drifting of people
saying yes I was always a longtime
anti-war activist no trace of it or
whatever but that's in fact he can take
this back to the earliest history they
go back to classical Greece who drank
the hemlock a guy was accused of
corrupting the youth of Athens with
false gods I'm going to take the
biblical records they didn't have the
term intellectual but they had a term
which meant what we mean by intellectual
that it's called prophets a bad
translation of an obscure Hebrew word
whether were so-called prophets and
lecturers who carried out geopolitical
critique you know condemned the King for
bringing about disaster condemned the
Kings crimes called for mercy for widows
and orphans and so on what we would call
dissident intellectuals how are they
treated they were denounced as haters of
Israel it's the exact phrase that was
used the origins of the phrase
self-hating Jew in the modern period and
they were imprisoned driven into the
desert and so on there were
intellectuals were praised the
flatterers of the court centuries later
they were called false prophets but not
at the time and that's almost the entire
history since there are few exceptions
in the modern period the one major
exception I know is actually Turkey it's
the only country I know we're leading
prominent artists academics journalists
publishers a very broad range of
intellectuals and not only condemned the
crimes
State but are involved in consuls
obedience against them facing often
enduring very severe punishment I have
to laugh when I come to Europe and hear
people complaining about how the Turks
aren't civilized enough to join our
advanced society you could learn some
lessons from Turkey but that's pretty
unusual in fact it's so unusual that it
can its barely known you can't bring it
up but aside from the word loss I think
Chris Hedges comments are accurate but I
just can't perceive any laws I think
it's about the same as it's always been
and in fact the way in dissident
intellectuals are treated of course does
vary so in the United States let's say
maybe they're vilified or something in
the old Soviet Union saying
Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and 70s they
could be in prison like Havel was in
prison if you were an American domains
at that time like El Salvador you get
your plane's brains blown out by elite
battalion trained in the u.s. Special
Warfare school so yes people are treated
differently depending on the country
third question comes from an Israeli
journalist Amira Hass of the uprising in
the Arab states menu change revise some
of the past evaluations are they and how
affected your notions of for example
masses hope Facebook Western
intervention or surprised well actually
a Amira and I met in Turkey a couple of
months ago a couple of hours chance to
talk and neither of us and maybe she did
if she did it was a secret I certainly
didn't anticipate anything that was
going to happen in the Arab world so yes
it changed my opinion in that respect it
was unexpected on the other hand when
you look back at it
it's not that different from what's
happened before except that in the past
the uprisings were brutally suppressed
and indeed they were this time too so
the first of the uprisings was actually
in November that was in the Western
Sahara which is occupied by Morocco 25
years ago Morocco invaded violated UN
resolutions as a brutal occupation the
in November there was a nonviolent
protest which Moroccan troops came in
and crushed violently as they've been
doing for 25 years it was serious enough
so that was brought to the UN for a
potential inquiry but France intervened
France is the primary protector of
atrocities and crimes in western Africa
it's the old French possessions so they
blocked any UN inquiry that was the
first the next one was in Tunisia again
more or less French area and you know
there were scandals as you know like the
minister of tourism or one of the
ministers went for vacation right in the
middle of the uprising and gotten some
bad publicity but that one was
successful it threw out the dictator
then came Egypt which is the most
important because of its significance in
the Arab world and that was pretty
remarkable was a remarkable display of
the courage dedication commitment it did
succeed in getting rid of the dictator
it didn't hasn't yet changed the regime
maybe it will but the regime is pretty
much in place different names the but
it's nothing new that uprising the
January 25th uprising it was led by
young people who call themselves the
April 6th movement well April 6th has
him for a reason April 6 they picked the
name because it was the date of a major
strike action
a couple years earlier at the mahalo
textile complex big industrial complex
that was supposed to be a major strike
support activities and so on well they
were crushed by violence that's April 6
and that's only one of a series
incidentally shortly after the crushing
of the April 6th uprising President
Obama came to Egypt to deliver his
famous address outreach to the Muslim
world and so on on his way he was asked
at a press conference whether he would
say anything about the authoritarian
government of President Mubarak and he
said no he wouldn't he said in Mubarak's
a good man he's doing good things he's
keeping stability like crushing the
April six strike and so on so that's
just fine then the uprisings went beyond
the most striking one is Bahrain that's
frightening to the West first of all
because Bahrain hosts the fifth fleet
the major military force in the region
u.s. fleet a second because it's largely
Shia and it's right across a causeway
from Eastern Saudi Arabia which is
majority Shiite it happens to be where
most of the oil is now that gets
frightening for years Western planners
have been concerned about a kind of a
geographical and historical accident
most of the world's oil is in Shiite
areas right around that part of the Gulf
Iran southern Iraq and eastern Saudi
Arabia well if the uprising Bufferin
spreads to Saudi Arabia then Western
power is really in trouble and in fact
Obama has changed the rhetoric of
that's used officially for the talk
about the uprisings for a while it was a
regime change incidentally that's after
the uprising succeeded then kind of move
in say I was fine now its regime
alteration we don't want to change it's
too valuable to have our dictators run
things actually rather striking fact
about all of this is that take a look
the WikiLeaks exposures pretty
interesting they the ones that got the
most exposure in the West the big
headlines are you for commentary were
the leaks from the ambassador's which
said that the Arab world supports us
against Iran well one thing was missing
in that reaction in the newspapers by
the colonists and others namely our of
opinion what they meant was the Arab
dictators support us it would have had
our of opinion it's known but it's not
reported in the United States zero I
think one report in England Jonathan
Steele reported it probably nothing in
France but it's it's well-known western
US polling agencies released by very
prestigious agencies it turns out that
some Arabs think I think Iran is a
threat about 10 percent a majority a
vast majority think the major threat is
the United States in Israel in Egypt
ninety percent say the United States is
the major threat in fact opposition to
US policy is so strong that in Egypt I
think it's close to 80 percent think the
region be better off if Iran had nuclear
weapons over the whole region its
majority well who cares you know Erik
going back to John burgers term
democracy Western intellectual contempt
for democracy is so profound
and deep-seated that it doesn't even
occur to anyone to ask well what Arabs
think when we are euphoric that the Arab
support us well the answer is it doesn't
matter as long as they are quiet and
subdued and controlled as long as
there's what's called stability if no
matter what they think the dictator
support us period were you for it
well okay that kind of ties together a
number of these questions but going back
to Amira Hass is comments yeah it what's
happened it does should lead us to think
about what has been happening not on the
Arab world but elsewhere has often
arisen and has been subdued by violence
and that's been true for a century I
mean the Britain the British were
suppressing democracy movements in Iran
this over a century ago in Iraq there
was a Shiite uprising and as soon as the
British cobbled the country together
after the first world war
big uprising violently suppressed one of
the first uses uses of aircraft to
attack civilians in fact Britain was
very proud of that now the famous Lloyd
Jordan succeeded in blocking a
disarmament conference in 1932 they
prevented it from barring use of
aircraft against civilians Lloyd George
famous Lloyd George wrote in his diary
that this was a great thing because we
have to reserve the right to bomb
niggers so there was a very good thing
that the British government did and it
continued in 1953 the United States and
Britain combined to throw out the
parliamentary government and in the near
and 1936 to 39 there was an Arab
uprising Palestine against the British
violently crushed
the First Intifada was again a very
significant popular uprising almost
entirely nonviolent and a real popular
movement women's groups attack you know
that protests against the feudal
structure try to dismantle it and so on
it was crushed by violence so sure these
things like this happened what time they
just crushed what's unusual this time is
that strong enough so it was most of the
country's Able's able to sustain itself
what will happen in Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain Jordan we don't know in fact we
really don't know what will happen in
Egypt the military has so far retained
control and the top military command at
least is deeply embedded into the old
oppressive regime they own a lot of the
economy that they were the beneficiaries
of the Mubarak dictatorship they're not
going to give it up easily so it remains
to be seen what happens there next
question is from Ken Loach award-winning
filmmaker how do we overcome
sectarianism on the Left I don't think
we'll ever over to comment for one thing
one form of sectarianism should be
welcomed namely disagreement there are a
lot of a lot of things are quite unclear
we ought to have discussion disagreement
to pursue different options and so on
but what he means by sectarianism and
what is generally meant by it is
initiatives that sometimes attempt to
and often succeed in breaking up popular
movements so individuals or political
groups that have their own agenda and
want to take control you know become
little Lenin's and so on and so forth
that kind of sectarianism I don't think
is ever going to really be suppressed it
can be marginalized so for example
during the during the uprisings in the
Arab world say Egypt
Toffler square
surprisingly little sectarianism and
there were many different points of view
you know but there was a unity in a
common goal and it's beginning to fall
apart unfortunately so just yesterday
there was a women's demonstration
calling for women's rights it was
attacked by it's a very sexist society
and the women were attacked and driven
out
okay that's sectarianism there's now
also religious sectarianism developing I
mean when a common goal is no longer
sort of uniting people in a struggle
then you do get sectarianism and that's
the way to bring people together so for
example in the labor movement the
American say in the United States same
else within the United States the labor
has often been extremely racist they did
not necessarily just against Blacks
for example Irish in the late 19th
century were treated very much like
blacks I mean walk around Boston and see
signs saying no dogs or Irish allowed
and so on what we're called Huns that
meant anybody from Eastern Europe bitter
racism against the Huns
it gets the Italians and you know it
goes all the way back but when the
strike waves began in the late 19th
century and they really became
significant than places like the coal
and steel centers in western
Pennsylvania working for people took
over cities and ran them you know at
that point the sectarianism disappeared
the racism disappeared there was unity
to achieve something and the same was
true in CIO organizing in the 1930s it
overcame you know black racism against
blacks they work together that's the
only way to do it that I know same
happen in the civil rights movement
if you've got a common goal and you can
combine and trying to achieve it then
sectarian efforts are marginalized they
don't disappear there's still people
hanging around the periphery and maybe
if if if the motive and commitment
declines they may begin to take over as
we're beginning to see in Egypt but I
don't have any other way to do it next
question is from Paul a very close
associate to Ken Loach and also
award-winning screenwriter there has
probably never been a time where there's
been such concentration of wealth and
power in so few hands the powerful are
sophisticated in maintaining the state
of affairs but perhaps we use this too
as an excuse to hide our shortcomings on
the left what do you think has been
lacking in our imaginative effort to
build a mass international campaign to
democratize resources and challenge
corporate power can you imagine a time
where we can organize our lives and
economy successfully on a cooperative
basis instead than a competitive one
certainly I can imagine it and in fact
there have been successful experiments
with it as some of them right now none
of them are utopia none of them would
iru or others would aspire to but
they're not insignificant like they say
the Mondragon system in Spain it's it's
not work or managed but it's worker
owned it's a form of co-operative quite
successful very broad lots problems but
quite real if you look around the United
States there they're probably hundreds
of self-managed enterprises you know not
huge some of them are pretty large but
huge they're successful
it takes a gift right now now one of the
interesting things that's happening in
Egypt is that the labor movement which
has been very militant for years as I
mentioned this is not a uprising out of
nothing there they've now apparently
it's hard to get information because not
covered very well but actually I think
of your house has been reporting this
that in some of the industrial centers
like again the mahalo big industrial
center apparently workers have taken
over the the enterprises and are
managing them themselves well if that's
true that would be to be the beginning
of a revolution to active young workers
words so yes it's it's certainly
feasible what's been lacking the the
comment about the inequality is very
real I don't know the detailed
statistics for other countries but in
the United States where I know it it's
inequality is back to the highest level
has ever been in history the 1920s but
that's misleading because the inequality
in the United States is highly
concentrated it's mostly in the top
fraction of 1% of the population you
take a look at the the income
distribution it goes very sharply up
towards the high end and literally 1/10
of 1% of the population now has
extraordinary wealth in fact that's
driving the inequality if you take that
part away it's not equal but not totally
out of sight who are they they're hedge
fund managers CEOs and bankers and so on
well something quite significant has
been happening since the 1970s the
economy has changed significantly it's
been financialized go back to say 1970
financial institutions you know banks
vestment firms were small percentage of
corporate profits at the peak now their
2007 they reached 40 percent the they
don't they don't benefit the economy in
fact to probably harm the economy
there's no essential social utility to
them but they're powerful and they with
economic power it comes political power
for obvious reasons so they have gained
extensive political power for example
those financial institutions that put
Obama into office pretty much so as most
as funding came from with political
power comes the opportunity to modify
the legals of the legislative system and
they've been doing it so since the 1970
1980s mainly fiscal policies have been
changed say tax policies to ensure rapid
concentration very high concentration of
wealth rules of corporate governance
have been changed they allow for example
the CEO of a corporation to select the
board that determines his salary you can
imagine what the consequences of that
are actually read them in the front
pages of the newspapers every day about
the huge bonuses being given to
management that's where that comes from
the regulation has been has collapsed
with very striking effects New Deal
regulation instantly this generalizes to
the rest of the world I'm talking about
the United States because I know it
better deburr a new deal regulation
prevented any financial crises up until
the 1980s really 1970s it started to be
dismantled since the 1980s crisis after
crisis several during the Reagan years
pretty serious ones
phicorp Egan left office with the worst
financial crisis since the depression
loan came Clinton and the tech crisis
then this finally this housing crisis 8
trillion dollars is a fake money
disappeared devastating the economy well
all of these are leaked our political
decisions I mean while the cost of
campaigning went way up and that compels
the parties to climb pretty deep into
the pockets of corporate sector that's
where the money is the next election
2012 is expected to cost about two
billion dollars and take a look at the
the Obama administration you notice he's
staffing the government right now with
executives you know they are the ones
who have the access to the corporate
funding that's going to buy the election
elections we just becoming farces you
know run by public relations industry
their marketing efforts and they kind of
say it openly but in fact Obama won the
award from the advertising industry for
the best marketing campaign of 2008 they
know exactly what's going on well you
know all of this is kind of a vicious
cycle the increased concentration of
wealth increased political power it acts
to further increase wealth
why is there no reaction actually there
is a reaction right now for the first
time at what's going on in Wisconsin is
a very significant reaction there are
tens of thousands of people in the
streets day after day with a lot of
popular support maybe two-thirds of the
population supporting them trying to
defend labor rights the right of
collective bargaining which is under
attack I mean the business world
understands very well that the one
barrier to this total corporate tyranny
is the organized workers movement so
that's got to be destroyed
very
a labor history in the United States
been extremely violent more so than in
Europe have been effort after effort to
wipe out the unions they keep reviving
now is a major one going on but it's
being resisted it's being resisted by
large popular movements well where's the
left actually what's happened to the
left is interesting it since the 1960s
when there was a big revival there is a
quite an activist left there more young
activists now than there were in the 60s
but the issues have changed the issues
are order sometimes we'll post
materialist they're important issues and
don't denigrate them so gay rights
environmental rights women's rights
you've all really important things but
they don't reach to the concerns of the
people who are living under depression
level unemployment they don't reach to
the 20% of the population roughly they
need food stamps there hasn't been that
kind of outreach and organizing so when
the protests started in Wisconsin a
couple of weeks ago it was practically
no left initiative I mean a couple of
well-known figures came in to give talks
but it was not organized by the left
groups who ought to be right at the
heart of it it's it's there and it's
like it better come or else we're in bad
trouble but while left activism is
significant very significant it's pretty
much divorced from the daily struggles
for survival and a decent life of most
of the population and that's a gap that
has to be overcome somehow last question
is from Alice Walker award-winning
author I believe that one state solution
to the palestine-israel impasse is
inevitable and more than just a
two-state solution could ever be this is
because I don't believe Israel will ever
give up trying to control Palestinians
whether citizens of Israel or those
living in the occupied territories and a
two-state solution
would be Israel and Palestine man to
Stan I have been struck by a dismissal
of the one state ID as something and
most absurd and would like to understand
where you see it this way he then no
hope that Israelis and Palestinians
might live together as white and black
people do after the fall of apartheid in
South Africa this an interesting
question
she's a very she's a wonderful woman
does fine work she's really committed to
the Palestinian cause but the question
tells you something about the recent
Palestine Solidarity movement I mean if
I had asked her let's say that why do
you think it's absurd to try to advocate
for civil rights for blacks in the
United States
it should be nonplussed she's devoted a
lot of her life to that in fact the only
possible response would be you know what
planet are you coming from that's what
I've been doing all my life that's
exactly the same here
it's now about seventy years that I've
been advocating for what in the recent
reincarnation is called a one state
settlement the one state settlement
notice not solution the one state
settlement used to be called a
bi-national settlement and if you think
about it yes it'll have to be by
national settlement so that's what I was
when I was a young activist in the 1940s
opposed to a Jewish state that was what
we were struggling for by national state
and one state settlement and that's
continued without a break and it's kind
of hard to miss since the late 1960s a
series of books a huge number of
articles constant talks all the time
thousands of them interviews all the
same trying to work for a bi-national
settlement opposition to a Jewish state
then a kind of work on this activist
work of writing and so on but it's it's
not it just a slogan and I think that's
why somebody like I also Walker doesn't
know it it's not just a slogan let's all
live together half
it's trying to look at the problem
seriously if you're serious about it
you ask how do we get there you ask what
are the steps that'll take us there not
just wouldn't be nice if we had peace
that's easy
how do we get there well that depends on
circumstances like all tactical choices
so in the pre 1948 period it was
straightforward so we don't want to do a
state let's have a bi-national state 48
to 67 you couldn't sensibly take that
position you're talking to yourself in
1967 it opened up again the work there
was an opportunity in 67 to move towards
some kind of a federal system which
could then proceed further to closer
integration maybe become a true by
national secular state and in fact at
that time 67 on I was writing about it
all over the place because I had books
articles interviews and so on up til
about 1975 1975 Palestinian nationalism
crystallized and appeared on the agenda
and the PLO turned to it to state
settlement this huge overwhelming
international consensus by that time for
two-state settlement in the form that
our windows 6775 it was possible to
advocate for it directly and it was
anathema hated you know denounced
because it was threatening it was
threatening because it could be
fulfilled and that would harm policy
formation so you know if you were if it
was noticed at all it was denounced
vilified 75 on you can still maintain
the position but you have to face
reality it's going to have to be
achieved in stages and there's only one
proposal that I've ever heard other than
you know let's all live in peace
together the one proposal that I know is
glad to listen if there's another one is
begin with the international consensus
to state settlement
it would reduce the level of violence
cycle of violence it would open up
possibilities for a closer interaction
which already to some extent takes place
even in today's circumstances commercial
cultural other forms of interaction that
could lead to erosion of boundaries that
could move on to closer integration and
maybe something like the old concept of
a bi-national State now I call that a
settlement because I don't think that's
the end of the road and see a particular
reason to worship imperialist boundaries
so like when I was my wife and I back
when we were students were backpacking
up in northern Israel and happened to
cross into Lebanon because there's no
marked border you know somebody finally
yelled at I said you better get back but
why should it be a border there it was
imposed by a British and French violence
you should move towards a closer
integration of the whole region than
those state so that if you want the word
and there's plenty wrong with States
anyway why should we worship state
structures they should be eroded so it's
a step it's a series of steps not if
anyone can think of another way to get
there then they ought to tell us we
could listen to it and talk about it but
I don't know of any other way so what
you end up with at least I end up with
what I've been writing and speaking
about is something that's too complex to
put on a Twitter message and in this age
that means it doesn't exist you have to
support both the to state and the one
state solution set settlement not
solution support both of them because
one of them is the path to getting to
the other if you don't make the first
move you're not going to get anywhere
now Alice Walker says Israel wouldn't it
won't accept a two-state settlement if
she's right
it a a 40 or is not going to accept the
one state settlement so if that argument
has any force her proposal is out the
window
mine too and the same by the same
argument you could show they can never
be an end to apartheid
white nationalist would never accept an
end to apartheid which was true okay
therefore let's give up the
anti-apartheid struggle Indonesia would
never give up East Timor in fact the
generals said so loudly it's our
province we're going to keep it and that
would have been true if actions were
taken in a vacuum but they're not taken
in a vacuum there are other factors
involved and one factor which is
significant and in fact in these cases
decisive is US policy well that's not
graven in stone when US policy shifted
on the Indonesian East Timor it
literally took one phrase from President
Clinton to get the Indonesian generals
out the one point he said it's over they
withdrew in the case of apartheid a
little more complicated Cuba played a
big role cubed drove South Africans out
of Namibia for example and protected
Angola tone that had a big impact if it
was when the u.s. changed policy around
1990 there was a change of policy it was
at that point that apartheid collapsed
now in the case of Israel it's just the
u.s. is decisive
I mean Israel can't do anything except
what the u.s. supports it has to it use
a diplomatic military economic
ideological support if that prop is
pulled out they do what the US says in
fact that's happened over and over so
yes it's true that if they were acting
in a vacuum they'd never accept anything
but what they're now doing taking over
you know guys a prison and take over as
much of the occupied territory as you
want
yeah they'll continue but they're not
acting in a vacuum there are things we
can do as in other cases to change it
and in that case I think you can
consider and they even lay out a plan
for a move towards a one-state
settlement as a step toward something
even better which can can go on you know
but if as far as I can see the only way
to do that is by supporting the
international consensus as a first step
that step to be a prelude and further
steps and that means very concrete
actions that we don't have to talk about
we don't have to have a seminar in which
we discuss you know abstract
possibilities there are very concrete
moves that can be made so for example
withdrawal of the IDF the Israeli army
from the West Bank that's a concrete
proposal and there are steps that can be
taken to implement it for example
Amnesty International which is hardly a
revolutionary organization that called
for an arms embargo on Israel well if
the United States and Britain France
others could be if the public could
compel the governments to accept the
that proposal as an arms embargo unless
you pull your army out of the West Bank
that would have an effect other actions
can - if the Army's pulled out of the
West Bank the settlers are going to go
with them now they'll climb into the war
is provided to them and move from their
subsidised homes in the West Bank to
subsidize those in Israel just like they
do in Gaza when they got the order some
will probably remain but that's okay
they want to remain in a Palestinian
state that's their business so there are
quite concrete things that can be done
it's not going to be like you know
snapping your fingers but not not beyond
the kinds of things that have happened
elsewhere wind policy if the great
powers changed primarily
