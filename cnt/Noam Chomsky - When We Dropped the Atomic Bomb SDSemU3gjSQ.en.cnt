you remember how you received the either
even the news of Hiroshima at the time
how I personally received it yes yes I
remember very well I was I was a junior
counselor at a summer camp in August
1945 and we heard the news just was
announced at breakfast or something and
I had a sort of a double shock which I
recall very well one at the news and
wanted the lack of reaction to it so we
heard the news was pretty clear what had
happened everything just went on as
normal
no reaction I was so shocked I just
couldn't stay there I just left I was my
guess is what 15 16 16 I just walked off
into the woods and sat there for a
couple of hours thinking about what a
man finally it's where it's dark came
back went on but still no reaction and I
was when I got little older could see
the general reaction I had the same
feeling the lack of reaction was utterly
shocking of course in part it was
because of censorship the information
was not allowed out we know now that
great deal of information was concealed
from Japanese and from the world but
enough was known to realize especially
after Nagasaki that this was the world
was entering into some stage of new AR
or maybe disaster as I recall a few
years later maybe around 1950 or so my
wife and I
one evening we're looking for a 1c a
movie so we looked at the movie pages of
the local newspaper and there was we
noticed the movie called Hiroshima which
struck me as odd I think there were any
movies and we looked and it was which
made it stranger is that it was being
shown in the they called the red-light
district the district where they showed
pornographic movies in downtown Boston
so we see what it is so we went down to
the red-light district you know bars
what you'd expect and I went in to see
the movie turned out to be a documentary
to this day I have never figured out
what it was because they weren't
supposed to be any documentaries but it
was a very poorly made but plainly
authentic just report visual report
photography of the actual events you
know people running to the river with
their skin flowing off and you know
these hideous things we know about and
the audience was laughing it was being
shown as pornographic movie I mean that
was one kind of reaction the other kinds
a Harvard faculty club wasn't laughing
that was just dismissal or concern that
but by then in 1950 was concerned that
you know the Russians would have a bomb
and so on so we wouldn't you alone have
the capacity and in some respects and I
say when I looked at the fine I was able
to look at the actual records so it was
in a way more ghastly than Hiroshima or
even Nagasaki which was pretty much a
test
just to see if a different kind of bomb
would work even more ghastly than that
in many ways in my mind though less
destructive was what the Air Force
history calls the finale on I guess it
was maybe August 14th Japan had
surrendered but the surrender had not
yet officially been received and this is
from memory I may not have an exact
there's something like this
the main Air Force general general
Arnold wanted to have a thousand plane
raid to finish off the war and which was
an apparently considerable logistic feat
be gone the other thousand planes flew
bombed war was over and among the
victims that one of them was in one of
the towns hit was Osaka one of the
victims there was a young boy who later
grew up to be a well-known Japanese
novelist Makoto Oda and years later he
wrote about it he said that along with
the bombs there were leaflets coming
down saying Japan has surrendered
ungraspable the savagery of the reaction
which you could see I mean even as a
child I could see it so as a child
growing up the Germans who were by far
the worst were treated with a certain
respect so there was a prisoner of war
camp happen to be right next to my high
school and you know that there were
disputes among the students some of the
students wanted to mock the prisoners
and throw things at them a couple of us
I was one tried to keep him from doing
that
this is just people who were captured
you have treat him disappear something
but they were never treated they were
always treated as if they're human
beings Japanese on the other hand were
treated as an environment who had to be
crushed and destroyed if you look back
at wartime propaganda
and I remember from seeing it the first
time it was it was the most racist
grotesque propaganda I'd ever seen so
when we finally smashed these bugs and
wiped them out why not have a grand
finale just to show them who's boss
the main story was unfortunate you know
killed a lot of people but mainly it
saved lives it saved you know at that
time numbers were thrown around like it
saved the million lives it brought the
word went in and met the American lives
were saved enough to invade the islands
and and so on actually that historical
debate still goes on until today the
most recent and so far most
authoritative work by Japanese professor
how's it go indicates pretty strongly
that what brought the war to an end it
was not the two atom bombs but the fact
that the Russians were invading the
Japanese Hawks hoped until the last
minute that they could make a deal with
the Russians and the Russians would not
invade meaning big metro area and so on
but when they saw that the Russians were
entering the war all hope of preserving
some sort of Japanese anti D was
destroyed and then they surrendered
