first question always is can you hear me
in the back yeah okay
actually a week ago I thought mother
nature was going to continue with her
antics and I'd have to come next spring
but you made it the the title has a
couple of presuppositions which I want
to say something about one it's talking
about other cognitive processes so it's
assuming that the mind like the metal
systems of mind brain is like everything
else in the body it's a modular system
with sub components dedicated sub
components that have their own
particular properties their own
properties of growth and development and
a functioning and that integrate with
each other in the life of the organism
and the modular approach to the mind
assumes that mental systems are the same
that's pretty uncontroversial the other
presupposition is controversial it's
that language is one of those systems
when I talk about language and other
cognitive systems or assuming that
language exists as a separate system not
just some kind of accidental connection
of interaction of other systems that's
highly controversial in fact it's a that
language exists in the sense that can be
an independent object of serious study
is a distinctly a minority position and
in fact has been for a century the which
is kind of strange when you think about
it because on the surface it seems
entirely obvious if you consider a
newborn infant let's say the infant is
faced with the famous blooming buzzing
confusion of William James and somehow
and how incidentally is not known
some in fact barely studied because it
hasn't been recognized to be a problem
though it is the infant somehow picks
out of this
complex collection of unorganized data
some sub parts which are language
related that's not it's not easy to
figure out how that happens as I say
it's barely been studied just beginning
to be studied now so it picks out the
intrud picks this out of the environment
reflexively of course in fact we now
know that that's going on even
intrauterine to a certain extent and
then continues again pretty much
reflexively to pick up the capacities
that you and I are now using and the so
is very little evidence not only is the
evidence is it scattered among other
data but that for not much of what
anyone knows there's almost no evidence
at all that goes from the meaning of the
simplest words when you look at them
closely up to complex structures there
and their interpretation I'll give a
couple of examples but it's a pretty
clear furthermore it's a humanly unique
capacity so if an infant has a pet
chimpanzee or songbird or kitten or
whatever the animal can't doesn't even
make the first step can't pick out of
the environment language related data
that's not because of sensory motor
defects or deficiencies or differences
even chimpanzee auditory system is
pretty much the same as a human auditory
system so much the same that it's
recently been discovered it even picks
out the distinctive features the kinds
of fonts and features that play a role
in language chimpanzee auditory system
is somehow constructed so it
specifically identifies those
and the motor system really doesn't
matter I mean the people learn language
perfectly well a children learn language
actually normally if they're exposed
only to sign not to sound and if they
use only sound sign the course of
development is virtually identical in
quite remarkable ways and in fact the
length of the what sometimes called the
externalization of language the way it
goes through the sensory motor system it
seems to be modality independent and of
course say apes have the same visual
system essentially the same capacity for
motor action even more developed in some
ways in humans so that can't be the
problem it's got to be something about
the internal computational system that's
uniquely human but despite all these
facts and they are glaringly obvious
nevertheless it's this kind of dogma
that language just can't be a separate
system it's gotta be just a combination
of other things common maybe to primate
in fact it's if you take a look course
in comparative terms across other
organisms about the only known animal
that even has any of the rudimentary
properties of human language or certain
kinds of songbirds and they're young
billions of years away in terms of
evolutionary history so whatever
similarities they are has to be
convergent not the common ancestry and
so so there's something very special
about language also it's pretty recent
in the human line there's really no
evidence for its existence there beyond
maybe a hundred thousand years ago which
is you know flick of an eye in
evolutionary terms and many millions of
years after the separation from the
nearest species well despite all of this
rich
is glaringly obvious it has there is the
kind of a doctrine that are pretty stat
it's if you took votes and cognitive
scientists today most most all agree
with it that it can't be true
I think it's a interesting case of
denial of the obvious for which maybe
psychologists might want to have
something say but you can easily
determine it from the literature also it
goes way back so if we go back to the
1950s when the kind of work that I'll be
talking about what sometimes called the
generative Enterprise when it was sort
of barely beginning actually a couple of
graduate students at Harvard who didn't
believe any of the they were highly
skeptical of the standard behavioral
science concepts of the time at that
point the same view was just rampant so
the leading the leading philosophers
most influential philosopher who had
aimed to say about these things was a
very important philosopher Harvard W the
Quine and his conception which was
highly influential and not just in the
Cambridge area but everywhere else as
well was that language is just every
language is just a fabric of sentences
associated with one another and with
stimuli by the mechanism of conditioned
response so it's all within the
framework of the radical behaviorism
that was prevalent at the time that's a
view that's almost incoherent I mean I
can even tell whether some of the
behaviors or sentences unless there's an
independent concept of language but
despite the incoherence and the complete
lack of evidence in fact masses of
contrary evidence this was a widely
believed accepted view outside in the
fields around linguistics there was no
cognitive science at the time was just
the early beginning in linguistics
itself arrived
similar view was held so it was a common
standard view you can kind of read it in
the major literature of the time was
what was called the Bosnian view named
after the famous anthropologist linguist
Franz boas whether he believed it or not
is another story it was called the Boas
e'en view namely that languages can
differ from one another in arbitrary
ways and when you approach a new
language to investigate you should do it
without any preconceptions about what a
language can be because they can all be
entirely different actually that's the
way I was taught in the late nineteen
forty or fifty when I was stood the of
course that would mean there is really
no such thing as language it's sort of
anything that comes along the later on
there were in the philosophical
tradition more modern philosophy another
standard view that developed while these
pretty much remained was not but not
universally anymore by the sixties and
seventies beginning to change but a view
that entered was and so it was developed
also tracing back to coin and in fact
with deep flutes in history of
psychology is that any mental process
anything you can't have a mental process
at all unless it's accessible to
consciousness may not be conscious but
at least has to be accessible to
consciousness that's a very widely held
view in fact if you look over the
history of psychology it's pretty hard
to find anyone who questioned it
even Freud in fact talked about the
unconscious but he read Freud carefully
he appears to have assumed that he's not
a model of clarity but he seems to have
assumed that whatever is unconscious can
in principle be accessed by
consciousness in fact that's what
underlies the practice of psychoanalysis
trying to bring things to consciousness
very hard you might
check to find anyone who believed that
the process the mental processes are
processes of thinking planning
interpreting and so on know that they
can't in fact to be inaccessible the
consciousness although I think again the
evidence is overwhelming that that's
what they are almost entirely and in the
case of language almost completely which
is why you can't investigate a language
by introspection you can look at the
data but it's your of your own language
but it's as foreign to you as it is to
anyone else what's inside
well the of the approaches to language
at the time were what are called
procedural you there were certain
procedures of data analysis you applied
them to a corpus of material and you
could rearrange the material and put
into organized form which again that's
what theoretical linguistics was in fact
the main theoretical book was called
methods in theoretical and structural
linguistics methods because that's all
there is the European linguistics was
approximately the same and that again
has the same kind of framework of
assumptions it follows from this and was
believed that there can't be any real
problems about language have any puzzles
because we are doing is taking data and
organizing it and unless you make a
mistake or you have the wrong procedures
it can't really be anything problematic
it's there is a modern variant of this
which is I mentioned is overwhelmingly
dominates the cognitive sciences all
returned to that well as I say it's kind
of strange because of the not just for
exotic reasons but because of the nature
of what's obvious before our eyes but
there's nothing novel about that now
that's the way the sciences have
developed so for example for
one of the great turning point in the
sciences was around the 17th century
when scientists for the first time
really allowed themselves to be puzzled
about what looked like very simple
things so for thousands of years the
greatest scientists had a simple answer
to some obvious fact obvious fact is
that if say I pick up a cup of boiling
water and hold my hand over it if I take
my hand away the steam rises in if a let
go the cup the cup falls so why does the
cup fall and the steam rise well there's
an answer given by an Aristotle they're
seeking their natural place and for
thousands of years that was considered a
satisfactory answer and modern science
actually begins when Galileo and later
others agreed were able to convince
themselves there's something puzzling
about that why does that happen
and as soon as those questions began to
be asked and investigated it was very
quickly discovered that all of our
intuitions about how these things work
are just false that's the intuition is
about rate of fall and almost any other
simple thing and it's at that point that
it when it came to be discovered that
what seemed to be obvious was compact
not at all understood as at that moment
that modern science starts and that
often has yet to happen in the human
sciences they think seem kind of obvious
to us so we don't really question but if
you can bring yourself to be puzzled
about them you find that we really don't
understand anything well those are the
two presuppositions on going to assume
except both namely that the mind is
modular like everything else in the
biological world every other thing in
all organisms and that language exists
as a separate module
this but it shouldn't really be
surprising that language and the mind
should and the human intelligence should
follow the biological norm as I
mentioned language has itself as very
special properties I'll mention some of
them and the things that should have
seen puzzling are very puzzling and
still are when you look closely and it's
a very recent development if you look at
the evolutionary record of course we
want to tape recordings but there's a
lot of archaeological evidence and the
archaeological evidence for the
existence of language so implicates the
existence of language is very modern
maybe within a hundred thousand years or
so and unique to humans it's not found
in the other hominid branches
Neanderthals for example who lived up
till maybe thirty thousand years ago the
insect still having the underfill chains
but it seems to be various specifically
human millions of years after the break
from other organisms there is a huge
literature by now just the last 20 years
it's virgin on what's called evolution
of language which is itself kind of
curious evolution of language a very
hard topic to study there is no direct
evidence there's no comparative evidence
nobody knows where to look for
neurological evidence nevertheless is a
library's full of books on it especially
the last 20 years if you take much
simpler topics there's almost no
literature on them so take say the
communication system of bees there's
quite complex some scattered papers
correctly nothing on it the reason is
it's just understood to be too hard it's
too hard to study the science is already
study what's kind of right at the
borders of understand
for bees a study of evolution of the
communication system of bees which is
quite complex you all know about the
waggle dance and that's everything who
is far more easiest study there's about
500 species of being safe plenty of
comparative evidence they have different
communication systems as some appear to
have no communication system they get
along about as well as the others which
raises some questions about what the
function of those complicated systems is
if anyway there's plenty of comparative
evidence the brain is tiny it's the size
of a grass seed maybe hundred thousand
neurons miniscule is compared to the
human brain very short gestation period
a couple of days you can breed so on and
so forth you can do any experiment you
like you want to take them apart that's
allowed you don't need consent forms or
ethical issues or anything so it's a
perfect organism to study as and humans
are impossible to study in all of those
dimensions and nevertheless there's
almost nothing about it because of the
recognition among biologists that is
just too hard on the other hand the kind
of tacit assumption that there can't
really be much to language makes it a
possible topic to study if you don't
know anything about language and
incidentally if you don't if you have
quite confused notions about evolution
there is a kind of a pop biology which
is very widespread that assumes that
evolutionary change that takes place in
small steps and adds up and finally get
complex things happening it was believed
at one time not very long ago in fact
nobody believes it anymore by now
there's overwhelming evidence for what's
called saltation you know sudden changes
and it's even kind of understood why
this has been understood in the
biological sciences ever since at least
the 60s and the 70s when after the
discovery of
the regulatory mechanisms cells that
govern the action of genes that govern
the action of other genes if you change
the regulatory circus a little bit you
get huge phenomenal differences and
there's by now many examples of very
small changes genetic changes that lead
to substantial differences in what the
organism is famous discussion back in
the 1970s by housewife cub is one of the
discoverers of
these mechanisms in Nobel laureate who
argued that if you you could change in
his image was you could change an
elephant to a fly by just changing the
timing and organization of two
regulatory circuits and that kind of
that you can't prove yet but similar
smaller results have definitely been
shown so the idea that everything has to
happen by small steps is out the window
I might say that back in the 1950s and
60s in biology too it was generally
assumed that organisms can vary in
arbitrary ways so the next organism you
look at you have to approach it quite
differently from others without
preconceptions that is totally out the
window so much out the window that by
now there are even proposals which are
taken seriously one by a molecular
biologist at Boston University that
there may be a universal genome that is
that all the Metazoa
complex organisms that come from the
Cambrian explosion 500 million years ago
that they're all fundamentally the same
they all have a basically the same
genome with slight variations and that
doesn't look exotic anymore they may not
may be true maybe not but it's not an
exotic proposal given what's known now
about conservation of genes
neck's structures going all the way to
bacteria up to humans and Simmel and
deep homologies know very deep
similarities and the way organisms are
put together it's I think the same is
true of language but it's much more
controversial in this case well give you
some illustrations from today I go back
a couple of months there was a review
article in the journal Science main
journal scientific weekly American
American Association for advancement of
science by a well known under Oh
cognitive neuroscientist at the Max
Planck Institute in the Netherlands he
was reviewing several books on evolution
of language the and he kind of dismissed
most of them because they were tainted
by a false assumption and namely the
assumption that languages that language
actually exists that is that there are
rural systems specific language which
determined the character of sound
systems other externalization systems
determine the structures and meanings of
expressions how they're interpreted and
that can't be its violates the dogma and
in fact the in order to sort of
established the point
the editors added a photograph in the in
the along with a journal article which
is a photograph of three infants
properly multiracial gotta be
politically correct so three infants who
seem to be more or less paying attention
to one another and the sub the title
says communication without syntax
without rules so that shows that you can
have communication without rules they
could have had a picture of
three bacteria which would have made the
same point they also communicate without
syntax but underlying this is a
fundamental Dogma which is almost never
questioned though it's almost certainly
false and that is that language is just
a system of communication there's every
reason to believe that that's not true
in fact again obvious reasons if you
just introspect almost all of your use
of language like 99% of it is internal
you can't go for a minute without
talking to yourself it takes a
tremendous active will to stop talking
to yourself well that's obviously not
communication that's thinking and that's
one with all the use of language in fact
goes on all night unfortunately but an
even interaction like interaction among
people parts of it or communication but
the large parts aren't to establish in
social relations
whatever nevertheless this Dogma is
widely held and that leads to the
assumption that you can understand
something about language if you look at
communication systems of other languages
that's what underlies the all of the
work on evolution of language you take a
look at this work you find it's not
about evolution of language all its
speculations speculations of course
about the evolution of communication -
quite a different topic it's not a
language and in fact then language is
used for communication but so is
everything else we do style address
whatever and the large parts of language
aren't use of language is only
peripherally for communication but if
you think of language as just being a
system of communication then you can
look at animal communication systems and
you can see if you can draw some
analogies or
whatever actually you can't very much
but at least it's it's not ridiculous if
you look at the properties of language
it's just instantly ridiculous even the
ones that I met simple ones that I
mentioned
well the with regard to with regard to
communicate itill of the article
incidentally is also revealing the title
of the article is without social context
question mark and what it's the point is
to criticize the idea that you can study
language without paying attention to the
social context of its use well in fact
if you're studying communication that's
true
would make much sense to study
communication without looking at the
circumstances of its use it's close to
tautology on the other hand if the study
of the mechanisms that enter into
communication or that enter into other
aspects of life and in other areas of
the cognitive sciences and biology
that's just taken for granted so for
example if you study the structure of
the digestive system you can do that and
in fact you do do that without asking
what happens when you have a Big Mac or
something
in fact that you dismiss you try to
abstract away from that if you're
studying in this insight mental
psychological systems there's very good
work on say object recognition by
infants Elizabeth spell Q Renee by
origin all others they look at the try
to discover the mechanisms by experiment
without social context they're not
interested in they don't look at it when
two kids are playing maybe you can but
that's peripheral you try to abstract
away from that and carry out
experimental studies in a refined
situation in which there's no social
context that's the way you study it
automatically like anything
the sciences take one of the major
discoveries of study of perception one
of the most interesting principles that
was discovered was Shima almonds what's
called rigidity principle is a pretty
surprising fact it turns out that if a
person is presented with tickets to
scopic images you know just dots in a
screen a few dots maybe three or four
dots on a screen and you have several
presentations of it what you see what
you perceive is a rigid object in motion
that's the structure that you impose on
the sequence of a few dots on a screen
that's the rigidity principle which is a
pretty remarkable discovery but has
absolutely nothing to do with social
context again this is not even real
objects it's looking at the Kista scopic
images like most of the study of vision
so in effect throughout the biological
sciences just as in chemistry or physics
all of this is taken for granted but in
the study of language and higher human
mental processes this considered
something to be something wrong with
this
you just can't approach it in the manner
of the sciences the so take just take a
concrete examples of these things in the
way so I won't write in the blackboard
but the simple enough so you can keep it
in mind so to take an actual sentence
say of English take the sentence they
wonder if they wonder if the mechanics
fix the car okay and suppose you want to
ask a question about how many cars there
were you can say how many cars did they
wonder if the mechanics fixed I suppose
you want to ask a question about the
mechanics well then it comes out how
many mechanics do you wonder if fix the
car well is plainly something wrong with
that you can't say that has a perfectly
good meaning fine thought
just can't express it in language and
that generalizes very widely as
principles that underlie at that
extended and all sorts of other
constructions but did you do you have to
study that in a social context or in a
condition of communication it could it
possibly be learned I mean did you have
evidence that you're not allowed to say
that or you can't say it of course not I
mean this is just something like the
rigidity principle it's some property of
the system which if you're willing to
reach the stage of say Galileo if you
want to enter into modern science you
should be puzzled about and it's a
typical example myriad examples of that
kind and any one of them illustrates the
fact if you want to understand anything
about the properties of language you're
going to have to study it the way the
sciences are pursued even the cognitive
sciences in other domains but that's
contrary to the dogmas well what's
developed out of this is in modern
cognitive science is a very strange
concept of scientific inquiry it's it's
not true of say the study of vision like
spell key by our own momen and others
but it is true of the especially the
computational cognitive sciences which
have the merit that the proposals are
clear enough so you can actually
investigate them they're not just hand
waving but everything happens like to
other primates they actually have models
that you can investigate which is good
and what you can show is they fail a
hundred percent totally and it doesn't
make any difference because they succeed
in terms of a new conception of science
which dominates the computational
cognitive sciences the idea that science
is a matter of
developing models that matter more or
less approximate data usually Bayesian
methods of statistical analysis and
basic methods have the nice property
that whatever the data is you can find
the Bayesian Alice that will fit it you
just have to fake the right priors and
so on and so forth
not exactly fitted but kind of come
close this is never done in the sciences
so for example if someone is studying
SEBI communication you know say the
waggle dance of some species of bees
they don't proceed by taking videotapes
massive videotapes of bees swarming and
then do a statistical analysis of them
you know Bayesian analysis and from
which you could get a pretty good
prediction of what's going to happen the
next time bee swarm that's absolutely no
interest to be scientists and quite
rightly if you apply for an NSF grant to
study it they'll laugh at you on the
other hand if you apply for NSF grant to
do the same thing with corpus a
collection of spoken language you can't
get it right off that's considered very
sophisticated or say physics if trying
to study physics you don't take
videotapes of what's happening outside
the window you know leaves blowing
around and so on and do an analysis of
them and get you know pretty good
massive collection you get a pretty good
prediction of what's going to happen
tomorrow when you look out the window a
prediction that's way better than any
little physicist can give in fact they
can't give you any prediction at all and
they don't care about but the sciences
just aren't done like that the only
thing that is done like that is
particular branches of the computational
and other cognitive sciences that deal
with higher mental faculties language in
particular and there's a criterion of
success the criterion of success is you
get a little better each time you have
more data you know more complicated
Bayesian analysis more sophisticated
methods and you get a little
to the data as I say in any other domain
this would simply be ridiculed but it is
the criterion of success and the
computational cognitive sciences novel
approach you can find it in all the
major journals all the time and but only
for language not even for something as
close to languages say a numerical
calculation so for example suppose you
want to study the rather interesting
fact in fact very surprising and
puzzling fact that all humans have a
capacity for a numerical computation
that they understand the number system
that's incidentally a fact that did
puzzle the scientists who created the
modern theory revolution Darwin and
Wallace they were kind of struck by the
fact that all humans that didn't
experiment with the business recognizer
was true that all humans have
comprehend the number system which is
very surprising from their point of view
because it couldn't have been selected
it's barely been used in the whole
history of humans a small group of
humans mostly pretty modern and still
small have you know made use of the
system but for most of almost entire
human history in fact most humans in
their day it just never never used it
all they could handle small numbers but
so can Apes and they could handle what's
called numerosity you know knowing that
a hundred things is more than 80 things
but not the particular characteristics
of the digital number system you know
the principles of multiplication or
addition and so on so where to come from
a big puzzle for them if it wasn't
selected how come it's there in fact
Darwin and Wallace had a dispute over
this co-founders of theory of evolution
and Wallace argued that there has to be
some principle in evolution apart from
natural
election to account for this mystery and
Darwin didn't agree with that but he
absolutely he had no alternative
suggestion remained a mystery it has
remained a mystery up to the present the
likely answer which we can now begin to
perceive is that if you look at the
actual mechanisms of language if there's
any time I may get to them with
something about them but if you get if
you take a look at them carefully
it turns out that if you simplify them
radically they in fact yield the number
system so it's very likely that the
number system just kind of piggyback
those language if you have a language
however that develop evolve you just get
the number system as a free gift by
simplifying the language actually
reducing the lexicon the collection of
words to one element then the basic
computational principles do give you a
model of a number system which may very
well be where it comes from which would
just true overcome the mystery well
let's go on this I'll go back to Enfield
again is useful collection of standard
beliefs he argues that language doesn't
exist because it is entirely grounded in
a constellation of cognitive capacities
that each taken separately has other
functions as well so it exists in the
sense that say today's weather exists I
mean yeah it does exist but it's not a
topic of scientific study it's just a
constellation of other factors that
operate independently and the argument
is that that's true of language there
isn't a particle of evidence through
this but it's almost universally held in
the cognitive science it's not totally
but very widely and in fact as soon as
you look at the simplest thing you see
it can't be true so for example the
infant acquisition of language or the
one example that I mentioned
how is that a constellation after that
how can what you know about that follow
from the interaction of other cognitive
processes and if so how and if somebody
makes this proposal in the sciences at
least they'd be expected to give some
evidence for look at some simple cases
but not in the cognitive sciences it's
enough to wave your hands at it mention
one well-known thesis in the study of
acquisition of language and one of the
main figures in the field is Michael
Tomasello those of you in the field or
women are familiar with this and his
view is that language is just a
structured inventory of linguistic
constructions acquired by processes
common to primates and others which are
kind of obscure so there's interrogative
constructions and passive constructions
and you just acquire them they could be
any other way just kind of accidental in
this way and there's nothing more to say
about them also notice that it would
have to be finite obviously it's not
finite languages unbounded so how does
it become infinite well that's just more
hand waving going back to Enfield
talking about the evolution of the
system he says there are well-developed
gradualist evolutionary arguments to
support the conclusion that there's no
such thing as language except as a
complex of independent cognitive
processes notice the notion gradualist
that's a reflection of the mythology
about evolution that still maintained
Outsiders biology some in evolutionary
biology everyone knows that's false but
outside the field even as close as no
cognitive neuroscience it still assumed
that somehow everything has to be
gradualist they're well known that
that's not true but it's kind of what
you learn in high school and people
believe it
and this in the sciences too and he's
particularly too upset about what he
calls the Salvation estar Gyu man is
selfish earnest that the transition from
finite to infinite was not gradualist so
natural language is clearly infinite
there's no bound on the number of
expressions that you can in principle
produce and understand just as there's
no bound on the collection of triples of
numbers X Y Z where Z is the product of
x and y and in principle yet enough time
and energy and so on you could calculate
it
well language is the same so how you get
from finite to incident well the fact
that that's salvation is not gradualist
is about as controversial as the fact
that two plus two equals four there's no
logically possible alternative it has to
be salvations
but the fact that it is is incompatible
with a gradualist conceptions no in a
rational field when you have some
conception and you have something that
shows it's logically impossible you give
up the conception but in a field that's
dominated by dogmas many of them ancient
dogmas what to do is denies logically
the fact even if they're just logical
truths and that's unfortunately pretty
common well what do we actually know
that evolution of language not very much
in fact but the little bit that is known
is highly suggestive one thing we know
which is kind of surprising if you're
willing to be puzzled by simple things
is that all humans have the same
capacity for language now you all humans
haven't been studied but a lot of
linguistic groups have been studied and
there are no known group differences
there are individual differences but
they're found in all groups so for
example if you take an infant from
a tribe in Papua New Guinea that hasn't
had contact with other humans her you
know tens of thousands of years and you
bring it to Boston that's child's raised
here it'll be just like you same
linguistic capacities same cognitive
capacities going to become a quantum
physicist and so on and conversely you
take a instance from here put it in
Papua New Guinea same thing happens and
in fact as far as is known there are
either no or very much at most very
marginal differences among human groups
in cognitive capacities also altogether
but in linguistics capacities there so
if they exist if so mind minut you can't
find them by present methods of very
marginal at most well humans we all
descend from a fairly small group that
left Africa maybe fifty thousand years
ago something like that and that what
that means is for the past fifty
thousand years there's been zero
evolution none has been change the
change is not evolution no the fact that
we're different from hunter-gatherers in
our cultures and size and everything
else that's those are signs of change
but not evolution if there is evolution
it's very superficial the things like
say skin color hair like things like
that but not in fundamental human
capacities as far as anyone can tell so
that's 50 thousand years with no
evolution at all which is striking that
means that whatever for language
whatever evolved was kind of rigid never
changed again it you know of course
languages differ but that's not
evolution that's just something else
like the Norman Conquest changed English
enormous Lee it made it kind of like
French but that's not evolution if
languages change the way they do say by
the effective teenage jargon or
something
very big effect on language James it's
not evolution it's just changes that
take place within a fixed system and the
system seems to be pretty rigid for 50
at least fifty thousand years well if
you go back about fifty thousand years
before that you just find no evidence
that language even existed the evidence
and it's commonly accepted by Paulo
anthropologists that sometime in that
narrow window there was something that
sometimes Jared Diamond called a great
leap forward there's a short period in
which is a sudden explosion of complex
artifacts complex social structures
symbolic behavior representational art
taken calculation of astronomical events
like you know phases of the moon and so
on all of this happened at least in the
archaeological record very brief period
maybe roughly 75,000 years ago you can
double the numbers if you like or triple
them and nothing much changes that's
because these numbers are also small but
from an evolutionary point of view they
don't matter
and again that's millions of years after
the separation from other organs or
other surviving organisms the well that
seems pretty clear and it's highly
suggestive about the nature of language
one critical property of language
crucial property in fact the core
property of language is that each
language consists of at its root of some
mechanism it's called a generative
process a mechanism which constructs an
infinite array of structured expressions
which have interpretations at in two
systems two interfaces they're called
sensory motor system
for making noises or signs or whatever
and thought systems for thinking
planning interpretation and so on each
of these structure expressions has to be
mapped into those two systems on that
and it's unbounded as I said this it's
also digital like like the numbers but
there's a five-word sentence six word
sentences no five and a half word
sentence and it goes on indefinitely as
long as you have patience time and so on
and virtually everything that's produced
is actually novel in your own experience
maybe in history the language because
the state the size of these sets is so
astronomical that you just keep
producing new things well that's the
most elementary property of language not
stuck around nine to five around 1950 a
generative processes like that were
understood from mathematical point of
view they really hadn't been in the past
but you know algorithms called reviewing
a kind of program that you can write for
your laptop let's say these things began
to be understood and understood very
well so it's possible to ask of what
kind of a generative process could have
these properties well how could such a
notice that it came at the part given
the limited evolutionary evidence it
must have happened pretty suddenly
that's a very brief window so presumably
what happened it's hard to think of an
alternative is that in some small group
these are hunter-gatherer societies
remember like a hundred people or
something in some small group wandering
around Africa somewhere some individual
underwent a slight mutation which led to
a small rewiring of the brain which
provided a generative procedure now
mutations take place in individuals not
in groups so it would have been one
person who was
lucky enough maybe unlucky enough to
undergo this mutation and that mutation
provided a Jenner a generative procedure
but remember it was one in person hence
there's no possibility of communication
if this generative procedure produced
structures that were linked to
pre-existing conceptual systems that
individual could think that could plan
it could interpret interpret and so on
well that presumably yield some
selectional advantage a mutation can be
transferred to offspring usually is
partially at least and that means over
time there might have been enough people
in this small group so that somebody
would have gotten the idea that it's a
it might be useful to externalize it to
map this internal system into a
something that can be perceived by
others maybe sound maybe sign you know
maybe tactile whatever it might be
well that process of externalization is
a very tricky one the internal system
that developed notice would have had no
selectional pressures couldn't have it's
just something that happened internally
so therefore it would have developed
solely in terms of natural law it would
be something like a snowflake just takes
on a perfect form because there's
there's no external pressures on it so
you'd expect an internal system to
develop which is kind of like a
snowflake perfect in some sense and
since these are computational systems
what that would presumably mean is that
it's it's computationally efficient it
meets perfect conditions of
computational complexity well a certain
amount is known about computational
complexity
enough to set very strict conditions on
what that might be like so what we would
predict if if we're investigating
language is that there's an internal
system perfect in a sense that is as
computationally efficient as a system as
this guy can be which connects to the
two interfaces one of them the interface
the mapping to the thought thought
systems ken has no external forces
acting on it so that ought to be perfect
- and also invariant wouldn't change
because there's no pressures on the
other hand the mapping to the
sensorimotor system is quite complex
sensory motor system has been been
around for hundreds of thousands of
years pretty good evidence for them and
it had nothing to do with the internal
system so the finding the connection
between the internal system and the data
produced by the sensory motor system
that's a complex cognitive problem and
you can you can't expect it will be
solved in many different ways and in
fact it is that's the task faced by
every infant an infant gets some data
from the sensory motor system has to
figure out how to map it to what may
very well be a virtually invariant and
maybe perfectly doesn't design the
internal system of syntax and semantics
and as far as we know but at one of the
pretty hot via you know overwhelmingly I
mean the facts about language that are
getting better and better established as
research condition continues is that
while the externalization systems very
enormous lis and are pretty complex the
internal system the syntax and semantics
they seem close to invariant which is to
be expected because there's very little
evidence for them they're very much like
that one example that I gave you have
most no evidence for
so they must follow from rigid
principles which are there because
they're computationally efficient and
then may not have changed for let's say
seventy five thousand years whatever
they certainly haven't changed for fifty
thousand years well when you study a
language what do you study you study the
external is it externalization you learn
the sounds if you learn the arbitrary
word meaning associations not quite
arbitrary but somewhat you learn the
irregular verbs you learn the order of
words things like that those are all
parts of external ization you don't
learn the syntax and semantics semantics
if one thing nobody can teach it to you
because barely understood for another
thing you know it already it's part of
your nature and the same is true of the
child acquiring language that's roughly
the these are the general facts that we
observe they fit pretty well to this
story this picture and that looks like
the direction in which linguistic
inquiry or to go and it is internal to
what's called the generative enterprise
but quite separate from beliefs and
doctrines in the cognitive sciences
especially the computational cognitive
sciences and I stress again it's a kind
of a harsh judgment and I don't have
time to talk about it that there are
literally no results in the
computational cognitive science with
regard the language the huge literature
that if you look closely the only
results are in terms of this a novel
concept of scientific inquiry that I
mentioned and which has to do with
matching data not known in any other
field even in cognitive psychology well
there's there's a lot to say about this
piece get laid so I just make one final
point
any computational system whatever it is
has to have sort sort of atoms of
computation you know minimal elements
that are operated on by the
computational principles the silane
system you program for your laptop any
computational procedure so it has to be
true of language those are roughly word
like first approximation not really so
we take word words first approximation
to be the minimal atomic elements well
where do they come from here's something
else that one should be puzzled about
how our words related to the external
world the word likes a cow or person or
table or river or anyone you pick
there's a Dogma about this as there is
in most things connected with my
language the dogma is what's called the
referential is Dogma a child learns the
word cow because it sees a cow
somebody says cow and an association is
established between the cow and the word
and that's the meaning of the word again
the simplest invest investigations show
that this is totally false it's it's
interesting it's pretty much true for it
may be completely true for animal
communication every animal communication
system that's known consists of atoms
but finite number of them of course
which let's say which are tied to
particularly particular mind-independent
event events that a physicist could
describe so say a monkey vervet monkey
may have say five calls one of them is
we we call it a warning call it's
connected to the leaves moving in the
trees vervets please leave it leaves
moving the trees it emits this coal and
other vervets run away
or could be I'm hungry you know some
hormonal change which is identifiable
and as far as is known that's what
animal communication systems are like
it's completely false for human language
there are no mind independent properties
properties that would be identified by a
physicist that Carly with the words and
our constitute their meanings what
they're referred to in fact the meanings
of what words really just give kind of
perspectives cognitive perspectives that
you can employ in discussing and
referring to the world there's no kind
of good examples but it's literally true
couragous to everything actually this
was pretty well understood in the 17th
and 18th century that's been interesting
work on it's mostly forgotten well that
raises a very serious problem for one
thing it's a problem where these things
come from but how do they get into it
must be that their internal every child
knows them you know learn them can't
learn them very complex formula gether
they're invariant they're about if
they're different in various languages
with very minor differences and how did
they evolve that's a total mystery in
fact such such a deep mystery that it's
very possible that they'll never be any
insight into it well let me stop there
well we would like to thank professor
Chomsky very very much for this
opportunity to come to speak for us this
evening and we will open the floor for a
few questions so if you'd like to raise
your hand I can give you the microphone
any questions
Thank You professor uh my name is Frank
over here sorry okay hey yeah you talked
you were critical of what you call
gradualism an evolution of you were
critical of what you called gradualism
in evolution and how people think that
uh happens slowly over time and then you
talked about how 50,000 years ago
compared to now we've changed relatively
little I was just curious how how that
works they seem like contradictory ideas
to me I was just curious what you meant
by that
Wow what but but but why nothing changed
in 50,000 years well you said we haven't
really changed that much
barely yeah but then you uh I feel like
that is evidence of gradualism and I
feel like you were critical of graduate
against gradualism it goes against
gradual yeah if you know there's just
constant evolutionary change small
changes why should have stopped
somewhere before fifty thousand years
ago on the other hand if what happened
in human cognition is that some rigid
system were developed suddenly for
reasons having to do with not natural
law a mutation or rewiring the brain
computational complexity and so on but
then there's no reason to expect it to
change maybe it will change someday with
another mutation but there's no reason
to expect the small changes this doesn't
prove that evolution is not gradualist
it's just consistent with the view that
it isn't which we know anyway
Thank You professor for your very
generous talk um should a kind of a
reflection I sort of it um so I was
interested in one comment you made about
that kind of conscious and unconscious
processes and how the kind of the
functional aspect of your proposal is is
more or less non conscious whereas
there's a of a conscious component which
is like our everyday lived experience
which is not kind of going to be being
able to introspect upon this functional
system so I was wondering more on a
philosophical know what how exactly
we're supposed to think about phenomenal
experience and kind of conscious
experience in terms of its relationship
to functional relationships like you are
specifically your linguistic proposal
but then also other domain specific
proposals like perception there are
those who don't believe that perception
ISM is you know module modular domain
specific that it's embodied or something
to that effect so I want to feed any
proposed reflections on this kind of
research now and how this relates to
kind of our phenomenal lived experience
well it's a visual perception which is
relatively uncontroversial and take the
one example that I gave the rigidity
principle okay when when you're looking
at that sequence of the Kista scopic
presentations you perceive a rigid
object and motor in motion you can't
prevent yourself from perceiving that
that's what you perceive period which
are actually the stimuli that are
actually reaching your your your eyes
your retina are just a series of as few
as three or four presentations on it to
Kista scope you know screen with lights
of each of which has several dots on it
well you have no way of introspecting
into them your phenomenal experience is
a rigid object in motion but the stimuli
that are hitting the retina are a very
small number of presentations of a few
dots
you can't introspect into that the in
fact it's a that's why it's a discovery
you know it's kind of like the discovery
of the chemical structure of you know
coal coal or something
you can't introspect into it so the
phenomenal descriptions you know that
they're useful but they're useful as
data they tell you very little about
what's going on so it's kind of like
everything else in the world where you
have data but it didn't tell you much
about what's going on but that requires
that's why you have to take courses in
physics and chemistry and so on because
the data isn't transcript isn't
transparent and it's hard for people to
deal with but the same is true of our
conscious lives I mean we tend to take
for granted kind of like just normal but
that we can understand everything about
ours ourselves fact we don't understand
anything about ourselves it's just it's
even harder than understanding how
chemistry works because it's so much
more complex yet that's that's the
crucial step that the human sciences
really have not taken taken yet for the
most part that was taken in the Natural
Sciences around the 17th century just
the willingness to be puzzled about
things that look obvious like what could
be more obvious than if I fact it if I
let go of a cup it goes down instead of
up well you know Galileo was willing to
be puzzled about that that's why you
take physics courses before that all you
had to be told as things are going to
their natural place
and it's a big psychological step even
in studying the external world even
greater and studying ourselves because
there we sort of feel that we know
everything what's conscious must be what
there is and in the in philosophy modern
philosophy it's it's kind of a principle
it happened to be John Searle who I was
quoting but it's a widely accepted
principle that nothing can be a mental
process unless it's accessible to
consciousness and as I mentioned if you
look over the intellectual history it's
very hard to find anyone who departed
from this view okay well um take time
for one more question because it's
getting late and something over here a
tree is doing it yes professor um you
mentioned the the problems behind the
referential Dogma would you say that we
are in a if we reject that are we in a
situation that that Quine maybe puts us
in with the sorry are we in a situation
similar to coins indeterminacy of
translation would you would you say
that's where we're left well Quine
accepted the dogma but that's not
surprising because long as everybody
does today - yeah his his idea his
doctrine of indeterminacy was in fact
based on assuming this so if you take
his framework that there's nothing but
Association and conditioning how do how
do you know to take his example when you
hear a word let's say rabbit this is the
case when a child hears the word rabbit
how does it know that the word is
referring to the that animal running
around sorry and not to some part of the
animal because if you see the animal
running around its leg is also running
around so how does the child know that
it's not the leg and how does it not
know in fact that the word does
refer to some disconnected object like
the leg of this one that's a standard
problem of induction it's humans problem
of induction and as Hugh Munder stood
but his successors don't seem to
understand there's no way to solve that
problem Hume himself contrary to what
you may learn in a philosophy course was
a rationalist not an empiricist he took
for granted and says that the only way
you can solve the problem of induction
is by what he calls an animal instinct
means there must be some internal
structure in your mind that leads you to
a particular answer because there's no
way to get it by induction and that I
think is correct and I think the same is
be true about Cline's the Gallagher no
rabbit the child gets the right right
answer because they're built to get the
right answer and the right answer is not
a in the case of sake rabbit you can
easily show that what a child
understands to be a rabbit is not
something physically identifiable kind
of guessing your ages but to say my
grandchildren probably about you afraid
when they were kids the story that they
liked about a baby donkey named
Sylvester and socially note the baby
donkey somehow has turned into a rock
and for the rest of the story it's
trying to convince convince its parents
that it's not a rock it's their baby
donkey and since children's stories
always end happily something happens and
it ends up then it's a baby donkey again
everybody's happy but the interesting
fact is that every child understands
that that thing that has all the
physical properties of Iraq is in fact
so
and the reason is and this was in fact
noticed by John Locke that people in
fact animals are individuated by
properties like psychic continuity okay
you the same if you there's some psychic
continuity no matter how you change
physically that's the standard fairy
tale you know you know the evil witch
turns the handsome prince into a frog
and has all the properties of a frog
until til the beautiful princess comes
and kisses the Frog he's an some witch
you have some forensic again
well again every kid knows that it's
always the prince because it has the
property of psychic psychic continuity
actually a lot of science fiction is
based on this but it's even true of the
children's stories
well that alone tells you right away
that what individuals objects is not a
collection of physical properties but
some complex mental structure that we
oppose on them look like psychic
continuity and human didn't think about
that
lock in fact did but I should say human
recognized that was true that we don't
identify words by physical properties
but it runs across the whole collection
of words you can't find a word so simple
that it doesn't have those properties
actually in the Natural Sciences what
you try to do is to concoct you invent
concepts which do have those properties
so when you invent the concept say no
electron or something you intend it to
be physically identifiable you don't
want it to have its meaning change by
what's in your head that's the whole
point so it's a kind of a norm
for the sciences but it's not true of
human language and that goes back to
coins example the solution to his
problems essentially essentially Humes
Humes solution to the problem of
induction no solution except you're
built to pick things up to structure the
world in a certain way so that's the way
to do it well thank you so much
professor for giving us some insight
into your area of expertise
we like to present to you a small token
of our appreciation and we'd love to
have you back any time you'd have us so
ladies and gentlemen professor Noam
Chomsky
