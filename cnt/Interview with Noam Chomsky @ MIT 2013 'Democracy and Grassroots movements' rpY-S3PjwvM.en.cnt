so this is Chomsky and first of all
to discuss your political views with us
it's truly privileged to meet you and so
we would like to ask you what's your
view of the connections among political
parties the media and the creation of
put it balanced and more people well it
serve it's not identical and different
societies to take the United States but
there is the protection of freedom of
the press is very high in the United
States by a comparator standards it's
very little government can do to control
when they compress some things but not
much if you but there are other forms of
control which are less direct that one
of them has to do with the relationship
of importance so for example if you
studied in at journalism school you're
taught that is important to be objective
and there is a specific notion of
objectivity objectivity means reporting
accurately what goes on freezes within
the Beltway inside Washington so if you
describe correctly look to political
parties are saying that's objective if
you go outside that framework it's a
subjective for the bias improper or
absorb for the to pollute actually one
party it's a business party with two
factions so isn't there some variation
there
fringes but overwhelmingly it's
essentially a business party it's
official elected officials are put into
office by mostly private sector funding
the last election the presidential
election ran over 10 billion dollars
congressional elections huge amount of
funding and that personal effects it
gets into office and it affects what
they do because you're naturally the old
dear funders otherwise you won't get
back employs there has been a great rift
in the best 30 40 years it's part of the
whole deal with all the assault on the
population so present war in the United
States there it's often said that there
are no longer any moderate Republicans
which is not entirely true because the
NARC both hands are now mainstream
Democrats there's in each of the bar
teases and deeply in the pockets of the
corporate sector and the business world
and very often and there are good
studies of what this and that that means
that what they're discussing within the
Beltway reflects the concerns of the
business world overwhelmingly isotactic
right now for example is that on
domestic issues with a huge split
between the population and the political
class on what's important tailgate polls
very heavily pull
a lot about people's attitudes
overwhelmingly people think that would
be domestic problems we lack of jobs but
the big banks and investment firms and
financial institutions that they think
the big problem is deficits actually
deficits or not but the public's correct
about that the deficits and not much of
a problem if I even the markets are
making that clear so interest rates are
practically zero and still there's a
rush of purchases of Treasury securities
and so on though sign that investors
care one way or another about the
deficit but to make banks do so
therefore if you look inside the beltway
everything talks about death and with
nothing to add jobs you can see that in
the Congressional debates and political
discussion there are a few people at the
fringes you come to us lugs they both
work and others that continually point
out there was it's not a problem whose
jobs of the problem but that's really on
the fringes although he's a very
mainstream the finger Nobel laureate
economics couple others and that's
pretty typical and in fact there have
been a very careful studies of how
addict public attitudes related to
policy this is kind of mainstream
professional political science nothing
margins and it's been shown very
persuasively that
about seventy percent of the public has
no influence whatsoever on post that's
lowered or seventy percent in terms of
income and wealth levels so they're
effectively disenfranchised an effective
name done but a good so about half them
roughly half the electorate close to
that doesn't vote and it's biased
towards the less wealthy border sectors
of society partly they don't vote
because they ever to make that make it
hard for them to vote but Department a
Spurs in the open cousins anymore
evangeline sending stays of what Sanders
do show that they paid a lot of
attention to the Brooklyn top third of
the income level within their
constituencies some attention to the
middle third there's no attention the
Lord there in fact is you really look to
more fine-grained analyses it turns out
that it's really the very rich at the
very top over since we're getting what
they want and influence on posing the
climbs with that then you get to go over
so be presented to us 20 so that's
reflect that's reflected in what
political parties do well since the
media have to be objective is there
since that's what they reflect
may discover things that the population
cares about the difference it turned on
from Jews the main concern is what
matters to the business world so it's
why she loaded in this behavior it has a
business section two metal Labor's it
right now there's plenty of business
reporters there used to be labor
importers arrow inverter years but the
new influence from school probably not
accorded by the labor board that most of
the people who work Labour's business
that's what's important when you turn
the farm fairs it's the same oh so this
is this itself there's plenty of other
pressures but dis fact along yields a
mode of a group of an effort to create
consent how much it creates consent is
another question it's a separate
question but it may just lead to passive
in your resignation out of the system on
but I'm ain't do with me but it can take
sometimes almost pathological forms
allege a trooper Gower was very
interesting phenomena right but there is
a kind of a this is visit critique of
government from the left because of its
dependency young private concentrated
private power but is an acid protein
from the right which reversed
governments and NM and that's that
reflects a deep contempt for democracy
and you can see it very clearly in
attitude towards taxes so he had a
functioning democratic society paying
taxes would be something that makes you
happy you're like April fifteenth day
when your taxes are due would be a day
of celebration your funding the
activities that you decided on I'm
pretty well sort of but here is a day of
mourning because an alien force the
government is swooping down to take away
your order than money not part of the s
propaganda this huge business propaganda
to make people and hate and fear the
government in a very nuanced way
business once a powerful state the one
that works of them they don't want a
powerful state that works for the
general population so there's a kind of
a generalized hatred of government
leaves intact of the things that really
mattered the business world the
intellectual crowd erupts
government-funded research development
which goes into product least private
profit and so on but things that help
the public like no education health will
fare
these are constantly under threat so
professor Chomsky related to your points
about population and democracy I don't
think that grass root movements can act
to prevent this manipulation from
political parties and media and do you
think that there can be a way out from
this vicious loop well there's with an
arrow and a broad answer to that
question the narrow answer assumes the
current institutions remain basically
intact so we're not talking about
radical reform of existing institutions
under that assumption I was an enormous
amount of restrictions I can't do have
none so the in the United States and
Europe of the countries to the extent
that roughly social democratic policies
have been enacted by governments it's
almost entirely the impact of popular
movements which have compelled them to
act as of in the United States again the
the New Deal measures of the 1930s which
were beneficial old enough to remember
that first and Brad would change the
country but they're quite beneficial
they were the effect of large-scale
popular activism including firstly the
labor movement that's always been a
central Central grassroots organization
if you like to popular movement the 90
carries the the rise of the CIO
industrial unions and militancy of the
including up to sit-down strikes which
are really threatening to business
because that's just a step before taking
over the factors which is a rival teams
they led the aggressor it's activism
there was a moderately sympathetic
government but the brand the grassroots
activists held reforms which are quite
significant same sixties the civil
rights movement for example wasn't a
gift from above result of large-scale
popular mobilization it led to some
partial successes part it's important to
recognize as soon as civil rights
movement turn to class issues we was
smashed down moving Martin Luther King
but which that was his main concern but
get angry but that he give them the
United States isn't has it a very
inadequate in fact scandalous health
system it has something that's so what
it has that carry Medicaid that's the
result of the activism and 60s the same
person where I'm standing you can think
about right now say women to that's gay
rights and so on all the result of
grassroots popular activism so it's a
great field will be done in the narrow
sense in the broader sense it's
difference to me change in fact to an
extent that's happening so for example
at one way how out of the job crisis is
simply to have the worker on
enterprising they can be perfectly
successful and profitable alina a
multinational would rather see the work
done in himself Forrester China northern
Mexico something like that and that's
spreading not on a huge scale detectable
skill walk o'clock around Ohio
particularly but a couple of other
places there's a significant moves
towards the development of worker and
community on sometimes managed
enterprises they're further initiatives
underway we go I don't know but one of
the more activist labor unions and I've
steelworkers has entered into
interactions with Mondragon in the
Basque Country huge work around longer
but to try to initiate similar projects
in the United States okay that begins to
lead to real institutional change at
that point is a lot more that grassroots
movements can do so and are concrete
about right here near Boston about two
years ago there was a small successful
manufacturing plant in one suburbs which
was which the multinational mom did
wanted to close it down the Union
offered to buy it and have it work
around and managed for the multinational
that would be profitable better than
just closing it down but up just I think
manager classroom since they refuse they
don't like the idea
all the time well if there had been a
popular grassroots movement something
like that I Philippe occupy if it had
been there and been active it could have
provided the support to push this
through in which case you instead of
people we out of work that you'd have
functioning enterprise at home may be
managed by the workforce in the
community on a much larger scale they've
been an opportunity which didn't go
through because the lack of grassroots
movements that's the entire auto
industry couple years ago the auto
industry was large part of it was
virtually nationalized I was taken over
by the government over not one hundred
percent substantially and there were
several paths that could be taken at
that point that one is the path that was
taken then we use public funds to
restructure the industry and then head
back to the same basically the same
honors maybe some different faces on a
class basis the same owners and Helen
continue to do what they're doing before
in the produce cars another possibility
would have been two handed over to the
workforce on the communities and have
them produced with country needs which
is things like high-speed rail for
example that's absolute scandal in this
country you can take a high-speed train
from China to cause a stun but you can't
take one from Boston New York which is
the most heavily traveled car may be
anywhere could certainly in this country
the country desk badly needs it create
jobs very good to the environment
for the economy bad for profit and
having the industry which is a huge
industry over the work force of the
radical change well that would have been
a possibility but there was no public
support for that work Curtis roots
organizations mobilized to put pressure
for becomes like that which wouldn't
have been impossible the in fact at that
very time the Obama's Secretary of
Transportation Maria who was in Spain
trying to get contracts for high-speed
rail from Spanish manufacturers those
are things to be done here the US
industry instead of closing it down
creating a Rust Belt unemployed workers
towns cities decay and so on so their
play of alternatives and that's these
are these are be these are the places
with the rest with movements can go
beyond the narrow changes and really
lead to significant student change
there's no different limits today that
can end up can end up being
revolutionary change as you may know
then marks for example speculated that
in the parliamentary democracies here
mostly England in mind it might be
possible to go all the way to a comic
kind of comment stating envision just by
parliamentary means and it's not
inconceivable if you had substantial
popular activist movements that's why
there's such major efforts to destroy
this is a huge attack on unions in the
United States and it goes right through
American history but every time there's
an upsurge in union organizing
in it activism was almost immediately
have a major backlash against me since
the second world war has been an
unremitting class war an attack opinions
and using every means available media
cinema threats with violence of the
illegal techniques of strike breaking
cooperation from the government by just
not unfortunate lately lords and so on
and by now it's been pretty effective at
private sector immunizations now about
seven seven percent now the major attack
on public sector unions which is stood
up and you can see the reason the unions
have typically been one of the few ways
in which were very passive population
can pool I can join together in order to
achieve Luxio result that's worst
concentrated our don't love them take
care going back to what you were
suggesting that the government and the
parties and certain private sectors
sometimes try to attack is a grassroots
movement now we are basically
experiencing that we are something that
the phase were usually we are labeled
with different names on they are trying
to and say that we are awfully stole
things like that now so i will always
wondering we were wondering if you had
something to say about this common
strategies that well it stands to reason
but concentrated
or is not going to want to have popular
opposition that's why the massive
efforts of all kinds are made to control
the Pope that goes back as far back in
history as you want to go for much of
human history it was done by violence
just words they driving people off the
land enclosures and so on but by the
late 19th century early 20th century and
number of countries is being enough
freedom had been won by popular struggle
so that was getting harder to control
people by violence and therefore it was
understood by constant power sectors
that's necessary returned other means
the other means our control of attitudes
and opinions and it's what you see is
that in the freest societies a hundred
years ago that meant written in the
United States in the free societies you
had a UH the beginnings of an enormous
growth of industries devoted to what
they called engineering content
controlling the population controlling
attitudes and beliefs marginalizing
people by driving them to quote the
business breast try to drive people to
superficial things in life like
fashionable consumption just keep them
away from our affair we have to run the
world just keep them out of our hair
keep them away the
herschel advertising which is an
enormous industry is devoted once
entirely to that creating once creating
irrational consumers actually strongly
opposed to market she has taken a
economics course you know that markets
are supposed to be based on rational
uninformed consumers making rational
choices if you ever turn violent
television set an ad you know that's the
farthest thing from them on they're
trying to create unemployment consumers
making irrational choices but ones that
will keep people marginalized separated
from one another atomized disorganized
and not not trying to interfere with our
control than ever we have to be of the
Westons private capital mostly
increasingly financial capital our
control of the system so of course the
penetrator and these are huge industries
large part of the economy is to vote
this and the media are part of it in our
own way partly for the reasons I
mentioned partly just because in the
media after all our large corporation
they're part of the corporate system
they're closely linked to state power
and then soon people who participate in
the media are graduates of universities
which are here imposing doctrinal
beliefs not challenging them and so on
so you have a massive system trying to
prevent the code from the organized the
which makes perfect sense first you know
the constant talked about the love of do
not
but perfectly obvious standing like that
works but I hate democracy you can see
if not owning their own countries have
it takes a the Arab Spring I mean the
rhetoric hidden government in media
electricals and so on is which is
delighted to seeing the upsurge of Arab
democracy in reality that terrified of
our up democracy and you can see exactly
when they've done everything possible to
try to block it for very sensible
reasons just take a look at the the
studies of public opinion done by
Western by us calling agencies in the
Arab world I mean the last thing that
West wants is for those attitudes to
become both a bomb on for example on the
main issues of concern to the United
States like you ran the hair public does
not regard your ends a threat they don't
like it but they don't regard as a
threat the threat they see is the United
States and Israel we don't want that
turned into policy this strong
opposition to the neoliberal programs
certainly don't want that turned into
policy so democracy is a dangerous
threat as the undermind prevent it and
one aspect of this is just me to
describe trying to undermine vilify
disintegrates popular movements of Jorah
the way in which the public entered into
affecting and determining policy for bad
thing
one of you
