i define well being in traditional
philosophical terms and I say that
because of course there are now
empirical inquiries well-being studies
and happiness studies economists survey
interested in this question now about
how you quantify well-being but the
traditional philosophical debate says
that well-being is a state of
flourishing of feeling that one is
living in a way that is satisfying that
it has movement towards really
worthwhile goals and the achievement of
them making progress towards that and of
having satisfaction in things that are
very central to a life that feels good
to live I'm economists knew to expect me
to say that well beings about economic
growth and we maximize well-being by
maximizing gross domestic product which
is what politicians obsess apart
actually that isn't how things are I
think know economists have thought that
gdp was actually a measure of well-being
it's a measure of material art pulled
and is one component of well-being I
think and I think most economists will
take the view that actually well-being
is a multi-dimensional concept with many
components of which a GDP material
standard of living is certainly one but
it's only one element of a complex
package I think well-being is a sense of
comfort in your own skin too many people
are going to elevate well-being to be an
absence of any kind of pain at all and I
don't think that should be the test I
think it's about being comfortable
within yourself and that inevitably
involves being comfortable with in your
society within your community and that
means that your community has to be a
place that is tolerant and compassionate
I worry about the concept of well-being
because I feel that it's a it's a way of
concentrating on the eye on the
individual on this sort of narcissism
that sometimes is
an indicator of the predominant view in
our society and forgetting the the sense
in which the individual only thrives in
a situation in which there is a degree
of solidarity it's kind of like love or
anger and you understand that if you
feel it but you can't really define it
it's the sense that what you're doing
somehow satisfies your inner needs
whatever they happen to be what I was
thinking that Dante after he goes
through hell climbs the mountain of
purgatory and at the very top in the
earthly paradise he finds two rivers one
river is Lethe forgetfulness when you
drink of that river you'll forget
everything we know about that the other
river is one that Dante invented and
it's called you know II you know means
good mind and when he drinks of that all
that's left to him are good memories
what I choose to think of these good
memories is not simply retrospective but
as good knowledge well actually Karl
Marx once made a distinction between
animal needs and human needs the Society
of well-run society community should
make sure that people's animals needs
are satisfied you should have I don't
need to have to quote it take a look at
the article 25 the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights spells it out pretty
well after they should it should provide
the opportunity for people to discover
who they are what their inner nature is
to have an opportunity to pursue it to
the degree which is maximal which allows
them to create their own future and
realize its potentialities what I think
there's a very small thing that could be
done in this country for example and
that is I think that music and dance and
the arts should be restored to the core
school curriculum I think that's one
thing we should do
from an economic point of view I think
there's one thing we should do that
would increase well-being which is to
stop talking about the economy and
having this idea that there is something
out there called the economy that needs
to be kind of fed and propitiated and we
should ask whether things are good for
the economy we should stop asking
whether things are good for the economy
we should ask whether they're good for
citizens and people for me well being is
only going to be preserved for the
individual if you actually look at all
individuals and society and I think our
societies are turning into much harder
places we're taking the heart out of our
societies particularly in well developed
democracies we are absolutely elevating
the individual at the expense of the
community there is a great diversity in
human nature and human interests and
needs and desires there's not a
one-size-fits-all answer to the question
what would make people happy what would
help people to get this sense of
flourishing and therefore to give them
the opportunity the space to pursue that
opportunity to make a life that feels
purposeful and meaningful for each
individual to create those relationships
which are really crucial to well-being
that I think would be the key thing
