from a cultural and ideological point of
view it's pre interesting to split the
history so if you go back to the
Enlightenment and the origins of
classical liberalism and say people like
Adam Smith or David Hume and others they
simply took it for granted that
solidarity a sympathy mutual aid work or
elements of human nature
they were the driving forces in human
nature in fact take Adam Smith's famous
phrase invisible and the way it's
interpreted is almost diametrically
opposite to the way he used it in fact
he barely used it but in one of them
only twice actually and in one case
which is directly related to this here's
what he argues he says he was thinking
of an agricultural economy of course so
he said suppose some landowner
accumulates almost all the land so
everybody else has to essentially be his
servant he says well this really won't
matter very much because the landowner
by virtue of his sympathy for other
people and concern for their needs will
make sure that property is distributed
so that it will be relatively equal so
as if by an invisible hand we'll end up
with a fair and relatively egalitarian
society not a very powerful argument but
it shows the kind of driving concept
that underlies the classical liberalism
enlightenment ideals and so on now all
of that ended with capitalism Adam Smith
and David Hume and others are basically
pre-capitalist capitalist ideology is
different it's get which can for
yourself and kick everyone else in the
face and now it's claimed that that's
human nature is it I don't think so
I think Adam Smith David Hume and others
were basically correct this is a
distorting ideology which is imposed on
us and undermines normal human emotions
and interactions highly dystopian
deceitful and going back to the
environmental crisis that's what's
causing us to race over the precipice
and when ExxonMobil executives say okay
let's lie about the fossil fuels they're
saying they're actually what they're
doing is pursuing what Adam Smith
denounced as in his words the vile Maxon
of the Masters of mankind all for
ourselves and nothing for anyone else
let's take the Occupy movement one of
their achievements in fact I think one
of most important ones has just been to
create communities of solidarity mutual
support Democratic participation that's
a very important achievement in fact
particular in a society like ours which
is kind of almost designed to isolate
people and separate them from one
another to the great techniques of
control of course performing communities
based on solidary sure that's very
important as I guess not now that's the
reason why the labor movement from its
origins has been concerned with
solidarity that's one of its main
slogans we're going to work together we
ought to work together because we ought
to be helping and one another but that's
the only way in which we're going to
confront concentrated power
