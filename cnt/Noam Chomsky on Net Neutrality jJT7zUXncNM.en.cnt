the Internet is technically free and
open which is a good thing but and I
hope it stays that way but you know you
can't overcome the fact that there are
the concentrations of power have ways of
directing use of the Internet in towards
their own concerns and interests the pop
ups the advertising the endless number
of ways right now a live issue is
whether the corporation's to whom the
internet was given it was developed
within the public domain for about 30
years then handed over to corporations
free gift whether they will be allowed
to determine the providers will be
allowed to determine who gets easy
access and who gets difficult access
that's my district right now if they win
that battle they have much more control
over the internet but the struggle to
keep the internet free and open is quite
important it's been a valuable tool has
its downside in a valuable tool and very
valuable tool undoubtedly one of the
great contributions of the Pentagon and
I got funding for decades
