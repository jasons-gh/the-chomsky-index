there are by now literally thousands of
pages of documentation detailed
documentation case studies and so on
which have put the model that to a test
in the harshest ways than anybody can
dream up I'll talk about some of the
ways of doing it later or you know in
discussion if you want but I think it's
been subjected to quite a fair test in
fact a very harsh test there's no
challenge to it as far as I know if
there is I've missed it
the few cases where there's any
discussion of it the level of argument
is so embarrassingly bad that just tends
to reinforce the implausibility of the
model in fact I think it's fair to say
that this is one of the best confirmed
theses in the social sciences but in
accord with its predictions it's off the
agenda you can't even discuss it well
what I ought to do now is what has to be
done of course actually not in a talk
and that is to turn to cases you know
method you know ask how you could test
it what the results are and so on and
there's plenty of material in print and
more coming out in which we can check
and see whether you convinced that in
fact it's plausible or accurate my
feeling as it is I'll just give a couple
of illustrative cases and let me stress
that I do this with some reluctance
because the illustrative cases are
misleading they suggest that maybe it's
a sporadic phenomenon in fact when
somebody gives you a couple of cases you
rightly ask whether there are an
adequate sample you know maybe they were
just selected to work so you ought to be
suspicious about isolated cases that's
why the model has in fact been tested
for many approaches but that misleading
necessity aside because I can't do more
than that let me give you a couple of
cases to illustrate the kind of thing I
think you will find if you pursue the
question of fact let's take something
that you'd certainly expect the media to
be concerned with namely freedom of
press they got a professional interest
in that and in fact there's a good deal
of discussion of freedom of press in the
media in the keeping just to the last
decade the problems of the press in
repressive societies has been very
widely discussed many examples the
the case that has been by far the most
discussed in fact I suspect it has been
discussed more than all questions of
media freedom of the press throughout
the entire world during this period is
the one newspaper in Latin America that
99% of the literate population would be
able to name if they were asked to name
a newspaper in Latin America namely La
Prensa in Nicaragua
there has been an overwhelming amount of
reporting on the tribulations of La
Prensa in Nicaragua one media analyst
Francisco Goldman who studied the
freedom of press in these countries
pointed out that in four years he found
about 260 references to this in the New
York Times that's an incredible amount
of coverage I'm sure I don't think
anybody done the study but try it if
anybody wants I'm sure you'll find that
this is more coverage than has been
given to problems all other problems of
the freedom of press combined all over
the world probably by a considerable
factor anyhow that's the one you know
that's the famous case and this coverage
has been very irate and angry because of
the tribulations of La Prensa for
example when let's go back to the moment
when Ronald Reagan succeeded in
convincing Congress to vote a hundred
million dollars in aid so that we have a
war a real war in violation of the
demand of the World Court that the
United States consider its stopped
terminate its unlawful aggression right
after that after the government
announced that now we finally got a war
a real war the government of Nicaragua
suspended La Prensa and that caused
tremendous outrage in the United States
there's a group of the distinguished
group of journalism fellows at Harvard
the Nieman Foundation and they
immediately gave their award for the
year to Violeta Chamorro the editor of
La Prensa to express their solidarity
with her in this moment of crisis and to
show how deeply committed they are to
freedom of the press the Washington Post
had an editorial right after that called
newspaper of Valor in which they said
Violeta Chamorro should receive ten
awards not one award the New York Review
of Books had an article by
left-liberal correspondent Murray
Kempton appealing to people to
contribute funds to keep the you
know friends alive during this period
those funds could then be added on to
the CIA subvention that had kept the
journal going since the Carter
Administration in 1979 right after the
Sandinista revolution succeeded and in
fact in general there was great frenzy
and hysteria about this terrible attack
on freedom of the press well let's look
a little more closely first of all what
is la prensa laprincia is a journal
which calls for the overthrow of the
government of Nicaragua by a foreign
power which funds it and which is trying
to overthrow the government of Nicaragua
it's an interesting fact you might check
the history of the West to see whether
there's ever been any such thing for
example you might ask whether a major
newspaper in the United States the
wealthiest newspaper in the United
States was funded by the Nazis in 1943
calling for the overthrow of the
government of the United States and you
might ask yourself what would have
happened if that was possible well you
can get the answer very quickly even
tiny little newspapers which weren't
funded by anybody and it raised
questions about conscientious objection
and so on they were censored and
controlled and suppressed and so on
during the first world war was even more
vicious we didn't actually put a
presidential candidate in jail for ten
years after the first world war because
he had he had declared opposition to the
draft the the so the in fact there's
nothing comparable to this in the
history of the West anymore and in world
history altogether now La Prensa is
described in the United States as the
journal that opposed Somoza in fact
there was a journal called La Prensa
which did oppose the Somoza regime
courageously its editor was in fact
murdered and had the same name as this
journal of Prensa and it's described as
the same journal but is that true well
it's a little tricky at this point
certainly has the same name in 1980 the
owner
laprincia decided to convert the journal
into a government into a journal
dedicated to the overthrow of the
government at that point they fired the
editor the brother of the editor who had
been murdered under Somoza and there was
a split in the staff 80% of the staff
left with the editor and formed the new
journal only the audio which is the
successor of the old la prensa at least
if a newspaper is defined by its editor
and its staff not of course if it's
defined by the money that's behind it
supplied by the CIA then you have a
different answer to what's the old la
prensa and that incidentally is also
something that's never discussed but
suppose that's true let's suppose it's
just the CIA Journal and in fact that
there's no parallel to it in history of
the West or that being true calling for
the overthrow of the government funded
by the outside power superpower that is
trying to overthrow the government well
nevertheless a true civil libertarian
would defend La Prensa from harassment
I think somebody really believes in
civil liberties should say yes England
should have permitted the press to be
dominated by Nazi Germany in 1942 and if
they didn't do it
that shows they don't believe in freedom
that's the position of a real civil
libertarian and that's the position of
the American intellectual community with
regard to La Prensa and now at this
point we ask the obvious question is
this passionate commitment to freedom of
the press based on libertarian
enthusiasms and passions or is it based
on service to the state well as a way of
answering that question in fact we all
know the way of answering that question
it's a question that we regularly ask or
don't even bother asking because the
answer is so obvious when we look at
propaganda of our enemies so you take a
look at the productions of say the World
Peace Council which is a communist front
peace organization or the East German
Peace Committee you know the government
Peace Committee you read that material
and you'll find that there's all sorts
of descriptions they're generally valid
descriptions of crimes and atrocities
and repression in the United States are
committed by the United States and its
agents and so on and great outrage over
the
is hard often that materials accurate
and often in fact its material it's not
reported here well do we praise them for
their you know libertarian passions no
we first ask a question we ask how do
they deal with repression and atrocities
carried out but Soviet Union and its
clients where they are and the ones
they're responsible for well as soon as
we get the answer to that question we
dismiss the whole story with contempt
and ridicule properly even if there are
charges are accurate that's a fair test
and we ought to have the honesty
to apply the same test to ourselves so
let's do it we now ask the same question
about the defenders of Liberty of press
in the case of La Prensa New York Times
The Washington Post New York Review of
Books the educated community and so on
the Neiman fellows and so on how do we
test that well we look at same test we
look at cases of repression of freedom
of the press in our domains and we ask
how they've reacted and there are many
such cases very close by in fact so take
el Salvador El Salvador had independent
newspapers at one time doesn't have many
longer
