again these lights are super bright well
what's it like being a Sufi sage pardon
what's it like like being a Sufi sage
and Sufi sage just I promised that I
would do something different than
introducing him but you ended that very
cheerful talk did I miss something
all are trapped by an institutional
logic that is deeply pathological and
that must be cured and quickly if we are
not to put an end to the human race how
do we go about doing that it's easy it's
all in our hands in the case of nuclear
weapons actually the answer is known
there are ways to end the threat of
nuclear weapons
furthermore as many of you know it's a
an obligation of the nuclear weapons
States to carry out good faith measure
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons
totally that's article 6 of the
non-proliferation treaty of 1970
that's furthermore a legal obligation as
the International Court of Justice ruled
some years later in 1996 and those
efforts could be carried out and
unfortunately we're going in the
opposite direction so President Obama
has recently announced a trillion dollar
program to modernize and upgrade our
nuclear weapons at capacity our attack
capacity other other powers are acting
more or less similarly they there are
policies being conducted right now I
mentioned Ukraine but it's not the only
one
that are bringing the global situation
to the point where it might lead to a
perhaps accidental Brax perhaps intended
nuclear strike incidentally it's been
known for many years decades that if a
power launches a nuclear strike first
strike it will be destroyed by the
effects of the nuclear explosions so
there's no escape
it's any nuclear war that between any
powers with any capacity will lead to
virtual extermination we know how to end
it but the steps that are being
conducted are in the opposite direction
and there have been some potential
unfortunately aborted efforts to
implement steps that would reduce the
danger so one major threat right now has
to do with Iran in the United States
it's commonly claimed by high officials
commentators and others that Iran is the
greatest threat to world peace it's kind
of interesting to compare this with
global opinion there are polls of global
opinion taken by US polling agencies
Gallup hold major won the most recent
about a year ago did ask people around
the world which country is the greatest
threat the world peace
the United States won by a huge margin
nobody else was even close a second was
Pakistan which was probably inflated by
the Indian vote but that's but
fortunately Americans are spared
knowledge of these facts the press
refused to report them but they're facts
nevertheless anyway here it's Iran
that's the greatest threat to world
peace there's interesting questions the
one can ask about just what the threat
is but let's say there's a threat
whatever it may be is there a way to end
it yeah there are ways to end it if I
don't you want me to go into it but
there were kind of stick to the five
five-minute lecture but there have been
potential steps which have been blocked
by the United States that's unfortunate
anyway in the case of nuclear weapons we
know how to end the problem it's
feasible it's a matter of implementing
policies that are understood and they
could be carried out if there were
sufficient popular pressure to compel
them to be carried out the populations
of the world care about survival their
leaders typically don't they care about
power and we can influence those
decisions particularly in countries like
this more free and open societies with
regard to an environmental catastrophe
it's not so obvious that there's a
solution there are measures that can be
undertaken to mitigate the threats and
maybe to overcome them that's an open
question but again policy is going in
the opposite direction what I quoted
from The Wall Street Journal is
unfortunately pretty typical they read
it in the business presses of the
business pages of the press across the
spectrum York Times Financial Times
others plenty of euphoria about how the
United States can become the Saudi
Arabia of the 21st century it can
achieve energy independence we can flood
the world with oil all great and Wonder
well the price of oil is going down
which is great
it means good for American consumers who
can drive more and all of these
marvelous things are simply very
straightforwardly driving us towards a
precipice which will fall over which
will be extremely harmful may be
devastating for generations not very far
away the generation of our grandchildren
much worse of course for the poorer
countries but also here well senator
cotton of Arkansas is one of the many
intellectual Giants in debt
esteemed legislature legislative body
recently announced that we do have a
great deal to fear from Iran because
they control Tehran I know that's pretty
super but you should add that if you
read The Washington Post this morning
you'll discover that senator cotton
who's got a real pedigree even graduated
from Harvard is positioning himself to
be the future foreign policy specialist
of the Republican Party taking the
mantle of McCain and Graham he has other
interesting warnings I don't know how
much he followed his career but when he
was running for Senate in Arkansas he
warned the citizens of Arkansas that the
Mexican drug cartels are linked to Isis
and joined together they are working to
send terrorists across the border into
the United States where they can kill
citizens of of Arkansas and of course
all of this is the Fort fall a fault of
President Obama with leaving a porous
border and so on if that's true we
should move that clock to two minutes to
midnight yeah election in Israel
Netanyahu won a third consecutive term
his fourth overall Haymarket author
Electronic Intifada co-founder Ali
Abunimah says Netanyahu's good for the
Palestinians why because he's very clear
no Palestinian state no compromise
hadiths correspondent
Amira Hass sees only cosmetic
differences between the two major
Israeli parties and she says that they
now moribund two-state solution is
actually a ten state solution a bunch of
Bantu stance she says inside the West
Bank what's your view on what happened
in Israel well what happened is that one
question is how much difference there is
between the camp between the parties um
they're all pretty much on the right
others the there was a very minor sort
of peace party merits got four seats
barely made past the admissions point
the there is the Arab party which is the
third largest but that's pretty much
excluded from any coalition just on
racist grounds no coalition will accept
the Arab party as a important
constituent but there are some
differences one difference is if you
read Netanyahu's appeal to the
electorate which carried him to victory
after rather tepid polling results it
was a combination of outright racism and
extreme fear mongering so you've
probably read in the papers he warned
the electorate that Arabs Arab citizens
of Israel are being driven to the polls
by leftists with support from foreign
governments all in an effort to
undermine his policy of defending Israel
from you know terrorists so on and so
forth
and that combination of fear-mongering
and racism does work it worked in Israel
we
not unfamiliar with it here and it's a
very it's a very dangerous sign about
the nature of Israeli society which has
been drifting very far to the right and
it's a this is a this is a major nuclear
weapons state it's a violent state
that's carried out lots of aggression
it's a direct violation of international
law and the occupied territories that's
accepted essentially by the entire world
with the exception of Israel in the
United States and it can be an extremely
danger it is already a very dangerous
state can be much more so as to the of
and I'm an Emir Hassan Cluj ins I think
they're slightly I don't think they're
analyzing the situation quite accurately
the there's it's widely argued not just
by them across the board by you know
Israeli analysts Palestinians others
that there are two options either a
two-state settlement in accord with the
overwhelming international consensus
which includes essentially everyone
outside the United States and Israel
that's one possibility and the other
possibility is supposed to be what's
called a one state solution
Israel takes over the whole of the
former Palestine Jordan to the sea and
then there will be what in Israel is
called a demographic problem too many
Arabs in a Jewish state that pretty soon
in fact maybe majority from the
Palestinian Palestinians who and
Palestinian supporters like the one used
you mentioned who regard this positively
say well then it'll be possible to carry
out an anti-apartheid struggle a civil
rights struggle to call for the rights
of Palestinians within this one state
the problem of that analysis is that
these are not the two options the two
options are quite different one up the
sec
option one state is not an option there
is no possibility reasonable possibility
that Israel will take over the whole
territory and face this demographic
problem they don't want it
the second option alternative to two
states is something quite different it
is what is exactly happening before our
eyes there are policies being
implemented daily right before our eyes
we can see them we can see where they're
directed they've been in motion for
almost half a century and their purpose
is clear what they're doing the policies
tako first of all they Israel is taking
over has taken over at what it calls
Jerusalem that's an area about five
times the size of historic Jerusalem
that includes substantial areas of the
West Bank
many former our villages were supposed
to be an internationalized territory
Israel has taken it over in all the
parties except for the very far out ones
are saying yes this is an indivisible
permanent capital of Israel that's one
thing then if you look at the
development programs which are pretty
systematic very obvious one of them
developed is developing a corridor
extending east of Jerusalem to include a
large town mollado Miam was built mostly
during the Clinton years its purpose is
to subdivide the West Bank to part
virtually partition it the borders of
mala domain reached virtually to Jericho
which will be left in Palestinian hands
that's right at the border so as a
corridor extending to the east
pretty much bisecting the West Bank if
you look at the map there are other
corridors to the north including other
new Israeli towns REO whom they break up
the region further in addition Israel is
taking over it's committed to taking
over everything that's within the
so-called separation wall
it's an annexation wall
declared illegal by the World Court by
international opinion but the US
continues to support the policies
doesn't matter that's a large part of
the arable land that excludes the
Palestinians from their farms orchards
and so on furthermore Israel is
systematically taking over the Jordan
Valley that's roughly a third of the
West Bank much of its arable land
Palestinians are being steadily expelled
by one or another pretext sometimes
simply thrown out Jewish settlements are
being established that wells are sunk
and so on
the traditional method for a hundred
years now of ultimately incorporating
some region inside Israel well you look
at that pattern and you can see what's
happening the the Israel is carrying out
a perfectly reason intelligent program
intended to integrate into Israel
everything that might be of any value in
the West Bank but to exclude the
Palestinian population the areas that
Israel's taking over don't have many
Palestinians and those who were there
are being largely expelled that will
leave the Palestinian population in some
kind of limbo
not not within Israel no no demographic
problem no one state Palestinians lose
everything that's the live alternative
there is no serious alternative that
anyone has made any meaningful case for
to think that there could be one state
unfortunately this is the assumption
that's made across the board but if you
think it through you can see that it's
extremely unlikely of the likely
alternative to a state state settlement
is why I just described the policies
that are now being implemented what
could stop them actually one thing it's
an
hands of the United States as long as
the you know the United States
officially objects to these policies so
the official US policy says it's
unhelpful to peace but the u.s.
continues to support them it's providing
the military economic diplomatic support
for them even the ideological support
for them by the way the issues are
framed in the United States which is
quite different from the rest of the
world as long as the United States
continues to support the policies there
is no reason to expect Israel to
withdraw from them whether it's
Netanyahu or Isaac Eric's or anyone else
there are some differences in the
policies the racist and extremely
alarmist rhetoric of Netanyahu's not
shared by others so there's some
differences but a mirror house is
correct and saying that they're not
fundamental differences in New Mexico
under US law Native American and Spanish
land grant heirs have lost common lands
and acequia water rights have been
separated from the land for commercial
use what hope for the future do you see
from traditional people's continuing to
defend the rights of the Commons and the
shared use of natural resources rather
than exploitation for profit
well again same story it's up to you
these are decisions that the American
population can make in the case of the
United States and of course as we all
know this has been going on for 500
years 400 years ever since the first
English settlers came there's been a
steady attack on the Indian nations
driving them out of their lands
exterminating them expelling them
sending in the reservations it's been
that's American history there are two
fundamental profound crimes in American
history the one is
expulsion or extermination of the
indigenous population the others of
course slavery with its impact still
remaining the United States is as is
what's called a separ colonial society
that's an unusual form of imperialism
it's a form of imperialism in which the
imperial power originally England
settles the country that is being taken
over drives out or exterminates the
population that's a extreme form of
imperialism it's true of the what's
called the Anglo sphere the countries
that sort of extend it out of England
through the United States Canada
Australia New Zealand almost they didn't
quite exterminate the indigenous
population that's an unusual form of
imperialism very for the indigenous
people a very dangerous one and yes
they're fighting back and they need
support however there's another point
that ought to be made about preservation
of the Commons that's back to climate
change the Commons are the environment
in which we live if the Commons are
privatized if they're handed over to
Exxon Mobil and Chevron and so on and
we're dead for the reasons that I've
just mentioned we're pretty obvious if
the Commons are preserved for the common
good we have a possibility of surviving
if you look around the world almost
everywhere it's the indigenous
populations which are in the lead in
trying to protect the Commons from
destruction by the industrial capitalist
powers primarily China others so in
Canada it's the First Nations in
Australia is the Aboriginal people in
India it's tribal people all around the
world
the countries that have substantial
indigenous majority's populations have
actually taken steps towards trying to
preserve the Commons Bolivia for example
which actually has rights of nature
written into its constitution Ecuador
made an interesting effort to keep some
of its oil in the ground where it ought
to be if the rich countries the European
countries would pay Ecuador a fraction
of the profit that it would have
received from marketing the fossil fuels
the rich countries refused so now
they're doing also destroying valuable
forests it's a pretty striking fact
which ought to really shame us that it's
the indigenous peoples who have been
driven to the margins of survival who
are in the lead in trying to protect us
from the folly that we are now carrying
out which is very likely to destroy the
possibilities of decent survival that's
the most crucial aspect of protecting
the Commons the day after the big
climate March in New York and September
the very next day the Rockefeller
Brothers fund the Rockefeller Brothers
fund disinvested from fossil fuels you
can't miss the significance of that
given John D Rockefellers background is
is this the start of a major movement in
terms of divestment from fossil fuel
corporations I was in Portland Oregon
recently and an activist told me this is
one of the hottest issues on campuses
from Stanford to Harvard yeah MIT my on
campus it's a hot issue on campuses and
yes it's important it's in a way
symbolic but significant these are some
of the steps that can be made to impede
the race to the press
how important it is will like everything
else depends on people like you would
you do something about it I want to talk
to you about two ships one fictional and
one real the Pequod and Moby Dick and
the Titanic I think it was Edward Sayid
right on this stage who years ago talked
about the monomaniacal urge of Ahab to
destroy Moby Dick no matter what and to
take the crew down with him it was of no
concern to him and what do you think
about that metaphor that Moby Dick is
nature and that a hab is out there's an
out of control kind of capitalism and
that when it comes to the Titanic the
reforms that are offered up by the
centers of power are merely cosmetic
they're moving deck chairs on the
Titanic recycle your cardboard drive a
Prius and things like that sorry to
Prius drivers well like any kind of
models and metaphors there's some point
but some differences the crucial we are
not being I mean you might say that
Hitler was an Ahab let's say he was
especially toward the end of the war he
was dedicated to continuing the war even
if Germany was totally destroyed and it
was the fault of the Germans if they
didn't succeed in winning the war okay
that's a hab like in a way but the in
our case it's somewhat different it
really is institutional logic it's not a
matter of individuals those CEOs who
voted in the Davos poll if you asked
them personally
maybe they contribute the Sierra Club
and maybe they're in favor of divestment
but in their institutional role as
managers of major corporations they have
a duty in fact a requirement even a
legal requirement to maximize profit and
market share and to ignore what
economists call externalities the impact
of a transaction on others that doesn't
enter into market calculations well in
this case the externality happens to be
the survival of the grandchildren but
they cannot in their institutional role
attend to that problem because their
task is to maximize profit and market
share there's some range of choices of
course and there's some variation among
corporations as to how they operate
but this overwhelming institutional
property happens to be lethal in its
nature it cannot continue if we're going
to serve and survive in the case of
state power it's not dissimilar quite
typically states governments regard
their own populations as a major enemy
the Snowden revelations for example will
reveal the extent to which the US
government regards the u.s. population
as an enemy which has to be monitored
and controlled the pretext of defending
terrorism as very weak as you may recall
when the Snowden revelations came out at
first that was claimed by the government
that 50 over 50 terrorist acts had been
prevented by the NSA surveillance under
inquiry they reduced it to maybe a dozen
or so under further inquiry it was
finally reduced to one one case someone
had sent $8,500
to Somalia that was the net yield of
this massive program which is a program
aimed at the population to ensure their
control and obedience and that's very
typical of governments and
understandable the leadership is
committed to power the state power if
you think through the record of nuclear
policy and sampled it if you look in
detail it's much worse but the record is
one of an astonishing record of
disregard for the safety welfare of the
population and steps in order to enhance
state power that's the way powerful
institutions function and these things
have to be to overcome institutional
pathologies is a lot harder than
overcoming an individual pathology in
the case of Ahab you know you can throw
them into the ocean or you submit them
to psychoanalysis or institutionalize
them there are remedies but in the case
of institutional pathology it's far more
serious as for rearranging the deck
chairs on the Titanic it's it's not a
bad image but but there are some steps
being taken that are not insignificant
the development of the solar energy for
example is proceeding there are major
efforts to try to block it but it's
proceeding unfortunately this is not the
center of where it's proceeding the
major production of solar panels is in
China and this means sophisticated ones
they're at the cutting edge of advanced
technology and solar panel production
should be here but some steps are being
taken there are some environmental rules
but by and large the primary thrust of
policy is in the wrong direction years
ago the philosopher John Dewey said
politics is the shadow
on society by big business how would you
would evaluate that shadow today in
light of citizens united and McCutcheon
vs. FEC and other Supreme Court rulings
well do his comment was accurate it
extends way back back in the 1950s
somebody will remember there was a equip
I think maybe it came from see right
mills I don't remember which said that
the United States is a one-party state
of the business party which has two
factions Democrats and Republicans and
that was pretty accurate at the time but
it's less accurate today the United
States is still a one-party state the
business party but there's really only
one faction the Republican Party has
pretty much departed from being a
functioning parliamentary organization
that's not just my judgment the very
highly respected conservative political
analyst Norman Ornstein of the American
Enterprise Institute right wing
think-tank pointed out recently I think
accurately that the Republican Party has
been witty has become what he called a
radical insurgency no longer committed
to parliamentary participation there's a
lot of truth to that we've seen it
pretty dramatically in the last couple
of years we're seeing it right now
just take a look at the today's
newspaper the description of the House
Budget basically the Ryan budget what is
the Ryan budget through an all kind of
sleight of hand which economists are
just mocking about balancing the budget
but what it actually does is undermine
Medicare by moving to privatize it which
means to it's the one part of the health
err system that more or less works
because it's not privatized its
inefficiencies and costs are due to the
fact that it has to work through thee in
highly an efficient bureaucratized
privatized system in the United States
so privatizing moving to privatize
Medicare or saying let's undermine the
one system the more or less works
cutting back Medicaid under the guise of
federalism repealing the Affordable Care
Act which sends not a wonderful
legislation but nevertheless an
improvement which will send tens of
millions of people into the uninsured
lists cutting back food stamps and so on
in other end enriching the wealthy
that's the one policy of the Republican
radical insurgency do anything you can
to enrich the wealthy and powerful and
attack the general population well you
can't win votes that way so what's
happened is over the last years the
Republican Party managers have mobilized
sectors of the population which have
always been around but have never been
mobilized into a significant political
force one part is Christian evangelicals
major component of part of the base of
the Republican Party today you see it in
the Iowa primaries coming up but quite
generally another is nativists people
who are afraid that they are taking our
country away from us which has a basis
in fact the white population is will
become a minority pretty soon and for
extreme ultra-nationalists nativists
this is a crime that can't be tolerated
people who are sectors of the population
who are so frightened that they have to
carry guns into Starbucks because
we'll come after them in fact there's
legislation in Nevada right now being
debated to allow guns to be brought in
to daycare centers and maybe some of
these three-year-olds were trained by
Isis Oh knows but these are you know
these are not small parts of the
population it's a very strange country
in many ways that's a large part of the
population people can be mobilized on
those issues and not notice that the
policies that their leaders are pursuing
are attacking them and supporting the
super-rich and the corporation's well
that's one that's one of the former two
factions what's the other faction it's
not Democrats
it's what used to be called moderate
Republicans if you take a look at the
Democratic Party programs there are a
few exceptions like Bernie Sanders and
others but if you take the the core of
the Democratic Party Democratic
Leadership Council and so on these are
the policies that used to be called
moderate Republicans in fact somebody
like Richard Nixon would be kind of at
the left of American politics today
Eisenhower would be off the spectrum
Eisenhower went so far as to say that
nobody even saying could think of
dismantling New Deal programs mainly the
ones that are being dismantled right now
the current Republican programs are
efforts to dismantle programs that were
initiated under Nixon the drift to the
right during this whole neoliberal
period roughly since Reagan is pretty
extreme actually see it pretty
strikingly in the public attitudes
towards health towards the health
programs the unites the u.s. health
system is an international scandal it
has about twice the per capita costs of
comparable countries and
relatively poor outcomes furthermore the
US government spends about as much per
capita as comparable countries but
that's a small part of the health costs
because it all has to work through the
privatized health system which is
inefficient bureaucratized and in the
hands of tons of bookkeeping
administration and so on and so forth
and in the hands of institutions which
have no interest in health an insurance
company is not dedicated to health it's
dedicated to making money so not
surprisingly they do things to try to
make money well this if you look back at
the there's an extensive polling record
of public attitudes on health care and
for a long period since the Second World
War there have been substantive
sometimes considerable majorities you
know a lot of the polls depend on
exactly how the question is asked but a
large part of the population often a
majority has been in favor of national
health care they go back to the late
1980s a majority of the population
thought that there ought to be a
constitutional guarantee for health care
national health care and in fact I think
it was 40% of the population thought it
already was in the Constitution that's
the late 80s and take a look today when
Obama presented his affordable health
care program you'll recall that at the
very beginning one of the part of the
program was a public option allowing
people to make the choice of something
like Medicare national health care at
the time almost two-thirds of the
population was in favor of that but it
was dropped without discussion it never
entered the discussion the United States
has a very unusual maybe unique law
which bars the government from
negotiating drug prices you can
negotiate other things but
not drug prices so of course drug prices
are way out of sight much higher than in
comparable countries the population is
overwhelmingly opposed to this there
haven't been many polls but the only
ones I've seen show over eighty percent
opposition there was never even a
attempt to deal with this the power of
the pharmaceutical corporations is so
enormous that there wasn't even an
effort to try to introduce it into the
so-called Obamacare if you look at the
attitudes towards the so-called
Obamacare they've been pretty negative
most of the population has been opposed
even though for years the population has
been strongly in favor of national
health care and this of course isn't
national health care now some of that
opposition is because it didn't go far
enough we don't know how much because
the questions aren't asking polls but a
lot of it is the kind of thing you see
reflected in this famous town hall
comment where somebody got up and said
I'm keep your keep your hands off my
Medicare you know that kind of thing
people don't understand that what the
government is doing and what the private
corporations are doing and the effect is
a significant change in expressed
attitudes towards the policies that's a
remarkable triumph of propaganda if you
think about it especially considering
how vital health care is to everyone's
life well those numbers have been at
zero for quite some time and there's a
light up there that says exit but I'm
going to take a moderators privilege you
and just go on for a minute or two more
if I may on this that's okay with you
well on this long journey you've been on
did you ever imagine the kind of crowd
you routinely draw or having your books
on display at airports well actually
start at giving public talks on these
issues much too late in the early 1960s
early days of the Vietnam War I started
giving talks about the Vietnam War and
as you know it was talks to three people
somebody's living room or a church with
three or four people or something like
that
and there was never end and none of us
who were involved ever had it could have
guessed at the time that a couple of
years later there would be a major
anti-war movement but there was and the
same has happened on other issues with
all of the negative things that have
happened over the past years this
neoliberal reaction since Lee Carter
primarily the Reagan years there's also
been plenty of progress audiences are
very different than they were in the
past
concerns are different lots of issues
that were fighting issues back in the
60s you could barely discuss them are
now accepted and taken for granted
women's rights gay rights there was no
concern for environmental issues in the
60s now there's substantial concern of
the years there have been periods of
extensive popular activism to try to
terminate the nuclear weapons lunacy the
the general atmosphere of the public has
changed a lot and you know audiences
kind of reflect that well all of this is
positive there's basically two
trajectories there's one trajectory
which one just been describing which is
a constructive positive offers hope
there's another trajectory which I
talked about which is going in the
opposite direction and the question is
which one will prevail but again as I've
said several times and as you all know
without my saying it that's in your
hands you were just in Argentina and met
with some you were just in Argentina and
you met with some activists from the
podemos movement in Spain what were your
impressions well this was an
international conference of activists
from around the world mostly South
America but some from Spain some from
Greece Arisa and others and it reflects
some of the positive developments in the
world
one of the major positive developments
internationally in the past for a long
time long ago see like has been what has
taken place in South America over the
past roughly 15 years South America
for 500 years since the early conquests
had been dominated by foreign powers the
South American countries themselves were
the typical structure was a small
Europeanized mostly white elite
extremely wealthy in a sea of misery and
poverty the elites were oriented towards
the outside they had their second homes
in the Riviera they sent their money to
Zurich you know and so on there was very
little interaction among the South
American countries of the South American
countries were the most religious
students of the neoliberal policy
structural adjustment policies of the
World Bank in the IMF in the Treasury
Department and they were the ones who
suffered most naturally but in the last
10 or 15 years they pulled out of this
for the first time it's a major change
in world affairs South America used to
be regarded here as what was called our
backyard
they did whatever we told them we don't
pay any attention to them
now South America is out of control you
take a look at the hemispheric
conferences the United States is
isolated in fact the primary reason why
Obama made some steps towards
normalizing relations with Cuba is that
the u.s. was utterly isolated on that
issue in the whole hemisphere they were
trying to get some kind of arrangements
before the summit of Americas which is
coming up soon they didn't quite make it
but that's the goal this is a huge
change and that's why the conference was
in South America but there were
participants from particularly podemos
and syriza these are in Greece Europe
has been subjected to a program of a
kind of a savage economic program which
is seriously undermine European
democracy it's been devastating for the
weaker the peripheral countries it's
beginning to dismantle Europe's major
post Second World War
Social Democratic welfare state programs
and I think that's the purpose of the
policies it's economically destructive
this is these are the policies of
austerity under recession even the
International Monetary Fund's is it
crazy from an economic point of view but
they are they make some sense from the
point of view of class war they are
enriching the big banks they're
dismantling social programs and so on
well there's a reaction the reaction was
from first in Greece which has suffered
most and the German banks which are
basically responsible for these crises
are reacting in an absolutely savage way
to try to prevent Greece from taking
steps that might extricate itself from
the disaster that's been imposed
Greece's calling for restructuring of
its debt
you know delaying debt payments and so
on this is particularly ironic because
Germany in 1953 was permitted by the
European countries to about to cancel
its major debts that's the basis for
German recovery that's why it's the
dynamic centre of Europe
secondly Germany practically destroyed
Greece during the Second World War
well put all this together the Greece is
now asking for a limited element of what
Germany was granted in 1953 and the
German the powers in Germany the bank
the blenders bankers just flatly
refusing in a very savage way now they
may get away with it in Greece because
Greece is pretty weak country Spain is
going to be harder nut to crack that's a
bigger country a more powerful economy
and in Spain in the last couple of years
two or three years a new political party
developed for them us which by now is
running first in the polls
and it is also a policy of a party has
dedicated a pretty pragmatic sensible
way to reversing the austerity programs
sustaining rebuilding the the the social
economy the welfare state programs and
moving the country towards in
constructive development in Spain as
well the criminals the ones who caused
the crisis were the banks the Spanish
banks and the German banks but they want
the population to pay notice that none
of them believe in capitalism in a
capitalist society say if I lend money
to you and since I know you I know it's
a risky loan
therefore and I therefore get a lot of
interest and I make a lot of money out
of it if at a certain point you can't
pay it's my problem in a capitalist
society but not in the societies in
which we live the problem is your
problem and your neighbors problem your
neighbors didn't take the deck the debt
but they got to pay for it that's the
way our system works radically
anti-capitalist makes sense on class
warfare grounds but no resemblance to
markets or capitalism and that's what's
been going on but there is a struggle
against it
and podemos I worth keeping an eye on
they have sensible programs might win
the next election which is coming up
soon and it's not a it's not going to be
easy for the brussels bureaucrats and
the german banks northern banks to the
crush spanish initiatives one last
question you grew up in the 30s at a
time when solidarity meant something
there was mutual support there was an
active labor movement what is it going
to take in 2015 to rekindle that spirit
of solidarity well remember what
happened in the thirties the labor
movement was in fact in the forefront
it was CIO organizing sit-down strikes
so on
they had a sympathetic administration so
the Roosevelt administration was willing
to accommodate to the some extent to the
pressures developing among the public
labor movement spearheading it which did
lead to the New Deal legislations which
were very beneficial to the population
and to the economy but go back to the
1920s the labor movement had been
destroyed there was nothing left
pregnant nothing left of it one of the
leading labor historians David
Montgomery died recently has a book like
the Fall of the House of Labor and it's
about the 1920s there had been a lively
vibrant act
pretty radical American labor movement
but it had been crushed by a brutal
attack this is very much a business run
society and the business classes are
highly class conscious constantly
fighting a class war have state power
supporting them and they were able to
crush and destroy the labor movement but
it revived and it can revive again and
other popular movements can as well -
and there's a basis for the basis for it
is the quite positive changes that have
taken place since the 1960s in many ways
it's a much more civilized society than
it was at that time in many issues and I
think that is a basis for recreating the
kind of solidarity mutual aid working
together dedication commitment that is
very necessary today that we can't
overlook the fact that we're at a moment
of human history which is entirely
unique for the first time in human
history we are at a position where the
decisions that we will make will
determine whether the species survives
I've been true in the past it's very
definitely true now these are not small
questions it's quite a sobering note and
as we bring this evening to a close in
Hindi there's a word called savor it
means service and I can think of no one
who has performed more savor more
service for humankind than you thank you
very much
you
you
