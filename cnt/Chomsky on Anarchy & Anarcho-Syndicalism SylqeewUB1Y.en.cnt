welcome the radio VR I'm Sean Evans in
Washington recently I had the
opportunity to sit down with professor
emeritus Noam Chomsky of MIT he is
famous the world over for his work in
linguistics but more so his political
beliefs and aspirations he's a
self-described anarchist and more
specifically an anarcho-syndicalist a1a
dr. Chomsky to expound on this idea of
anarcho-syndicalism to get an
understanding about what it is how it
arises and how it can be applied by
people that want to effect positive
change in the world I kind of wanted to
start off by asking you to briefly
describe what is anarchism and more
specifically anarcho-syndicalism well I
think the best characterization that I
know was given by one of the leading
thinkers and activists in the modern
anarcho-syndicalist world Rudolf rocker
who described anarchism in general as
not a specific set of beliefs that
provides particular answers to all the
questions that can arise but rather what
he called a general tendency in the
history of humanity which aims to
inquire into the nature of social
economic political structures to
determine to detect structures of
hierarchy and domination and to
challenge them to demonstrate their
legitimacy they're not self-justifying
and if they cannot defend their
legitimacy on some plausible grounds
then to dismantle them and reconstruct
them from below and to do this in the
context of the existing society
developing alternative institutions that
are more free and more just in the hope
of moving on to
of free associations of workers
communities controlling their own
institutions their own fate in
association with one another various
kinds of federal arrangements and so on
that's the basic thrust of an arc
anarchism altogether in my view and of
anarcho-syndicalism in particular which
is designed for complex industrial
societies so you're talking about
workers controlling their own work and
controlling the enterprises that work
and expanding out of the community nice
but crucial aspect doesn't in fact
anarcho-syndicalism kind of shades off
into left anti-bolshevik Marxism people
that count on Panico climatic choral
course and others and sympathetic
relationships and ideas and the great
anarchist achievements like the 1936
Spanish Revolution before it was crushed
did have the strong and sympathetic
support of left Marxists who felt a
community of interests and commitment
workers controlling their own work how
is this organized and how does it arise
how does it are going to all over the
place first of all it's a constant
development takes place all over there
were efforts in Eastern Europe for
example the self-management in
Yugoslavia right now in the in the
United States and the and the old
decaying Rust Belt where industries are
collapsing they're being replaced to a
certain extent by worker owned and
partially worker managed enterprises
there's one huge institution that's
Mondragon the great conglomerate didn't
Spain which is worker-owned if not the
delegates selected by manager selected
by workers but not actually worker
managed which is
a collection of heavy industries banks
hospitals community living someone do
they rise arise kind of spontaneously
and is there any kind of one specific
like is there a system that regulates
how the workers organize themselves like
maybe in the u.s. like they do it one
way and then over an span Mondragon that
they'll do it a different way is it is
there any kind of vision there's no
leadership or Bible things develop on
the basis of the circumstances that
exist so the conditions and say the Rust
Belt in northern Ohio and in Catalonia
and Aragon and the 19:36 are quite
different and the backgrounds are quite
different but but there were
similarities in the way the takeover by
working people of peasants of their own
lives preceded let's say that Mondragon
wants to have an association with
somebody in the Rust Belt yes it's
happening in fact okay I don't know how
far it'll go but the one of the major
u.s. unions and Steel Workers is no has
entered into some kinds of interactions
with Mondragon to try to work out ways
to develop a Mondragon type system in
the old industrial sections of the
United States and revive them on the
basis of worker ownership and community
ownership and control
