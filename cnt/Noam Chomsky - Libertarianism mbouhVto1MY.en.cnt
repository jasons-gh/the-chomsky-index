libertarian conceptions basically come
out of classical liberalism seventeen
eighteenth century classical liberalism
and it's the core principles of
classical liberalism were opposition to
illegitimate Authority people should be
free from constraints and controls by
authoritarian structures which have no
inherent legitimacy hopefully one or
another form of tyranny or domination so
in the early days they were concerned
with feudalism with tyrannical states
and so on in the late 19th century on
through the 20th century the major some
of the major authoritarian oh but their
policies whatever their goals might be
their policies tend our attempt to drive
people under the control of the worst
possible unaccountable private tyranny
that's the opposite of libertarian
there's one crucial difference between
American libertarianism traditional
libertarianism traditional your
libertarianism was opposed to any form
of dominance and higher one of the
slogans was no god no master
meaning no ecclesiastical dominant
no masters in industry and personal life
and families anywhere else
American libertarianism is quite
different it's perfectly happy to
support masters in fact it extols them
it's in favor of it it wants no
interference with the domination and
control of people in the workforce
that's today
that's very counter to traditional
libertarianism either in Europe or for
that matter in the United States if you
go back to the 19th century early days
of the Industrial Revolution there were
mass popular movements which had their
own journals and agreed what they said
and so on they were they were mr.
Spontini
opposed to the way in which the
industrial system was forcing them to
turn into tools of production under
someone else's control and destroying
their independence as freed people also
destroyed their culture well their
slogan was those who work in the middle
should own that's taken for granted in
fact it was what they called wage
slavery beige labor they regarded is not
very different from chattel slavery now
that was such a popular position in the
United States in the 19th century that
it was a slogan the Republican Party
wage labor is tolerable because it's
temporary but people should control
their own industrial faith this is as
American as apple pie and quite
different from what's called
libertarianism today today these are
important things to bear in mind
