and points this out but it's clearly the
case they learned that there is a way to
maintain something remotely like a
capitalist system namely with massive
state subsidy and direction and control
and they're the guys who had to know it
because they were running so they didn't
have to read it in textbooks they had
experienced it overcame depression with
big shot in the arm to the economy right
after the war there was a consensus
extremely broad consensus going from
economists like then young Paul
Samuelson and others all the way across
to business leaders that if this
government stimulus and support were to
drop we'd head right back to the
depression which was pretty realistic
that's what pull the country out of the
depression anyway that was the consensus
and you don't have to go to secret
sources at this time the business press
quite openly said that the government is
going to have to do something about it
Fortune magazine pointed out that
high-tech industry cannot survive in an
unsubsidized competitive free enterprise
economy Businessweek added that the
government has to be the savior that was
pretty general agreement on this it was
understood just like you learn in your
elementary economics of course that any
kind of government spending can serve as
a stimulus like social spending or
military spending or you know hiding
dollars in the sand or whatever you like
they'll all work they understood this
and in fact there was a debate in the
business press in the late 40s about
which path to follow social spending or
military spending and it was decided
pretty quickly explicitly in fact that
military spending would be a much better
path the reason was that social spending
has a downside even if it would work
first of all it's redistributed secondly
it has a democratizing effect that's
like people sort of care where you're
going to build a hospital or something
it's also not a direct gift to
corporations it's sort of just filters
indirectly well military spending has
none of these defects it's a direct gift
the court
asians its redistributed but the right
way and it has no democratizing effect
if I quite the opposite people of no
opinion on what kind of jet plane to
build or something so it's just perfect
and furthermore it's easy to sell and
that was recognized to the point was put
rather succinctly by Truman's first the
first Air Force secretary secretary
Symington Truman secretary he pointed
out that as he put it the word to use is
not subsidy the word to use is security
and if you can get people to tremble in
fear you can carry out the subsidy
calling it security so military spending
is the perfect solution to the problem
that as everyone recognized the
capitalist system just isn't viable and
there has to be a massive public subsidy
for it and some degree of intervention
and control well that was very widely
understood it soon turned to a kind of
international military keynesianism as
it's sometimes called the revival of
Japan and Europe a very crucially
depended on US military spending after
the meager and disappointing effects of
the Marshall Plan were played out but
they did get revitalized Korean War and
big military spending and so on Vietnam
War had the same highly stimulating
effect at this time also for South Korea
which traces its economic take off to
that by 1940s well understood in fact
even before the korean war by 1948 the
business press was hailing Truman's cold
war spending as a magic formula for
almost endless good times it's a way to
inject new strength into the entire
economy by 1952 it was quoting obvious
that foreign economies as well as our
own are mainly dependent on the scope of
continued arm spending in this country
which is serving as a cover for public
subsidy under the guise of security
subsidy through advanced industry I'm
quoting steel magaz
magazine of Wall Street in this case and
but it's typical and it's all across the
board and business press and so the
story continues just about everywhere
takes a computers like set of core
element of a modern industrial society
in the 1950s they were kind of big
clunky things with the vacuum tubes
always blowing up and too much paper
around and that sort of business you
couldn't sell them in other words so the
public support for them was about a
hundred percent they were controlled
they were designed under the security
guys like at Lincoln labs at MIT where I
am and we're actually my wife worked as
a programmer with a security clearance
so I wasn't supposed to know what was
happening the they were designing what
was called an air defense system I doubt
that anybody in it thought it was ever
going to stop anything but maybe a world
war one fighter plane that got lost but
the air defense system did develop the
basic architecture and software and
structure for modern computers when it
got advanced enough some of the leading
figures in that pulled out one of them
formed el layer IBM came along and so on
by the 1960s these things were
marketable and the public support
reduced to about fifty percent and it
sort of oscillates up and back in the
1980s it went up again because there
were fifth generation computers coming
along and parallel processing and all
sorts of new fancy stuff so the public
share went up again and this is pretty
public i should say likes a Star Wars
was sold to the public as a system
you're going to defend ourselves from
Martians or somebody but to the business
world it was sold pretty frankly as just
a subsidy to next generation of computer
technology and lasers and so on and so
forth there was no big secret about it
that and what's true of computers is
true of just about anything else in the
50s about eighty-five percent of R&D
research and development electronics
altogether
publicly subsidized and it remains at
various levels since i'ma go into
details the same is true of the
aeronautical industry of automation is a
striking example it was so inefficient
that for several decades it had to be
developed in the state sector finally
handed over to private enterprise I you
know containers and some
containerization machine tools is a
dramatic example that's well studied in
this case an important work by they have
noble the energy industry nobody argues
about by the technology pharmaceuticals
in fact just about every dynamic sector
of the economy that even includes
services so from one of the biggest
parts of the service industries is
tourism huge industry which is of course
aircraft based and enormous source of
profits for services to us-based
companies and so it goes I will skip the
rest but as I say it's extremely hard to
find some dynamic sector of the US
economy that doesn't rely on this kind
of thing fairly crucially sometimes
overwhelmingly sometimes less so but
always significantly now there are
variations it's not like a uniform story
so it takes a the Reagan administration
the reagan heights were extreme and
their contempt for contempt for markets
they really hated them in practice that
is to the public the reagan
administration was full of you know
wonderful praise for the miracles of the
free market that's both to the third
world and to poor people at home to the
business world they were sending a
different message so secretary of
treasure james baker informed the
business world that the reagan
administration he boasted that they had
instituted more protection for american
business than any Administration in
post-war American history which was in
fact far too modest it was
more protection than all post-war
administrations combined they had
virtually doubled one or another form of
protection amounting to tariffs though
sometimes by the devices that was used
targeted specifically this to save the
American steel industry automotive
industry machine tools semiconductors
it's unnecessary for aircraft that's
already publicly subsidized that's what
saved them otherwise it would if they're
free market had been allowed to function
they presumably would have been taken
over by much cheaper and more efficient
to Japanese and other industries but the
market was effectively closed and a lot
of subsidies were poured in and that
saved the industries and again it's no
secret so like foreign affairs in its
review of the decade points out later on
quoting it now but the United States
shifted in the 1980s from the world
champion of multilateral free trade to
one of its leading challengers with the
greatest swing toward protectionism
since the 1930s that much it's true but
it's only a small part of the story
because it omits the huge public
subsidies to high-tech industry the
initiation of new technologies startup
companies the unprecedented public
bailouts the biggest nationalization in
American history and a lot more there's
a scholarly study of ghat by one of the
chief economist's of the gat secretariat
sort of the main study of get in the
modern period he estimate patroklos his
name he estimates Reaganite restrictions
on free trade as about three times any
foreign counterpart this is what he says
part of the sustained assault on free
trade principles by the industrial
countries from the early 1970s there's
no time to go into this but the early
1970s are important that's when the
financial systems were deregulated after
the Nixon administration broke down the
Britain
agreement something which had had an
enormous effect on the international
economy probably the biggest change in
World Order since World War two but
takes us off in another direction so
I'll drop it a important direction well
all of these things have had effect one
of the effects is the unprecedented
redistribution of income toward the very
rich that is complained about and
attributed to the free market and also
the steady decline of the majority as
we're moving towards a society which has
notable structural similarities to the
third world great rich countries it's
not going to look like Brazil but the
structural similarities are quite
obvious let me take any third world
country and now Eastern Europe now that
it's going back to the third world where
it belongs and was for five centuries
the the small sector comicon island of
extreme wealth and privilege there's a
big sector kind of ranging from
suffering to outright misery and there's
just a lot of superfluous people who
don't contribute the profit-making and
you got to get rid of him somehow in
countries like we all say take the
country that gets that most of our
military aid in the 1990s in the
hemisphere Colombia there they get rid
of them by his murdering them that's
what the military aid is for social
cleansing large-scale killing by the
military in the paramilitary and so on
we're more civilized we don't kill them
we throw them into jail so the jails are
going way far be incarcerated is
completely uncorrelated with crime far
beyond any industrial society in fact we
now are competing with the world
championship with China and have been
for some years and still going up so
that's perf Luis population none of this
is the result of the wisdom of the
market miraculous or not but it is
definitely the result of explicit social
policy well these effects i should say
have led to real euphoria among the
winners business press is pretty amazing
in this respect so in
businessweek in a review of 1996 points
out that profits were spectacular that's
up from dazzling and stunning in the two
previous years of double-digit profit
growth which has been going on through
the last couple of years by far the
biggest winner that they reported in
1996 were what they call aerospace and
defense defenses a euphemism they're far
ahead maybe about twice as twice as much
profit as the competitors which are also
beneficiaries of the transfer of public
funds the private profit in an earlier
period and that continues again reported
in the business press like you know you
read The Wall Street Journal in the back
pages of the New York Times you'll learn
about it so for example last November
Japan announced a new government program
of up to about a billion dollars to aid
Japanese companies to regain the ground
that they lost when the Reaganite
programs of massive state intervention
mostly disguised as military spending
save us companies in semiconductors and
gave them a big step ahead in chip
making and other technologies part of
what makes possible air current passion
and telecommunications the same day the
Clinton administration announced a
program to build new military jets with
profits that are estimated they may run
to 750 billion dollars or more when
foreign sales are included which will be
aided in fact decisively by aggressive
government intervention particularly
interesting was the fact that in that
proposal for this huge jet program
McDonnell Douglas was excluded from
competition in favor of Boeing and that
was noticed by industry analysts Boeing
had just won a billion dollar contract
for a laser system for 747s called
defense system as usual the reasoning
for cutting McDonnell Douglas act was in
favor of Boeing was explained by
Pentagon officials and by aerospace
industry analysts the reason is that
boeing has essentially the American
monopoly for commercial aircraft and
therefore new technologies have to go to
it directly to expedite the growth of
commercial production not just
indirectly in the usual fashion so
therefore we'll give them the military
jet contracts directly and then they can
just use it without wasting any time for
commercial jets and remain the model of
the free market when we preach the
gospel this an aerospace analyst that
Merrill Lynch pointed out but this is
involves a shift from a military
industrial economy to an industrial
military economy it's kind of more Frank
in other words and in fact one you
selected I was a Pentagon official one
useful effect of the end of the cold war
has been too kind of lift the clouds you
know it's kind of harder to maintain
print pretenses so will now call it what
it is an industrial military economy
with military just used to as much as we
can other devices we can't to ensure
that that the rich aren't don't have to
face market discipline which can be
pretty tough I don't want to suggest
that business doesn't have any problems
they do so about a year ago Businessweek
had a headline saying the problem now
what to do with all that cash as
profits are overflowing the coffers of
corporate America and are booming and so
on and that is a problem because not
really clear what to do with all that
money just about a week ago if ever a
tenth Business Week updated it that an
article pointing out that the liquid
assets of non-financial companies in the
United States had reached what they call
a staggering 679 billion dollars and
that poses vexing problems at places
like Boeing and IBM and the Intel and
Ford problem is what you going to do
with all this money we can't figure out
what to do with it the meanwhile in
these lean and mean times that we live
in we have to be able to accept happily
the by far the highest poverty rate in
the world worse child poverty rate and
in the industrial world in any
industrial country literal starvation
and all the other problems that just
come from the miracles of the market and
we of course also have to reduce the
capital gains tax because it's important
to free up funds for new investment
since the 600 staggering 679 billion
dollars that's sitting there nobody
knows what to do with so some new funds
have to be gotten and lowering the
capital gains tax of course means
transferring taxes r aggressively toward
the poorer and all of this is to be
understood and you're not supposed to
laugh about it and in fact it takes a
pretty well discipline doctrinal system
and a very well accompany metallized
mind to be able to handle all of these
things and not to do what those 40
million Mexicans might have done if they
were told that Cuba as a security threat
well there's a lot more to say about
this but let me just say a word about
the earlier history which is itself
interesting before World War two you can
learn a lot from that in the 18th
century the differences between what is
now the first in the third world were
much less sharp than they are
day so for example India was the major
commercial and industrial center of the
world it was producing more iron than
all of Europe for example in the 18th
century and in fact until the 1820s
British engineers were still going to
India to learn advanced steelmaking
techniques and so on actually it's very
likely that wages in south indian
industry were actually comparable or
made two or maybe even better than
british industry along with working
conditions there's interesting new
scholarship on this the all of this
raises some questions too obvious
questions which countries developed and
which countries didn't and secondly what
were the factors well the first question
we can dispense with very quickly
there's no question about Europe
developed and so did some of the regions
that were free of European control to in
particular the United States which had
freed itself from European control and
Japan which is the one part of the third
world that was able to resist
colonization Japan were along couple of
its colonies in tow Japan was an
extremely brutal imperial power but it
treated its colonies differently from
the West it developed them so what is
now Taiwan and Korea developed under
Japanese rule at about the same rate as
Japan they didn't Robin they developed
them for whatever reason so those are
the two exceptions the two parts of the
world that we're able to resist European
colonization developed again something
you're not supposed to notice I maybe
suggest something what turn to the
factors well a lot of this is not very
well understood economic growth is not a
very well understood thing but some
things are pretty clear so one of the
most eminent economic historians in the
world pull by roche published a
interesting book about all this stuff
recently I points out that is quote him
that there is no doubt that the third
world's compulsory economic liberalism
was a major element in explaining the
delay in its industrialization and in
the very revealing case of India
the process of deindustrialization that
turned the world's leading workshop and
trading center into a deeply
impoverished agricultural society with a
sharp decline in real wages and food
consumption and so on well what about
the successful societies again lots
isn't understood but there are mentioned
that this is neoliberalism what I was
just describing for the defenseless the
developed societies though a lot is not
understood one thing seems pretty clear
and that is that and I think it's
without exception from England up the
least asian growth area that radical
violation of market principles was a
significant factor may be the decisive
factor in their successful development
just as imposition of market principles
was a major factor in the under the
undeveloped d development or even you
know the industrialization of parts of
the third world maybe all of it the
associate take for example the United
States like how come we're not pursuing
our comparative advantage and say
exporting fur don't seem to be doing
that there was an industrial revolution
started around eastern Massachusetts
with textiles as it always does how was
the u.s. able to produce textiles is it
because the textiles from Lowell were
cheaper than England no they were much
more expensive England was providing
much cheaper and better textiles but the
US was free so it was able to set up
high protectionist barriers and to
develop a textile industry with a big
spill over to other related industries
the same is true of say steel the steel
British steel was far better and cheaper
than American steel a century ago but
high tariff barriers made it possible
for Andrew Carnegie to set up the
world's first billion-dollar corporation
along with big navel contracts and so on
remember he was a pacifist but within
limits
so so we get a steel industry and so it
goes on up till the present I gave a
couple of examples the this is not
unknown the end so I should in fact the
US is described for example by brush as
the mother country and bastion of modern
protectionism in fact was way in the
lead through the period of its growth
these are pretty much staples of
economic history but they leave out an
awful lot because of the way academic
disciplines are divided up so
protectionism is only one factor and you
can see that pretty clearly takes a the
industrial revolution it was based the
major commodity in world trade of course
in the core the Industrial Revolution
was cotton there had to be cheap and
available cotton for the industrial
revolution to take place in England and
then the United States well how is it
kept cheap and available like market
forces no I mean it was kept cheap and
available by extermination of the
indigenous population in the Southeast
United States and by bringing in slaves
and a serious violation of market forces
actually Texas and a third of Mexico
were taken over quite explicitly in
order to gain they hope the monopoly on
cotton the this is nothing to do with
the market the contemporary analog is
energy where there's a large-scale
public subsidy to the price through the
whole protection military protection
system well factors of that kind are
just not considered in economic history
and they're not considered part of the
under state intervention but they means
that it very much under States its role
there were other cotton producers back
around the time that us cotton took off
like India or Egypt both major cotton
producers India just blocked by violence
so they destroy the British British
managed to destroy the Indian cotton
industry and textiles in the case of
Egypt it was about saying Egypt hard to
believe now but it was a
major agricultural exporter and a big
cotton producer and it was starting an
industrial revolution about the same
time the United States was but that was
barred the British refused to allow
independent development in the eastern
Mediterranean and they were quite frank
about it palmerston foreign minister
said that no ideas of fairness to Egypt
ought to stand in the way of such great
and paramount interests of Britain as
maintaining domination of this region
and blocking blocking competitors the
u.s. in contrast was free to follow the
course of the mother country England
with radical departures from market
principles England of course did turn to
liberal internationalism in famously in
1846 that was after a hundred and fifty
years of protectionism and violence and
in fact organization of Europe's most
efficient developmental state had led to
double the per capita capitalisation of
any other country so under those
conditions a level playing field looked
pretty nice and England didn't turn to
liberal internationalism but with some
significant reservations even then
period of free trade so about forty
percent of British textiles went to
colonized India and that was pretty much
true of British exports generally when
British steel was priced out of
international markets they could still
export to thee to the colonies by the
1920s when Britain couldn't compete any
longer with more efficient and
modernized Japanese industry they just
called the game off in 1932 the Empire
was effectively closed the Japanese
competition because free market wasn't
working anymore it's part of the
background for World War two other
countries did the same at that time if
you look Indian manufacturers were
indeed bleeding for protection but from
England not from Japan but under the way
markets work it wasn't the answer in the
conclusion is quite general free trade
is
great game as long as you're going to
win a century after England in 1945 the
United States turned into the same
direction that abandoned its high levels
of protectionism and called for a
free-trade international liberalisation
that was after a hundred and fifty years
of violence and massive protectionism
and market interference had put the
United States way ahead of any
competitor it actually had half the
wealth of the world at the time and a
living level playing field looked like a
nice idea but again with reservations so
complimentary development as it was
called was going to be blocked in other
countries and it was by force and there
were massive subsidies through the
military system and others also at the
agro export and other devices to make
sure that the level playing field was
still tilted radically in the proper
direction by the 1980's the Reagan eyes
just called the game off again and as I
described and today the sectors of the
economy that were helped to get back in
business and regain the lead there now
passionate advocates of the free market
well I think that's the relevant I
barely touched on it but that's the
relevant history of the
telecommunications agreement no miracles
of the market but there is a law markets
are great if we're going to win in fact
there is what we might call really
existing market doctrine market
discipline is good for you but I need
the protection of the nanny state so not
for me please the really existing
doctrine is operative policy discipline
for the defenseless and the poor like
seven year old children they have to
learn responsibility but the rich and
the privileged for them a powerful state
I'll look at the Reaganite policies
makes this very clear it's getting late
but let me give just one last dramatic
illustration I'll take the lead
commentator the New York Times Tom
Friedman who says that the hawked of
distinction over the issue now is
between the safety net errs is equal
and let them eat cake errs this everyone
agrees he says on globalization and
that's we can't even talk about that but
there is a distinction and he picks two
examples Clinton example the safety net
or Gingrich is an example of the
integrationist let them eat cake errs
it's about two weeks ago well that's it
that's not you know that's not like a
tautology it's a empirical thesis which
means you can test it so we can take
Gingrich and ask whether he's an
integrationist let the meat taker well
how do we test it well we for example
Gingrich was in Congress during the
1980s now we can ask how he voted during
this massive assault against free
markets for the benefit of the rich who
did indeed benefit how did he vote well
in favor of it okay conclusion number
one he certainly no integrationist he
didn't believe in global markets what
about the let em eat cake ur is he an
example of that well another way to test
that too I mean he's a congressman he
represents a district namely Cobb County
Georgia which happens to win the world
to the national championship in federal
subsidies among suburban counties the
only exceptions are the ones that are
part of the federal government itself
Aleksei Arlington Virginia they get a
little bit more that's where the
Pentagon ism but if you go out of the
federal system Cobb County is first so
he's achieved the in fact the whole
Atlanta region is like this so the fact
of the matter is that gingrich is the
leading advocate of welfare dependency
really existing market theory full of
you know all sorts of rhetoric about the
third world peasants and we're children
to learn responsibility and this kind of
thing but not his rich constituents they
require a powerful nanny state to
maintain their welfare dependency well
these are not big secrets and it's a
kind of a task of a doctrinal system to
conceal all of that so that the losers
who were the majority accept their fate
quietly and this incidentally is
completely general it's not the United
States I'll give only one example to
illustrate how general but
it's completely universal there's a
recent technical study they only want
detailed one I know of the top hundred
transnational corporations in the
fortune list is just published in
England I do economists they just run
through the top 100 national big highest
corporations and fortune list and they
look at their policies and record and so
on a lot of interesting stuff one
conclusion is that all 100 benefited
from the industrial policy of their home
country and 20 at least they say we're
saved from complete destruction as
enterprises by either massive state
takeover or huge bailouts in their home
country one of them is ingre jizz
favorite cash cow Lockheed which was
given a 202 billion dollar bailout by
the Nixon administration that's that's
the way the world works going back to
minimizing the state yeah there's
minimizing the state but that's
maximizing not the people's rule but the
private power which lies behind it and
is designing social policy that's where
decision-making is transferred and
furthermore these corporations don't
believe in free trade you have to under
not quite apart from the massive
subsidies and socialization of risk
remember that more that what's called
trade is that's a kind of a odd word for
it over half of us Trey what's called
trade in the United States over half of
it is intra firm within a particular
firm that's internal to a huge command
economy run by a very visible hand with
all sorts of techniques of undercutting
the market effects and so on and this is
pretty well understood so the last
comment I'll make is the following I'll
just leave it as a question there is
this question about use of public funds
for private profit
you know there are some real questions
there some of them are non-trivial one
question is how should public funds be
used to create the basis for the future
economy and intellectual culture real
question non-trivial second question
should the results of all of this
whatever-it-is be handed over to private
power through the socialization of risk
and cost technique that we use third
should the issues be discussed in the
public arena that is who should decide
well the first question you can
certainly argue about maybe the second I
don't think so but on the third there
shouldn't be any debate at least among
people who think that democracy might be
a good idea that is they ought to be
discussed in the public arena and ought
to be a public decision not something
that people are manipulated and deceived
into accepting with all kind of
fraudulent rhetoric about the wisdom of
the market and you know minimizing the
state and responsibility and so on at
least again for people who think that
democracy is something useful to think
um we have some time yeah okay are there
some mics down there or not ok if
anybody wants to say anything I'll try
to repeat it so others can hear good
yeah sorry no what you taught like was
the appropriate way for people like us
to respond to some of this vtc
centralization powering among
corporations democratization of our
society what what are some of the one is
some of the most exciting response to
that that you see going on with exciting
alternatives to that how can we plug
into this can you hear ya well the first
way to plug into it is to realize that
it's happening I mean if your if your
picture of the world is what is
presented across the board say from the
New York Times in the Wall Street
Journal through the New Yorker to the
progressive if that's your picture of
the world you're not going to plug into
it because you're not going to
understand what's happening so the first
thing to do is to break out of the
doctrinal controls which are very strong
I mean I didn't quote a lot but it's a
fair sample lip self-liberation is the
beginning that's very hard to do alone
that requires organization it takes a
lot of fanaticism to sort of work
through all of this stuff on your own
that's what groups are for like unions
used to play this role they educated
people they brought people together to
think about things so the first task is
some kind of interaction an organization
which will make it possible to contrast
the image of the world with the reality
of what's happening after that with some
conception of what's going on there are
a lot of ways to react in fact
mechanisms are in place right now which
can enable people to react if this same
study of transnational corporations that
i mentioned pointed out that
three-quarters about three-quarters of
their interactions are internal to your
Japan in the United States okay and
they're all heavily dependent on their
home countries for markets for subsidy
for bailout for everything else well
these are three areas of the world where
there are formal mechanisms in place
that enable the public at least in
principle to exercise some role in
public policies it's like none of these
countries are going to have a military
coup let's say if people decide
something the wrong way through their
elected representatives that means that
even with existing mechanisms in place
there are very straightforward ways to
deal with this it's not a law of nature
that social policy has to be designed so
that the rich are protected for market
discipline and children have to face it
that's not a law of nature you know you
can change all that you can change it
with existing mechanisms further work
you know it's a good question whether
existing mechanisms just happened to
exist they're not wholly you know
they've been changed all through history
if you go back to the real sources of
classical liberalism I think you find
that the existing mechanisms are
inconsistent with it they're good
principles there which ought to be
thought about so for example take say
the patron saint again Adam Smith I mean
like everybody studies paragraph 1 of
wealth of nations where he talks about
how great division of labor is but not
many people get to know whatever it is
page 463 or something i'm picking a
number out of my hat but anyway deep
inside when he says the division of
labor is a monstrosity because it's
going to turn people he says and to peep
into creatures as stupid and ignorant as
it's possible for a human being to be
and therefore it must be resisted in any
civilized and developed society by some
kind of government interaction action to
block it in fact if you look at Smith's
argument for he does give an argument
kind of a nuanced it argument for
markets sort of all the way at a nuanced
view of them take a look at the argument
good or bad isn't the point at this
right now but the argument is that free
markets will lead the perfect equality
under conditions of liberty that's the
argument for
well if they're not doing that then as
far as his principles are concerned
they're no good you go back to other
major figures in the classical liberal
tradition they were against wage labor
on the grounds that standard formula if
a person does a beautiful thing on
command we may admire what he does but
we despise what he is because it's not a
human being the de Tocqueville described
it in the phrase the art advances the
artisan recedes it's an unacceptable
form of existence and it goes on and on
like that no these are in these ideas
are run right through the Independent
Labour working-class movement in the
United States as not only with marks or
anything else find it in 1850 you know
working-class press and so on sorry
natural idea of people out of control
their own labor they shouldn't be like
chattel slaves some other kind of slaves
well these are ideas that can be
rethought the power of modern
corporations is not something that was
given by nature either these were
decisions and indeed not legislative
decisions those of you from the law
school surely know about this these were
judicial decisions pretty recent ones in
fact it's early in this century that
corporations got the immense power that
they now have mostly through courts and
lawyers round about the legislators it
doesn't it's not laws of nature you know
you could go back to classical liberal
principles and put them under public
control democratic control and so on
that's going beyond existing mechanisms
into principles but yeah we could
reconstitute ideas that were once pretty
standard in fact across the board but
even with existing mechanisms there's
plenty that can be done instantly as far
as this globalization business is
concerned it's described as if it's
something so overwhelming that what can
we do fact of the matter is by at least
gross measures like say trade and
investment flows and so on and so forth
by gross measures the level of
globalization now is about what it was
around 1913 it's a relative to G you
know to the economy in fact there are
some differences in fact some striking
ones like the rapid flow of financial
speculative transactions but that's
controllable though it's had a
devastating effect on economies and it
was understood in fact one of the people
who pointed out the effects was right
here James Tobin back around 20 years
ago gave a important presidential
address to the American economics
association in which he pointed out that
the freeing up of financial markets was
going to have a destructive effect on
the international economy was going to
lead to low growth low wage and though
he didn't say at high profit economies
and he even suggested some rather simple
mechanisms to deal with this it's called
the Tobin tax small tax on speculative
short-term transactions which probably
would slow down financial flows it's
been on the agenda for years never been
enacted because the Masters of the
economy who prefer a different social
you know social policy they want the
profits and they don't care if the
public goes down the two but those are
all mechanisms that are I mean maybe
that that tax wouldn't work you know you
don't really know until you try but it's
and it's one of several devices but
there's plenty of technical ideas around
about how to deal with this and there
are general mechanisms to implement it
and there are perfectly good ways to
challenge the basic assumptions of the
institutions which have been changed
throughout history you know all of human
history is a matter of challenging
authoritarian structures asking them to
justify their legitimacy and if they're
not legitimate dismantling the whole of
human history hasn't come to an end how
you can do this will only wait there
there's never been a magic key the only
way that's ever anything has ever been
achieved whether it's the end of
feudalism or the overthrow of fascism
Bolshevism or you pick it you know
women's right I mean name anything you
like come some struggle you know comes
from education and organization and
activism to aim usually it's specific
things but going
the broader issues and so on if there's
another technique it's been kept a dark
secret that one has been used for a long
time with positive results George Soros
in the Atlantic Monthly this was an
article in which he was saying that the
rush towards free markets is going to be
destructive in its impact I would say
more or less the same thing I said about
other criticisms like the one in the
progressive I think it's hard it's in
the right place but his picture of the
world is completely false there is no
rush to free markets there's a rush to
something very different you know
there's an in fact it's not a rush it's
just the history the last couple hundred
years the history of the last couple
hundred years taking of course new forms
as things change is what i said i think
markets are great for you and if you're
poor and defenseless I'll RAM them down
your throat but I'm going to have a
powerful state to protect me and that's
right in front of us I mean the Gingrich
and the Reagan nights are perfect
examples it takes a the heritage
foundation you know which crafts the
budget for the right-wing Republicans
you'll notice that parts of the state
are minimized and other parts or map of
the state are maximized so the military
budget keeps going up you know it used
to be we had to protect ourselves from
the Russians okay no Russians fact their
allies they're contributing the US
technology so we therefore have to have
a military budget that's actually higher
in real terms than it was under Nixon
then I'll probably go up and they want
it to go up him faster actually there's
a reason for this it's interesting to
look in the White House every year he
sends Congress a message you know like
around the spring telling him here's why
we need a big military budget the
interesting one to look at was
March spring 1990 it was March 1990 the
reason that's interesting is the Berlin
Wall had fallen you know and even the
most extreme maniac maybe barf you
couldn't believe that the Russians are
coming you know maybe Richard pipe still
believes it but most people couldn't
accept the idea that the Russians are
coming in March 1990 if you look at the
report that the Bush administration sent
to the white house which was
incidentally not reported in the press
as far as i know this public document
quite interest i've written about it if
you're interested it's available the was
quite interesting it was the same as all
the others you know we need a bigger
military budget we need the defense
industrial base has to be maintained you
know the whole thing has to go up why
well not because the Russians are coming
I'm quoting it's because of the
technological sophistication of third
world powers okay that's why we've
needed all of this up until now is
because the Russians were coming ok now
it's because of the technological
sophistication of third world powers
which incidentally we're trying to build
up part of lockheed's profits come from
selling advanced jets to third world
countries so that they will be a
military threat requiring that we build
f-22s you know I zillions of dollars to
protect ourselves from it and if you
read Lockheed propaganda they say it
straight out it's a dangerous world out
there getting even more dangerous when
we're selling them upgraded f-16 and so
yeah this is this is there you know and
I kind of lost track to your question at
this place sorry I'm often remind me of
your question Oh Soros yeah he's missing
all of this you know he just doesn't see
what's happening in the world I mean he
can read the front page story in The New
York Times about the telecommunications
industry and then our passion for free
markets and not understand that this is
just what's been going on for a couple
hundred years the guys are going to win
because they've had plenty of public
subsidy and support think that
competition is great
up till the point where they're going to
lose which points out the window like
democracy so I sort of half you know I
agree with a lot of the mood that he's
conveying but it seems to me extremely
misleading not to present the world the
way it is no you want you want people to
do something about things you have to
begin by getting a kind of a tolerable
grasp of reality if you don't have that
it doesn't matter how good your
sentiments are and I just don't think
that's a tolerable grasp of reality well
that you can figure out but anyhow that
seems to be the thing that's missing
those in any university certain parties
third parties uh well you know I think
they have interesting possibilities
there is for the first time ever really
a Labour Party hasn't run yet but it's
around the new party which coming out of
mostly Wisconsin has a good idea behind
it if they can reach sufficient scale it
could be effective I mean they're they
have a long-term program which is
actually pretty much the program of the
Christian Right which was the right
program kind of build structure at the
local levels when the elections you can
even if they're for school board you
know then have fusion candidates they're
trying to push through fusion principles
so you can you know vote on your own
line for somebody else so you don't
throw away your voter to say a federal
election and try to keep getting closely
involved with community development
programs which they're doing sometimes
even with business support all of this
makes perfect sense it's a question of
scale energy commitment and so on I'm my
view these very there's three or four of
these initiatives they obviously ought
to get together they're all going right
down parallel paths and to split the
minuscule energies that are around that
doesn't make any sense that's been a
perennial problem I need not say there's
a big I mean look there was just a
meeting in Washington it was kind of
interesting it's also interesting that
it wasn't covered by any of the media
even suspend c-span it was
the Progressive Caucus of Congress which
is 50 people it's pretty pretty lot and
they had a day-long session in
Washington on Capitol Hill which was
quite interesting i was there had talked
there in fact i mean that kind of talk
has never been heard on capitol hill it
was ranging from sort of you know
mainstream liberal democrat all the way
over to pretty militant left not a peep
out of anyone that's a big part of
Congress and it reflects I think it
probably reflects a majority of the
public at least if you can believe in
opinion polls and that's a lot of
potential can be how much it can work
through the political system it's pretty
hard to say after all we have about a
hundred and fifty years in which the
political system has been mostly a
matter of competition among groups of
investors who invest to control estate
but that's not a law of nature either so
yeah I think there's potential there way
back there's opposition than Congress
but you know for reasons that I don't
think I mean I don't you know you can
have your own opinion about it- kind of
negative but it's the opposition in
Congress is for different reasons mostly
kind of chauvinistic reasons i think why
should we bail out the damn european
sort of but i think it's a very
problematic move i mean i think it makes
sense to move towards various kinds of
integration in europe and which kinds
but i can't see any result any
constructive result that can be achieved
through NATO that can't be achieved
through european union type arrangements
except for one thing it keeps us power
over the whole system which is in fact
part of what NATO was for in the first
place not so much to defend against the
Russians as to make sure that Europe
went the right way and European elites
are in favor of this because they're
worried about their own working classes
and so on so in my view it's due
is move although some kind of
integration of parts of Eastern Europe
into general system are not a bad idea I
mean you could say the same thing about
say NAFTA isn't after a good idea or bad
idea well there's no answer to that
question a free trade agreement linking
Canada the United States Mexico maybe
other places that might very well be a
good idea but NAFTA my opinion was a
very bad idea because that's not what it
was it was something quite different it
was an investor rights agreement which
was highly protectionists and happened
that we have a it was predictable that
it was predicted that it was going to
have a very negative effect on all three
countries and it has for the country's
not for the rich they've gained but and
this was pointed out at the time depends
what kind of NAFTA not NAFTA what kind
of NAFTA that's the question was never
allowed to be debated incidentally
although was the position put forward by
the labor movement by the office of
Technology Assessment in Congress by
plenty of independent dissident but that
was never allowed to be part of the
discussion it was either this version of
NAFTA are nothing but the real issue is
what kind and I think the same arises
here what it's not integration or
nothing it's what kind of integration
one under the rubric of nato's seems to
be kind of starting off on the wrong
foot
amazing place not first of all because
it's not against the interests of the
people who are running the system
they're doing fine including people like
us you know people i mean i don't know
you obviously but my guess is you're
kind of like me you know where people
who in fact do pretty well out of the
system like I'm checked out the numbers
but i'm sure my in personal income went
up a lot faster because of reagan I'd
policies then it would under
alternatives people who are graduating
from this law school they're going to
great you know the ones who are are the
doctrinal managers and of course we have
their hands on the levers of power they
define and the same is true in the third
world the people who were you go down to
say Brazil or India or say you know
Russia or other parts of the third world
Russia is part of it again you find that
all of these programs are strongly
advocated by educated elites by the
business world and so on sure they're
going to do fine in fact you go back to
the British Empire when India was being
converted remember from the leading
industrial commercial power of them in
the world into a deeply impoverished
peasants society with real Horrors I was
all as strongly supported by educated
sectors in India and a late up till a
point where they wanted mostly had a
nationalist on grounds take it over from
ourselves so the people the elements who
have internalized the but I don't say
the lying you know the elements that
have internalized the beliefs and you
know write these things yeah they do
pretty well that's in their
self-interest and that's as old as
history it may happen that it in fact I
think it does happen that it harms most
of the population but the policy is not
made for the most of the population
actually can learn that from Adam Smith
if anybody wants to bother reading it
instead of praying to the shrine he
pointed out quite accurately well it's
quote him he said that in England he's
talking about England of course he said
in England the prince
architects of policy make sure private
interests who control the state make
sure that their own interests are most
peculiarly attended to no matter how
Grievous the impact on others including
the people of England well okay he
didn't have the data to prove that but
in fact he was right it turns out yeah
the principal architects of policy in
his days as he said the merchants and
manufacturers of England do use state
power to protect their own interests and
very effectively no matter what happens
to others including the people of
England and I don't think that principle
has changed since Adam Smith what he was
I mean everybody knows he wrote a book
called wealth of nations but less known
as the fact that he knew that the notion
of nation was a myth there's no such
thing as national interests there's
internal divisions in the nation the
merchants and manufacturers have a
completely different interest than most
of the population and talk about the
prosperity of nations is just mythology
as he was aware that was later called
class analysis but he was certainly
aware of it and explicit about it so
that's what you have to ask who's
gaining and who's losing and you'll find
out that the domestic population quite
often loses even if the powerful and
wealthy sectors are gaining and I think
we're seeing that very dramatically
right now you see it in the wealth
distribution figures and the
deterioration of democratic structures
and whole business way back
economic efficient well first of all as
a loss didn't you I'm sure know or ought
to know that this has been going on for
a couple hundred years I mean the whole
American and in fact British legal
systems were transformed through the
19th century everything from tort law on
to everything else to facilitate to
develop the developmental state and the
accumulation of power profit and the
rise of corporations and so on there's
very good and work on this the best
thing I know is Morton Horowitz's two
volumes and transformation of American
law which goes into this in considerable
detail but there's plenty more so yeah
the new law and economics group is just
moved doing the same thing what they're
talking about as efficiency is indeed
efficient for their wealth wealthy and
the powerful maybe not for anyone else
and it seems to me the right way to
respond to it is to put it in its
context which is a long history and then
to evaluate the arguments on their
merits obviously and if you find as I
think you will that the merits are
pretty thin to ask who's benefiting from
this kind of ideology and should we pay
any attention to it when I have a
different legal system that supports
different interests
the nation and I'm wondering especially
given their role as an academic and how
you chosen politically engaged that if
you would speak to the myth of the
University and in particular I think
that we don't even need to go to this
call third world to see so many of you
wishes meaning just step outside
communicate and see him right here with
the graduate student strike Yale and the
struggles and the various conflict
resolution yeah yeah you're actually
right i mean the university is a bastion
of privilege and power inside very ugly
society and as you say you can go a
couple blocks away and see it and in
fact even internally there are similar
divisions what can you do about it
anything you choose you know you're not
going to be tortured not going to be
sent to the gulag the worst thing that
will happen is people will scream at you
and maybe won't get a job there are
worse fates you know that's not nice you
know it's not nice to be abused and
hated and so on and maybe to be cut off
from you know being as rich as you might
be but the penalties for action in a
rich country free in rich country like
this are so miniscule as compared with
what people are facing all the time
everywhere in the world you just can't
even laugh at it you know well so we can
make our choices and there there were
attempts at Yale as you can find out if
you don't already know about 20 years
ago to open up the campus to people in
the community like bring in people for
you know evening and courses run by
students and things like that that was
squash pretty fast huh there are
possibilities for all kinds of
engagement with community issues and
after all you know we're not stuck I
mean it's important to deal with new
haven but there's a much bigger world
there were lots of things are going on
and in a university with all kinds of
capacities to deal with these issues
they can be thought about to like our
policies towards Brazil and India can be
an issue here I'm like there's 15
million or so children dying a year
according to the world health
organization from easily treatable
diseases you know which would require
maybe a couple of pennies a day and a
you know like diarrhea you know they
need salt or something measles which you
can protect people against well we can
do something about that we don't have to
help kill 15 million children a year if
we don't want there there are millions
of women around the world who are dying
from pregnancy related diseases most of
them easily treatable hospitals right
close you know doesn't have to happen
it's New Haven is a serious problem but
our outreach is far greater it's simply
a question of how much you feel like
doing about it now I don't mean you i
mean everybody me too but the
repercussions personally are so small as
compared with what people face who are
really fighting these battles that you
can't even discuss it I mean I was in
Colombia is to give an example a couple
of months ago with an amnesty
international mission colombia receives
more military aid and training from the
United States than any country in the
hemisphere it's under the cover of drugs
but it has almost nothing to do with
drugs as any human rights group report
or expert analysis will tell you the
murders are going on an unbelievable
rate mostly military and paramilitary
according to America's watch our
military aid is going to go up you get
down there I mean there are people you
know hasn't women priests other people
who are working out there under
horrendous conditions I'm getting like a
friend of mine who is they I got I met a
guy who is there as a law student from
University of Michigan who was working
in human rights work and in one of the
human right search based human rights
groups
when I was down there and we were in
contact or months later I got a email
message from him he was in hiding in
Bogota sending indirectly an email
message he was in hiding because he had
gone out to visit a human rights worker
out in one of the outside towns and
while he was there in the guy's house
paramilitary elements who work for the
military and who were funded by us it
came in took this guy outside murdered
him in the front of his children and he
was able to save one of the children by
dragging him away then he had to go into
hiding because he'd witnessed it if he
stayed there he'd be killed and then he
had to figure out a way to sneak his way
out of the country now he's back in the
United States the stuff is going on all
the time but the people are still going
out I mean we don't face that we can't
talk about costs and that's not just
Colombia that's a lot of places
to question anyway I swear we are so
involved on a great deal and even
insinuating saying you know still with
the butter Garcia versus tied up your
practice and enforcement watch that's
true but what do you feel the prospects
giving the new under Paris legislation
you gotta stay a little Christmas we
took service sectors of the population
how much more restricted and less seen
and most of the rest of society is asked
to see perhaps better future for your
feelings I've had better the real
question like to ask you would seem to
be encouraging broader thought or that
is you feel about the function of
technology at how many industrial
society as its accumulated in you know
empirically measurable ways mr.
especially in a recent period you know
what's the effect comes get yourself as
no holding that our senators views I
feel I manifest in a very poor way in
terms of favoring future society that
relates to more primitive at least
philosophy as
not actually questioning structures of
Technology additional paper yeah yeah
there were two separate questions there
let me see if I can summarize and
quickly one is that when I talk about
people being free of repression and that
sort of thing that's certain that's
certainly not true for sectors in
American society affect big sectors like
if you're a black male in Washington DC
it's a different story then you're
facing police terror that's absolutely
true but I'm not we're not black males
in downtown Washington you know we're
part of the rich and privileged sector
so it's different and there's a lot to
say about this in fact if you're a
working-class ordinary me d median
income family you know say a
working-class person who's working hours
I've had to go way up just to keep food
on the table and whose wife has to go to
work full-time not because if she wants
to find but force due to keep food on
the table and you're both spending 50
hours a week and there's no daycare and
you know there's no money for health
care and so and you don't have time to
think about these things so that's maybe
you don't call that police repression
but it's something that controls people
but we're not that kind of people you
know we're free so yeah it's a
capitalist society you gotta freedoms a
commodity like anything else if you got
enough money by a lot of it and weep all
of us can buy a lot of it there are
other people who can't buy so much so
for them it's harder incidentally
they're the ones who do things despite
the repression and just as in Colombia
and so on but your point I agree with
however I don't think it applies to us
the opposite no I don't think so I don't
think that in a rich wealthy society
like this the wealthy will ever permit
wealthy dissidents to be repressed I
mean I've been through this a lot of my
life I've been sort of in and out of
jail close to long jail sentences and so
on has never been anything that I could
for repression and it's not because you
know I'm loved by people in power what
Nixon's enemies list the you know
co-conspirator with your bill coffin in
a court case and so on it's just that
wealthy and powerful sectors in the
united states do not want the state to
be strong enough to go after people like
them okay well that happens to offer us
plenty of protection and i don't think
the Counter Terrorism Act will affect
that in the least I mean anything could
happen but I mean I think this is
speculation often Mars I mean in the
real world we are unusually free on the
other point the on the question of
Technology in anarcho-syndicalism and so
on I don't quite see it the way you do I
mean it doesn't see it seems to me that
anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism in
particular we're not against technology
and they were not in favor of a more
primitive organization of society there
are strains in the anarchist movement
that were primitive 'used but certainly
not the anarcho-syndicalist i mean
they're big achievement was organizing
catalonian industry which pre advanced
that was an idea about how to develop to
organize democratically in advanced
industrial society as for technology i
mean i don't think it makes sense to be
against it I didn't know that you know
in fact there are real problems in the
world and they're going to have to have
any solutions are going to have
technical solutions that's true of
environmental problems of health
problems of all you know cultural
problems and so on the technology in
itself is mostly neutral technology
doesn't care I mean let's say a hammer
okay I mean you can use it to bash
somebody's head in and if you give it to
a brazilian torture that's maybe what
they'll do with their you can use it to
build a house you know the hammer
doesn't care and the same is true the
internet and just about any technology
you can imagine effects pretty hard to
think of a kind of technology that is
inherently oppressive or Liberatore
there everything depends who's
controlling so it seems to me we got a
welcome technology and use it as a means
of liberation and freedom
oppression and so unless they take
automation okay I mean if you could
really can't be done right now but
suppose you could really robot eyes to
the point where you get get rid of the
kind of work that nobody wants to do not
you not me not the people who are forced
to do it suppose you could get machines
to do it terrific yeah you're free
people up to do better things with their
lives and the same is true of now maybe
the way it's being used is to drive
people into poverty and out of work and
so on and so forth but that's a social
decision the technology doesn't care you
know you can use it in other ways and I
think that that's true across the board
I don't myself think it makes any sense
for anarchist to be opposed to
technology I think they should welcome
it and ask for it to be used to free
people
yeah is there any hope for a resurgent
afl-cio given the World Trade situation
yeah there's plenty first of all the
World Trade situation let me stress is
not radically different than it's been
in the past in fact it's not unlike the
early part of the century under British
hegemony and with the gold standard so
it's not that this um there are changes
like radical financial flows but they're
controllable I think but in most things
it's not all that new you know there's
an idea of being given to you that it's
some fantastic thing that we can't
control but have a look at the facts
it's not true and I think this is pretty
well known to economists you know you
can read about it in standard sources or
just look at the numbers so yes there's
plenty of problems but and they may
require and in fact do require I think
new forms of working class solidarity of
the kind that we're contemplated and in
fact implemented a century ago and say
the the internationals which were
internationals remember so for example
now a German workers and American
workers have very similar interests for
example German workers have very
significant interests in preventing the
southeastern United States from going
even deeper into the third world and it
is now they don't like it when
daimler-benz shifts production to
Alabama because they can get third world
conditions there you know where workers
have a are paid a fraction of the wages
of German workers with no benefits and
the state pours in resources to you know
protect them and so on and so forth so
in fact you know people members of the
German unions have come here to try to
talk to us workers about organizing
jointly to protect the common race to
the bottom that's being forced on them
by their common oppressors and an
American where US workers do the same
with Mexico and Guatemala there's or
Indonesia and so on yeah I think
national interaction is very important
here and the United States plays a sort
of an intermediate role remember
production workers here are not the
highest paid in the world by any means
they're going down relative to the
industrial world even in terms of
purchasing power you know which is the
proper measure the United States is
still a richest country in the world not
for production workers and fact this is
the only industrial country where work
where wages have actually declined in
the last 15 or 20 years along with
benefits and security and everything
else so we're somewhere in the middle of
all of this third world from some points
of view first world from others and that
does require international solidarity on
the part of working people which is
harder to workout than solidarity
between you know say Indiana and
Michigan but of course there's a lot
more means to do it to the states then
there were 100 years ago is there a
opportunity for a revitalization of the
US labor movement yeah I think so or not
cake there's a terrific work on this
subject by a Yale historian David
Montgomery who has a book for example
called something like the rise and fall
of the house of labor is it labor
historian done great work on these
topics the rise and fall of the house of
labor is about the 1920s the fall of the
house of labor took place in the 1920s
that's when the labor movement the
United States was finally crushed by as
he puts it in a very undemocratic
America with plenty of violence
including the Wilson administration and
so on but that was the 1920s in the
1930s it rose again in fact the new
heights that it had never reached before
ok we're not how many things are bad but
they're not the 1920s it's way better
than that and there's no reason why it
shouldn't rise again in fact people like
us could do a lot to help
nineteen twenties and that I was just
shocked i'm not american born so I think
you know that there is a law that was
enacted in 1926 was put into place and
now we see that the 1997 the President
of the United States goss and stops the
strike and it does not government
intervention that I don't know what it
is of course its government irreversible
is a smarter government is its your
right and it's exactly what I said
smaller government for you if it's going
to help you but bigger government for me
if it's going to help me yeah
television and I show you yeah all over
the place I just came back from Brazil
or it's been an hour and a half in a
national televised press interview I
just came before that I'm in Australia I
gave the talk at the national press club
live televised no over the country yeah
sure but that's understandable look if
that weren't it wasn't happening in the
United States I begin to think I'm doing
something wrong I mean why should why
should television which is commercial
incidentally I personally do better on
commercial than on public television but
why should any of these systems want to
offer publicity to somebody who's trying
to say they ought to be destroyed
femur before each other even extensively
and so well I actually the day that just
to give an example the day that jose
ramos-horta is an old personal friend
and Bishop bellow I also know he's been
mostly in East Timor when he came here I
meta and I've been involved in this
issue for 20 years extensively but the
day that the Nobel Prize was announced I
did get plenty of interviews in fact
even had a long interview in the globe
but it was not the Boston Globe it was
Oh chlobo in Brazil ultra right-wing
newspaper The Boston Globe I know the
people you know we're even personal
friends and if I they heard they got
into the issue to the extent they did
through my incessant hammering at their
door but the same with the new york
times but here they have a different
agenda and from their point of view
rightly you know you can't it doesn't
make a lot of sense to criticize General
Motors for trying to raise profits okay
and it doesn't make a lot of sense to
criticize the huge corporations that
control the media system for trying to
protect their interests I mean I don't
think we should like it or accept it but
the way not to like it or accept that is
to eliminate the power not to blame them
for doing what they're obviously going
to do given their institutional nature
if you go outside the United States of
course it's different actually even
inside the United States it's more
nuanced let me drop myself because I
don't make this personalized but i can
give you plenty of examples there there
is i don't know if you probably don't
hear it much here but there is a guy
named David barsamian who does a lot of
alternative radio he it turns out to be
extreme isn't other technology it could
be used if people would do something
instead of you know wailing about the
problems it's extremely cheap to get on
satellites turns out you know really not
a lot of money to put something up on a
satellite and then it can be picked up
by radio stations anywhere you know he's
been spending a lot of he runs a small
community based radio for
the station out in boulder colorado and
one of the things have been doing for
years is putting on the satellite tapes
of talks like say maybe he'll do i don't
know who's televising this but maybe
he'll do this one but he does lots of
talks of mine of howard zinn's of you
know it's i heed of a couple other
people who are wandering around
rabble-rousing he and he has a record
now of years of how it works and it's
quite interesting he's even written
about it he's virtually excluded from
the eastern seaboard but as you move
further to the west it kind of opens up
like in Des Moines you know or central
oregon or idaho or someplace they'll run
estate and I think that's similar to
what you're describing and there's a
pretty good reason for it if you're in
the ideological and power centers makes
a lot of difference what you think you
know and what you believe because you're
going to be in a position to make
decisions that affect things if you're
often central Idaho you can think what
you like no not bother anybody and in
fact the controls decline and it's the
same in Greek television as crazy Greeks
want to think something they can't do
anything about it anyway so okay fine
we'll let them run the stuff but what
people think in places like Boston and
New Haven and New York and Washington
that makes a difference and as a result
I think you get the highest degree of
indoctrination and ideological control
and the more a late centers including
the university's i should say i think
it's kind of hard to prove but it's an
impression if it's true it would be
understandable let's get together yeah
okay sorry
