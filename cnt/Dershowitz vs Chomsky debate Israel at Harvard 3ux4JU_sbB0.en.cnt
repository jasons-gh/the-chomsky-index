Tuesday alan dershowitz and Noam Chomsky
debated how to end the
israeli-palestinian conflict at Harvard
University's Institute of Politics this
is an hour and a half
born in Brooklyn Professor Alan
Dershowitz graduated from Brooklyn
College and Yale Law School at Yale he
graduated first in his class and served
as editor-in-chief of the Yale Law
Review
after clerking for Chief Judge David
freslin and justice Arthur Goldberg he
was appointed to the Harvard Law Faculty
at age 25 there wasn't even time for you
to join a mid-career program here at the
school and he became a full professor at
28 the youngest in the school's history
when not teaching students he found time
to be one of the country's most
accomplished defense lawyers and
authored over 20 books his latest the
case for peace how the arab-israeli
conflict can be solved has received
favorable reviews from former President
Bill Clinton and Middle East negotiator
Dennis Ross at Harvard Law School where
he is the Felix Frankfurter professor of
law professor Dershowitz teaches courses
in criminal law constitutional
litigation civil liberties and violence
legal ethics and human rights professor
Noam Chomsky son of a Hebrew scholar
professor Chomsky was born in
Philadelphia while he acquired his PhD
from the University of Pennsylvania in
1955 much of his research leading to his
degree was done here at Harvard between
1951 and 1955 in 1955 he joined MIT and
in 61 was appointed full professor in
the department of modern languages and
linguistics from his articulate
opposition to the Vietnam War in the
mid-60s to his book manufacturing
consent in 1988 and to his even more
challenging text 9/11 published after
the terrorist attack that year Noam
Chomsky has never retreated from taking
on the most pressing issues of our day
professor Chomsky is the Institute
sort of linguistics at MIT and teaches
classes in linguistic Theory syntax
semantics and the philosophy of language
before we begin and to set the
appropriate tone in context for this
evening I'd like us to have a brief look
at a short clip from a forum event last
year hi my name is Laura dagi I am a
junior in the college and I was
wondering as a leader who is
internationally recognized in the
struggle for peace what advice do you
have for the rising leaders of our
generation also hold on biggle don't be
like us be different you know thousand
and a very little patience for history I
believe that to imagine is more
important than to remember let me just
repeat that so that we have that as the
tone and the context for our discussion
tonight and I quote from Shimon Peres
first of all don't be like us be
different
personally I have very little patience
for history I believe that to imagine is
more important to remember so tonight
let us imagine what should be the next
steps in the process of achieving peace
in the Middle East for your knowledge a
coin toss conducted by the Harvard
speech in parliamentary debate Society
has determined that professor Dershowitz
will speak first for 10 minutes after
that we will go to directly to professor
Chomsky and then the floor will be open
professor Dershowitz thank you it's a
great honor for me to be participating
in a debate with a man who has been
called the world's top public
intellectual my connections to Noam
Chomsky go back a long time in the 1940s
I was a camper and he a counselor
in a Hebrew speaking Zionist camp and
the Pocono Mountains called camp Mossad
in the 1960s we both worked against the
Vietnam War in the 1970s we had the
first of our many debates about the
arab-israeli conflict I advocated ending
the Israeli occupation in exchange for
peace and recognition of Israel he
advocated a one-state solution modeled
on Lebanon and Yugoslavia we debated
again in the 1980s in the 1990s I have
the text I hope that our once a decade
encounter will continue for many decades
to come though I doubt we will agree
with each other the debate today occurs
at a time of real potential for peace
Shimon Peres Israel's elder statesman in
the peace camp today quit the labor
party and announced his support for
Ariel Sharon in the upcoming election
quote in my eyes it is not a problem of
parties but a problem of peace how to
create a strong coalition for peace the
elements are now in place for a real
peace as I wrote in the case for peace
when the Palestinian leadership wants a
Palestinian state more than it wants to
see the destruction of Israel they will
finally be a two-state solution the
untimely death of Yasser Arafat makes
the two-state solution a real
possibility I call our Fox death
untimely because if it had occurred five
years earlier we might now be
celebrating the anniversary of
Palestinian statehood our Fox decision
to turn down the Clinton Barack plan for
Palestinian statehood was characterized
by Prince Bandar of Saudi Arabia as
quote a crime against the Palestinians
in fact against the entire region the
crime and the death that it needlessly
caused can never be undone but this is
the time to move forward and to assure
that the crime is not repeated the time
has come for compromise my friend Amos
oz the great novelist and leader of the
Israeli peace movement has said there
are two possible resolutions to a
conflict of the
kind a Shakespearian and the check off
even in a shakespeare drama every right
is wrong every act is revenged every
injustice is made right and perfect
justice is prevailed prevails but at the
end of the play everybody lies dead on
the stage in a Chekhov play everybody's
disillusioned embittered heartbroken and
disappointed but they remain alive we
need to check off in resolution for the
arab-israeli tragedy this will require
the elevation of pragmatism over
ideology it will require that both sides
give up rights rights giving up rights
is a hard thing to do it will require
that each side recognizes and
acknowledges the pain and the suffering
of the other and it will require an end
to the hateful attitudes and speech that
some on each side direct against the
other sometimes it's better to start at
the end the ultimate solution is not as
much in dispute these days as is the
means for getting there I believe that
even professor Chomsky and I have the
same basic agreement about a number of
very important elements of what a
pragmatic resolution might look like
professor Chomsky now acknowledges that
the two-state solution may be quote the
best of the rotten ideas around I'll
settle for that he also seems to
acknowledge that those who advocate the
so-called Palestinian right of return
are pandering to their people and
misleading them into believing that
there is yet another weapon a
demographic weapon that can destroy
Israel I think we both agree that
Jerusalem should be divided essentially
along demographic lines with the
Palestinians controlling the Palestinian
population and Israel controlling the
Jewish population that the borders
between Israel and the Palestinian state
should be based roughly on the UN
resolution 242 that Israel properly
ended its occupation of the Gaza and
that it should end its occupation of all
Palestinian cities and population
centres on the West Bank that terrorism
must stop
and that the Palestinian state that
results from this piece must be as
contiguous as possible and economically
and politically viable there remain
considerable differences between us and
more importantly between the Israeli
government and the Palestinian Authority
that must resolve these issues and
actually sit down and make peace some of
these differences are attitudinal I
believe that peace is a realistic
possibility where as professor Chomsky
apparently believes there is no chance
for peace at least as reflected by the
German title of his new book kinda
Schantz fear Friedman which translates
as no chance for peace why a Palestinian
state is not possible to be established
with Israel and the United States I hope
you're wrong but the differences are
quite specific relating to precise
boundaries and considerations that are
quite important the devil always being
in the details I strongly believe
however that there is a genuine will for
peace on both sides now and that the
pragmatic differences can and will be
resolved and here I think the Academy
can play a very important and positive
role in fostering peace at the moment
I'm saying to report that many academics
around the world are contributing to an
atmosphere that makes peace more
difficult to achieve they are
encouraging those Palestinians who see
the end of Israel as their ultimate goal
to persist in their ideological and
terrorist campaign by demonizing and D
legitimating Israel in the international
community and on university campuses
throughout the world they send a doubly
destructive message to those who must
make peace on the ground to the
Palestinians the messages don't
compromise if you hold out long enough
the next generation of leaders will buy
into your efforts to delegitimize Israel
and will give you the total victory you
see to the Israelis the messages
whatever you do in the name of
compromise you will continue to be
attacked demonized vested from boycotted
and D legitimated so why make the
compromise efforts as I travel around
college campuses in the United States I
notice a stark difference
many of those who support the
Palestinian cause tend to be very
opposed to Israel comparing the Jewish
states and Nazism and apartheid
comparing Shimon Peres to Hitler and IDI
men calling Israel the world's worst
human rights violators and suggesting
that Israel should be flattered by a
comparison with the Gestapo these are
all quotes the men Hitler quote from
professor Chomsky the comparison with
Gestapo from Norman Finkelstein whereas
most of those on the Israeli side tend
to be supportive of a peaceful
Palestinian state but another way pro
Palestinians tend to be anti Israel
whereas pro Israelis are often pro
palestinian as well it was not the
Israelis who scuttled the United Nations
two-state solution in 1948 and
themselves originally occupied Gaza and
the West Bank with little or no
objection from the international
community that was Egypt in Jordan it
was not the Israelis who turned down
resolution 242 in 1967 with the famous
three knows no negotiation no peace and
no recognition as Abba Eban put it this
is the first time in history that the
side who won the war sued for peace in
the side that lost the war demanded
unconditional surrender it was not
Israel that turned down the generous
offer at Camp David in Taba the
Palestinian leadership has never missed
an opportunity to miss an opportunity
but it is not too late for peace now I
wish to end my opening remarks today by
making a specific proposal directed to
my distinguished opponent I propose here
today a peace treaty among academics who
purport to favor peace between Israel
and the Palestinians I believe that by
agreeing to this peace treaty and by
implementing it academics can actually
contribute to encouraging a pragmatic
peace I call today for those who have
supported the Palestinian cause to stop
demonizing Israel to stop dealer Jetta
mating Israel to stop defaming Israel to
stop applying a double standard to
Israel to stop divestiture and boycotts
of Israel and
importantly to stop being more
Palestinian than the Palestinians
themselves I call on academics who
support Israel not to call for a greater
Israel nor to call for a continuation of
the occupation of Palestinian cities to
stop being more Israeli than the
Israelis themselves and to join the vast
majority of Israeli and American
supporters of Israel who favor the
two-state solution if the two elder
statesmen of Israel Sharon and Peres can
place pragmatism before ideology and
peace before party and come together
toward the center in the interest of a
pragmatic peace then surely two elder
statesmen of the American academic
debate over Israel who share this
platform tonight can also make our
contribution to the peace process by
encouraging those who respect us and
sometimes follow our guidance to move
closer to the center and closer to
accepting a pragmatic non-ideological
resolution of this bitter conflict
ecclesiastes many years ago said to
everything there is a season a time to
throw stones a time to gather stones a
time for war and a time for peace this
is the season of peace let us not let it
pass us by thank you very much
Thank You professor
Durst which professor Chomsky mr.
Mendell will confirm there was an
explicit condition for this debate that
is that neither participant tried to
evade the issue by deceitful allegations
about the other so I therefore
congratulate mr. Dershowitz on having
made a true statement I was a counselor
at Mossad about the rest there happens
to be an ample record in print or if you
like you can ask a question but I'll
keep to the topic and the rules
the topic is where do we go from here
the answer to that is largely up to us
evidently it requires some understanding
of how we got here the question of where
we're going now has a clear answer it's
given accurately by the leading academic
specialist on the occupation Harvard's
Sarah Roy as she writes that under the
terms of disengagement gazans are
virtually sealed within the strip while
West bankers their lands dismembered by
relentless Israeli settlement will
continue to be penned into fragmented
geographic spaces isolated behind and
between walls and barriers her judgment
is affirmed by Israel's leading
specialists on the West Bank mehron
benveniste
who writes that the separation wall
snaking through the West Bank will
create three Bantu stands his words
North Central and South all virtually
separated from East Jerusalem the center
of Palestinian commercial cultural and
political life and he adds that this is
what he calls the soft transfer from
Jerusalem that is an unavoidable result
of the separation wall might achieve its
goal quoting still the goal of
disintegration of the Palestinian
community after many earlier attempts
fail the human disaster being planned he
continues will turn hundreds of
thousands of people into a sullen
community hostile and nurturing a desire
for revenge it's another example of the
sacrifice of security - expansion that's
been going on for a long time a European
Union report concludes that us back
Israeli programs will virtually end the
prospects for a viable Palestinian state
by the canonization and by breaking the
organic links between East Jerusalem and
the West Bank
Human Rights Watch in a recent statement
concurs there was no effort to conceal
the fact that Gaza disengagement was in
reality West Bank expansion the official
plan for disengagement stated that
Israel will permanently take over major
population centers cities towns and
villages security areas and other places
of special interest to Israel in the
West Bank that was endorsed by the US
ambassador as it had been by the
president breaking sharply with US
policy along with the disengagement plan
Israel announced investment of tens of
millions of dollars in West Bank
settlements Prime Minister Sharon
immediately approved new housing units
in the town of Malaya to meme to the
east of Jerusalem the core of the
salient that divides the southern from
the central van to stand to use
benveniste Sturm and also announced
other expansion plans and there is near
unanimity that all of this violates
international law the consensus was
expressed by US judge Bergen Thal in his
separate declaration attached to the
world court judgment ruling that the
separation wall is illegal in Bergen
halls words the Fourth Geneva Convention
and international human rights law are
applicable to the occupied Palestinian
territory and must therefore be fully
complied with
by Israel accordingly the segments of
the wall being built by Israel to
protect the settlements are it so facto
in violation of international
humanitarian law which happens to mean
about 80 percent of the wall
two months later Israel's High Court
rejected that judgment ruling that the
separation wall quoting must take into
account the need to provide security for
Israelis living in the West Bank
including their property rights this is
consistent with chief justice Barack's
doctrine that Israeli law supersedes
international law particularly in East
Jerusalem and next in violation of
Security Council orders and practically
speaking he's correct as long as the
United States continues to provide the
required economic military and
diplomatic support as it has been doing
for thirty years in violation of the
international consensus on a two-state
settlement you can find detailed
documentation about all of this in work
of mine and others who have supported
the international consensus for 30 years
in print explicitly in Israeli
literature like Benny Morris's histories
you can find ample evidence about the
nature of the occupation in Morris's
words founded on brute force repression
and fear collaboration and treachery
beatings and torture chambers and daily
intimidation humiliation and
manipulation along with stealing of
valuable land and resources like other
Israeli political and legal commentators
Morris Reserve special criticism for the
Supreme Court whose record he writes
will surely go down as a dark day in the
annals of israel's judicial system
keeping to the diplomatic record the
first in both sides of course rejected
242 the first important step forward was
in 1971 when President Sadat of Egypt
offered a full peace treaty to Israel
in return for Israeli withdrawal from
the occupied territories that would have
ended the international conflict Israel
rejected the offer choosing expansion
over security in this case expansion
into the Egyptian Sinai where general
Sharon's forces had driven thousands of
farmers into the desert to clear the
land for the old jewish city of young
each of the u.s. fact israel stand those
decisions led to the 1973 war and near a
disaster for israel the US and Israel
then recognized that Egypt could not be
dismissed and finally accepted so that's
1971 offer at Camp David in 1979 but by
then the agreement included the demand
for a Palestinian state which had
reached the international agenda in 1976
the major Arab states introduced a
resolution to the UN Security Council
calling for a peace settlement on the
international border based on UN 242 but
now adding a Palestinian state in the
occupied territories that Syria Egypt
Jordan and every other relevant state
the u.s. veto the resolution again in
1980 the General Assembly passed similar
resolutions year after year with the
United States and Israel opposed the
matter reached ahead in 1988 when the
pillow moved from tacit approval to
formal acceptance of the two-state
consensus Israel responded with the
declaration that there can be no as they
put it additional Palestinian state
between Jordan and the C Jordan already
being the Palestinian state that Shimon
Peres and music Shamir and also that the
status of the territories must be
settled according to Israeli guidelines
the u.s. endorsed Israel stand I can
only add what I wrote at the time it's
as if someone were to argue the Jews
don't need a second homeland in Israel
because they already have New York in
May 1997 for the first time Paris's
Labor Party agreed not to rule out the
establishment of a Palestinian state
with limited sovereignty in areas
excluding major Jewish settlement blocks
that is the three Canton's that were
being constructed with us support the
highest rate of post Oslo settlement was
in 2000 the final year of Clinton's term
and Prime Minister Brock's maps of the
us-israel proposals at Camp David Shoah
salient east of Jerusalem bisecting the
West Bank and a northern said in
virtually dividing the northern from the
central Canton I have the maps if you
want them the current map considerably
extends the salience and the isolation
of East Jerusalem
the my maps are from the leading Israeli
scholars run boondocks the director of
the Shimon Peres Center the crucial
issue at Camp David was territorial not
the refugee issue for which RFA agreed
to a pragmatic solution as fund back the
leading scholar reveals no Palestinian
could accept the canonization including
the u.s. favourite Mahmoud Abbas a
Clinton we also debated because Clinton
recognized that Palestinian objections
had validity and in December 2000
proposed his parameters which went some
way towards satisfying Palestinian
rights in Clinton's words Barack and
Arafat Arafat had both accepted these
parameters as the basis for further
efforts both have expressed some
reservations the reservations were
addressed at a high-level meeting in
Taba which made considerable progress
and might have led to a settlement but
Israel called them off that one week at
Taba is the only break in 30 years of us
Israeli rejection ism
high-level informal negotiations
continued leading to the Geneva Accord
of December 2002 welcomed by virtually
the entire world rejected by Israel
dismissed by Washington that could have
been the basis for a just peace it still
can bye-bye then however bush are on
bulldozers were demolishing any basis
for it every sane Israeli Hawk
understood that it was absurd for Israel
to leave 8,000 settlers in Gaza
protected by a large part of the army
while taking over scarce water resources
and arable land the same conclusion was
to withdraw from Gaza while expanding
through the West Bank and that will
continue as long as Washington insists
on marching on the road to catastrophe
by rejecting minimal Palestinian rights
I'm quoting the warning of the four
former heads of Israel Shin Beit
Security Service there are clear
alternatives and if that March the
catastrophe continues we will have only
ourselves to blame Thank You professor
[Applause]
hi my name is Nikki Harmon I'm from
Jerusalem and this is a question asked
in professor Chomsky I wanted to know if
you think that it actually is relevant
to dwell upon forming a shared narrative
of both sides in in in going forth
towards any any solution of peace
between us is it important for us to
actually agree what what what
forty-eight represents for one one side
and what 48 represents for the other in
order to live together in peace in the
future yes I think it's very relevant to
understand history if you want to
understand the present because it's a
country I think the history has to be
objectively verifiable and it doesn't
become true because professor Chomsky
says it's true there was a two-state
solution proposed by the United Nations
in 1948 and if the Palestinians had
accepted what the Israelis accepted a
small non contiguous state with vanta
stands to quote professor Chomsky and
instead of not invaded and if the
Egyptians had not occupied the Gaza
something that nobody complained about
it was literally a prison for 20 years
and if they're Jordanian said and
occupied the West Bank literally a
prison for twenty years and had the
situation gone forward as it was
supposed to go forward in 48 we would
not be here we'd have a two-state
solution but what happened is it's clear
that the Palestinian and Arab leadership
was more interested in destroying the
nascent Jewish state of Israel than in
establishing a Palestinian state that is
simply the truth and there is no way to
deny that and no amount of rhetoric can
undercut that reality 1948 I'd be glad
discuss that if you like though it's not
relevant okay I began with seven for a
good reason
because it's in 1967 that UN 242 was
passed and a framework was laid for
peace settlements and since then it's
the wit well let me bring concuss I was
whoa well I participated in the drafting
in a small way of 242 I was off the
Goldbergs assistant at
Supreme Court he drafted two for two he
conferred with me and consulted with me
two for two clearly contemplated Israel
retaining some of the territories needed
to create secure boundaries in 1967 the
UN rejected a formulation of Israel
returning all the territories or the
territories and kept only territories
and as the result of that Israel
accepted two for two and at Khartoum all
the Arab states and the Palestinians
unanimously rejected two for two and
issued their three knows no which no
compromises no recognition no peace if
we can do the truth of the matter is if
we can ever friendly relations United
States approached the Jordanians and the
others and got them to agree to to
accept qualified acceptance of two for
two on the condition that there would be
minor and mutual adjustments with no
substantial change to the map okay
there were curved lines and it was
agreed that they should be straight all
right what you can't see behind the
podium is that both of my colleagues are
armed with several dozen maps and that
could get that could that could get
dangerous in this part of the
conversation so I'm gonna ask for some
restraint so we make sure that we go
directly to our participants yes sir
thank you ken sweeter I'd like to bring
it to the present and I'd like to ask
professor Dershowitz since this was a
major point made by Professor Chomsky
whether or not you believe Israel is
ready to negotiate for a contiguous
state not one of three separate bankers
- yes
now contiguous depends of course on
whether it means contiguous with in the
West Bank or contiguous including a
connection between the West Bank and the
Gaza now it was the UN that created the
lack of continuity between the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank in fact the
original proposals for Israel required
complete non continuity the north was
separated from Tel Aviv Tel Aviv from
Jerusalem yet is
except that a non-contiguous state under
the clinton parameters there would be
complete contiguity with a
circumferential highway around jerusalem
much like route 128 it would take nine
extra minutes to get from Ramallah to
Bethlehem then in the middle of the
night through Jerusalem because the
shortest distance between two lines
taken into account traffic is not a
straight line
now there are all kinds of creative
proposals for functional contiguity
between the West Bank and Gaza including
a high-tech rail line recently designed
by the RAND foundation I have a picture
of that in in my book it also looks much
like the Danish railroad a high-tech
waterway all kinds of ways of connecting
all the Palestinian states do we cities
to each other under this proposal no
point in Palestine would be more than 90
minutes away from any other point in
Palestine including Gaza it would take
34 minutes to get from Hebron to Gaza
City on the rail line that is functional
contiguity and the fact that the leader
of the Labour Party for years has quit
his party to join a new party and the
leader of lis could has quit his party
both in the interest of making peace
persuades me plus an hour I had a loan
in Israel not so long ago with Prime
Minister Sharon and much time that I've
spent with the form of Prime Minister
Perez that the will toward peace is
absolute and genuine having said that I
also believe the will to peace by Abbas
and many of the leaders of the
Palestinian Authority is genuine - thank
God Israel has to make peace with the
Palestinians and not with the
professor's comment from 23 from mothers
under Shasti those who want to see the
maps that lie behind Mayron been besties
and Sarah Roy's and Human Rights Watch
in the European Union other comments I
have them here but there's a very simple
test that we could try let's if those
are that's a valid approach to
contiguity for the Palestinian state in
22 percent of the former Palestine let's
propose it for the Israeli state in 78
percent of the former Palestine let's
who would dream of proposing that it was
proposed the peel Commission proposed
accepted it in 1937 but you know
relevant period right we're talking
about today when for that is a pose that
for Israel thousands of people have been
killed by terrorism you don't expect the
country to go back to a proposal that
was offered and rejected many many years
earlier options change when rejection
ISM sets in ok let's go to our next
question
my name is Allison Montoya you mentioned
the connection between Gaza and West
Bank right but I think to follow up on
my on the on my colleague I'm not sure
this is what he meant what about the
pieces of West Bank we're going to end
up with elements are continuing to be
built inside the West Bank the wall is
being built inside the borders of 1967
so now please talk to me about peace
about pro-palestine when it comes to
building walls and actually separating
the West Bank from East Jerusalem okay
here is what a Palestinian state would
have looked like had Camp David and Taba
been accepted it would be a completely
contiguous West Bank with an area that
including my laddu mem and some of the
other areas right side of Jerusalem
which would become part of Israel and
would remain within the wall the
ultimate goal is to have a separation
fence that is on the border the accepted
water and I'll tell you what I think the
real options are today the real options
are if this new peace party wins if the
Sharan Paris peace party wins it will
offer the Palestinians a very good deal
a deal much like that what was rejected
at Camp David and Taba and by the way if
you think it was the Israelis who
rejected just ask Bill Clinton he has
told me Dennis Ross has told me it was
completely in the fault completely in
the hands of the our fought and that's
true of Prince Bandar as well but if it
gets accepted this time there and if the
peace party prevails again they will be
offered some
very very close to that it will be a
viable Palestinian state much more
viable than anything Israel was offered
and accepted in 38 and in 47 and I think
every reasonable person today would urge
the Palestinians not to repeat the
disastrous mistakes they made in 48 they
made in 67 they made in 2000 they made
in 2001 this time say yes accept the
Palestinian state build it create an
economy create a political system and
finally peace can be achieved Thank You
professor cows so those who you would
like to see the mat I have it it's as I
said from wrong pun duck the leading
Israeli scholar the head of the Shimon
Paris Peace Center it shows that this is
Camp David map which was which Clinton
recognized was impossible which is why
they went on to Taba and it cuts through
the West Bank completely it's not that
it is this is wrong yes Dennis Ross was
the u.s. negotiator that word is
meaningless I'll be happy to say it it's
obvious to any reader it stops you know
right obvious to you
it stops notice that his book stops
immediately before Taba
why because Clinton's parameters and
what Clinton said about the acceptance
of them by both sides and the table
negotiations completely undermines
Dennis Ross's book so he therefore
terminates it right before that and can
therefore make these absurd claims if
you want to learn something about it
look at Israeli scholarship it's much
more serious thank you good evening I
like to thank both professors for
speaking so eloquently tonight my name
is Josh sauce cos I'm a recent
Harvard College and I'm really glad to
be back
I am sort of a simple question for
professor Chomsky it seems to me that
you left out in your analysis the
element of violence psychological
physical against Israel against Jews and
it seems to me also that the history the
professor dish was described a lot of
that is dictated by what what happened
the terrorism the wars against Jews
especially considering the immediate
history right before the establishment
of the State of Israel the Holocaust and
everything that has happened since so
I'd like you to address the effect of
the psychological effect in the physical
effect of war and terrorism on Israel
that's a half of a very important
question the other half of it is what's
the effect of war on terrorism on the
Palestinians now if you take a look
about that question here but if you look
at the both you'll find that what any
Mars described is in fact correct of the
balance of terror and violence is
overwhelmingly against the Palestinians
not surprisingly given the balance of
forces and that's even true that's true
right to the president I mean for you
know for decades Israel was able to run
the West Bank virtually with no forces
as Laura's point none others point out
because the population was so passive
while they were being humiliated beaten
tortured when and stolen and so on just
as I quoted finally there was a reaction
and it's interesting to see the u.s.
reaction to it in the first month of the
Intifada this one October 2000 in the
first month of the Intifada a tooth
75074 Palestinians were killed for
Israelis were killed so on the occupied
territories the Israeli army according
to its own records fired a million
bullets in the first day which disgusted
the generals when they learned about it
Israel first few days of the Intifada
was using us helicopters
Makem US helicopters to attack civilian
complexes apartment houses and so on
killing and wounding dozens of people
and the u.s. did respond to that Clinton
responded by sending the biggest
shipment of military helicopters in a
decade to Israel the press responded to
by not publishing it
I should add refusing to publish it
because it was repeatedly brought to
their attention well while the ratio was
twenty to one which is pretty much what
it's been for a long time there was no
concern here then over the next two
three years the ratio reduced to closer
to three to one and then came enormous
concern about the one not the three and
this goes back for a long time what I
quoted from Mars is accurate well a very
brief response the idea that there is
this vast conspiracy between the
American media and both Democrats like
Clinton and Republicans like Bush to
hide the truth from the American public
just does not bear reality Israel's an
open society any newspaper can come and
cover it why would not the newspapers
cover these stories before one reason
they are figments of Chomsky's
imagination well then a fan there just
never happened now I want to talk about
another figment of his imagination
constantly quotes constantly quotes many
Mars as if many Mars supports his
position what happened is many Mars was
asked whether or not I accurately quote
him in my book the case for peace and
Benny Morris responded as follows he
still holds the views that I attributed
to him that I am right about his views
and that someone could read Morris's
books this is a quote from Morris and
arrived at exactly the same conclusions
and yet professor Chomsky by selectively
quoting and by picking tidbits out of
context knowing that you're not going to
check up on him tells you essentially
that what you believe in the American
media whether it be the Washington Post
The Boston Globe or the New York Times
is not true in order to get the
meaning of the world you have to move to
Planet Chomsky where the news reflects
his perspective on reality
well I urge you to move to the real
world
read the real news don't read the
Selective Israeli journalist that he
talks about listen to Dennis Ross Dennis
Ross actually helped to draw the maps he
was there when I haven't done my two
minutes when he said when I asked Dennis
Ross a la minute about these maps and
what what apparently Chomsky would say
in response Ross said ask professor
Chomsky one thing were you there
Dennis Ross was there he knows what maps
were presented to the Palestinians and
what they rejected thank you
the leading scholar on this and doesn't
know right before he's refuted the way
Dennis rusted presents he was involved
in negotiation since before Oslo right
through Camp David up to the present the
long historical account of it you can
read it if he can read Hebrew some of
it's in English the one all this smoke
that was blown had to do with one fact
that I mentioned one and you can check
it and please do in the earth in the
first month of the Intifada I'm now
using Israeli sources 74 Palestinians
were killed for Jews in the occupied
territories the first few days
this is reported in the press your
Boston Globe Israel was using us
helicopters to attack apartment
complexes Clinton reacted with the
biggest deal in a decade check it out
it's in the public record
not if not questioned by anyone to send
military helicopters to Israel the there
has been a database search of the US it
was reported in Europe it was reported
by Amnesty International it's reported
in Jane's Defence weekly the main
military magazine in the world
there was a database search for the US
press and they found nothing I know of
explicit cases and I'll be glad to tell
them to you where the press was a
and asked just to report the fact why
Chomsky why didn't they reporter are
they bad reporters what's their motive
explain why time so the post wouldn't
report this great story from Planet
Chomsky gentlemen weekly from the
International Press and so on yeah they
wouldn't you have to ask them why they
didn't report it I'll give you my
opinion in fact I've written
given that the JFK Forum is here for the
purpose of creating educated citizens
and participants in a very important
debate I would ask each of you to
exercise a bit of restraint so that we
can have more of our questions from the
audience please and identify yourself
Nancy Murray and if you want the answer
why didn't they report a CPC propaganda
and the promised land now my question
getting back to today and your
functional continuity contiguity
contiguity i would like to know have you
seen not just the wall but the eight
terminals that are being built under
your vision under your compromise will
the terminals be dismantled will the
wall be dismantled will Jerusalem East
Jerusalem be under the sovereignty of
Palestinians not just under the control
and will the Palestinians have their
water resources back will they have
freedom of movement I mean is this the
kind of vision you have is it a genuine
one or are you talking about
Sharon's plan well I can work it was
so-called pellet I can only tell you
what my proposal is and I think it's a
proposal that's today widely supported
within Israel that is that the ultimate
security fence I've been through not
only the terminals but the most recent
terminal the most recent high-tech
terminal that was just built I proposed
actually that the security fence be
placed on wheels and constantly be able
to be moved consistent with Israeli
security needs the Israeli Supreme Court
the Israeli
Supreme Court ruled last year and
Chomsky misstated it no Israeli justice
has ever said and I challenge you to
find a statement that Barak has ever
said that Israeli law Trump's
international law that is simply not
true what he said is that Israeli law
enforces international law but
international law is not determined by a
body the International Court of Justice
which excludes Israelis from serving on
it and which will not allow an Israeli
ever to be a member of that Court it
would be as if Southern black in the
1930s accepted as the correct statement
of American constitutional law a
decision by an all-white Court in a case
involving a black and a white man no
Israel accepts international law
enforces international law and the goal
of course of my peace proposal is that
the security fence will eventually be
dismantled when terrorism ends but
before that it would be on the border
the way the Gaza fences and is now on
the border and that water rights would
be respected there would be complete and
total freedom of movement within the
contiguous West Bank and between the
West Bank and Gaza even today Israel has
given up control over the Rafah crossing
now has a video which it can watch to
see as Palestinians monitor exit an
entry through the Rafa a gateway that's
going to be the future and if there is a
will to peace if there is a desire to
make sure that there are two States not
simply once day a Palestinian state then
all of these issues can be resolved and
will be resolved Israel has shown the
will to resolve these issues certainly I
support a resolution that gives dignity
gives economic viability gives political
freedom and freedom of movement to the
Palestinian people yes once again I
purposely quoted justice Bergen tau
because I know of mr. Gershowitz his
opposition to the World Court I
therefore cut coach quoted the US
Justice
World Court who stated that the segments
of the wall being built to protect the
settlements or if so facto in violation
of international humanitarian law that's
80 percent of the wall
two months later Israel's High Court
stated in contrast that the separation
wall must take into account the need to
provide security for Israelis living in
the West Bank including their property
rights that's in direct contradiction to
justice Bergen Thals separate
declaration unanimously but the World
Court that's right and if you would like
his comment about how international
Israeli law supersedes international law
in East Jerusalem because now was
annexed to Israel illegally I'll be
happy to provide it to you just a minute
but that's not what you said please hold
let's go to the next I'm a second-year
student at the law school professor
Chomsky it seems like you've done a lot
of remembering and very little imagining
and a lenders witches idea is if they
seem funny to have a train or you know
some type of other high-tech connection
at least they're creative and at least
they're moving us forward how do you
deal with the issues of refugees how
would you connect Gaza and the West Bank
or is the only solution in your mind a
one-state solution what would you do
about Jerusalem well as you would know
if you looked at anything I've written
instead of if you would know if you look
at anything that's written I've been
supporting a two-state settlement since
the early 1970s an imprint and perhaps
you can show me some of mr. mr. Schue
answers material in print supporting it
I haven't found it but yes that's my
position since the early 70s all in
print as for connections the issue
recall at Camp David and at Taba and
today is territorial in the West Bank
okay if the and the current proposals
are exactly as I described go through
the sources I mentioned or find any
other ones they think are serious those
are the major Israeli and Western
academic sources and human rights
organizations and so on yes they break
up the West Bank into three Fanta stands
as benveniste said with virtually no
organic connection to East Jerusalem
which is the center of Palestinian life
that's why the EU and you're in the
European Union and Human Rights Watch
and others flatly reject them now it is
possible what Israel is in fact doing
now is developing a huge infrastructure
system in the West Bank with highways
for Israelis and paths for Palestinians
so that they don't have to interact with
one another which means that this
network around the West Bank which will
be annexed to Israel roughly 40 to 50
percent people can travel in it in great
comfort from the suburbs around Tel Aviv
including all the water resources
including most arable land they can get
to Tel Aviv in Jerusalem the
Palestinians will be fond has actually I
can read to you if you like how Israeli
journalists are describing that and if
you'd like to check it out for yourself
I suggest some time that you take what's
officially called the Palestinian Road
from Bethlehem to Ramallah which takes
like 10 minutes on the Jewish highway
I've taken it it's a little winding road
that their growth goes right next to a
Wadi if it's not raining you're lucky if
you don't fall into it and often the
hill you can see the paths where people
are sort of moving on the days when the
settlers are not traveling the roads are
empty because there's no eating anywhere
I mean you're going up broken-down
taxi cab up to a barrier and then you
transport someone who needs dialysis a
pregnant woman tearing over a ditch and
as you go to another cab and so on yeah
that's kind of continuity and again I
say the same thing if that's reasonable
then fine let's impose that kind of
continuity on Israel okay first of all
listen to the words there's an element
of racism in one of the phrases we've
heard today in describing this as a
Jewish highway 1.2 million Israeli
our Arabs many of them are Christians
there is no such thing as a Jewish
highway in Israel there are Jewish there
are Muslim highways in Saudi Arabia
there are Muslim only roads in other
parts of the world but there is no road
there's nothing in Israel that is opened
only to Jews even synagogues everything
is open to Israeli Arabs every road is
opened to an Israeli rare Arab when the
peace solution is finally proposed had
the Camp David and Taba Accords been
accepted the Palestinians would be free
to build any super highways they choose
and indeed Israel has offered now a
super highway in a super roadway between
Gaza and Jerusalem become sorry between
Gaza and heparin and the idea of it's
very difficult I acknowledge how to
connect East Jerusalem to Bethlehem to
Ramallah and to Jericho will require a
challenge but people are working on it
there are creative solutions being
proposed
I am waiting along with the student who
asked the question for some creative
positive imaginary imaginative solutions
from Professor Chomsky all we're hearing
is a recitation of the past Empire
involved there will be no I congratulate
mr. switch again for one true statement
they are not Jewish rows their Israeli
roots that is they are roads of the
sovereign's when I'm quoting the High
Court the sovereign state of the Jewish
people in Israel and the Diaspora saying
that British roads roads Anglican be for
qualification there is really roads
there are Israeli highways and
Palestinian heads if you want to create
a solution I mentioned one let's go to I
mentioned er there's an eva courts the
Taba agreements which is a real
cancelled
we're gonna focus on this next question
you are yes hi my name is Abraham
Riesman I'm a sophomore college question
for both of you to play
I guess I'll ask professor Chomsky just
because there's just spoken it's sort of
funny that we're all here given that a
lot of us have never been to Israel
never been to Palestine and it's long
been one of the sort of strange
paradoxes in world politics that
Americans and people the world over can
get so enraged about either side when
it's a conflict that many of us will
never firsthand experience specifically
how would both of you like to see young
people like me and Milan bus here
envisioning the conflict in the future
because a lot of us have a tendency to
internalize it to a degree where it's
not about people anymore on both sides
there are people I know who are ardent
Zionists who never go to Israel who
believed in it because they're very
religiously Jewish and all of a sudden
it becomes attached from the realities
on the ground there are people who are
very Pro Palestinian who are strongly in
favor of social justice and economic
okay thank you yeah how do you professor
Chomsky well my feeling is you should
you should approach as an American and
for them as for an American it is one of
the lead issues in the world you know
Israel is able to do these things to
dismantle and destroy the West Bank to
disintegrate the community because of
the United States gives it massive aid
unparalleled in international affairs
not only military and economic but also
diplomatic by as I've mentioned for the
last 30 years unilaterally blocking the
two-state settlement which Israel also
totally rejected alone the two of them
and as long as you the American tax
there goes on supporting this yes it
will continue and it'll lead to exactly
what the Baptist and style solution that
to bend the Nifty and others describe
right on the ground and yes so therefore
it's an enormous importance to Americans
as for solutions pretty straightforward
there they were coming close to a
solution at Taba until Israel called it
off if negotiations continued leading to
several proposals of which the most
detailed were the Geneva Accords you can
find out what I thought about all of
those in print you can ask mr.
Dershowitz where he supported them in
print the Geneva Accords in December
2002 were accepted by essentially the
whole world Israel rejected them the
u.s. refused even to send a message to
the Jiva meetings but they're still
potentially alive and American citizens
can compel our own government to reverse
its program to accept the international
consensus for the first time and then
we'll be on the way to a solution thank
you I too have written about the Geneva
Accords and in Chapter six of my book
and I generally support many elements of
the Geneva Accords I do not support the
right of return that is the idea that
700,000 or now four million Palestinians
can demographically destroy Israel which
is rejected in the Geneva Accords it is
not accepted or rejected it is left for
future negotiations and is left precise
okay did not say anything about that
because now Athenians had already at
Camp David Anna Taba accepted the
so-called pragmatic settlement which
would not affect the demographic
character that Israel if you want to
learn about the serious scholarship like
is simply I can tell you that President
Clinton told me directly and personally
that what caused the failure of the
can't David Taub Accords was the refusal
of the Palestinians in our thought to
give up the
of return that was the sticking point
was in Jerusalem
it wasn't mortars it was the right of
return can you believe if you believe
that the United States has unilaterally
rejected the two-state solution that's
what we heard from Professor Chomsky
that it's the United States that has
rejected the two-state solution when
every modern American president has
favoured the two-step solution I say
welcome to Planet Chomsky exercise you
can believe one of two things the
extensive published diplomatic record
which I gave you a sample of and you can
find indeed their own books of mine and
others or what mr. Dershowitz says he
heard from somebody no check the map sir
your question
Andrey Denis Russia's book which
contains appendices which have the
diplomatic records what Chomsky is
telling you to do is read the available
record in Esperanto he constantly tells
you to read sources he knows you can't
read because he knows if you check his
sources they are you don't find it in
the press his answer is it's not in the
press it's part of a conspiracy to keep
it out of the press thanks thanks in the
documentary record which happens to be
quite different can say okay not only on
this issue but you know Morton's
gentlemen I think it's important that we
take advantage of your expertise there
are many years of wisdom by hearing a
couple more questions please you are hi
my name is tal silverstein and I was
campaign manager and later on special
advisor to Prime Minister Barak and Camp
David so I think I know and at least no
less than the one who knocked my friend
about what happening came David in Java
and in Taba I'm saying it's only because
I think
and their to what mr. professor Chomsky
said here a lot of things are inaccurate
even though do you have a question yes
please no but I think just before the
question because it's very important
he's go directly to your question Nick
you know there was a question before
that had about a seven-minute
prerequisite this is it this is an
expert who was there who was an
eyewitness I think he should be
permitted to proceed his question with a
one minute corner I don't I don't want
to go I don't want to go into history
and I'm a little excited because you
have to understand one thing I believe
we have only one last opportunity to
which piece and this is this coming
faulty in this coming election now my
question to you professor Chomsky and I
and I do it with you as well as done a
lot of crazy and terrible things to
Palestinians and for students that have
a lot of crazy terrible things to
Israelis but let's say that the new
party after the election guided by Sean
is to offer the Palestinians a deal it
doesn't matter which the a deal that
will be accepted by most Palestinians
would you support this deal even if it
doesn't reflect the views or your
ideological views well I'm glad to see
that you I assume you endorsed from
Boondocks expert expert knowledge
correct I therefore recommend to all of
you who read English that you read the
summary of his review of all of this in
the Journal of the Institute for of
strategic security studies in England
and for those of you who read Hebrew
like you I presume you read the much
longer study that run when duck and RelA
wrote it's on the Paris Center website
which describes in detail if you like I
can quote it from you as to what I was
noting David Gordon one that was not he
was one of the negotiators in the
background he was one of the negotiators
in the background and he was from he was
from Oslo
and his study he was one of the advisors
as you know read it you're the one who
told me you Evert you agree with him you
say if you think not tell they said if
shimon peres centered a firearm is
director those are the basic Israeli
documents furthermore they're supported
by plenty of others if you want to know
more about table you can read the
European Union report accepted by both
sides which says exactly what I said as
to your question yes I already told you
the answer there is a very good solution
on the table it's the solution that they
came close to in Taba before Israel
cancelled it and that was then carried
forward by high-level Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators informally
leading to the Geneva that's why it's
leading to the December 2002 Geneva
Accords which are right there you can
read them in English you can read them
in Hebrew there on the web
no problem look up the gue showing
fellowman website that's a pretty good
solution most Palestinians Fortin even
if it wasn't the flam that you think is
optimal oh hi well no it's honest in
Ian's because I know most Israelis
probably would vote for it if most
Palestinians would vote for it even if
it's not optimal it's not going to be
optimal at the dairy if most
Palestinians would vote for it would you
accept it is not up to me
if you asked what I thought what I
thought is what I think is if there's a
very simple creative solution which
hasn't been very close to the
international consensus that I've been
supporting for 30 over 30 years and the
United States and Israel been
unilaterally blocking it was reached by
high-level Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators and though there hasn't been
a vote about it I my guess is that if
there was a poll on both sides majority
on both sides would probably accept it
but that's totally different from the
proposed
Joseph of the Sharon Paris party the
Kadima or incidentally of Paris's Labor
Party so far so far he simply endorsed
the expansionist program that breaks up
the West Bank into Canton's perfect
perfect selective use of Shimon Peres
you know the Shimon Peres Peace Center I
want to read you a quote from norm
Trotsky he described Shimon Perez he
described Ronald Reagan at one point as
the semi-divine Reagan as one of the
iconic group of mass murderers from
Hitler to Idi Amin to Perez so on one
day of the week you find Nam Chon ski
describing Peres this great man of peace
as an iconic mass murderer and on
another day he's quoting the authority
of Shimon Perez to make peace I mean
where do you stand on Shimon Perez is he
a man of peace or is he an iconic mass
murderer he is a an iconic mass murderer
and I've given plenty of evidence for it
and he is not a man of peace what I
didn't realize did not refer to Shimon
Peres I refer to the director of the
Shimon Peres
Peace Center so you got FEMA and Peres
you Simone Perez the man who just joined
in to make peace is an iconic mass
murderer woman a lot a man of peace I
think that says it all
they want me to run through his record
and the fact that as late as 1996 he
informed the press that a Palestinian
state will never happen and in 1997 he
said maybe we can ultimately tolerate it
somewhere but we're not saying where
that's not a man of peace thank you
you are my name is amy levin i'm my
first year at the Kennedy School my
question is for professor at gerschwitz
you had said that one of the steps in
your plan for peace in the future was
for the Palestinians to stop their
terrorism activities so my question
would be if you were advising the
Israeli government is there anything
about their current strategy and how
they respond to these terrorism tactics
that you would advise them to change to
move forward yes I would I do not favor
for example house destructions on the
other hand I do think that targeted
killings of ticking bomb terrorists
leaders and terrorists has been quite
effective hundreds perhaps thousands of
terrorist acts have been prevented
including an attempt to blow up a gas
tank outside of Tel Aviv including an
attempt to blow up a port in US code
tens of thousands of Israelis probably
would have been killed but for the
intelligence activities and the
preventive activities of the Israeli
government I have a book coming out in
January called preemption where I set
out all the parameters of where I think
pre-emptive acts are justified where I
think they're not justified I think
Israel gets a C+ or B - in its
compliance with human rights in fighting
terrorism which is higher than any
country ever has gotten comparably
facing any external threats and I
challenge in fact anybody in this room
or professor Chomsky to name me any
other country which has faced comparable
threats of terrorism comparable external
threats which has ever had a Supreme
Court and an academy which has been more
sensitive to the human rights and civil
rights of those who would destroy it I
say C+ me - if I were in Israeli I would
demand much more I would demand that it
get up to the b-plus range but surely a
much better standard than the United
States has followed in Iraq
surely a much higher standard than Egypt
or Jordan surely a much higher standard
than France followed when faced with
terrorist threats and at least
comparable and probably better
England when it was facing terrorist
threats from Northern Ireland so when
you make comparisons and you argue that
Israel is the worst human rights
violator in the world which is the
mantra on planet Chomsky one always has
to look at comparable factors in
comparable countries it's not enough to
single out Israel and say Israel isn't
perfect if in fact you wanted to have
the best ature which Chomsky before he
opposed it favoured it if you wanted to
have two best teacher I'd favor it if
you listed all the countries in the
world in terms of their compliance with
human rights and did divestiture in
order of their compliance you would
never even get to Israel on that list
professor John if you would like to
exercise an exercise for the reader I
won't waste your time on it write a
letter to Alan Dershowitz ask him to
cite the source where I described Israel
as the worst human rights violator in
the world or even anything remotely like
it if he had ever if he would ever look
at a word that's written so he would
know for example that I was supporting
the two-state settlement in the early
seventies when he was saying nothing
about it and hasn't until recently he
would also know that I described in
detail how the u.s. Israeli record was
considerably better than the US record
but to answer his challenge there are
certainly cases that are much better
than Israel's record countries that have
suffered far worse terrorism and have
not done anything like start to take an
obvious case Nicaragua uncontroversial
case uncontroversial because much as you
hate the World Court the World Court
ruled that the United States was
carrying out what it called unlawful use
of force against Nicaragua that's
international terrorism in lay language
the case was run by one of your
distinguished colleagues the and ordered
the u.s. to stop the terrorist attacks
and to pay massive reparations the u.s.
rejected the court judgment vetoed two
Security Council resolutions supporting
the court judgments
went on to practically destroy the
country the number of people killed in
that terrorist attack translating to per
capita equivalents here it would be
about 2.25 million that's more than the
total in all US wars ever there were no
target assassinations and unlike Israel
the Grabbe didn't even close newspapers
I mean Israel has repeatedly closed
newspapers even in Israel but mostly in
the occupied territories because it
claims that they have some connection
with terrorists the leading newspaper in
Nicaragua right to the end was owned by
a supporter of the US terrorist army and
was openly on its front pages calling
for the overthrow of the government
occasionally they reduced some of its
newsprint they never closed it that's
one case an obvious one take an even
more obvious case Cuba the United States
launched since we're at the Kennedy
Center I can point out that John F
Kennedy launched a major terrorist
attack against Cuba in 1961 right after
the failure of the Bay of Pigs it was a
very serious terrorist war plenty of
documentation about it from the best
sources you can you like Arthur
Schlesinger Raymond gotta fall you can
read that major terrorist warts going on
right through the present based in
Florida Cuba has not carried out
terrorist actions in the United States
so Cuba has a better human rights record
than Israel on the on the issue of
preemption which is the one you raised
yes yes you've raised a challenge about
preemption and I told you that there are
many much better cases no I didn't say
that very clear Israel and the United
States are both threatening Iran with
destruction well you know preemption
according to their shoe it's would
require that you ran be carrying out
targeted assassinations in Israel the
United States will hold there we're
gonna go this is gonna be our last
question of the evening um my name is
Laurie crassula I'm a second
MPP student thank you for this lively
debate what I have a question kind of
directed at both of you but professor
ardour chorus in your book you said you
hope to have a win/win situation where
everyone had to give something up and
what's clear to me after this debate and
just looking at history that no one's
able to come to a resolution where
they're willing to give up enough to the
other person so it seems to me that the
only way to win is to have everybody
lose so I'd like you to comment on a
proposal where maybe if you all lost
we'd actually come out winning well I
think there is a win-win possible
situation Israel has been giving up much
it gave up the Gaza it by the way
offered to give up the Gaza to Egypt way
back in the early 1980s Egypt wouldn't
take it back there was no international
outcry over the occupation of the Gaza
by Egypt for 20 years no one's there any
international and I'm sure there must be
a long record check Chomsky's writing he
must have in print large opposition to
the occupation of Gaza by Egypt and
strong opposition to the occupation of
the West Bank by Jordan funny I never
came across it in my research but I'm
sure it must be there if you check at
least the Czechoslovakian version of one
of his writings and so I do think
there's a win-win solution the win-win
solution is the one I proposed starting
in 1967 and that is Israel make
territorial adjustments necessary to
secure its boundary and Security's
consistent with Palestinian rights no
occupation of Palestinian cities a
two-state solution that is a win-win
situation and and let me tell you why I
consider myself pro palestinian I am
pro-israel and pro palestinian because I
favor a viable healthy economically
strong politically democratic
Palestinian state that will be good for
Palestine it will be good for Israel it
will be good for the world Israel has a
major stake in this
of Palestine whereas the Palestinians
have never had a major stake in the
success of Israel and so I see a
successful Palestinian state a viable
largely contiguous Palestinian state as
a win-win situation not only for Israel
and the Palestinians but for the United
States and the rest of the world I only
hope that professor Chomsky can join me
in agreeing that we're not going to get
a perfect solution and let's just
advocate a solution that's acceptable
the question that was asked before was
to me the key question if the
Palestinians accept the solution that
professor Chomsky finds unacceptable
will he use his enormous resources as
the most influential intellectual in the
world today to turn the palestinians
against this peace proposal or will he
lend his great prestige to urging the
palestinians and his academic supporters
all over the world to accept a pragmatic
compromise solution professor Chomsky a
lot turns on you you are a very
important and influential person and
therefore you were to understand your
power and use it in the interests of
peace justice just before I asked one of
the most influential intellectuals today
to respond to Laurie's question just to
tell you where we're headed professor
Chomsky will respond then in accordance
with our rules of procedure and decorum
for this evening I will ask professor
Chomsky to offer a two-minute summary
for the evening to be followed by
professor Dershowitz professor Chomsky
well with regard to my opposition to the
jordanian egyptian occupation there is
ample material in print and there has
been for 35 years ever since i publicly
and openly and very prominently
supported the two-state settlement with
mr. dosoo it says he now supports I'm
glad to hear that I don't know the
background evidence
let's return and that means of course
posing jordanian Egyptian occupation
let's turn to the question we were asked
to address where do we go from here well
we actually have two fundamental choices
one choice is to support Washington's
continued dedication to the road the
catastrophe that's outlined by Israel's
for former security chiefs namely
watching in silence as Washington funds
the canonization of the West Bank the
breaking of its organic links to
Jerusalem and the disintegration of the
remnants of Palestinian society that
choice adopts the advice of Moshe Dayan
to his cabinet colleagues in the early
seventies then was in charge of the
occupation he advised them that we must
tell the Palestinians that we have no
solution you shall continue to live like
dogs and whoever wishes may leave that's
the solution that is now being
implemented don't take my word for it go
check the sources I cited very easy all
English there's an alternative the
alternative to is to return to the
spirit of the one break in u.s. Israeli
rejection ISM that is the week in Taba
in January 2001 before Israel called it
off and to take seriously the follow-up
proposals from high-level negotiators on
both sides of which the Geneva Accords
are the most detailed there is
overwhelming international support for
taking them as the basis for a political
settlement it does come close to the
long-standing international consensus
that the United States and Israel have
barred and that I've personally been
supporting for the last over thirty
years that's the road away from
catastrophe towards an end to violence
and towards eventual reconciliation
either choice is within our reach from
that point on it's up to us
but that's the dursa which we do seem to
have a remarkable point of agreement I
think we both do agree that the
proposals made at Taba do provide a
useful basis for a peace process now
Taba didn't end because Israel left Taba
ended because our fought rejected Camp
David thereby causing the election of
sharone over Barak there was no
government essentially that could carry
out the table of proposals which were
favored by a very very large number of
Israelis
that's why Prince Bandar are said to are
fought at Camp David and Taba if you
reject the proposals at Camp David
you're gonna get your own instead of
Barack you're never ever gonna get a
better deal thankfully he was wrong
Sharon emerged as a man of courage and a
man of vision and I myself although I
never did support your own in the past
strongly support the efforts made by
Sharon in Paris a great great man of
peace a man who has vision a man who
imagines the future a man who can bring
about peace in the world and peace in
the Middle East and I think the
prospects for a peace based on the table
of proposals are quite realistic I think
that if this party wins the election and
invites the Palestinians to the table
and the Palestinians don't again miss an
opportunity to miss an opportunity there
will be a real prospect for negotiation
a real prospect for a peace based on
pragmatism one final word about the
sources please the other area where
professor Chomsky and I agree check his
sources take him at his word go back
tonight and google and read the sources
read them in English read them and
whatever language you can and then
mail us both as to what the sources show
and finally in a constructive and
positive way I urge you imagine peace
imagine the peace dividend that will
come to the world if finally a pragmatic
solution based on peace comes to the
Palestinian people and the Israeli
people I'm hoping for Shalom for Salaam
and for peace thank you thank you just
before we conclude and I thank our
speakers I want to share with you in a
very few seconds what I have heard
tonight standing between these two
scholars the first the first is that in
looking around this room it is clear to
me that being members of the
international community to which we all
belong whether we have been to Israel or
Palestine or to other conflict arenas or
not that people can care deeply about
people in conflict and understand that
there needs to be a way through secondly
as we heard from some of our questioners
the parties themselves Israelis and
Palestinians seem to be post
disengagement and then there are two
election processes quickly approaching a
crossroads perhaps a tipping point where
some form of acceptable solution that
will involve some part of loss of the
dream to both sides will make pragmatism
rain the third thing in which I've been
honored to be a part of this discussion
tonight is that a khadeem and the
scholarly community matter in this
discussion I have read a great deal of
the works of both professors Chomsky and
Dershowitz and in both of these readings
whether you agree with points of view
challenge their sources is beside the
point what you have been
- tonight is to individuals who have
spent a lifetime thinking very very hard
about some of the most difficult
problems in international public policy
and on behalf of this group here tonight
- my scholarly colleagues I am eternally
grateful thank you for coming
[Applause]
