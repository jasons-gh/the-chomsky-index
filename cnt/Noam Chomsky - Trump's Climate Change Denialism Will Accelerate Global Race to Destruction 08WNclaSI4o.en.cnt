the Paris conference had the goal of
establishing verifiable commitments to
do something about the worst problem
that humans have ever faced the likely
destruction of the possibility for
organized human life they couldn't do
that they could only reach a non
verifiable commitment promises but not
not not not fixed by treaty had a real
commitment and the reason was that the
Republican Congress in the United States
would not accept binding commitments so
where they were left with something much
weaker and looser the Morocco conference
intended to carry this forward by
putting teeth in that loose vague
agreement the conference opened on
November 7th normal way November 8th the
World Meteorological Organization
presented an assessment of the current
state of what's called the Anthropocene
the new geological epoch that is marked
by radical human modification
destruction of the environment that
sustains life November November 9th the
conference basically ceased the question
that was left was whether it would be
possible to carry forward this global
effort to deal with the highly
problem of environmental catastrophe if
the leader of the free world the richest
and most powerful country in history
would pull out completely as appeared to
be the case that's the stated goal of
the president-elect whose regards
climate change is a hoax and whose
policy if he pursues it is to maximize
the use of fossil fuels and
environmental regulations dismantle the
Environmental Protection Agency
established by Richard Nixon which is a
measure of where politics has shifted to
the right and the past generation and in
other ways accelerate the race to
destruction
well that was essentially the end of the
Marrakesh conference it terminated
without any issue
so that might signal the end of the
world even if not quite in the intended
sense and in fact what happened and
myrrh Marrakesh was a quite astounding
spectacle the hope of the world for
saving us from this impending disaster
was China authoritarian harsh China
that's where hopes were placed at the
same time the the leader of the free
world the richest most powerful country
in history was acting in such a way as
to doom the hopes to total disaster it's
an astonishing spectacle and it's no
less astounding that had received almost
no comment you can something to think
about
well the effects are quite real cop21
the Paris negotiations
would not reach a verifiable treaty
because of the refusal of the Republican
Congress to accept binding commitments
the follow-up conference cop 22 ended
without any issue we will soon see and
not for a distant future even more
dangerous
horrifying consequences of this failure
right here to come to term to address in
a serious way this impending crisis so
say take the country of Bangladesh
within a few years tens of millions of
people will be fleeing from the
low-lying coastal plains simply because
of the rise of sea level with the
melting of the huge Antarctic glaciers
much more quickly than was anticipated
and the severe weather associated with
global warming now that's a refugee
crisis of a kind that puts today's
crisis which is more immoral crisis of
the West and an actual refugee crisis
they will put this current crisis into
it'll seem like a footnote to tragedy
and it's the leading climate scientist
in Bangladesh has reacted by saying that
these migrants should have the right to
move to the countries from which all
these greenhouse gases are coming
million
United States and indeed the other rich
countries that have grown wealthy as we
all have while bringing this new
geological epoch bringing about this new
geological epoch epoch which may well be
the final one for the species and the
catastrophic consequences can only
increase just keeping the South Asia
temperatures which are already
intolerable for the poor are going to
continue to rise as the Himalayan
glaciers melt also destroying the water
supply for South Asia in India already
300 million people are reported to lack
of water to drink and it will continue
both for India and Pakistan and at this
point the two major threats to survival
begin to converge one is environmental
catastrophe the others nuclear war
another threat that is increasing right
before our eyes
India and Pakistan are nuclear States
nuclear weapon states with nuclear
weapons they're all already almost at
war any kind of real war would
immediately turn into a nuclear war that
might happen very easily over water
short over struggles over diminishing
water supplies a nuclear war would not
only
devastate the region but might actually
be terminal for the species if indeed it
leads to nuclear winter and global
famine as many scientists predict so the
threats of survival to survival converge
right there and we're going to see much
more like it
meanwhile the United States is leading
the way the disaster while the world
looks to China for leadership it's an
incredible astounding picture and indeed
only one piece of a much larger picture

linguist speaking Monday night at
Riverside Church as part of the
celebration marking 20 years of
democracy now after a short break we'll
hear the conclusion of Chomsky speech
