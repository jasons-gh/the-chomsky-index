hello I know this whole roomful for most
of you as to whom a lot of them you
might recognize us always here sitting
next to me here you have save some
friends yeah okay so I think we're not
quite everyone is here yet
is that correct so we should everybody's
here okay so we can start well we have a
good meeting three days we did miss you
though I'm very happy that we can see
you now and talk to you now and listen
to your talk
so the idea will be that you will start
with your presentation and then you can
take as long as you like so dangerous as
you can hear Bob is here too so no but
so you could so we have in total we have
two hours to our available with this
system and it will be recorded by the
way it will be put online so don't be
too rude to Bob for instance and so but
you can take anything between an hour an
hour and a half or if you want to if you
want to cut it sure thats fine too and
hopefully you'll be available to answer
questions afterwards okay so you could
sound whatever you're ready okay okay
well first of all I'm very sorry not to
be able to with be with you personally
disappointment what I'd like to do is
make some remarks about the architecture
of language as at least as I understand
it and what that suggests about the
origins of this distinctive human
possession clearly inquiry into the
evolution of some system can proceed
only as far
as its nature isn't understood no less
evidently without serious understanding
of the fundamental nature of some system
its manifestations will appear to be
chaotic highly variable lacking general
properties and accordingly studies of
its evolution cannot be undertaken such
inquiry must also of course be as
faithful as possible to whatever is
known of the evolutionary history
these truisms a hold of the study of the
human language faculty adjust as for
other biological systems and proposals
in the literature can be evaluated in
terms of how well they adhere these
elementary strictures the problem of
evolution of language arose at once in
the mid 20th century when the first
efforts were made to construct accounts
of language as a biological object
internal to an individual and capturing
what we may call the basic property of
human language namely that each language
yields a digitally infinite array of
hierarchically structured expressions
with systematic interpretations at the
interfaces with two other internal
systems the sensory motor system for
externalization and the conceptual
system for inference interpretation
planning organization of action and
other elements of what are informally
called thought the general approach the
language adopting these guidelines has
come to be called the bio linguistic
program well in current terminology a
language understood in these terms is
called an internal
language i language for sure by virtue
of the basic property each i language is
a system of audible lawn signs
forethought quoting the great into your
pianist William dwight whitney century
ago that we now know that
externalization and need not be
restricted to the auditory articulatory
modalities by definition the theory of
an i language is its generative grammar
and the general theory of i languages is
universal grammar ug for short
that's adapting a traditional notion to
a new context ug then is the theory of
the genetic component of the Faculty of
language the capacity that makes it
possible to acquire and use particular
I'll anguishes + ug determines the class
of generative procedures that satisfy
the basic property and the atomic
elements that enter into these
computations the atomic elements pose
deep mysteries the minimal meaning but
barring elements of human languages word
like but words these are radically
different from anything known in animal
communication systems their origin is
entirely obscure posing a very serious
problem for the evolution of human
cognitive capacities language in
particular now there are insights into
these topics going back to the
pre-socratics developed further in
classical Greek philosophy further still
by prominent philosophers of the early
modern scientific revolution and the
Enlightenment and still further in very
recent years
though they remain insufficiently
explored and in fact the problem that
they pose which is quite severe is
insufficiently recognized and nor and
understood careful examination shows
that widely held doctrines about the
nature of these elements are untenable
the crucially the widely held
referential is doctrine that words pick
out extra mental objects that appears
not to be true at all this great deal to
say about these quite important
questions that I won't put them aside
and simply noting again that the
problems posed for evolution of human
cognition and language or severe and far
more so than generally acknowledged the
the second component of ug the theory of
generative procedures has been amenable
to study there really for the first time
since the mid 20th century by then the
work of turing durdle church and others
had established the general theory of
computation on firm grounds making it
possible to undertake the study of
generative grammar with a fairly clear
understanding of what is involved the
the generative procedures that
constitute I languages must satisfy
certain conditions certain empirical
conditions first some of these at least
are learn about as we know since they're
learned and the capacity to acquire and
use I languages must have evolved
turning first to learn ability
acquisition of an either language is
evidently based on first the genetic
constraints of ug and secondly the
language-independent principles it has
been well-established that language
capacity is radically dissociated from
other cognitive capacities that fact
along with close examination of the
properties of languages that leads us to
expect that the second factor language
independent principles probably consists
substantially of organism independent
principles not other cognitive processes
that pretty well follows from the
dissociation and the particular
properties of languages for a
computational system like I language
these language independent principles
are likely to include principles of
computational computational efficiency
which fall under natural law and the
study of learnability must face the fact
that what is quickly acquired vastly
exceeds evidence available to the child
that is the normal property of growth of
a biological system well turning to
evolution that we should first be clear
about what is evolved what has evolved
of course it is not languages of
languages don't evolve they change but
they don't evolve and what has evolved
is the capacity for language that is UG
it is unhelpful that suggests that
languages have evolved by biological and
non-biological evolution
James Hereford storm term the latter is
not evolution at all with these
providers in mind I will continue to use
the conventional phrase
of language recognizing that it can be
sometimes is quite misleading one fact
about evolution of language that seems
to be quite firm is that there has been
none for fifty or sixty thousand years
or more there are no known group
differences in capacity for language or
in fact cognitive capacities generally
indicating that the system is not
evolved not surprising in such a short
period of time another fact to which we
can appeal with less confidence is that
not long before that the language may
not have existed at all for now at least
it's a reasonable surmise that language
were precisely UG emerged at some point
in a very narrow window of evolutionary
time perhaps in the neighborhood of
roughly seventy five thousand years ago
that has not evolved since in the
burgeoning literature on evolution of
language this surmise is sometimes
described as anti-darwinian or as
rejecting evolutionary theory but these
criticisms are based on serious
misunderstanding of modern biology apart
from these two facts one quite firm of
the other plausible the available record
tells us very little and the same seems
to be true of complex cognitive
capacities generally that's a very thin
basis for studying evolution of language
it does however yield one suggestion
namely that what evolved ug must be
quite simple at its core and if so the
apparent complexity and variety of
language
is must derive from changes since the
shared changes not evolution since the
shared capacity evolved and are further
they're probably localized in peripheral
components of the system which may not
have evolved at all I'll return to this
suggestion that we may also anticipate
as I mentioned that the appearance of
complexity and diversity reflects lack
of understanding a very familiar
phenomenon of course as soon as the
first efforts were undertaken to
construct generative grammars by mid
twentieth century it was very quickly
discovered that very little was known
about languages that was contrary to
assumptions at the time as they recall
very well for my student days even about
the languages that were well studied
virtually nothing was known about them
as was quickly discovered but
furthermore many of the properties
revealed by close study opposed quite
serious puzzles some of which are still
alive today along with many new ones
that continue to be unearthed along the
way at the time mid 20th century it
seemed to be necessary to attribute
great complexity to Yugi in order simply
to capture the empirical phenomenon of
language which were being unearthed as
soon as generative grammars began to be
constructed for a fair variety of
languages as was the case in the 1950s
and also for the their apparent variety
it was always understood however that
this cannot be correct the reason is
that Yugi must meet the condition of
evolvability and the more complex its
character the greater the burden on some
future account of how it might have
evolved and it's a very heavy burden as
the very few available facts about
evolution of language indicate those I
mentioned for these reasons along with
general considerations of rational
inquiry the research into I languages
and ug from the very outset sought to
reduce the complexity of assumptions
about their nature and variety I won't
review the history of steady progress in
this direction familiar to most of you
particularly with the crystallization of
the principles and parameters framework
in the 1919 80s that for the first time
offered a way to account for the problem
of language acquisition without what
seemed to be hopeless barriers and it
opened the way to vast expansion of
empirical materials available studied at
a level of depth that was previously
unimaginable by the early 1990s it
seemed to a number of researchers myself
included that enough had been learned so
that it might be reasonable to approach
the task of simplifying ug in a somewhat
different way the namely to try to
formulate a kind of an ideal case and
ask how closely language approximates
the ideal then seeking to overcome the
many apparent discrepancies sometimes
called
approaching ug from below this effort
adopting this approach has been called
the minimalist program it's in fact a
seamless continuation of the study of
generative grammar from its origins you
adopting somewhat new approach of the
kind I just mentioned well the the
optimal situation would be that ug
reduces to the simplest computational
principles which operate in accord with
conditions of computational efficiency
this conjecture the conjecture that this
is true of language it's sometimes
called the strong minimalist thesis SMT
for short
some years ago SMT would have seemed a
very exotic idea but in recent years
evidence has been accumulating
suggesting that something like this may
not be far from true so it seems to me
at least that would be a surprising and
significant discovery if it can be
established
it would also open the way to addressing
the study of evolution of language
relief for the first time I'll return to
a few words on the prehistory of
contemporary study of evolutionary
language after that I'll return to this
matter well as I mentioned the problem
of evolution of e2g arose as soon as the
bio linguistic program was undertaken
and roughly 60 years ago the problem had
of course been discussed in much earlier
years at a time when language was
regarded as an internal biological
object so that its evolutions would at
least be formulated as a problem that
evidently if language is not regarded as
a biological object its evolution cannot
be seriously discussed 19th century
indo-european ists often did consider
language in
internalists terms as a biological
property of an individual but the work
barriers serious ones to studying its
evolution the minimal conditions that I
meant mentioned at the outset of these
remarks were not satisfied in particular
there was no clear understanding of the
nature of the system that had evolved
satisfying the basic property in 1886
Paris linguistic society major
international linguistic society
famously banned papers on language
origin they adopted the view of the
prominent scholar William Dwight Whitney
that quoting him the greater part of
what is said and written about the topic
is mere windy talk words that in my
opinion still merit attention well there
was a kind of a standard story about
what happened next its summarized
accurately by Jean Aitchison in a volume
called approaches to the evolution of
language that edify edited by three
leading figures
James Hereford Michael stuttered Kennedy
and Chris Knight hsm cites the famous
ban on evolution of language and then
skips it once to 1990 when she writes
all of this changed with a paper by
Steven Pinker and Paul bloom that
demolished some intellectual roadblocks
in understanding the relation between
evolution and language that's James
perverts comment the Pinker bloom paper
HSN continues emphasized that language
evolved by normal evolutionary
mechanisms and commented quoting them
that there is a wealth of respectable
news
information relevant to the evolution of
language that has never been properly
synth it synthesized the field was then
able to take off became a flourishing
discipline according to this version
with many publications conferences and
so on well that's pretty much the
standard story but the real history
seems to me rather different and not
solely because of the accuracy of
Whitney's strictures of what I think
seems to me to have happened is pretty
much the following after the the late
19th century in the following a
structuralist period length leg which
was not typically regarded as a
biological object so the question of its
evolution could not be raised its the
reason for the long gap European
structuralism that commonly adopted
these it's a caesarian conception of
language in the relevant sense of
language as a social entity in as
disturb himself put it a storehouse of
word images in the brains of a
collectivity of individuals founded on a
sort of contract for American
structuralism standard concept was that
of leonard bloomfield leading segura
tician for whom language is an array of
habits to respond the situations with
conventional speech sounds and to
respond to these sounds with actions or
in a different formulation of his
languages the totality of utterances
made in a speech community whatever
these presumed entities are and I think
that's pretty obscure but whatever they
are they're not
logical objects hence there is no study
of evolution of the systems matters
changed in the mid mid century mid 20th
century as I mentioned when the first
efforts were made to under study I
languages in terms satisfying the basic
property as I mentioned the problem of
evolution of language arose at once but
could not be seriously addressed the
task in early years was to construct a
theory of language theory of ug rich
enough to permit description of the
facts that were quickly being unearthed
in a variety of languages but the richer
ug the greater the burden on evolve
ability and accordingly little could be
done there was a very important step
forward in 1967 with the publication of
Erich lana verbs both biological
foundations of language the book that
founded the modern study of biology of
language this work in 1967 did contain
quite serious discussion of evolution of
the language capacity which Lindenberg
properly distinguished from the non
topic of evolution of language and it
had many important insights also a
fairly sophisticated argument in favor
of discontinuity of evolution of the
language capacity on biological grounds
which he elaborated nevertheless the
basic problem of richness and complexity
of ug persisted in the following years
1970s there were a series of
international in the US domestic
scientific conferences bringing together
distinguished biologists
along with linguists philosophers and
cognitive scientists the issues of
evolution was of course discussed but
with little outcome for the same reasons
I myself was co-teaching a seminar in
biology of language at MIT in the 1970s
co-teaching with evolutionary biologist
Salvador Luria a Nobel laureate several
of the students went on to careers in
the field evolution of language was one
of the main topics but again with little
to say for
