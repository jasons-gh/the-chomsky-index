I interrupted you I'm sorry well first
of all you've now mentioned Marshall aid
for the first time and Marshall aid
Marshall planet has to be distinguished
quite sharply from the truman dr plus y
because the Truman Doctrine was a
doctrine of military intervention and
the Marshall Plan was our first attempt
at a major age we do understand it
sometimes just a soldier can be as
useful as a bushel of wheat don't you
know look nevertheless if we're going to
be at all clear about the American roll
we're certainly going to distinguish
between military intervention and
economic intervention they're very
different in the way they function now
the fact of the matter is that neither
was disinterested in your sense i don't
think but they're very different in the
impact that they had the Truman Doctrine
I think was a disastrous than sure i
think the marshall plan was arguable i
mean one understood well how do you
explain the schizophrenic read how do
you kind of schizophrenia of a public of
which will both more or less
simultaneously probably one have you
later the public is in public didn't
without unit is interested public then
we'll either were the relative are the
other government but because because
both were the government backed by the
public has that how do you explain that
the same government on on monday did the
Truman Doctrine which you consider
simply thought to be a projection of the
evil impulses I made on Tuesday did
something which you consider to be very
good I didn't side with the Delta Z
Monday into use first of all I didn't
say I consider to be very good i said
it's very it's rather different and one
has to bring different standards to bear
and evaluating it but no files are
different giving example suppose you're
a former because and anything you need
agriculture are you need further along
as I say you apply to me for fertilizer
but just before I get it to you somebody
comes up with a bayonet and is about to
it is about to make it impossible for
you to because when you're forming now I
think you're big in that particular
instance is there a strategic difference
between by giving the fertilizer my
giving the the soldier who writes not so
you're talking three dream world the
real world because the real world is one
in which the alternatives were bringing
coming with a bayonet which is on an
American rifle held by an
american-backed Greek soldier and the
alternative to that was giving the kind
of aid which was used in fact to
construct the kind of society in Western
Europe that we wanted to see develop
their now these are two very different
things it's a very different thing to
introduce to run for the gray
garmi a counterinsurgency program with
military support and many military men
involved that's one kind of thing one
sort of repression imposed on the Greek
population through American intervention
one might argue whether it's right or
wrong but that's that's to be very sharp
I just think we're hosed why do you say
it impose is it because your presumption
here here is is that the green let me
tell you would like the kind of regime
my site that my end of my assumption is
that us all intervention is imposed by
any country that is NEC i'll leave that
quite general me impose on the french
when we liberated the net them from the
Nazis was that an imposition we didn't
conquer france we moved the right there
no i didn't from from an outside
invading force we invaded but we didn't
conquer it from its own people see in
greece we were trying to conquer a
chromatin the day you willing to credit
the adding that is as their own people
but you not in greece willing to credit
the agenda German army the German army
was there there was no outside army in
Greece other than ours look there are
modalities of outside knows but look
there's a very sharp difference between
it's a very short term Laval was not a
Nazi but I wouldn't have lasted for five
minutes without the German army and no
no wood no wood Makarios have lasted for
five minutes without the help of
russian-made but wait a minute is you
know no comment about Cyrus Garza both
at a look now let's let's be careful
again I mean there's a difference BTW
first of all I'm post military aid to
other countries whether by us or by the
Soviet wine well let's come back to that
because the more important thing and
that is that I'm even far more opposed
to the imposition of regimes by foreign
troops now in the case of Germany let's
in the case of France the Peconic over
the amount of our government Alicia
government was supported by German
troops had the German military
necessarily because there was certainly
indigenous support but there's no
question that if German military force
have been withdrawn to the other side of
the Rhine then there would have been a
an overthrow of the Vichy government and
France would have had some different
form of government now in that case our
invasion of France was whether one likes
it or not what is it was in reaction to
an occupying external force it just pure
confusion to identify that with the case
of Greece when we were trying to
liberate we were trying to select the
kind of society the Greek Greece would
have and we were
trying to save the rulers that we had
designated as appropriate from their own
population there were no outside forces
but don't utilize it in your book and
that's why you're not willing to to be
consistent and carrying out this
argument you're constantly talking about
our satellite in the places like Cuba
and the Dominican Republic and so forth
and yet we have a occupied van Gogh we
sense in what you're talking about well
we never activated Dominican Republic we
send 25,000 troops there in 1965 I'm
talking about pre the American marines
were in there dozens of how I think
you're being evasive I don't debase not
to be no let me ask you this is it it is
not a base of it was amazed you know we
just simply repeatedly sent troops to is
it possible the dominican republic cuba
tetra tech is it possible to Santa lies
a nation without having an occupying
army there yes it is all right then
there goes your friends your tedious
frame sex base oh no no because that it
doesn't happen to be you see we're
talking about a real situation we could
talk about some ideal situation and you
know have an academic discussion I'd say
they're worried as possible for real on
front to satellite South Vietnam
presumably without even its logic occupy
it entirely and in a formal sense but it
didn't happen though so the well
seasoned argument considering which
there's the two points of view let's
discuss it and his target yeah in fact
you see there's much more if you want to
be serious about it there's more
evidence that South Vietnam tried to
colonize North Vietnam then conversely
in fact Sofia well look South Vietnamese
commandos were going military forces
regular military forces were going north
considerably earlier than in the time
when we even proclaimed that the
infiltration began from north to south
did they bump into the refugees governs
of the refugees were coming south in
night we're going in both directions in
the fact in 1954-55 and according least
according to burnet fall the commandos
began going north and 56 or 57 the first
claimed infiltration from the north was
in 59 and that was South Vietnamese
coming so so you know if one wants to
talk about again the real world the
first moment the trouble is you know you
got difficulty with chunks gives you in
my judgment you never know Quinn neatly
to begin your historical are you
the beginning but the point really is
that if you if you're starting to say
that 1959 was a provocation because it
wasn't a provocation going lane but I
say well but how about the people who
are going from north to south who were
talking about the misery that it would
what about which means out of it when we
say I mean which people are you talking
about I don't know well I'm doing about
Vietnamese north end and so you're good
you're probably is neatly captured in
the remark made recently by
Czechoslovakia that Texan walk is after
all the most neutralist country in the
world since it declines in defeating
with its own internal affairs and I
don't see the relevant I welcome what
would the relevance very simply that you
you you start your line of discussion at
a moment that is terribly useful for you
that semantic the you at the beginning
of the political world is that the
communist communist imperious by the use
of terrorism by the use of by
deprivation of freedom have contributed
to the continuing bloodshed and the sad
thing about it is not only the bloodshed
but the fact that this seemed to
dispossess you of the power of
rationally i say something should I
think that's about five percent true and
about or maybe ten percent true it
certainly is why do you give that may I
complete a sentence it's it's perfectly
true that there were areas of the world
in particular Eastern Europe where s
where Stalinist imperialism very
brutally to control and still maintains
control but there are also very vast
areas of the world where we were doing
the same thing and there's quite an
interplay in the Cold War you see the
what you just described is a I believe
in mythology about the Cold War which
might have been tenable ten years ago
but which is quite inconsistent with
contemporary scholars go check ask ask a
Guatemalan ask a Dominican esperance
illumination Republic ask you know ask a
you know that's your person brought
South Vietnam you know ask a high
obviously that way if you can't
distinguish between the nature of our
venture in Guatemala the nature of the
Soviet Union's in Prague what's then we
have real documented
