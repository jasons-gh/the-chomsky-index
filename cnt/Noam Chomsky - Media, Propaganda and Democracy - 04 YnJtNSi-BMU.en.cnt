on ideas the 1988 messy lectures about
media propaganda and democracy a series
of five talks one each night this week
divided into 16 sections including
questions from a panel of distinguished
Canadian journalists the messy lectures
are an annual event on CBC Radio there
began in nineteen sixty one and a
commissioned by the CBC to preserve
critical work by prominent intellectuals
in the humanities science and politics
the 1988 Massey lectures are given by
Noam Chomsky institute professor in the
Department of linguistics and philosophy
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in Boston professor Chomsky
has published some 30 books both in the
field of structural linguistics and in
the field of political theory is
especially well known for his analyses
of the place of the United States in
international affairs last month
pantheon published his latest book
written with co-author Edward Herrmann
it's called manufacturing consent and it
shows how the American mass media more
properly called the elite media function
as a propaganda system in support of
American corporations and government the
philosopher Reinhold Niebuhr concluded
that ordinary people were hardly capable
of understanding the world or acting
reasonably without being subjected to a
set of what he called necessary
illusions or tweed call propaganda
constructed by the intellectual elites
the system for managing this has turned
out to be the mass media in tonight's
lecture long term scape details the
treatment by the American Free Press of
your sections in Central America
distinguishing between the treatment
afforded official enemies notable
Nicaragua and official US friends
notably Guatemala and El Salvador the
fledgling democracies as they're called
professor Chomsky will also examine the
reporting of events that the United
Nation
when the United States disagrees with
the rest of the world a topic of some
interest right now with the activities
this week in Washington New York and
Geneva the 1988 messy lectures on media
propaganda and democracy part 11 on the
media as agents of government Noam
Chomsky many of our permanent newspapers
have become analyst agent saw regiments
of the government they do not contest or
even raise questions about government
policy this is Senator William Fulbright
speaking in the United States Senate
hearings on government in the media in
1966 this relax are not precisely
accurate the media do contests and raise
questions about government policy but
almost exclusively within a framework
determined by the essentially shared
interests of state and corporate power
discussion outside these boundaries is
rare and it's the goals themselves that
remain beyond challenge or even
awareness to illustrate I have reviewed
a few samples of the newest
contributions on the one hand to the US
government project of demonizing the
Sandinistas while on the other hand
posing the violent terrorist States back
tour director installed by the United
States and the Central America region
with all the skepticism about the media
that I have personally developed through
studying their preference over many
years I had not expected that they would
rise to the challenge of demonizing the
Sandinistas while causing the terror
States but the assessment of the media
was naive we're eager they had succeeded
in portraying the murderous us clients
as progressive if flawed democracies by
the same ministers guilty of no crime
that even begins to approach those of
Washington's favorites have become the
embodiment of evil they're reviewing my
last lecture of two periods of intense
to build over US policy towards
Nicaragua kept to the spectrum of
expressible opinion by editorialists
colonists or invited contributors news
reporting conforms to the same implicit
premises Jack Spence has studied 189 New
York Times articles on Nicaragua during
the first six months of 1986 the
conclusions are similar to those drawn
from the editorial and opinion columns
Spence absorbs that Central America was
virtually again word until us control
faced a challenge in 1978 for 1969
through 1977 the TV networks devoted a
total of one hour to Nicaragua all in
the nineteen seventy-two earthquake they
ignored the 1972 election in El Salvador
which was overturned by blatant fraud
and intervention by the US clients in
Central America that guaranteed the
military rule that continues until the
present there being no challenge to us
nomination the problem of establishing
democracy did not arise similarly it did
not arise in 1984 in Panama when the
notorious drug dealer general Noriega
who is then still a u.s. favorite ran a
fraudulent election legitimized by the
attendance of George Schultz at the
inauguration at the inauguration Schultz
close the vote as a triumph for
democracy taunting the Gorog what to do
the same after he had been breached by
the CIA that Noriega had stolen upwards
of 50,000 ballots in order to ensure the
election of his candidates most of the
hundred MIDI when New York Times stories
on Nicaragua came from Washington and
they presented Reagan administration
doctrine without challenge or analysis
including the limits about freedom
fighters forced to fight with only boots
and bandages against advanced Soviet
elements and Cuban piloted helicopters
brutal repression in that George Schultz
called this cancer right here
lame ass cuban troops swimming the
streets of managua by the scores in this
terrorism sanctuary two days drive from
Texas a second Libya and so on through
the familiar litany of misrepresentation
and outright lies in news columns Spence
observes the times tacit Lee accepted
the Reaganite views seeking out nor
others thus contributing to a drastic
narrowing for public debate regarding
the charges leveled against the
Sandinistas he goes on all those no
contrary view could be found in New York
Times and supporting evidence was never
present four times in the hundred
eighty-one stories the Nicaraguan
embassy was given a billion or two and a
few stories the reporter added a
background bounced on since goes on to
say it was as if the times had a
software program that a true and odd
intervals automatically kicked in a
boilerplate dancing graph beyond that
stories halfway point first priority in
news reporting was given to the US
government ranking second where the US
proxy forces the countries there are
extensive reports of the concern of the
businessmen's Association cosset
harassment of the us-funded general a
printer and other abuses coverage of the
US clients was largely favorable only
one of 33 stories on the country's
focused on human rights abuses and there
are a few other references to atrocities
that will by that time reaching a
remarkable scale let the State
Department and Congress the media
preferred what human rights
investigators described as intentional
ignorance in the case of el salvador in
contrast the guerrillas were castigated
as much as terrorists and the official
line has laid forth in New York Times
editorial was that these were improving
under the democratic government
the Honorable mr. Duarte the honest
reform-minded Christian Democrat who is
desperately trying to lead his people to
a better life while beset by implacable
extremes although the times concedes he
may have been less than rigorous in
bringing death squad operatives to
judicial account to translate from the
party line into English Duarte has done
nothing to curb the security forces that
he praises for their valiant service
alongside the people against subversion
his words while he concedes quietly that
the masses were with the guerrillas when
he became the front man for the war
against the population Dwight they was
portrayed as a victim meant as the
willing agent whose role was to ensure
adequate congressional hanging for the
state terrorist whom he protected in its
editorials the planes never once
mentioned such matters as the murder of
the archbishop with the complicity of
the security forces the destruction and
closure of the university by the only
with many killed the physical
destruction of the independent media and
the murder and expulsion of its editors
where the Salvadoran state of siege from
March 1980 when Dwight they joined the
hooter under which the atrocities were
conducted with his backing and constant
apologetics in contrast when the Gorog
were declared a state of siege in
October fifteenth nineteen eighty-five
The Times bitterly condemned this
demonstration of nicaragua's lack of
respect for democracy and human rights
as they put it dismissing with contempt
president ortega's claim that the
crackdown is the fault of quote the
brutal aggression by North America and
its internal allies the renewal of El
Salvador's for more draconian state of
siege two days later received no mention
whatsoever dissidents were also largely
suppressed or falsified in the news
columns there is no concern and little
if any reporting and the fact that since
1980 when the Salvadoran press has
either supported the government or
criticized it from a right-wing
perspective
avoiding stories critical of government
forces from a human rights standpoint as
observed in an America's watch review of
freedom of the press the political
opposition had been murdered by direct a
security forces or had been driven out
of the country so there was no need to
report or comment on their problems or
in the fact that none of the leading
leaders became Duarte his respected
minister of defense after his service as
director of the National Guard as it
administered its pedagogy of terror with
regard to Nicaragua the typical pattern
of media coverage was for the US
government propaganda services to
concoct some charge which the media were
then prominently and uncritically relay
occasionally when the charges were seen
to be outlandish there might be a male
disclaimer on the inside pages often the
charges persisted even acknowledged to
be groundless or even share fabrication
the disgrace of the free press could
hardly be more dramatic is worth
stressing that far more is at issue here
then dereliction of duty in competence
or service to power the protection
afforded state terrorists and the
fledgling democracies provides a veil
behind which they can pursue their
atrocities with crucial us support while
the indignant focus on far lesser abuses
in Nicaragua has facilitated the Reagan
programs of terror and economic warfare
that reversed social and economic
progress in Nicaragua and reduced the
economy to ruins permitting regular
media gloating over send aniston
competence and malevolence the video
with us accomplices in an extraordinary
outburst of violence of repression Jack
Spence observes that the obviously
relevant pending World Court decision
was not mentioned in the 171 new york
times news stories that preceded the
World Court decision itself the decision
was on jun 27th 1986 in this decision
the court condemned
United States for support for the
countries and ordered it to desist from
these violations of international law
and valid treaties and to pay
reparations the decision was reported
but it was dismissed as a manner
alliance its contents were suppressed or
falsified the World Court not the United
States was portrayed as the criminal and
the rule of law was held to be
inapplicable to the United States here
its editorial response to the court
decision on July first New York Times
dismissed the court as a hostile forum
they had voiced no criticism when this
same hostel forum had ruled in favor of
the United States in the matter of the
Iran hostage crisis in the July
seventeenth op-ed column thomas frank of
New York University Law School a noted
advocate of World Order argued that the
United States should dismiss the World
Court ruling because in his words
America still needs the freedom to
protect freedom the US government in the
media are surpassed by known in their
appeals to the August rule of law and
the call for diplomacy rather than
violence in the case of official enemies
that is hence the events of the sooner
of 1986 called for some careful
perception management until June
nicaragua's failure to accept the
contadora treaty draft was a major story
in may the new york times published a
lengthy report by stephen kinzer Hedlund
nicaragua box at latin peace accord the
story criticized ortega for his
unwillingness to sign the agreement
without some commitment from the united
states nicaragua appears to be the only
central american nation reluctant to say
in the draft agreement Kinser wrote a
few weeks later in mid-june the u.s.
client States rejected the treaty draft
under us pressure this fact was excluded
from the national press nicaragua
declared its readiness to seeing the
treaty on jun 21st the washington post
ignored
unwelcome fact but it received oblique
mention in to 20 items in the New York
Times under the headings Nicaragua makes
offered to limit some weapons us
condemns offered by Nicaragua on treaty
the story focused on the Reagan
administration rejection of nicaragua's
acceptance of the treaty as
propagandistic both items appeared in
the around the world roundup of marginal
news for adjuncts of government news
value is determined by utility for
ideological warfare a few days later the
World Court called for termination of US
aid to the country's Congress reacted by
voting a hundred million dollars of
military aid to implement what the court
had called the unlawful use of force
while government officials commented
happily that this is for real this is a
real war nicaragua brought the matter to
the UN Security Council where the United
States vetoed a resolution calling in
all states to observe international law
Nicaragua then turned to the General
Assembly of the United Nations which
passed a resolution 94 23 calling for
compliance with the World Court ruling
to occlude States Israel in El Salvador
during the United States in opposition
the Security Council vote merited a
brief note in the New York Times the
newspaper of record that the General
Assembly endorsement of it passed
unmentioned the x UN correspondent
preferred a story that day on overly
high UN salaries in November 1987 a year
later the General Assembly a demon
called for for an immediate compliance
with the World Court decision this time
only Israel joined with the United
States and opposing adherence to
international law this was not reported
by the New York Times The Washington
Post where the three TV networks the
reaction of the US government in the
media
to world opinion merits further comment
the same UN session provides a number of
interesting examples while all attention
was focused on the Washington summit in
December 1987 and the INF treaty the
urine voted on a series of disarmament
resolutions the General Assembly voted
150 for 21 with no abstentions opposing
the build-up of weapons in outer space
that resolution was clearly aimed at
Reagan Star Wars it plated 135 to one
against developing new weapons of mass
destruction in those cases the United
States was alone in opposition the
United States was joined by France in
opposing a resolution passed 143 22
calling for a comprehensive test ban
treaty another vote calling for a halt
to all nuclear test explosions passed by
a vote of 137 to three with the united
states joined by france and britain in
opposition all of these votes were
unreported and unleash ined in the new
york times review that was headlined
setbacks to US and Soviet at the United
Nations other reports on the same
session provide further insight into the
style of un coverage two days after the
only reported disarmament resolutions a
new york times story reports a vote on a
resolution that in quoting that
reaffirms the united nations previous
strong condemnation of international
terrorism in all its forms and calls on
all countries to cooperate in eradicated
terrorism the resolution passed 128 21
Israel alone
in opposition with the United States
outstanding and the other 128 members
present voting in favor the headline
reads Syria isolated at un drops
terrorism plan five days later the
General Assembly passed a resolution
condemning terrorism wherever and by who
never committed the vate was 153 to to
Israel in the United States in
opposition with Honduras alone
abstaining this was unreported and
unleash and in the new york times review
of the session on december 26th in watch
19 great story is headlined un to study
rights in Cuba USC's diplomatic victory
the story reports Cuba's invitation to
the UN Human Rights Commission for an
honest and investigation undercutting a
US campaign for a resolution condemning
Cuba the first 13 paragraphs of the
story present the u.s. point of view
turning the failure into a great triumph
of American diplomacy the last paragraph
quotes a Cuban official who states that
the outcome shows our continents growing
political unity in rejecting the u.s.
effort unreported is a resolution passed
by the Human Rights Commission the same
way 26 to one with the United States
alone in opposition expressing grave
concern at quote for continuation of
acts of aggression and the arbitrary
practices of the Israeli occupation
forces in southern Lebanon which
constitutes a flagrant violation of
international law and calling on
Israel's allies to pressure it to end
its aggressive and expansionist policy
in southern Lebanon world opinion has
passed through the sand filters that set
the bands of respectability at home
failing to meet these standards world
opinion is ignored or subjected to
puzzled inquiry as to why the world is
out of step the 1988 messy lectures
continue on ideas presented by Noam
Chomsky
pop 12 the contadora peace accords
returning to the campaign to do nuys the
Sandinistas a new challenge arose when
the Central American presidents reached
a peace agreement in August 1987 the
Reagan administration had long sought to
undercut diplomatic initiatives after
bitterly condemned as in ministers for
refusing to say in the adoro draft
of 1984 the administration quickly
changed its tune Nicaragua unexpectedly
announced that it would sign at that
point the draft became a deception and a
fraud and the United States preceded the
underlayment with further denunciations
of the treacherous and Estes Washington
tried by all means available to block
the saving of the contadora peace Act
the Vice foreign affairs minister of
Costa Rica observed in an unreported
interview revering have a us strongly
pressured Costa Rica and its client
States during the nineteen eighty-five
1986 period when he was a first-hand
witness the IRS initiatives of 1987 were
also a most unwelcome to the Reagan
administration in June Philip Habib
who's called Washington's peace emissary
informed high-ranking senators that if
the administration felt its views and
interests were not reflected in a
regional arrangement it would continue
to thing the Nicaraguan Contras rebels
despite agreements reached by the
Central American leaders that was an
advance notice that elicited little
attention in the same in the Reagan
administration pressured President
duarte to block a scheduled meeting of
Central American presidents in Guatemala
a Guatemalan official reported that what
a personally told Guatemala's president
the reason he asked for a postponement
was because of us pressure applied by
habib in a last-ditch effort to only man
the peace agreement washington put forth
the Reagan White
plan on August fifth this plan called
for dismantling the political system in
Nicaragua and need to jose de nicaragua
and demobilization of its military
forces in return the United States would
pledge to halt shipments of arms to the
country's this proposal received wide
media acclaim as fair and just
nevertheless to the surprise and
annoyance of the administration the
Central American presidents reached an
agreement on August seventh government
propaganda then shifted predictably to
the demolition of the unacceptable
Accords the media followed faithfully
along the first requirement of this most
remarkable campaign was to establish
that us support for the country's forced
the same ministers to negotiate this is
an important doctrine since it can be
exploited to justify subsequent resort
to armed force and terror the doctoring
hardly withstands the evidence of
history this evidence reveals
nicaragua's effort to pursue the
peaceful means required by international
law through the World Court the United
Nations and the contadora process and on
the other hand Washington's success in
trumping these initiatives as a linked
secret document exalted such problems
were readily overcome by dismissal of
the facts to the memory hole the next
problem was to dismantle the Accords
themselves the first phase of the
Accords ran from the signing in August
1987 to january 1988 when the central
american presidents were tonight to
receive the report of the international
verification commission that was charged
with monitoring the Accords the goal of
the Reagan administration was to focus
all attention on the Sandinistas thus
ensuring that the United States could
maintain the attack by its proxy forces
while excluding the US Korean States
from the provisions of the Accords the
media at once dedicated themselves to
these tasks the hiss plan specified me
indispensable element for peace mainly a
termination of open or covered aid of
any form to irregular forces meaning the
countries or insurrectionist movements
meaning indigenous guerrillas in
response the United States at least
stepped up its illegal supply flights
which had already reached the phenomenal
level of one-a-day in an effort to keep
the proxy forces in the field the supply
flights doubled in September the week
after the Accords and virtually tripled
through the rest of the year
surveillance flights also increased
successes were immediately evident as
contra attacks on civilians doubled in
intensity including ambushes mortars
attacks on foreign cooperatives and
kidnappings the peace agreements were
less effectively dead from the first
moment these were by far the most
significant developments during the
August January failures of the Accords
the media responded to these
unacceptable facts by suppressing them
only the most assiduous reader of all of
the media unpublished wire service
reports and other documents could have
been nearly aware of these crucial facts
the behavior of the New York Times was
particularly remarkable including
outright falsification along with
scrupulous suppression again we see a
shocking display of media civility to
state power the Accords call for justice
freedom and democracy and guarantees for
the inviolability of all forms of life
and liberty and the safety of the people
they call for an authentic pluralistic
and participatory democratic process to
promote social justice and respect for
human rights these provisions were also
unacceptable to the US government since
it is obvious that they cannot be met or
even approached in the u.s. clearance
States we're at the dismantling of the
government structure nominated by the
armed forces and the security services
having eliminated the provisions
applying to the United States
then faced a second task to remove the
practices of the client states from the
agenda this problem was whether overcome
by the same means simple refusal to
report the facts or marginalization and
distortion when they were too visible to
ignore entirely state error in the u.s.
client states escalated but no matter
the laser like focus of the media was in
Nicaragua which received for more
coverage than the other countries
combined virtually all of the
concentrating on departures from the
Accords as interpreted in Washington
another unacceptable feature of the
Accords was the role given to
international monitors the u.s. works no
interference in its domains and the
international presence would inhibit
violation of the Accords thus
interfering with us intentions the first
phase of the Accords ended in january
with a report by the international
verification commission the commission
had the bad taste to condemn the United
States and its clients while praising
steps taken by Nicaragua obviously it
had to go the New York Times cooperated
by suppressing the verification
Commission report and under us pressure
the Commission was abolished the victory
was complete made a shred of the
original agreements remained Nicaragua
responded by announcing that it would
satisfy the terms of the former Accords
unilaterally requesting international
supervision to monitor its agreement
alone the loyal media responded by
announcing that family Nicaragua had a
grant to comply with the Peace Accords
although of course communists cannot be
trusted meanwhile state terror continued
to escalate in the client states without
however influencing the judgment that
Nicaragua alone was responsible for
violating the court and that is the
correct response given that the United
States and its clients were now exempt
by washington media edict in the New
York Times the terror was
early noted apart from gorilla terror in
El Salvador to which the government
sometimes responded Times correspondent
James lemoyne commented with regret with
the Accords now restricted to the
question of enter a bow in compliance
with Washington's dictates the crucial
issue became the willingness of the
Sandinistas to negotiate with the CIA
established civilian front for
Washington's proxy forces the text of
the Accords require do such negotiations
that the records have long since been
dismissed to oblivion in early nineteen
eighty eight Nicaragua did agree to this
us condition reaching an unexpected
ceasefire agreement meanwhile the
indigenous guerrillas in El Salvador and
Guatemala were consistently rebuffed in
their efforts to negotiate but these
facts were suppressed as irrelevant in
conformity with the washington media
version of the Accords will not suppress
the facts were simply denied as women
Jeanne Kirkpatrick wrote in The
Washington Post in June that Duarte has
seen his generous offers of anise tea
and negotiations rejected by the fmln
guerrillas one by one this pronouncement
followed what his rejection of a series
of efforts by the FMLA the political
opposition and the church to arrange
negotiations the Nicaraguan ceasefire
was saying on March 23rd the agreement
stated that only humanitarian aid will
be negotiated it further stipulated that
this aid must be in accordance with
article 5 of the August 1987 Accords the
aid is to be channeled through neutral
organizations secretary-general Suarez
of the Organization of American States
was entrusted with ensuring compliance
with the agreement Congress responded by
voting over
mainly to violate the terms of the
ceasefire approving 48 million dollars
in aid to the countries to be
administered by the State Department
through its Agency for International
Development the aid will be delivered in
Honduras and within nicaragua by a
private company james immune of the New
York Times reported quoting contra
leaders the phrase private company is a
euphemism for the CIA for which the
agency from the national development has
admittedly served as a front in the past
by no stretch of the imagination can
this agency be considered a neutral
organization the congressional
legislation stipulated that all Aled
must be administered in a manner
consistent with the March 23rd ceasefire
agreement and in accord with the
decisions of the verification Commission
established by that agreement for which
secretary-general Suarez was the
responsible authority secretary-general
Suarez wrote a letter to Secretary of
State George Shultz and April 25th in
which he drew his attention to this
passage of the Congressional legislation
the secretary-general went on to state
that remains in the US Agency for the
nation development was in clear
violation of the ceasefire agreement he
expressed his deep concern about this
whole situation he emphasized further
that article 5 of the peace accords
which determines how age shall be
delivered into the ceasefire agreement
quite explicitly rules out any
assistance whatsoever to the Contras
except for repatriation or resettlement
aid can be seat to the countries within
nicaragua by names agreed by both sides
as a means towards their reintegration
into normal life that for no other end
washington disregarded the objections of
secretary-general Suarez the official in
charge of monitoring the agreement
and all this was one reported in the
media to my knowledge and the illegal
operations continued and woods the head
of the US Agency for International
Development said that the aid would have
to be delivered by private American
aircraft in violation of the ceasefire
agreement the New York Times article
reporting this is headed official sees
problems on country aid the big hurdle
is st. aniston mistrust the US Agency
for International Development then began
delivering supplies to the countries in
Honduras violating the Congressional
legislation that stipulated that the aid
was to be delivered in cease fire zones
all of which are in Nicaragua and
violating the ceasefire occurred since
the agency for international development
a US agency clearly is not a neutral
organization all of these facts were
largely ignored by the New York Times
which offered a different version rather
pure alleged that president Ortega has
blocked deliveries of the aid authorized
by Congress on grounds that the
deliveries would violate the ceasefire
agreement I mentioned in his report was
the fact that this was also the
conclusion of the official in charge of
monitoring the agreement
secretary-general Suarez his name
actually did appear in the article but
only in the context of the Reagan
administration decision that he had not
met their financial accountability
standards so therefore Washington had
not disbursed the 10 million dollars
provided by Congress for the Commission
to verify compliance with the ceasefire
agreement in further violation of both
the agreement and the Congressional
legislation the Reagan administration
sent comers to the countries to spend as
they wished the national media remained
unperturbed in accordance with the
doctrine that the United States stands
above any level
for international agreement Mira the
United States Treasury Department
announced a new ruling barring import of
Nicaraguan cuffy processed in a third
country according to the willing a
section ago a green coffee will not be
considered sufficiently transformed to
lose its Nicaraguan identity it suffice
us to replace the word Nicaraguan by
Jewish to know to which phase of history
this edict belongs during the same
months negotiations on a political
settlement broke down through the device
of demand escalation by the country's
know about following the State
Department script each new government
agreement going far beyond the terms of
the long-forgotten peace accords simply
led to new demands the government of
Nicaragua continued to urge resumption
of the talks receiving your response
from Washington or the countries will
continue to add new demands given
Cardinal a bandeau would barely conceals
his sympathy for the country's urged
them to return to the talks to no avail
they are followed what the council on
hemispheric affairs describes as a CIA
managed campaign of provocation and
internal disruption inside Nicaragua
this established a first crisis
atmosphere in which Congress could turn
to move aid for the country's
congressional bubs implemented
legislation providing continued aid to
the country's the long-term goals have
been obvious from the opposite it is
necessary to demolish what Archbishop
Romero called the people's organizations
fighting to defend their most
fundamental human rights it is necessary
to eliminate any threat of independent
nationalism in the fledgling democracies
if Nicaragua cannot be restored by
violence to the Central American Road
when at least the United States must
implement they reported both to the
State Department insider in 1989 to to
Nicaragua into the
vania of Central America but is poor
isolated and radical the United States
must ensure that Nicaragua will become a
sort of Latin American Albania so that
the soonest a dream of creating a new
more exemplary political model for Latin
America would be in ruins in the words
of British journalist John Carlin these
girls have largely been achieved in the
US media serving as edges of government
deserve a large share of the credit the
1988 messy lectures continue to marinate
on ideas presented by Noam Chomsky
several weeks ago professor Chomsky gave
a talk on the subject of the media and
democratic thought control to an
audience at rosen polytechnical
institute in Toronto after which he was
questioned by a panel of Canadian
journalists would also read an advance
copy of the lectures we're presenting
this week on ideas we're broadcasting
parts of the panel discussion each night
this week as professor Chomsky responds
to questions of the panel this is gene
allen faeren editor of The Globe and
Mail many of the things you described
about how they are we press in the
United States sees the world are
replayed to us through some of the main
communications links that we rely on
such as Associated Press Reuters news
agency new york times news service and i
think many canyon journalists are in the
position of recognizing a strong us bias
in those in those reports and in our
actives and that's one of the day-to-day
challenges is trying to find ways of
getting around that have one of the
things you can do is get your own
correspondence there who have a
different point of view or try and get
local stories you can't do that all the
time but I just wonder some that it my
party
in a way it seems that perhaps a lot of
what you described could be simply
interpreted as kind of the American
press time cheerleader for the home team
is just like there's a kind of sports
writer is called a hammer you know when
the home team can do no wrong and can
look at it that way just as an issue of
American foreign policy and countries
like like Canada can can can have signed
effective room to maneuver in terms of
touring the world I think I think
there's something to that but you know
what to be careful about what's the home
team for example with the American press
defendants is the interests of a link
elements in the United States now it may
be that the general population is
strongly opposed to a lead elements but
they're not the home team it's the only
two elements that are home the home team
for the reasons that I mentioned Sirhan
say Central America there is no doubt
that the general population has been
pretty much a close to these policies
but the hurricane is in favor working in
the presses in favor and let's do it now
vietnam war in the ER that was very
interesting at first the general
population was strongly in support of
the war strongly and support but then it
changed by about 1969 the population was
largely opposed to the war and on
interesting grounds there where the
population was opposed in principle when
you take a look at the Gallup polls up
until today or at least two years ago
which is the last one I saw we populate
about seventy percent of the population
regularly says the Vietnam War was
fundamentally wrong and immoral at a
mistake now among opinion leaders isn't
seventy percent it's like thirty percent
opinion leaders includes clergy and
businessmen and so on we're in Italy
really leaked the percentages about zero
was actually at a peak of opposition to
the war like in around nineteen seventy
the real intellectual elite you know as
picked by various sandwich because of
course opposed to the war so is
everybody including Wall Street but this
was just not telling anymore but there
are personally pragmatic rounds it
wasn't working he was too costly as
maybe
bloody and so on but we were wrong and
immoral not a mistake that what position
is barely expressed in the ideological
system but it's the position of about
seventy percent of the population now
here we have a striking case were you
know the the home cam that you're
working for is not the general
population it's a very specific interest
in the general population I think it's
true a lot of issues let's take say
takes a turn with totally different
question take nuclear-test-ban justjust
to a popular grassroots organization the
population was about seventy-five
percent in favor of the nuclear test ban
two or three years ago elites were
strongly opposed to it liberal
conservative everyone else they were so
strongly opposed to it that when the
Soviet Union declared a a unilateral
test ban the money had barely covered it
and they noticed that he disparaged it
told various lies about it and as we
neared it was barely even covered and
this one isn't it was hardly even an
issue in the elections even though if
seventy-five percent of the population
was in favor of it had virtually no
elite support except maybe an occasional
gesture that's a very strong a leak
position but it's not reflecting general
the general public so I think there's
something to what you say but I think
one has to be more discriminating about
how to define the home team the haunting
means the people are in the country and
therefore our governor or the official
homepage yeah Peter Worthington editor
of the Ottawa some your calc of the
Vietnam War the turning against it and
you said poor for moral grounds because
it goes an immoral war in general
population at the eight I have no idea
would be
the public turned against it regardless
of the point that I think is a mistake
but I think public turned against it
primarily because it was a losing war
and can you give me any indication of a
winning war that's been unpopular well
can I give an indication of a wound
where that's on the popular see I quite
honestly I think we get known war was a
ring word from the United States title
winning well well civil SB could be
super cuts and donor ciganda that's
indoctrination in order to decide what
we must because you know what finally
letting donated to beside where war is a
winning were not you have to figure out
first why it was full right that's what
tells you whether it was a winning or
variety of ways to tell that's right
there are a lot of ways that well but
one of the ways if your logical is to
ask what were the goals of the rule and
where those goals achieved that's the
way you decide where their wars are
winning work right if we do that what
I'm going to do this in one second let
me again just talk methodologically
because there's no time to go through
the whole story you can look up the
documents there's a library of
documentation on the background planning
for the Vietnam War elaborate
documentation on the high-level planning
and the main concern all along was that
independent nationalism in Vietnam maybe
what was called a a rotten apple that
would infect the barrel a the amount of
the demonstration effect throughout the
region very much like Nicaragua and
there's a way you deal with it the way
you deal with a virus that might infect
the region the virus in this case being
independent nationalism the way you deal
with it is by destroying the virus and
inoculated the region from the spread
now there is then there's the Vietnam
War had a dual character you had to
destroy the possibility that independent
development in Vietnam and you had to
create around it go to
military dictatorships which would
prevent the spread and both of those
things were done reasonably effectively
part of the Vietnam War was the support
for the Indonesian massacres in 1965 a
very significant part part of the
concern over Vietnam was that it would
encourage the growth of the of
independent politics in Indonesia where
you had a huge mass based peasant based
communist party and success in Vietnam
might have spurred that on in 1965 that
party was like that with the slaughter
of maybe 700,000 people too enthusiastic
support in the West I should say that
was part of the inoculation of the
region same happens in Thailand saying
up in the Philippines with Marco school
or in the region meanwhile hit many was
sufficiently destroyed so the chances of
it being a novel for anyone else are
very slight I mean Vietnam probably not
bholi survives now if it's it suffered
the kind of fate that there's nothing to
compare with in European history back to
the Black Plague yes century before they
even recover if then so that's impartial
a partial victory is it in terms it so
here you have even got a total victory
they didn't get their ultimate goal you
know if if you're only six if you're
worried if you call success only
achievement of every goal leaving the
minor ones than it wasn't a victory but
if we give an accurate assessment it was
a partial victory partial defeat partial
victory in will absorb Indochina back
into the American system that they
prevented it from being the threat of a
good example in this respect the
American world in Nicaragua is also a
partial victory now we can we can answer
the question what the American
population thought about the war we can
answer it because it's a very heavily
fold population and willing to speculate
we can look at public opinion studies
and they changed over time by the late
60s the population was largely opposed
to the war on more
or grounds not on grounds that it was
going to fail by the 70s with the
continued improvement in the cultural
climate among the general population
those figures went up by 1982 it was
seventy two percent answering yes to the
wars fundamentally wrong in a moral not
a mistake and those figures are
particularly dramatic because there was
virtually no articulate expression of
this view you go to the extreme does you
know Anthony Lewis and so on they were
not saying this they never said it what
they were saying is it's a mistake maybe
some of them might have said it's too
bloody if you want some actual evidence
on this don't take my word for it go to
the evidence there is an interesting
study called the American intellectual
elite with tomorrow 1974 it's done by
sociologist named Charles tradition it's
a study of the attitudes of people call
the American intellectual elite it's I
agree it's a telly addict concept but
the people stated are probably no worse
a sample than others I was actually one
of them so as I've watched the study you
want this study was taken in 1970 that's
rather important if you look back you'll
discover that that was the peak period
of opposition to the war right after the
invasion of Cambodia that was the period
when the colleges were closed down you
know a whole country was blowing up
right at that point this survey was
taken of the American intellectual elite
you know people are right for the New
York Review of Books and all this kinda
fancy stuff the return of people in the
sample everybody was against the war but
so is Richard Nixon you know so that
didn't mean anything the question is why
were they against the war well they
broke down into three categories most of
them were against the war on what the
editor called pragmatic rounds being
can't get away with it a smaller
percentage to get the numbers i think
maybe a third or so we're against the
wall and what they called moral grounds
funny word moral grounds meant it's too
bloody in other words you killing too
many children you know kill fewer
children it's okay then there was a
teeny group actually was maybe two or
three people in the sample I was one of
them who were opposed to the war and
what the editor called ideological
grounds now the term is interesting
otherwise it was a bad word you know
what it means is that this cane is
statistically a relevant sample you know
like one percent or something were
opposed to the war on principle man
grams that aggression is wrong even if
it succeeds so if they had asked the
question where you think about the
invasion Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia question wasn't asked but
if it had been asked everybody would
have been against it no they will be
announced it on pragmatic grounds
because it worked and nobody would have
been against it on what are called moral
grounds because it wasn't guilty you
know and I killed one person or
something so it's not moral ground here
everybody everybody would have been
against it on ideological grounds except
nobody would call that ideological you
would just call it human or principle
the Soviet you ain't talking about the
United States don't do it not work on
Russia's war sorry habit you know but
yet now you're missing my point my point
is that opposition that in a US study
our position to an American War up to
aggression on grounds of principle is
called ideological and it is marginal
when it's us aggression and it's
concerned and it's considered normal and
cropper when we're talking about Soviet
aggression now here's my point at a time
when the population was moving towards
over large-scale opposition to the war
and grams of principle the intellectual
elite was only by statistical or did you
find anybody who is opposed to the
grounds of principle and that's at the
peak period of opposition to the war I
think those things are pretty revealing
in fact I think there's in my view at
least there's a kind of a split that's
taken place in American culture an
interesting sort of split between
educated elite opinion which in fact is
ristic and indoctrinated and reactionary
and so on whether it calls itself
liberal or something else and the
general public which is moving in
another direction noam chomsky the 1988
messy lectures all ideas we're back
