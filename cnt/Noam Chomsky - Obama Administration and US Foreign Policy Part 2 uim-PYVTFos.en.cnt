stream in the first in the first term
well you know the second term was
somewhat different for one thing some of
the most extreme figures were kicked out
Rumsfeld Wolfowitz a couple of others
were sent off the pasture they couldn't
get rid of Chaney because he was the
administration so can't dismantle it but
a lot of the others went and policy
shifted more towards the norm to the
more or less centrist norm and little
talk about negotiations I'm in less
aggression and so on and a more polite
attitude toward the portal eyes so that
it was more acceptable fundamentally
didn't change it was more acceptable and
this prediction was that that's what
Obama would do and I think that's pretty
much what happened in fact there's a
pretty interesting characterization of
this which sort of captures it I think
pretty well it's a anachronistic but I
think it applies back in 1962 at the
time of the cuban missile crisis when
the world really was coming you know
dangerously close to a nuclear war which
would have been sort of the end danger
most dangerous moment in history Arthur
Schlesinger called that Kennedy's
advisor right the peak of the missile
crisis u.s. planners were considering
measures which they knew might destroy
Europe and in fact in particular Britain
so they're kind of playing at these
scenarios which led to the destruction
of Britain but they weren't and take
them very seriously affect the taking
the steps towards but they didn't let
Britain know Britain is supposed to have
a special relationship with the United
States but the bridge were pretty upset
they couldn't find out
was going on the Prime Minister
Macmillan all he could find out was what
British intelligence was picking up so
here they're the best and the brightest
are making plans might well lead to the
destruction of Britain but they're not
telling at that point a senior advisor I
think it was probably Dean Acheson of
the Kennedy administration entered the
discussion and he defined the special
relationship he said the special
relationship with Britain means that
Britain is our lieutenant the
fashionable word is partner and the
British of course like to hear the
fashion will work well that's pretty
much the difference between bush and
obama a bush simply told him you are
lieutenant you do what we say or you're
irrelevant fact that's the word that I
think Colin values the UN do what we say
or you're irrelevant you're just our
lieutenant and forget about it they
don't like to hear that what they like
to hear is you're a partner you know we
love you and back in secret we treat you
as our lieutenant but that's okay and I
suspect that that's the main difference
what about the anti-war movement in the
United States you've long been a
participant in it very active in Vietnam
right up until today but where do you
see it in relation to the person that
many of them devoted tremendous efforts
to elect another actually that my view
which is not the standard one is that
the anti-war movement is far stronger
now than it was in the 60s it in the
1960s there was a point you know 1968-69
whether it was a very strong any war
movement against the war in Vietnam but
it's worth remembering that the war in
Vietnam started an outright war started
in 1962 and by then
be 70 or 80,000 people that are even
killed under the US client regime but in
1962 Kennedy really opened an outright
war sent the American Air Force to start
bombing South Vietnam under South
Vietnamese markings but everybody knew
was even reported authorized napalm
authorized chemical warfare to destroy
crops and ground cover started open
started the programs which drove
ultimately billions of people from the
countryside into what amount of the
concentration camps to try to the words
were to protect them from the guerrillas
who the government knew perfectly well
they were supporting same kind of things
you read now in Afghanistan if you
bother to read the fine print about the
conquest of the margin but we had it
drive them into concentration camps to
to protect them from the people the
guerrillas they were supporting that's a
war it's a serious word protests was
zero literally it was years before you
could get any sign of protest I mean
those of you who are old enough may
remember that in Boston liberal city in
October 1965 that's three years after
that hundreds of thousands of American
troops are in Beijing the country you
know war spread to North Vietnam and so
on we tried to have our first public
demonstration against the war on the
Boston Common usual demonstration places
October 1965 I was supposed to be one of
the speakers couldn't say a word and was
broken up you know violently a lot of
students marched over trying to break it
up hundreds of State Police there the
next day the Boston Globe most liberal
paper in the country devoted its whole
front page to denouncing the
demonstrators not that once we were
breaking it up you know a picture who
wounded soldier in the middle of that
sort of thing when I was October 1965
hundreds of thousands of troops there
were escalating beyond well finally
after years in 1968 you got a
substantial anti-war movement 67 68 by
then South Vietnam was gone it was
virtually destroyed and the same was
true with much of the rest of Indochina
well the word did go on for a long time
horrible effects we were unwilling to
face the fact even to report the fact
but nevertheless the anti-war movement
did have an effect very late or compare
Iraq there were huge protests before the
war was officially launched and we now
know that Blair and a bush were simply
lying when they said that they were
trying to work for a diplomatic
settlement they'd already started the
work okay that came out in the famous
Downing Street memos in England but it
had been officially announced so but
there were huge demonstrations and I
think they had an effect the US war in
Iraq was horrible enough probably killed
about a million people drove a couple of
million out of the country devastated
the country destroyed horrible cultural
destruction and so on it was pretty
awful it could have been a lot worse
it's not what the US did in South
Vietnam nothing like it you know no
saturation bombing with b-52s chemical
warfare and so on and I think it was
retarded by by the anti-war movement the
population here had just become more
civilized that's one of those grim
effects of the 1960s pardon Afghanistan
is an interesting case the an
Afghanistan was sold here as a war to
retaliate to adjust source called adjust
were to prevent terror retaliate against
a terrorist attack that's it's such a
standard view that take it apart you
know requires
more time than I'd be allowed but the
fact of the matter is that that was not
the goal of the war I mean if the goal
of the war was to isolate al Qaeda
eliminate terror there were
straightforward ways to proceed if you
go back to that time the jihadi movement
itself was highly critical of the United
Levin attack they were fought was coming
out for the most radical clerics and you
know Allah saw a university main
theological center denouncing al Qaeda
Osama bin Laden and the terrorist
attacks on Islamic when I would do that
and so on well if you wanted to end
terror the obvious thing to do at that
point is to isolate al Qaeda to try to
gain support even from the jihadi
movement and of course from the
population they're trying to mobilize
you know terrorists regard themselves as
a vanguard they're trying to mobilize
others to their cause I mean every
specialist on terrorism knows that so
you could have done it then and you
could have proceeded to identify the
perpetrators which incidentally they
couldn't do because they didn't know who
they were and that was conceded later
but they could have tried to identify
and bring them to justice you know two
trials with fair trials did not torture
but fair trials which would have
probably the sharply reduced if maybe
not maybe even if ended Islamic
terrorism well they did the opposite
what they tried to do is to mobilize the
population and mobilize the jihadi
movement to support al Qaeda that's
exactly the effect of first invading
Afghanistan and later invading Iraq and
it's also the effect of Guantanamo and
bagram and the other torture centers I
mean everyone is involved in them deals
series nosy how they created terrorists
I think Obama should have these
Guantanamo prisoners tried a new
well it depends whether we want to be
regard ourselves as a civilized country
as a rogue state if if you want to be a
rogue state you know do whatever you
like kill them torture if you want to be
part of the civilized world and also if
you want to reduce the appeal of the
extreme jihadi movement than diamond
city in courts in fact the very fact
that they're in Guantanamo is outlandish
first of all what's Guantanamo I mean
Guantanamo was taken from Cuba a century
ago at gunpoint they said give us want
anema or else Cuba was under military
occupation it's called a treaty okay but
and what the treaty of Guantanamo if you
want to call it that allowed Guantanamo
to be used as a coaling station for the
Navy well you know it's not what's being
used for in fact as you know perfectly
well used for Haitian refugees when
Haiti Haitians were fleeing from the
dictatorships that the u.s. was
supporting the u.s. refused to permit
them political asylum it claimed that
they were just economic refugees yeah
the Coast Guard tried to stop him and if
any got through they sent to Guantanamo
okay now you know what they're being
used for actually what they are being
used for us create terrorists it's on my
opinion that's the opinion of the main
us interrogators we've liked Matthew
Alexander who actually has an article on
it in the same issue of national
interest that I mentioned so you have a
great way to create terrorists it
inspires terrorism all over and it turns
many of these people they're into
terrorists even if they were picked up
for whatever reason it was so yes if you
want to if your goal is to reduce the
threat of say Islamic terrorism and to
become part of the civilized world you
have civilian trials just as the
those who were in Guantanamo first of
all most of those are in goa thought
about it and I've outrageous anyways
like some 15 year old kid who was found
holding a rifle when the u.s. is
invading his country that's it
terrorists you know okay but that's a
large part of maybe most of all of
what's in Guantanamo but if you wanted
but what should have been done with them
if the goal was to be civilized than to
reduce terrorism is to put them in
prison in the United States there's no
security problem they're not going to
get out of a maximum security prison and
they don't have some magic way of
spreading poison around the world or
anything but of course the government
didn't want to do that because I had no
evidence and if they were they were sent
to Guantanamo so that they could it was
hoped to be free from US jurisdiction
they could play that you could pretend
they weren't under your us jurisdictions
of the laws didn't apply well Supreme
Court finally after a long time kind of
whittled away at that and said yes they
have the right of habeas corpus the Bush
administration accepted that Obama
doesn't Obama the Obama administration
is trying to overturn a decision by a
right-wing Bush judicial appointee that
the supreme court decision holds for
Bagram the torture Center in Afghanistan
and the Obama administration is trying
to override that so that that means that
the Supreme Court decision is just a
joke if you want to torture somebody
don't send it to Guantanamo because
supreme court said you can't torture
them they're a sound of the Bagram so if
you pick somebody up in Yemen or
wherever you pick them up and you want
them to not to be subject to
international law also US law okay so
I'm the Bagram that's the Obama
administration position I'm it's for
reasons like these that even the most
hawkish ed you know terrorism specialist
be like michael Scheuer who was in
charge for the CIA of following Obama
for years he says that al Qaeda's Osama
bin Laden's best ally is the United
States we're doing exactly what he wants
what he wants is trying to sell a line
to the Muslim world you know these guys
are on a crusade they're trying to kill
us we've got to defend ourselves and the
u.s. is acting you know as if they're
under command you know yeah we do
everything he wants should do about
Israel Palestine what do you think
people here should I israel-palestine
happens to be a particularly easy case I
mean there has been an overwhelming
international consensus for 35 years on
how to settle the problem short term at
least namely a two-state settlement on
the international border which everyone
agrees on with the phrase was minor and
mutual modifications that was us
official policy until the u.s. departed
from the world in the early seventies as
it did that's just overwhelming I mean
there was a Security Council resolution
in 1976 calling for a two-state
settlement the u.s. vetoed it and it
just goes on from there I'll run through
it but if you get till today was just
overwhelming agreement it includes all
the Arab states for a long time it
includes Iran the Organization of
Islamic states it includes Hamas you
know in fact everybody except the United
States and Israel so what has Obama had
to say about this well it's interesting
he has this great vision but if you look
if you go below the vision
take a look at the words it's a little
different so his only word so far the
two really one is to politely ask Israel
to stop expanding settlements well first
of all it's meaningless the issue is the
existence not the expansion of the
settlements but furthermore those words
were also meaningless he was quoting
bush in fact he was quoting Lee what's
called the road map the official
supposedly the agreed upon a scenario
for moving for he was quoting it okay
that's meanings but that's part of his
great vision the other part which is
more interesting was a few days after he
took office and He gave His one and so
far only a serious talk about Israel
Palestine that's when he was introducing
George Mitchell as his negotiator which
is a good choice if he's given any
leeway and Obama explained what he was
going to do he said well he said this
was his you know being very forthcoming
to the Arab world he said well there's a
constructive proposal on the table they
are peace proposal have people on the
head for producing it and then he went
on to say well it's time for the Arabs
to live up to their peace proposal they
should start normalizing relations with
Israel well you know Obama's literate
intelligent I suppose he chooses his
words carefully he knows perfectly well
that was not the arab peace proposal the
era peace proposal rhian dorst the
long-standing international consensus
and said in the context of a two-state
settlement the Arab states will proceed
even beyond to normalize relations with
Israel well Obama picked out the
corollary but omitted the substance
which is a way of saying we're going to
maintain our rejectionist stance
couldn't have been clearer and that's
what's happened with regard to his
repetition of the call to stop expansion
of settlements he did go a little bit
farther than not he but his
spokespersons and press conferences
they were asked is the administration
won't do anything about it and if Israel
rejects it and they said no it's purely
symbolic in fact explicitly said that
the administration is not going to do
what George Bush the first did George
Bush the first had some light taps on
the wrist if if Israel continued to
reject what the US was asking for a
Clinton pretty much we threw that and
Obama withdrew it totally he said knows
it's just symbolic well that's telling
Ben you mean nothing yahoo go ahead and
do what you like you know we'll say we
don't like it but the way a wink saying
yeah go ahead meanwhile we participated
you know we send you the arms the we
give you the diplomatic support on a
direct participation that's the vision
you know it could hardly be clearer now
what can we do about it well you know we
can get the united states to join the
world in this case it's literally the
whole world just accept join the world
and accept the international consensus
and stop the direct participation and
violating it I mean what Israel is doing
and it shouldn't sit what the US and
Israel are doing everything Israel does
is a joint operation they can't go
beyond what the US permits and
participates in so what the US and
Israel are doing in Gaza and in the West
Bank is destroying the hope of the for
realization of the international
consensus and there's no alternative
around I should say with regard to a lot
of the ante to propel you know its
supporters of the Palestinians in fact
some of the leading Palestinian
activists themselves are saying well we
ought to give up on the two-state
solution and just let Israel take over
all the territories maybe an ex them and
then there'll be a civil rights struggle
and like an anti-apartheid struggle that
can work like South Africa that's just
blindness that's not going to happen the
US and Israel are not going to permit
that
happen they're going to continue with
exactly what they're doing strangling
Gaza separating it from the West Bank in
violation of international agreements
and in the West Bank take over whatever
they want so take over the arable land
you know the nice suburbs of Tel Aviv
and Jerusalem happened to be in the West
Bank take over the Jordan Valley arable
land again take over the water resources
and build this salience running through
the rest of the territory that divide it
that break it up into Canton's with the
RAL char on the the author of the
policies the main author was honest
enough to call banner stands let's break
it up into that doesn't take any
responsibility for the Palestinians know
who I'm a graphic problem no Arabs in a
Jewish state no anti-apartheid struggle
no civil rights struggle and that's not
hypothetical that's just what we're
doing so yeah continue to do that that's
the alternative to a two-state settle
it's within reach you know greater
things than that have happened easily
but it's going to take a lot of pressure
we're going to take some questions from
the audience you can see the microphone
setup and as people go for that
microphone one last question as you look
out on folks here many young people many
students I was wondering if you could
reflect on your career at the moments
when you had to make a decision about
whether to take a risk that might risk
your position
or you're standing in some way when it
when you felt what you say to people
when it comes to issues of coverage well
you know I don't like to talk about
myself and it's not important but since
you asked a couple of times the first
time I mean I had been a political
activist all my life you know since
childhood when you talked about them I
understand and so on but with regard to
say the really doing something say
coming involved with the non-existent
anti-war movement the first time was
around 1962 you could see what was
happening in 1962 it wasn't really
concealed and I decided to try to get
involved in organizing anti-war activism
no that's not it wasn't risky but it
meant giving up a lot you cannot put I
don't have to tell you you can't put one
toe in this if you get into it it's a
full-time occupation you 1956 you went
to MIT your GP 55 I forget what year it
was but it wasn't a consideration in
fact it may be odd for you to think
about but MIT in the 1960s I had two
interesting characteristics one was was
almost entirely funded by the Pentagon
in fact I was in a lab which was a
hundred percent funded by the three
armed services to it was the main center
of anti-war resistance I'm not talking
about
a dissenter you know protest I'm talking
about resistance you know organizing
resistance activities illegal activities
and the Pentagon didn't care much
because contrary to what a lot of people
believe one of the main functions of the
Pentagon is just to provide a cover for
the way the economy functions the way
the economy functions is you know people
like to claim it's a free market economy
but you know most of it comes out of the
state sector I mean computers internet
airplanes you know the idea is the
public is supposed to pay the costs and
take the risks and if anything works out
you hand it over to private enterprise
that's called the free market and the
way when it's when the economy was
mainly electronics based the Pentagon
was the cover so you know you got to do
this because the Russians are coming but
they actually didn't really care what
you were doing I mean this is an
interesting story anyhow so yeah maybe I
was tendered maybe not but it didn't
matter the I got involved in 1962 and
what that meant so like if I'd give a
talk in a church which I sometimes did
it would mean for people you know the
minister the organizer a drunk who
walked in off the street and a guy want
to kill me that was a talk in a church
and that went on for a couple of years
the net the only really risky step are
you suggesting the anti-war movement
during Vienna was mainly alcoholic all
right don't tell David Brooks in 1966 in
1965 I tried to organize a friend of an
artist friend of mine since died try to
organize national tax resistance well we
got somewhere so that's taking sort of a
mild risk but in 1966 there were the
stirrings of an effort to organize more
serious resistance did you not pay your
taxes I didn't pay my taxes for years
but what you know it's I mean there's a
the how the IRS reacted is kind of
interested in my case of course they can
get the money good salary took it I got
a nasty letter from them from some
computer but in some cases they randomly
as far as I could tell they you know
they took people's houses people who
went to jail and so on so there's a kind
of a risk associated with but a more
serious was supportive direct resistance
support for resistors deserters and so
on and so forth and that began around
1966 became public in 1967 and that did
carry potential penalties I mean
actually my wife we had three kids she
went back to college after 17 years
because we expected I probably end up in
jail and it came pretty close I mean
that I was a trial was announced in 68
which I was the main defendant I was
saved as were others by the Tet
Offensive the Tet Offensive came along
in January 1968 and it convinced the
business world in the united states that
the US should that this was just
becoming too costly are you charging the
charges were conspiracy to resist the
draft or overthrow the government or
something or other the conspiracy trials
are kind of an interesting story i could
talk about them but but it was real you
know if it hadn't been for the Tet
Offensive you probably spent a couple
years in jail but did you go through the
trial the trials were called off right
after the Tet Offensive there was one
that was underway but this mock trial
where they picked all the wrong people
but and that it was
overturned on appeal but mainly because
the Tet Offensive I mean the business
world just said look out in fact what
they did what happened in 1968 is that a
group of so-called wise men you know big
shots from Wall Street and so on went
down to Washington and basically gave
the president marching orders it was a
very real power play that Johnson was
told stop the bombing of North Vietnam
don't run for office again and begin
negotiations and start to withdraw and
he followed orders to the letter then
Nixon came along and did a different way
but the visible escalation of the war
declined visible I say because some of
the worst atrocities were in 1969 and
then it went off to Cambodia and Laos oh
it was even worse but that was kind of
invisible still is but it kind of
tempered at that point and one of the
things that was done was golf the trials
because there was an effort on the part
of the government to sort of make peace
you know make peace with students that
was an interesting story too but that
ended the trials but yeah that was that
was risky and other civil disobedience
is it's so fun you know how many carats
say it's risky so maybe it may store
beaten or something like that spent a
couple days in jail but not the
pleasantest experience but it's not kind
of risk that this isn't stake in other
countries you know but yeah but that
that's the kind of decisions you have to
make you just can't become involved part
time in these things it's either serious
and you're seriously involved or you
know you go to a demonstration and go
home and forget about it and go back to
work nothing happens I mean things only
happen by really dedicated diligent work
I mean we're not allowed to say nice
things about the Communist Party right
that's not a rule but one of the reasons
why the New Deal legislation worked you
know which was significant you know
just change the country was because
there were people who were there every
day whether it was a civil rights issue
labor rights issue organizing anything
else they were there ready to turn the
mimeograph machines no internet
organized demonstrations they had a
memory you know the movement had a
memory which doesn't have now now
everyone starts over from fresh but it
had a kind of a tradition a memory that
people were always there if you look
back it was very heavily Communist Party
activists well you know that was
destroyed and it's one of the lack of
such a sector of dedicated committed
people who understand that you're not
going to win tomorrow you're going to
have a lot of defeats and there'll be a
lot of trouble you know and a lot of
things will happen to you that aren't
nice but if you keep at it you can get
somewhere that's why we have us out of
civil rights move
someone have the microphone thank you
very much professor Chomsky I had the
pleasure to listen to you when I was a
graduate student many years ago and I
happen to be in town I'm glad to listen
to here today some years back before he
died Bob McNamara wrote a book the fall
of war actually saw a movie and and he
also drew some lessons from the war what
is your assessment of lessons of Vietnam
how effectively do you think we as a
nation are applying them today and what
would you change based on that well yes
I'll tell you what I think and what I
wrote back in nineteen seventy which I
still think but I have to tell you I'm
like a minority of one so it's no
consensus opinion the left doesn't like
it the right doesn't like it nobody
likes it the only people who liked it
what i was saying then was the business
world because i was basically repeating
what they were saying what they were
saying around nineteen seventy part of
the reason for telling johnson you know
call it off is they recognize that the
u.s. had already won the war i mean if
the left doesn't like to hear that
because they like to hear you know
people united can ever be defeated and
so on and so forth makes you feel good
actually the peace movement the anti-war
movement had an effect I mean it saved
the society from total destruction which
probably would have happened so it did
have an effect but the u.s. achieved its
major war aims and had done so by by
around nineteen seventy if you look back
at the planning we have a detailed
record of internal planning from the
Pentagon Papers and later releases the
goal of the war was not to conquer
Vietnam that's a viet nam's of no
particular interest of the United States
that could fly off the face of the earth
and the US would have cared Eisenhower
tried to build up some support for the
water by talking about the 10 and the
and so on but those so marginal it
didn't matter what they were afraid of
is what a very consistent feature of
policy right through US policy but you
know Imperial policy generally it's a
policy that for the public is called the
domino theory and then when it doesn't
work you kind of laugh about it but it's
a real principle so it's never changes
now what you ought to call it is the
Mafia principle international affairs is
run like the Mafia very much like it and
the Godfather does not accept
disobedience it's too dangerous you know
even if some small storekeeper somewhere
who isn't paying protection money you
can't accept that I mean if he doesn't
pay protection money and gets away with
it you know the next Kyle stops are
increasing the whole system control the
roads so what you do is you send in your
goons not just to get the money which
you don't care about but to beat them to
a pulp so everyone else gets the idea
you know you don't disobey orders that's
the way International Affairs runs
pretty much Cuba's a case in point you
ran today is a case in point and Vietnam
was very clearly a case in point the US
was concerned that Vietnam might move
towards successful independent
development which could be what planners
called a virus that would spread
contagion well care about Vietnam but if
the contagion spreads to Thailand and
especially to Indonesia which really had
rich resources that would be dangerous
then the system's control starts to fall
apart and what they were really
concerned about was with John dower
leading Asia historian called the super
domino super Domino is Japan if
Indonesia the rest of Southeast Asia
began to move towards independent
development Japan would accommodate was
the word that was used Japan would
accommodate to an independent developing
South and Southeast Asia
and would become its technological
center and it's a commercial center and
so on that would mean that the United
States had lost the Second World War
it's not a small thing the second world
war in the Pacific was fought in large
measure to prevent Japan from
establishing what he called a new order
approximately what I just described well
United States and 1950 wasn't ready to
lose the Second World War and that was
the main reason for supporting the
French reconquest of the colony and by
the late 60s it was evident that Vietnam
is never going to be a model for anyone
it will be lucky if it survives and by
1965 the contagion had been stopped you
got a virus that spread contagion what
you do is destroy the virus and
inoculate the targets well that was done
you take a look at what's happening in
the 60s brutal dictatorships were
instituted in all the surrounding
countries okay that inoculates them no
virus the virus was destroyed by the
late 60s in 1965 the most important
country Indonesia there was a coup
Suharto coup killed maybe a million
people mostly landless peasants
destroyed the only mass political party
it was greeted with total euphoria in
the United States England and Australia
they just couldn't contain themselves
you know gleam of light in Asia New York
Times and so on they knew it was
happening you know staggering mass
slaughter a gleam of light and Asia
nothing secret but it was recognized
that and they opened themselves up the
Western exploitations it was all
wonderful in retrospect McGeorge Bundy
who was the national security adviser
for Kennedy and Johnson in retrospect he
said he thought we really should have
called off the war in Vietnam in 1965
because the main result
it had already basically been one after
the Indonesian coup and going on was
just too costly for ourselves so it was
a dumb thing to do anyway that was my
feeling then and it's pretty much my
feeling now the lesson that we ought to
learn it there was a split in American
public opinion very sharp split very
visible in the early 70s between a lead
opinion you know newspapers Harvard
faculty so on on the one hand and the
general population on the other not the
anti-war movement the general population
a na lead opinion particulate opinion
and I even read so it's easy to document
the most extreme condemnation of the war
was that it was a mistake which proved
to be too costly okay that's about as
far as you can go along the public about
seventy percent in polls said it's not a
mistake it's fundamentally wrong at mr
okay it's a very sharp and significant
split and i think the lesson we'll learn
is that to bring it to today that say
when obama is praised for opposing the
war in iraq because he thought it was a
mistake we should recognize that to be
on a par with the Nazi generals after
Stalingrad you thought that the two
front war was a mistake issue isn't
wizard a mistake it's whether it's
fundamentally wrong a tomorrow well
that's the lesson that has to be drawn
that's what the public probably already
understands but we have to do something
with and organized with just say one
thing there's this quote that I've been
trying to find out who said it I think
back on my life over all the times I
thought I went too far and I realize now
I didn't go far enough I don't think
Noam Chomsky said that
that's a good quote we will have to stop
here professor Chomsky has other
engagement but I would really like to
thank for search on ski and miss Amy
Goodman for joining us today
