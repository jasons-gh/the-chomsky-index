the United States and Russia are
co-chairing a meeting in Vienna today of
the 17-nation International Syria
support group aimed at easing the
five-year conflict according to a recent
report by the Syrian Center for Policy
Research
the death toll in Syria has reached
close to half a million people nearly
twice the number counted by the United
Nations a year and a half ago when it
stopped keeping track of the numbers
killed because of the datas
unreliability just last month President
Obama announced the deployment of 250
more Special Operations troops to Syria
and a move that nearly doubles the
official US presence in the country
Syria is only one of a number of ongoing
conflicts in the Middle East last year a
record 60 million people around the
world were forced to flee their homes
becoming refugees well for more on these
conflicts from Syria to Iraq to Yemen
and the u.s. role in the ongoing
violence we continue our conversation
with the internationally renowned
political dissident linguist author Noam
Chomsky he's written over a hundred
books most recently who rules the world
Noam Chomsky is Institute professor
emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where he's taught for more
than half a century I began by asking
him to talk about the conflict in Syria
Syria is spiraling into real disaster
virtual suicide and the only sensible
approach the only slim hope for Syria is
efforts to reduce the violence and
destruction to establish small small
regional ceasefire zones and to move
towards some kind of diplomatic
settlement there are steps in that
direction also it's necessary to cut off
the flow of arms as much as possible to
everyone that means to the vicious and
brutal Assad regime
primarily Russia and Iran to the
monstrous Isis which has been getting
support passively through turkey through
to the illness or front which is hardly
different as just the al Qaeda affiliate
technically broke from it but actually
the old Qaeda affiliate which is now
planning its own some sort of emirate
getting arms from our allies Catherine
Saudi Arabia Iran the CIA is arming them
we don't know at what level its
clandestine as much as possible cut back
the flow of arms the level of violence
try to save people from destruction
there should be far more support going
simply for humanitarian aid of those who
are building some sort of a society in
Syria noted notably the curves should be
supported in that effort
these efforts should be made to cut off
the flow of jihadis from this places
where they're coming from and that means
understanding why it's happening it's
not enough just to say okay let's bomb
them to oblivion this is happening for
reasons some of the reasons
unfortunately are that we've we can't
reverse the US invasion of Iraq was a
major reason and the development of
primary reason and the incitement of
sectarian conflicts which have now
exploded into these monstrosity that's
what are under the bridge unfortunately
though we can make sure not to not to do
that not to continue with that but it's
a we might like it or not but Isis the
ISIS or whatever you want to call it
does have popular support even among
people who hated the Sunni popular much
of the Sunni population of Iraq and
Syria
evidently regards it as better than the
alternative something which at least
defends them from the alternative from
the Western countries the flow of jihad
is is primarily from people young people
who are who live in conditions of
humiliation degradation repression and
what's something decent wants some want
some dignity in their lives wants
something idealistic they're picking the
wrong horse by a large margin but you
can understand what they're aiming for
and there's plenty of research and
studies Scott eight Rijn others have
worked on this and have plenty of
evidence about it and those conditions
alleviating and dealing with those real
problems can be a way to reduce the
level of violence and destruction it's
much more dramatic to say let's carpet
bomb them or let's bomb them to oblivion
or let's send in troops but that simply
that makes the situation far worse
actually we've seen it for 15 years I
just take a look at the so-called war on
terror which george w bush declared
actually reading clear reagan had
declared it but Rheda cleared in 2001 at
that point terror what jihadi terrorism
was located in a tiny tribal area near
the afghan-pakistan border where is it
wheaton so and since then we've been
hitting one or another center of what we
call terrorism with a sledgehammer
what's happened each time it spreads but
now it's all over the world it's all
over Africa Southeast Asia South Asia
everywhere you look take the bombing of
Libya which Hillary Clinton was strongly
in favor of one of the leaders of
smashed up Libya
destroyed a functioning society sharp
the bombing sharply escalated the level
of atrocities by a large factor
devastated the country left it in the
hands of warring militias opened a door
for Isis to establish a base spread
jihad ease and heavy weapons all through
Africa and fact into the Middle East
last year the according to UN statistics
the worst terror the world was in West
Africa Boko Haram and others consider
considerable extent an offshoot of the
bombing of Libya that's what happens
when you hit vulnerable systems with a
sledgehammer not knowing what you're
doing and not looking at the roots of
where these movements are developing
from so you have to understand the the
situate understand where it's coming
from where the appeal lies what the
roots are there were often quite genuine
grievances at the same time try to cut
back the level of violence and you know
we've had experience where things like
this worked that takes a ir8 terrorism
it was pretty severe they've practically
murdered the whole British my cabinet at
one point as long as Britain responded
to IRA terrorism with more terror and
violence
it simply escalated as soon as Britain
finally began incidentally with some
helpful US assistance at this point in
paying some attention to the actual
grievances of Northern Irish Catholics
as soon as they started with that
violence subsided reduced people who had
been called leading terrorists showed up
on negotiating teams even finally in the
government happened to be in Belfast in
1993 it was a war zone literally I was
there again a couple of years ago it
looks like any other city you can see
ethnic antagonisms but nothing terribly
out of the ordinary
that's the way to deal with these issues
incidentally what's happening in Syria
right now is horrendous but we should
useful to remember that it's not the
first time if you go back a century
almost exactly a century at the end of
the First World War there were hundreds
of thousands of people starving to death
in Syria proportionally but proportional
of the population it's likely that more
Syrians died in the first world war than
any other belligerent Syria did revive
and it can revive again we'll continue
with Noam Chomsky the world renowned
political dissident linguist and author
his latest book who rules the world
