you're a very radical defender of his
speech but what about incitement to
racial hatred do you think that this
would be tolerated do you think that
given she hopes past want to tolerate
expressions of anti-semitism isn't that
a form of insult of the dead and what do
you reply to those who say never again
in Belgium I guess my position is
considered radical in the United States
is considered conservative yeah I'm
taking the position of the US Supreme
Court you know how can you be more
conservative than that one of the good
things about the United States my values
and I would like to hope that there will
be other people's values too
free speech is a speech is really
protected incidentally that's not
historically true this is another
example like slavery and homosexuality
and so on
there's allusions that freedom of speech
is guaranteed by the Constitution famous
First Amendment but if you read the
First Amendment it doesn't guarantee
freedom of speech and in fact throughout
American history it has not been
interpreted as grant as guaranteeing
freedom of speech in fact the history of
protection of freedom of speech in the
United States is extremely interesting
for one reason because it's reached the
most advanced level there and it's
reason the first you know the court that
law is basically what the courts decide
not what's written on paper and the
first freedom of speech cases came to
the courts in the 20th century and the
famous early judgments that people hail
was great progress word ascents descents
in the creek Supreme Court cases and
first of all and secondly they were very
weak so the dissents still permitted the
kind of repression of speech that would
be considered intolerable now fact won't
go through the details but it wasn't
until the 1960s which is pretty reason
that the courts reached a high standard
of freedom of speech
and it's interesting to look at the
cases they're very revealing the first
case involved the civil rights movement
Martin Luther King and the civil rights
movement in judging in their favor in a
libel suit of the courts struck down a
law that almost every country has and
that the u.s. had the laws of seditious
libel which make it a crime to assault
the state with words basically that I
was struck down in 1964 that means
expands the notion of freedom of speech
was defending the civil rights movement
the next major case a couple of years
later was defending the Ku Klux Klan the
most racist violent the murderous
organization in American history it
defended them and it established an even
higher standard of freedom of speech
namely that speech should be free up to
participation in imminent criminal
action so if say he and I go into a
store and he has a gun and we intend to
rob it and I say shoot that's not
protected that's action in that speech
in participation and imminent criminal
action well that leaves a degree of
latitude but that's the basic principle
frankly I think that's the right
principle actually that's a principle
that was enunciated in any Lightman
Jeremy Bentham and others and it's
taking a long time to reach it in my
view that's progress it's progress as in
the case of slavery homosexuality and
subjugation of women and it's virtually
unique well it going to should what
about I should say that this high level
of protection of freedom of speech is
almost universally accepted with regard
to ourselves so for example not far from
here there are August institutions like
United Nations General Assembly and
Security Council where there's constant
incitement not just the racial hatred
the extreme violent action based on
demonization of people and cultures in
fact there's incitement to the most
extreme form of crime namely what the
nuremberg tribunal called the supreme
international crime of aggression
constant incitement to that and
demonization of those necessary to to
create as monsters to be destroyed
furthermore that same goes on in the
newspapers in common and current
discourse and so on and there's no
effort to try to stop that in fact if
you stopped it you'd close down all the
newspapers and academic publications
it's all over them it's extreme excite
incitement to hatred to violence to
externa bout incitement to racial hatred
is very narrow it does not apply to the
major cases we should think about that
should incitement to racial racial
hatred be tolerated no shouldn't be
tolerated nor should incitement to war
be tolerated or all sorts of other
speech should not be tolerated but
there's a gap the crucial gap between
not tolerating something and granting
the state the power to determine what
speech is legitimate or even worse to
determine what our historical truths I
don't think we should grant the holy
state the right to decide what history
is and to punish deviation from it and
to decide what kinds of statements are
legitimate and what kind aren't I don't
want the state to have that problem that
power I so note sure don't tolerate it
but don't grant the state the right to
determine what's acceptable and to
punish it that's a critical gap which
unfortunately is not made clear in
Europe I'm afraid what about an insult
to the dead say Holocaust denial I mean
the worst form of insult of the dead
that I can think of is to adopt the
missiles of their murders gurbles and
stalin would be delighted with the that
guy solo on France you know which is
allegedly trying to protect the memory
of the dead it's not it's insulting them
you don't insult the memory you don't
honor the murdered victims of the
Holocaust by adopting the Nazi doctrines
that is the doctrine that the state does
have the right to determine historical
truths and other legitimate expression
to punish deviation from it actually I
just had a personal note one of my
closest friends died a couple of years
ago was Israel's leading civil rights
activist civil and human rights activist
Israel's aha as some of you may know he
was a survivor of the Warsaw Ghetto and
bergen-belsen somehow survived made it
to Israel became the leading figure in
defense of human and civil rights
Palestinian rights and women's rights
homosexual rights and so on he was quite
respected in Israel he was selected for
honors on Holocaust day one day a year
they picked a Holocaust victim his
conclusion from his experiences was yes
never again for anybody not just for me
but for anybody so that kind of thing
shouldn't happen to anyone not just to
me and my friends that's the right kind
of conclusion to draw I think from these
horrible repression now I don't know
Belgian law so maybe I'm wrong but I
would guess that if I stood up right now
and said here that King Leopold didn't
kill ten million people at the Congo he
only killed five million or if I said
that the Belgian government didn't
purposely murder Lumumba and throw the
Congo into total disaster
including what's happening right this
minute and namely the worst atrocities
in the world have being carried out with
the cooperation of multinational
corporations in eastern Congo so that
you can have cellphones if I were to
deny that I doubt that I'd be brought to
court you can tell me if I'm wrong I
suspect that that's considered good and
that's that's that's pretty serious now
these are some of the worst crimes in
modern history and they reach right to
this minute they're going on right now
while we're talking in eastern Congo
which the worst atrocities in the world
all traceable to these activities very
recent activities well that again
illustrates the Very's that give many
other examples these selectivity reveals
extreme hypocrisy if there was time I
would go through the very interesting
history of how Holocaust denial became a
crime in fact just briefly speaking at a
time when it was possible to save
Holocaust victims to save survivors
there was almost no interest in doing so
I explained it if you like
years later when Holocaust victims could
be exploited as justification for
persecution of others then it became a
big issue that's exactly what troubled
people like Israel shot
