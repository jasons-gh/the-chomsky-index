situation by Bob Marley this is
democracy now democracynow.org the war
and peace report i meani goodman with
democracy now Zarin mate' we're talking
to Noam Chomsky professor emeritus at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
has written over a hundred books is just
returned from Norway and Iceland his
latest book 911 was there an alternative
as the Palestinian Authority launched
its bid for statehood recognition at the
UN last week the Obama administration
confirmed it would veto any statehood
measure that came before the Security
Council this is State Department
spokesperson Victoria Nuland it should
not come as a shock to anyone in this
room that the u.s. opposes a move in New
York by the Palestinians to try to
establish a state that can only be
achieved through negotiations so yes if
something comes to a vote in the UN
Security Council the US will veto and
President Obama has affirmed this Noam
Chomsky your response well unfortunately
it's quite consistent with past practice
list of u.s. vetoes at the Security
Council to protect Israeli aggression
occupation is huge the most recent one
which actually got some attention
because it was so outlandish was less
februari when Obama vetoed the Security
Council resolution endorsing official US
policy we looked the resolution its core
part was opposing expansion of Israeli
settlements in the West Bank that's
supposed to be US policy Obama vetoed it
if if the Palestines do bring the issue
to the Security Council in the USB does
it it will be just another indication of
the real unwillingness to permit a
settlement of this issue in terms of
what is has been for a long time and
whelming international consensus and
this goes back a long time the first
relevant us veto was in january nineteen
seventy six thirty five years ago the
major Arab states so-called
confrontation States Syria Egypt Jordan
brought a resolution to the Security
Council calling for a two-state
settlement on the international border
and then the resolution incorporated the
basic wording of you n 2 42 which
everyone agrees at least in theory is
the basic security council document
called for a recognition of the rights
of every state in the region that would
include Israel new Palestinian state to
exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized boundaries wording
approximately like that US vetoed it
another veto in 1980s similar resolution
long series since of them things shifted
to the General Assembly where they're
almost annual votes with numbers like
150 2 3 and so on us Israel sometimes a
Pacific island ill solve the door and
this is just continuing right up to the
present they're pretty ugly ones to the
US has blocked ceasefire efforts at the
time of Israeli attacks in fact Obama
himself you take a look at his wife she
still has it been in his website prior
to the election there was a section on
the Middle East and it's worth looking
at it gives you an indication of what's
been happening since it's full of you
know adoration of Israel you expect that
practically not a word about the
Palestinians few phrases saying maybe
they should have some rights but that
was right in the middle of the latest
israeli invasion of lebanon 2006 brutal
murders invasion without any credible
pretext to go into that
actually the fifth such envision and
Obama took pride in his webpage and
having co-sponsored a Senate resolution
right in the middle of the invasion
insisting that nothing be done to impede
Israel's attack in Lebanon and that the
US should censure and maybe sanction
anyone who tried to interfere with it
Iran and Syria so they must be able to
go on to achieve their objectives at
killing a thousand Lebanese again
destroying a large part of the country
and so on that's Obama when he he during
that after he was elected Israel
attacked gaza major attack on guys early
december two thousand a degree through
january 2009 obama was I'm sure your
listeners are familiar with that
horrible atrocious attack the United
States blocked efforts at the Security
Council to establish a ceasefire to end
the atrocities Obama was repeatedly
asked would he say something about it
his answer was there's only one
president I can't say anything about it
it was saying all sorts of other things
but not this I know I should his known
campaign a few minutes on I want to cut
you up to get in a few more questions
actually one last question okay if we
have time which is that you've written
about what it would mean for Israel and
the u.s. if this statehood bid is passed
at the UN and of course this debate is
coming up very soon scheduled to take
place of General Assembly in the coming
weeks what would it mean if the UN
passes statehood for the Palestinians
well that's really up to us to decide I
mean it could be there could be a very
harsh reaction on the part of the United
States and Israel that Congress US
Congress has already declared that it's
going to
cut off funding was cut off funding to
the Palestinian Authority Israel
controls much of their funds through
control of customs and transfer of
Finance so they all go through Israel
they could cut it off the Palestinian
Authority Palestinians could be in very
serious finet economic trouble financial
trouble if the US and Israel acting
jointly react by to any kind of
statehood bid by simply cutting off the
funding on which they rely it's a Israel
for decades as presented prevented any
independent development series economic
development and the territories there is
the numbers show economic growth that's
highly reliant on outside aid very
artificial and that could be a very
serious blow to the Palestinians the
role that Egypt plays will also be
significant especially with regard to
Gaza my guess is that some kind of
compromise position will be worked out
which will provide enhanced observer
status to the Palestinians at the United
Nations may be short of what would
trigger a US and Israel from simply
pulling out the rug from under their
survival no we have to leave it there we
have to leave it there for the global
show but we're going to continue and
