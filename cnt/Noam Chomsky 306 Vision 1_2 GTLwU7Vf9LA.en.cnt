welcome back from time to time on 360
vision you'll see in-depth interviews
with some of the true vanguard of our
time they will guide you through some of
the complexities of our coexistence and
maybe shed some light on faith
spirituality and how it all fits Noam
Abram Chomsky was born in 1928 in
Philadelphia Pennsylvania the son of a
Hebrew scholar he is currently a
professor of linguistics at MIT but
Chomsky is best known for his radical
political views his beliefs have earned
him both a large following of admirers
as well as many detractors 360 visions
Barry's wicker sat down with the
controversial political thinker to
discuss faiths politics and the
relationship between the two welcome mr.
Chomsky thank you for joining us would
you or do you consider yourself a person
of faith I try not to have faith I
believe in a principle that was
enunciated rather well by Bertrand
Russell which is that you should try to
keep away from having irrational beliefs
you should believe some things that for
which you can find some evidence or some
support apart from commitment to
principles like equality and freedom and
justice and so on those I wouldn't say
that's faith as there are things you're
committed to but as far as beliefs about
the world reality my feeling is one
should try to as much as possible have
substantiated beliefs or at least
beliefs through which evidence could be
appropriate well then would you consider
yourself paradoxically a person who has
faith in the scientific method I think
it's the only method we have to try to
get some approximate understanding of
the world I don't have faith that it'll
reach the truth or even that it's
leading us in the true direction in fact
as someone committed to the scientific
method I'm also committed to its
consequences
among them are that you and I and the
rest of the species are organic
creatures who have our specific
capacities and limitations and we simply
don't know and have no reason to believe
that these capacities are such that we
can gain the truth about the world we do
our best but that's the most we can do
but there people would say that you
cannot have moral principles unless you
adhere to a faith if I attribute those
principles to a divine creature who I
define as ordering me to have those
principles the principles don't become
any more better established so that's a
useless step it's true that our moral
principles are not firmly grounded in
unshakeable of evidence and argument but
nothing is going to make them any more
firmly grounded as for having a
meaningful life that seems to me
irrelevant no people who have meaningful
lives with faith and without faith now
could Americanism be fairly
characterized as a religion I would call
Americanism or Italian ISM or Russian
ISM or anything else totalitarian
doctrines no one should have any in fact
these doc notions like that are only
used in totalitarian states so for
example in the Soviet Union the old
Soviet Union dissidents you know rather
than people like that were condemned as
being anti Soviet in under the neo-nazi
generals in Brazil people who condemned
their horrifying policies were
criticized as anti Brazilian on the
other hand I mean if a book called the
unate aliens appeared in Italy referring
to people who criticize Italian foreign
policy let's say that people would just
laugh and ridicule maybe under
miscellaneous
and the reason is that these are
totalitarian doctrines they identify
state policy with the country and its
society and its culture and that's not
done by people of any conception of
freedom actually there's a long history
to this notion goes back to the Bible in
Kings one King Ahab condemns Elijah who
was seeking justice and freedom he
condemns him as being a Hebrew phrase or
arias or L that means roughly someone
who hates Israel or troubles Israel
something like that
he's anti-israel because he is seeking
justice and freedom and that's the
origin of the concept and it has an
inglorious history from King Ahab right
through the Soviet Union and up to today
and we should avoid it at least if we
want to identify ourselves with the
ideals of Elijah and not King Ahab if
your concept of America is that it
should be a violent destructive racist
state that seeks to achieve the ends of
those in power by any murderous or other
means that it has and that it's quite
happy to have say 30 million people
hungry and 40 million without health
insurance and so on if that's your
concept of America then yes you should
call Martin Luther King an American you
should call the people who won the
struggle for freedom and human rights
and labor rights and women's rights
should call all of them on American on
the other hand I would call people who
regard America that way as people who
hate America that's their conception of
America they're free to have it but it's
not one that I'd want if by America you
mean the people who have in for the
actions and the people who have in fact
won a quite remarkable degree of freedom
over the centuries in fact beyond any
other
country that I know not buy a gift but
by constant hard struggle and dedication
and I have achieved at least some
measure of justice and want more and who
are opposed to the aggression and
violence if that's your conception of
America fine then I'm pro-american but
there's no there's no answer it depends
which America you mean it's like King
Ahab again if your concept of Israel is
King Ahab's concept then Elijah is aunty
Israeli if your conception of Israel is
Elijah's concept and a hab hates Israel
but there's no answer you take your
choices
