what do you think in the issue of
climate I don't know if you've paid
attention to the Democratic debates at
all but it's it's come up very few times
and I mean some of the questions that do
get asked are so trivial
I believe Greta term Berg is now
advocating for media outlets to refuse
advertising dollars from fossil fuel
companies do you think that would make
much of a difference in terms of the
coverage that climate change receives
probably not unfortunately yeah for one
thing to the same I mean that could only
happen first of all if there was a
serious understanding of the urgency and
scale of this threat without that it
wouldn't happen and if you had that
understanding you wouldn't need I mean
the fact of the matter is there should
be the screaming headline everyday in
the mainstream press about the fact that
we're going off a cliff and we're not
doing much about waiteth on burgers
trying to get them to say I mean after
you probably listen to her talk at the
25-minute talk very eloquent very
accurate lots of details exactly very
well said
but what can you say about a world in
which the sixteen-year-old kid has to
lecture the great figures of the world
on their failure to address a threat
that within not very long this one
undermine organized human life we have
to listen to the 16 year old kid to tell
us
yeah it's um there has been in the past
decade a global rise of the far right
and it comes at just about the worst
possible time during this what's deemed
a make-or-break decade for climate
change the El Paso killer the the white
nationalist who wrote a manifesto before
the shooting mentioned environmental
catastrophe and this has come up among a
lot of far-right figures now and they're
worried about mass migration they have
slogans like you know save bees not
refugees are you worried at all that if
we don't do anything there could be some
kind of rise of what's sometimes called
eco fascism I mean I said there's plenty
to worry about about the far right I
don't think this is a no-go not as much
more to worry about about the mainstream
that what you said before about the
democratic debates which incidentally I
I'll admit I don't watch but I read
about them which I said is quite
accurate I mean they're focused on
impeachment for the crime of having the
president and heavy and tried to harm
the leading figure in the Democratic
Party that's the focus of the
impeachment that he the Trump used his
office to try to get the government
Ukraine to find harmful material about
leading candidate in the Democratic
Party that's the issue the big issue in
the world incidentally does that remind
you of something do you recall an event
called Watergate sure it was Richard
Nixon charged with well there were
efforts by several congressmen one was
improper treinen priests from
Massachusetts to include in the articles
of impeachment some of the Nixon's
the lake the bombing of Cambodia for
example horrifying wall knocked out the
only issue was left was that Nixon sent
some petty thugs to break into the
Democratic Party that's the big issue
with Richard Nixon big issue with Donald
Trump is it's mine after two by two
private party candidate and there that's
the lead issue that the Democrats are
focusing them right which incidentally
will almost certainly turn into a gift
to trunk you can predict senators
obviously exactly rating he'll parade
was with a triumph we the people finally
managed to undermine and the deep state
the traders are trying to destroy the
presidency I could make up propaganda
easily so it's very much like the imelda
report it's predictably and predicted
was going to be a gift to trump
so is this that's what we focus on
not his edit not exposes of global
warming which are gonna destroy that we
barely Nord and the practices will
occasionally if it's kind of interesting
to watch to read the coverage and the
best newspapers in the world you know
four times at London financial time and
really serious newspapers just take a
look at their coverage of fossil fuel
emmissions euphoric the United States
just passed Saudi Arabia and producing
fossil fuels that's great now we have
energy independence well we don't have
other countries impeding our policies
the fossil fuel industry is investing
more and profitable fossil fuel
extraction long detailed articles
try to find the word global warming
those articles I mean sometimes you read
about environmental problems so long
article in The New York Times but their
best correspondence to different Ravis
Trump's expansion of fossil fuel the
exploration the United States and there
is a mention of environmental problem at
one point he says that more drilling and
what they'll mean for fossil fuels may
harm the local ranchers whose water
supply may be affected is that the big
problem I mean it doesn't they will know
about it it's not as if there's any lack
of knowledge just as the CEOs of the big
banks know as much as we do about the
threat of global warming while they pour
funds and do fossil fuel extraction
including the most dangerous of them
like encouragement
this is if some kind of schizophrenic
I'm gonna do the one hand we know that
we're destroying the possibilities for
human life and then the other has our
brain we can make some more money
tomorrow again it's pretty hard to find
words to describe
