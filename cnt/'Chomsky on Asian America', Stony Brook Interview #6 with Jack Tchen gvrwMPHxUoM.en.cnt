hello my name is Jack Chen I'm a
historian at New York University and I'm
delighted to be interviewing Noam
Chomsky today we will be discussing
Asian American and Pacific Islander
issues both in terms of the growing
numbers of asian-americans and Pacific
Islanders in the United States and many
of them are at our college campuses but
also especially focusing on issues of
race its relationship to foreign policy
intercultural kinds of questions and
also questions of philosophy and
education so so no I was you know I
thought it'd be useful that maybe
contextualize a little bit you know I'm
sure at MIT but certainly at NYU and
places like Stony Brook here there are a
lot of asian-american students and many
of them are coming as you know the
children of recent immigrants Korean
Americans have a term for it 1.5 is 1.5
generation and it's my understanding
that also you're you you could be I
don't know if you would consider
yourself that way but in many ways
you're the child of immigrants and you
spoke do you speak Yiddish and parents
refused to let us speak Yiddish okay
that's for different reasons however
that's because there was a in the Jewish
immigrant community that was kind of a
cult or Kampf going on at the time
between Yiddish Diaspora oriented and
Hebrew in Palestine oriented around my
parents were on that side of course
there was other whole groups that just
wanted to drop it all you know right all
right so you spoke Hebrew that my I was
it I didn't actually speak it but it was
in a Hebrew culture okay yeah learned it
right right
well one of the interesting questions
about being a 1.5 or is that people have
some insight about more than one culture
they're immersed in a family culture and
also community oftentimes a community
culture which has its food ways
languages still immersed in that
of very different oftentimes immigrant
you know experience and then they're
also engaged with various aspects of
kind of the dominant US culture and so
it's a part of what I think is very
interesting now about Asian Americans
who are in this country is that they're
kind of negotiating that Korean
Americans in particular I've talked
talked about being caught between
cultures but it seems to me that that's
also a resource of special insight
really critical insight about the
cultural difference and and how cultures
operates and what the norms of different
cultures are I'm wondering if that's
something that that bends over much how
its treated I mean it can be a way of
enriching a society in a culture or or
it can be abandoned many immigrant
communities have tried to suppress and
abandon their traditional routes and
Americanized themselves and I remember
that very well and childhood in fact
went in both directions my parents were
really transplanted immigrant community
happened to be here but my generation
was trying to Americanize itself in
every way could you
was there something of an idea of an
American dream and and within the other
matter of learning baseball statistics
and making sure you were as like the
other kids you know and even more more
so than they were at the same time
keeping to you know going hebrew school
in the afternoon and so on and so forth
so it's kind of two parallel universes
which was pretty common of jewish kids
back in the 30s and the 40s right i'm
wondering if that's uh the reason for
that was there was plenty of
anti-semitism it was rife so you just
wanted to you sort of wanted to keep
your identity not too visible so on the
one hand you wanted to kind of become
american in terms of identifying
identifying with baseball like the cool
part of the kids on the street right
there I kind of want to share with you
maybe a few people that I've been
working with and because I think their
experiences in some ways embody the
tension of being caught between
different cultures and also clearly what
happens in Asia has affected them deeply
here but it's also a process of
discovering what those meanings are last
night at the event I met a man who is in
his 50s he's Filipino America his father
was in the Philippines supportive Marcos
he himself was drafted during the
Vietnam War and fought in the war and
started dealing with the fact that he
wasn't kind of a mainstream American in
the sense that soldiers were American
soldiers are starting to threaten him in
: racist names so he he was telling me
that he not only had to kind of watch
out who was in front of him but also
watch behind his back that's one story
the other story is a PhD student of mine
who's Vietnamese and she was just
finishing up a PhD a couple years ago
when it was discovered that she had
ovarian cancer and it turns out that a
lot of Vietnamese children who came over
and she says she's South Vietnamese now
could be chemical workers were affected
by a doc since yeah and that it's
affected the children even though they
may have been quite young when they left
in a profound no there's still new cases
gonna come on yeah from new children
born well after the chemical warfare was
terminated actually the extensive
studies of it but they can't be recorded
here or they won't be they aren't
reported at least many of them done by
American public health specialists it
was just a conference and I know I a
couple of months ago in which a leading
us researcher who's concerned with
dioxin did report an extensive study
that they had done comparing dioxin
it's only in South Vietnam that they
didn't use it in North Vietnam so kind
of ugly but they have a control
population the he just compared the
levels of dioxin with levels of spring
and of course it coincided closely we
also found that dioxin levels were
hundreds of times as high as what's
permitted here in heavy spraying areas
actually Columbia University just
published a unit in the epidemiological
Center I just published a study in
Nature you know the British science
journal a couple of weeks ago in which
they discovered that the actual use of
these chemicals was about 50 percent
higher than what was reported yeah so
and there's extensive studies of the
effects there's new cases coming along
it's kind of ended here there's
virtually no mention of it which is you
know you don't pay attention to your own
crimes right you know it's what's
interesting about these two examples but
also there are many more that we could
go on and on is that these are people
who have been deeply affected by war
violence u.s. foreign policy when they
come here they're also racialized in
very particular ways they oftentimes are
from our coasts or South Vietnamese and
came you know with the support of the US
but then in this country they're they're
kind of treated in though they're that -
both and especially the Philippines
because goes back a century but the
Philippines were very deeply colonized
I mean to the extent that sense of
identity was lost in many respects and
they have to kind of recover what they
have to learn what happened
Viet Nam's more complex because more
recent and many different currents and
so on but I'm gonna take even sport for
Marco's I'm in the u.s. it was a brutal
corrupt dictator the reagan-bush
administration not only supported him
but expressed what they called their
love for him and there is they admired
his love for democracy a George Bush
Senior and so on and that went on up to
the practically that day when the
military turned against dude I mean
there was a what they called people's
power movement which kind of spread over
much of the country and what the
military was really powerful was
pressing at one point it was about it
was around March 1984 if I remember the
military turned against him and the
Reagan administration instantly turned
against it and they said yeah we support
the democratizing forces but so and then
they became a tee markers so people like
that are caught in a very complicated
situation in which they grew up with the
support of the United States supporting
a dictator and part of the dictatorial
system but then became quickly on the
other side with policy shifted almost
overnight and of course the racial
element is just constant no matter
what's right right the Vietnamese case
is complex if this is a South Vietnamese
woman she was probably you know South
Vietnam was split there was a u.s.
client regime with its own supporters
and there was a popular movement that
was opposing it in the south so it's
kind of like France during the German
occupation
I mean Vichy France at playing a
supporter I was running the country
pretty much by itself with the Germans
in the background the resistance had
plenty of supporters that in fact after
the war
were pretty serious reprisals thousands
of people killed so that's that's pretty
common in countries that are colonized
part of I think the challenge of Asian
American Studies and that perspective
that brings to let's say American
Studies in American history is that you
have people who have migrated here who
come out of these experiences and
obviously people don't necessarily
critically reflect on their experiences
some of them are escaping and just kind
of trying to assimilate in a culture it
as quickly as possible but in their
backgrounds and it was interesting about
this Filipino American man is that he
didn't really think about his identity
even after having been in Vietnam and
having had the experiences he had until
he had grandchildren and then he began
thinking about what was he gonna tell
his grandchildren what what identities
what did we know about Filipinos well
such as not much right because it was
wiped at a colonial experience virtually
like them I mean it was kept in some
circles of course but for much of the
population it was just expressed many of
the Filipinos that I work with talk
about the absence of presence the
absence of presence and part of the
challenge of doing the kind of
educational and historical work they do
is to try to try to make something
tangible and real because it's all been
wiped out the archives are gone the
stories are kind of suppressed people
don't talk about this true everywhere
men take say Korea as South Korea is
becoming democratized it's also bringing
up memories of things that happened
earlier which had been suppressed like
the Jeju Island Massacre which was never
discussed for years but now it's a big
issue on the island the conference that
every year that are trying to admit
spreading through the population what
happened none of these issues it gets
suppressed for a long time actually I
noticed this number of places I happened
in Europe I happen to have gone well I
did go to both
and Greece shortly after the
dictatorships were overthrown and young
people just had no idea what the
background was I mean if he years later
it's beginning to come out but if you
talked about you know what happened in
Barcelona and 1939 I mean I remember it
vividly but only people my age knew same
agrees talk about the Greek Civil War
people my age remembered but hadn't
talked about it for years because she
just couldn't talk about those things
and their children didn't know so you
have to kind of recover a history which
is not that far back in these cases
saimin you know one of my students was
taking one of our courses and was
reading a history book and and there's a
reference to it I think was a Bruce
Cummings history and Chiodo was
mentioned and she suddenly realized that
because her family was from chaid Rideau
and her grandfather had disappeared and
died at a certain point that was what
had happened is that you know it's a
very powerful insight but the family
itself didn't talk about it no
connecting up but I mean I remembered
from my own childhood my parents never
took that Eastern Europe actually my
mother was too young but my father was
there till II was 17 but it was just one
of those things you didn't talk about so
part of the the kind of irony or
difficulty of being a migrant in this
country is that on the one hand you have
that family experience often times but
then it's also oftentimes erased or
ignore and some of these are all
different circumstances in the Korean
Filipino Spanish Greek case I mean it
was suppressed in the home country under
dictatorships and military rule
fascist governments and so on which may
adds an extra layer of difficulty to
recovering it has to be recovered in the
home country which is not so easy it
takes time you you write about the
necessity to develop a critical
comprehension for comprehension of
reality I guess part of what what's
interesting about the Asian American
experience is that the experiences are
not self-evident but as people begin to
look into their own family histories and
their own backgrounds this is where is
is that kind of what you mean by the
kind of work well it's yeah and it's
pretty it's there are a lot of specific
problems in the asian-american case and
that you know in complicated ways age'
has been at different parts of asia
depending on what year it is are
demonized in the in the united states to
an extreme extent and this goes way back
it course varies depends who the Allies
are who the enemies are but it's kind of
a generalized demonization of Asians
which isn't differentiated much in the
popular culture
even though it may be in policy which
just affects everyone on the one hand
will be a demonization of the bad Asians
but then there's always some kind of
group whether it's Chinese or Chapman
Japanese Americans are Chinese Americans
from one moment to the next or let's say
in South Vietnam
those were collaborators and therefore
the good news but you know I think in
the popular in the general popular
culture these differentiation joint
clear to people in fact it's important
to understand that the United States
itself is an extremely insular country I
mean most people don't know anything
about the outside world and they can't
distinguish who you're for and who
you're against I remember we take a
recent case one of the one of the major
Wars in the 1980s was nicaragua's that
they issue all over the newspapers you
couldn't miss it everyone though it's a
huge
well my wife and I were went down number
of times and Erica we had friends who
people who have college degrees
you know educated people who assumed
that we were visiting the Contras
the reason is that the u.s. supports
governments and they know we're these
kind of crazy types of funny ideas so we
must be visiting the gorillas you know
this is the lead issue and then
newspapers and they know which side the
US government was on just imagine if
people who don't even you know barely
know where Asia is they're trying to
sort out who are the friends and who are
the enemies more recently there are a
lot of Asian American students on
campuses the Stern School of Business at
NYU for example is 50 60 %
asian-americans among their students and
the representation is that from Asia or
from you know Asian Americans Asian
Americans many of them 1.5 hours yes
yeah and there's a popular
representation especially among
neoconservatives
of Asian Americans as kind of the model
minority used as a way to point to poor
African Americans and Latinos as well
these are examples of a minority and
they've helped themselves etc etc and
you know how would I mean how would you
understand that in the global context
that
I mean there are striking differences
they they didn't come from the same
experience as Latinas and blacks
the and they tenth of its kind of
reminiscent of the Jewish minorities
tend to be education oriented
hardworking quiet obedient and you don't
pay attention to the splits within the
community so you know who goes down to
the poor neighborhoods where Asian
Americans live but the ones who make it
to NYU
do come from a education oriented upward
oriented community so they can be you
know held as you say as a kind of weapon
against others why don't you do it if
they do it that's which puts them in an
especially difficult position for one
thing it's not representative of the
asian-american community well many of
them also come from backgrounds that's
in Korea where the the parents actually
enjoyed kind of american-style education
as it was instituted after the war yeah
in in South Korea same with Japan same
with Taiwan other places and so many
ways they're already very comfortable
with kind of western-style
education and oftentimes when they came
to this country they they sacrificed
quite a bit for their children because
they were at a higher professional level
and then they end up operating a
greengrocer in the case of many Korean
Americans all right your child goes to
NYU right now but the child goes to NYU
and it puts a lot of pressure as you can
imagine on the children too because the
parents are expressing a blow through
sacrificing themselves for the children
the children then feel that they need to
honor their parents in that love at the
same time they feel the need to become a
part of American culture straight you
know just strikeout to get some freedom
from that kind of authority many of
these parents are fairly authoritarian
coming from authoritarian
governments and cultures and cultures
yeah yeah so what would you say I mean
what would you say to some students
because you can't tell people that live
their lives
I don't give a dice to my own children
nah if I did they'd be smart enough not
to listen to it well how I mean maybe I
should ask it a different way which is
if they're if they're struggling to try
to understand some of that themselves
many of them will kind of work it out in
terms of this personal you know kind of
animosity or rebellion against their
parents but it seems to me that they've
really they've really come out of a
larger historical moment post-war put
post-world war two Asia wars in Asia and
they've got a difficult relationship
with this country and this culture in
many ways yeah that could turn out to be
more difficult because the conflicts are
simmering and could blow up again I mean
the potential us-china conflict is right
beneath the surface u.s. planners regard
China as a serious potential enemy
there's concern that the whole Northeast
Asia region might strike out in its own
it's a rich developing region and those
are likely to be they're gonna live with
those problems very likely they may take
a more serious form so I better figure
out ways of resolving them some
economists are projecting that in 2020
Chinese economy will be the same size as
the US economy if it continues to grow
obviously with the SARS incident
recently that's well sorry I actually I
think one should see as reflecting
another sort of hidden problem in China
and that is that the since the reforms
are no sort of market reforms have been
taking place the a lot of the socials of
the support system has collapsed so the
health system is pretty well gone
actually there's recently a study done
by a
a Harvard University group and Harvard
Medical School and the Beijing
University want some University their
medical school trying to see if they
could give a realistic analysis of
growth rates in China if they took into
account the loss of support systems so
if you lose your health support system
and you have to deal with it yourself
that's a cost and it growth declines if
you take that in so they try it it's a
tricky study but they tried to do an
estimate and you know their figures were
not impressive I mean it by their
analysis Chinese growth rates were very
low if you took into account the
collapse of pension system support
system health systems and so on and I I
strongly you know China is so secretive
it can't really figure out what's going
on very well and the statistics are
probably very dubious but it's very
likely I suspect that the SARS concerns
have to do with the collapse of a
preventive health system I mean whatever
one thinks about Maoist China it had
pretty successful health outcomes
actually there's it's interesting the
way this is dealt with here the the main
person who's studied the economists have
studied the famines and Social Policy
and their effects as a march assent won
the Nobel Prize for this work the very
important work half of his work is known
the other half which is in the same
papers is not known what his main
studies he and his colleague John dres
compared China and India which is good
comparison I mean they're both colonized
became independent same time late 40s
and they were sent you know different
countries large pockets yeah it's
similar in many ways levels of
development so on well he he
one of his main contributions was
studying the main that terrible Chinese
famine and 1958 to 60 when maybe 20
million people died big you know
terrible famine and he treats that as a
political crime basically an ideological
crime it's not that the senator wanted
to kill people it's that they didn't get
any information totalitarian society you
don't get a flow of information up and
back and simply didn't know what was
happening and no critical commentary and
they couldn't do anything about in India
he points out which is a capitalist
democratic society they did get
information so there were flows of
information up and back and criticism
and so on in India never suffered any
such famines after the British were
kicked out there are plenty of them
before but since independence and had a
major famine and this is the well-known
part of Amartya Sens work shows how
awful the Communist story take a look at
the same papers and the other half of
the paper it doesn't different analysis
it compares mortality rates in India and
China since independence well in China
they went way down because they
instituted rural health programs and
barefoot doctors and preventive medicine
for the huge overwhelmingly rural
population in India they did they
followed capitalist principles you know
do anything for people to do it on their
own well turns out that the death rates
in India declined much more slowly and
if you look at the gap well I'll just
quote their own conclusion what they say
is every eight years India put as many
skeletons in its closet as China did
during its years of shame meaning during
the period that they studied 1947 to
1979 as a hundred million extra deaths
in India well that's pretty serious and
that's also they treat that as an
ideological crime to comes from
government policies you know you could
have carried out preventive medicine and
rural health care and so on but they
didn't with that half of this
is unknown unreported when Sen got his
Nobel Prize I don't see a single mention
of it and it's hard to miss it's in the
same papers you know the same books but
it doesn't fit the requirement so that's
our ideological crime or I can fit our
ideological requirements anyway going
back to China that system has been lost
and in fact their studies Senate dress
goes a little beyond 79 and they say
that at the very beginning of the reform
period 79 the death rate started the
decline slow you know whether that
continues I don't know but if these
facts are taken into account get a
rather different picture and I strongly
suspect that the Soraa said that
epidemic has to be looked at in that
context and there is concern that if it
spreads to the countryside where the
health support systems of virtually
collapsed that could be a catastrophe
yeah part of what you're pointing out is
that usual indicators of economic
developments don't take into account
people's well-being health care and
there is an effort was done by a hawk
and Sen and others to and it's now part
of the UN program to construct an annual
Human Development Index which is
different from the growth index and that
it's takes into account a few things
like I think literacy infant mortality
maybe one or two other things and if
countries are ranked in human
development it looks quite different
from the economic growth the growth is a
very funny notion you know there's much
to do with most of the population right
and effect take Chinese growth the
Chinese China's growth statistics are
very high but to be serious about it you
have to ask how much of it is foreign
owned growth right and it turns out if
you look at the real growth areas of
China plenty of its foreign investment
overseas Chinese Japanese US others it's
also very urban as opposed to more
that's very very leaves death most of
the popular
like 900 million people out there who
may be devastated if the big question
now in the world trade system is whether
China is going to agree to open its to
open its economy to agricultural imports
from the United States and Europe well
these are highly subsidized
technologically advanced agribusiness
exports which no peasant society can
possibly compete with they want the
subsidies they don't support and so on
so I'll be wiped out right but that
means hundreds of millions of people
will be you know destitute what happens
to that they'll become dependent on
these other words just as the economy
does what about the producers and the
peasant agriculture happens to be highly
productive and very effective but it
cannot compete with subsidized high tech
agribusiness that's very possible the
same things happening in Mexico right
the and in fact all over the world you
know peasant communities are being
devastated by the fact that they can't
although they may be highly productive
and they are in fact very often when
scientific agriculture is it school
comes into some third-world area that
production actually declines because
peasant agriculture which is the product
of centuries or millennia of development
the study you know the selection I mean
picking the developing seeds and so on
and so forth
turns out to be really productive I mean
people know you know this seeds you
plant under this rock because the Sun
hits in the afternoon and so on and so
forth that's all gone when you have
scientific usually monocrop of
Agriculture furthermore peasant the
peasant agriculture of tradition though
it's very rich is unknown the reason
it's unknown it's a it's a women's
culture because from where the daughter
so you know in the right in the society
people don't know what it is the
daughter knows what it is because
mother taught her you know and it
develops over long periods extremely
rich and extremely fragile if you
eliminated it's gone well there's also
the move of let's say US corporations to
take let's say certain varieties of
basmati rice from local and the
plantations and foot to modify them
slightly force them back under
subsidized exports which destroys the
peasant society actually sometimes it's
more brutal than that I was in southern
Colombia not long ago where in fact
chemical warfare is going on they call
it fumigation but it's just another form
of chemical warfare now what it's just
doing is destroying peasant communities
I mean it's driving peasants off the
land these again are rich at traditional
peasant communities with highly
complicated and rich agriculture but
it's an extremely fragile system one
generation is enough to kill it it's
closely connected to the in Colombia it
turns out very rich biodiversity so it's
all integrated with that but the via
diversity is also being destroyed by the
chemical warfare and other operations
and you know you drive the peasants off
the land by what's called fumigation
they joined them several million people
rotting in urban slums mining companies
come in and strip-mine the mountains
once the these are indigenous people
come ceno's afro-american
afro-colombians ones there a way that
mining companies can come in freely the
drilling companies come in you can put
up dams you know flooding big areas for
hydroelectric power for you know what
they call free export zones foreign
industries and the peasant society is
gone the lot of the biodiversity is
destroyed you end up with you know
violent a tremendous violence as you'd
expect there's about 20 political
assassinations a day by now and then as
far as the agricultural areas are
concerned what either the alternative
ranches for
cavalry or anything or else monocrop
agro-export using the months out the
genetically modified seeds which will go
them somewhere no and the creation of
shantytowns and he's extended early and
if you go after the urban areas and so
in fact the people it's it's it's like
many countries some of the people most
of the lot of the the wealthier part of
the population is completely unaware of
it I mean I've had Colombian students
who learned about Colombia when they
came here and they heard people you know
like me you know those giving talks
about and they went back it's oh yeah
that's the other corner of town I mean
you know it's plenty of people in
downtown Manhattan like you know who
know what's going on in a mile away
right what do we know about the homeless
but it's not just a home was the way
people live I mean I've you know walk
through parts of Manhattan which look
like this some of the worst parts of the
third world you just don't see him it
doesn't the same in Boston same
everywhere
I mean my own children you know didn't
see it really a poor person in a serious
sense till we happen to take him to hunt
at once and they were kind of shocked
they know people lived like this well
the fact they live like this just a
couple of miles away from where we live
but who sees that right we recently were
doing some teachings around in Indonesia
and looking at the obviously Indonesia's
where the largest is the largest Islamic
you know nation in the world but also
it's clearly a kind of a an ongoing hot
spot in terms of us conglomerate and
global conglomerate interests so there's
gas and oil there's also the natural
resources of the forestry and their
indigenous which is a devastate and it's
being destroyed actually but most by
Asian exporters Thai
others are just wiping out the forest
illegally you know for their woods for
the woman in cheek would something like
that it's illegal but no but now
Indonesia has laws about it but nobody's
enforcing them and that can have out
that's kind of like the destruction of
the Amazon you know it's very dangerous
there being so it a pure one and other
places like that in the name of kind of
being able to have middle-class access
to litter but there's that kind of a
background there which is also it's it's
amazing that it's well striking that
it's not known here I mean the the
United States relations to Indonesia are
pretty complex Indonesia was a central
focus of us tension back in the late
1940s in fact Planning Commission's
called of the major issue in Asia in
1958 is kind of a it's public
information but nobody knows it the u.s.
carried out the the Eisenhower
administration who carried out the
largest clandestine and subversive
operation in post-war history to try to
destroy Indonesia to break it up to
separate the outer islands they
supported a military revolt to strip the
outer islands away from Indonesia the
outer islands were most of the wealthy
resources the reason was that the
Indonesian government was becoming too
independent was pillar of the
non-aligned movement which dissipated
and also to democratic the Indonesian
government of sort of an autocracy was
allowing a political party of the poor
to function and it was picking up
support if you look at that now be
classic Declassified US records they
were very concerned about that they
thought they were going to get dominant
support within a quasi democratic
political system so therefore that
system had to be destroyed and there
were there was attempt in 1958 to split
it up by force that didn't work u.s.
then turned to supporting the generals
by 1965 there was a military coup
support the coup which killed them
nobody knows but maybe a million
in the couple of months you know
hundreds of thousands certainly a huge
massacre a CIA called it the one of the
worst mass murders of the 20th century
comparable to Stalin and Hitler it was
greeted with complete it was reported
accurately pretty accurately I was
greeted with total euphoria I mean the
Time magazine had a an issue she had on
the front cover something like boiling
blood baths and then it just reveled in
this wonderful massacre of hundreds of
thousands of people I mean it mostly
landless peasants destroyed the one
political party mass based political
party and opened the country to foreign
robbery for an investment after that
General Suharto ranat compiled one of
the most grotesque human rights records
in the world he was held here as a
wonderful person Clinton administration
described them as our kind of guy they
invaded East Timor with enormous US
support
Carter administration and since wiped
out maybe a third of the population
they're pretty much depressed you know I
mean figure it out if he looked but
almost nobody knows and that goes right
on till 1999 finally the u.s. Suharto
lost his usefulness
he began dragging his feet on IMF orders
and he was sort of losing control of the
population there was popular revolt
brewing a lot of it by students actually
a lot of it using the Internet so one of
the first internet revolutions because
they could communicate around the you
know the official system by 1998 the US
was giving up on support though they got
a phone call from Madeline Albright
Secretary of State saying the u.s.
believes it's time for a democratic
transition four hours later he resigned
no it's not caused an effect but it does
reflect the power relations try to find
some comment here asking why they hadn't
had a democratic democratic tradition
since 1958 well no that's part of
history wipe out
why did what
by the euphoria about one of the biggest
massacres and it's in the 20th century
which is it's only entirely open you
know it's well but you know all of that
and what it means is gone so when you
talk about in Tunisia yes a lot of
complicated things and it's a little
like the Philippines a lot of
Indonesia's no no that this exactly it
because there were 100 one hundred
thousand political prisoners you know
the major writers in the country were in
prison they couldn't nobody could talk
about it you know it's and it's you know
you have to recover your own history and
historical understanding and put it in
the context of world affairs which is
not so simple yeah a part of the pattern
of Asians in the u.s. has been when the
u.s. is involved in a foreign policy
intervention of one kind or another then
and in some cases it's people who were
suppressed and actually are important
intellectuals so you know coming here
but in any case arriving here and their
children settling here and arriving here
and then their children are really cut
off from any kind of understanding well
they were cut off in their own countries
because of the repressive regimes
sometimes really brutal ones when they
come here they find that history's going
they have to recover it but just like
young students here if they want to
understand anything about US history
they're going to have to discover it
it's not gonna be taught to them in
schools right we only have about five
minutes left but I thought it'd be
useful to talk about one holding a
little bit in this context because in
many ways he's an example of that he has
a very successful kind of motto minority
in a certain sense who who who came as a
foreign student married here had
children here became a naturalized
citizen became quite successful loving
mathematics really worked on nuclear
arms you know in Los Alamos but then
what happened to him in some ways I
think has been quite a rude awakening
for a lot of professionals Asian
Americans in this country
you know these racist and other factors
and often intermingled with political
internet international political
conflict are right below the surface
doesn't take much for them to emerge I
mean oh look there I wouldn't be if the
let's take a hypothetical situation
closer to me personally if the United
States turned against Israel
which it could there could be a major
wave of anti-semitism in the United
States hasn't existed for maybe 30 years
but 40 years but it could come back it's
all these things are barely below the
surface
well when the US spy plane got shot over
China yeah all of a sudden in this
country their boycotts of Walmart
because they're selling goods made from
China and boycotts of Chinese
restaurants and you know on suppose that
China does begin to take what looks like
an independent course there's a lot of
concern I mean the US military planning
is oriented towards a potential Chinese
threat so what's called missile defense
which is nothing to do with defense but
it's understood by both the Chinese and
by the US to be a first strike weapon
aimed at China not anybody else
yeah and of course quite a concern I
mean even if let's say Chinese Americans
were pro US and and didn't ever hear
about so what does pro u.s. mean I mean
in fact I'm Pro US but against the US
government
you know it's depends what you mean
think US is right that the population is
it the culture of the society state
policy and it's a very interesting
concept it's really nice totalitarian
roots this whole concept of
anti-american or pro-us and so on it is
presupposes that the society the culture
and its people should be identified with
state policy and that's something that
should be dismantled
you know so we're you a system I don't
like to use okay you know there are a
lot of Asian Americans who really come
out of more conservative backgrounds
they're supporting us point policy and
but they find the contradiction when
they're here in terms of their being
entirely vulnerable to to racism but
also feeling quite vulnerable I mean
many Chinese Americans believe that if
there was a war with China or China was
declared in excess of you could be and
they would have interned yeah just like
the japanese-americans yeah impossible
yeah I'm you know it's not gonna
duplicate it but you know the hysteria
over China has been extreme the Red
Chinese were the super demons in the
1950s all kind of fantasies concocted
about what they're planning to do to
Americans you know tournament the drug
addict so that particular thing was
particularly ironic because it's the
West that churned China into drug
addicts by force but that's been
forgotten
now there were fantasies about them
going to turn us into drug addicts and
that could easily come back just like
these stories about Hispanic narco
traffickers were stimulated and built up
in the late eighties mostly for domestic
and international political reasons it
doesn't take long some of these
populations are very susceptible to that
kind of propaganda it's worth bearing in
mind that for whatever reason I don't
know what the reason is speculate but
the United States happens to be a very
frightened society and has been for a
long time I mean actually goes back to
colonial history but in the modern
period it's dramatic I mean I remember
my own children in school background
early sixties being taught to hide under
desks tuck uncover you know protect
themselves from atom bombs which are
going to come from China probably Russia
or someplace there's no other I don't
think there's any other country in the
world would any kind of such lunacy took
place but it's a strain that runs right
through the culture and it's always
barely below the surface it's a large
part of the gun culture is based on that
I mean plenty of people really think
they need guns to protect themselves
from and you should see who they're
protecting themselves from other parts
of the country where people are
protecting themselves from the United
Nations which is sending black
helicopters over to carry out their
plans of the genocide of Americans or
aliens no this fear of aliens and of
course communists whoever the current
enemy happens to be but these are
strains that are just beneath the
surface and they can show up in very
ugly ways right okay we're going to need
to wrap up this segment but write it
open up for questions and and comments
so
um name is Charles Ehlinger I want to
ask if you could expand on two things in
China one being I understand that while
is a rapid growth it's going to
investors and the Communist Party
operatives but not so much to the
peasants to the extent that I've been
told that there have been some physical
uprisings in the country and that it
might actually be a forbearer of a
revolution this is according to a group
called China study in New York City and
then the other question would be I'll
move into Afghanistan and seems to be
people say we're trying to control oil
and perhaps other resources in that area
where does China fit in as far as its
needs for oil does it have its own
support or will it be possibly a problem
with America over control of that area
well what's going on in the interior of
China people really don't know much
about but there have been reports there
is there have been you know some
speculation that China might go back to
a period of mass peasant revolts mass
peasant revolts against the central
authority that's a large part of Chinese
history you know sort of quite big ones
it's conceivable because the peasant
population is in a serious situation a
lot of people being driven off the land
already they're becoming highly
exploited labor and very ugly
circumstances in the growth areas the
industrial areas which are split the
Chinese growth has benefited a large
part of the population but it is also
devastate it's a very large part - and
how this is gonna play out nobody knows
the big effect is likely if they open
themselves up to Agra ex-work from the
West the United States and Europe that
could lead to a very serious problem and
this decline of support services could
be pretty severe - so I don't think
these speculations are wild we don't
know that they could be happening
actually China has been carrying out
quite repressive policies in many areas
in this gets to Afghanistan including
the Muslim areas
in the in western China where there were
connections to things happening in
Central Asia even people moving up and
back and that repression which is pretty
severe has been supported by the United
States since number 11th September 11
that gave a kind of a gave a free rein
to repressive governments all around the
world to become more repressive so
Russia and Chechnya China and Western
China with authorization from Washington
now they call it counterterrorism but
that actually is a link I mean China was
involved in Afghanistan China and Iran
were involved in 70s against the
domestic more or less by the late
seventies Russian backed government as
part of their whole you know
international games even before the u.s.
got in serious like this sort of like
late seventies and the connections have
continued China has great interests in
Central Asia and naturally borders on
them and the the energy sources are a
crucial issue the US has always since
the Second World War
committed itself to controlling Middle
East oil because it's the main resource
in the world and it's kind of a leader
of world control on the other hand the
eastern Siberia has a substantial mainly
gas but also oil resources which China
needs and so to South Korea that's a
large part of the North Korean problem
is that it's right in the middle of all
of this these areas Russia because of
its eastern Siberian resources China a
big developing society with resources of
its own Japan and South Korea huge
industrial countries they're all
integrated and they could the resources
of the area could you'll independent a
degree of independence maybe high
independence then comes the question of
who picks up the you know the Central
Asian resources which are not on the
scale of the Persian Gulf but are
substantial so yes this is
these are major concerns for planners
and could be large parts of future
evolving policy it certainly as far as
Afghanistan is concerned and the u.s.
didn't go in there because it wants oil
there's nothing much in Afghanistan you
know they could use a pipeline but it's
a secondary issue I think too much it
was made of that the u.s. does want
military bases there and also in Central
Asia but that's because of Central Asia
and the Persian Gulf it seems a common
theme in an oppressive situation whether
it's in a family or whether in a society
is the the power of silence certainly in
a family unit if there's some type of
abuse going on or whatever there's that
strong network of keeping people quiet
and then it spills out could you talk
about the power of silence a little bit
is that from humaneness is that from a
societal thing where does that come from
well it certainly is pervasive I mean
the domestic abuse issue is a remarkable
example of it and I I didn't myself
annoying much about it until very
recently what happened to have learned
about it and I've just been shocked by
what I've discovered I mean in my own
town which is you know professional
educated relatively wealthy town
everybody's it turns out I've often
wondered what the police do in that town
there's nothing to do except chase lost
cats or prevent the black kids from
coming in in a dilapidated car there
kind of like a border police but it
turns out that they have two or three
cases a week where they're actually
called to you know by a 911 call that
gets them to a home for a domestic abuse
cases I would never guess that this
could have happened here
and yes it's silence and it silenced
within families the inside silence among
friends
have a close friend who happens to be a
radical woman lawyer who works in a
radical law office a lot of it on
feminist issues though one of her
colleagues was coming in Bruges and they
suspected that some problems taking
place we said nothing she was killed you
know so right in the middle of the most
you know sophisticated to conscious area
and I tell you I can remember that from
childhood to we said I was in the
immigrant community we happen to be the
only Jewish family in a mostly Irish and
German Catholic neighborhood it was the
1930s very anti-semitic this street life
for myself and my younger brother two
Jewish boys was a tricky issue you know
because because the anti-semitism was
extreme we never told their parents
about it
I don't think their parents ever knew
till their till they died and they never
knew what life was like in our own
neighborhood you just didn't talk to
your parents about those things and they
didn't talk to you about things and and
this is inside families you know closely
knit families when you go beyond well
you know the things we've been talking
about silence about the crimes stories
that aren't ideologically acceptable and
so on it's overwhelming in fact one of
the well as you know when the women's
movement began in serious a serious way
in the late sixties early seventies a
lot of it was just telling the truth
about ourselves okay you know let's face
the truth about our own lives because
we've been silent about it we talked
about it's just accept it as the norm if
you bring out what actually what your
life is actually like to yourself it can
be revolutionary
we we only have just a minute left
unfortunately but one of the quotes that
you refer to as John Dewey in your miss
education book and I'll just read it the
ultimate aim of production is not
production of goals or Goods I'm sorry
but the production of free human beings
associated with one another on terms of
equality could you just maybe end with a
few comments about that
well John Dewey it was the leading
American social philosopher was also by
our standards pretty radical I mean he I
think his positions correct
Bertrand Russell took very similar
positions and yes a decent education
ought to be creating free independent
creative human beings it doesn't have to
be developing them has to be allowing
them to follow those natural instincts
those are natural among children the
educational system has to beat it out of
them and make them obedient and
insubordinate and so on but a decent
educational system would be would allow
these natural aspects of human nature to
flourish and encourage them and it would
be part of developing a free and
democratic society of real participation
but of course that runs counter to elite
interests the worth remembering that the
United States was not founded to be a
Democratic Society and elites do not
want it to be a Democratic Society it's
supposed to be what political scientists
sometimes call a polyarchy
system basically of a league decision
and public ratification and if you had a
the kind of educational system that do
we spend his life committed to you
wouldn't be able to sustain that people
would become active involved engaged and
would try to create a truly functioning
democratic society which would as do we
also pointed out require industrial
democracy that means democratizing
production Commerce and so on which
means eliminating the whole structure of
capitalist hierarchy those positions
were well he's very mainstream Main
Street America but radical from the
point of view of prevailing doctrine and
I think he's quite right about that in
fact they're just to go to politics or
do he also pointed out that until that's
done unless that's done politics will
remain what he called the shadow cast by
business over Society and the
educational system will be a system of
indoctrination and control
I was lucky as a kid to be sent to a do
at school and I was quite a quite an
exciting experience on that note we have
to wrap up but thank you very much
