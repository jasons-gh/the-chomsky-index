let's shift to look at an international
focus and I wanted to look at
Afghanistan and Iraq and Pakistan but
beginning with Obama's recent proposal
on withdraw his discussion of
withdrawals very striking feature of the
whole debate about withdrawal I mean it
is being debated like Nancy Pelosi
doesn't like it then somebody else does
like it in some way else says it's too
fast there's one voice missing Iraqis
does anybody what Iraqis one now we know
what they want they compelled the United
States to accept the status of forces
agreement which the US didn't want that
struggled all the way to prevent it just
as it has struggled all the way to
prevent any form of democracy in Iraq
the u.s. tried to prevent elections when
it was forced to accept elections it
tried to subvert them succeeded to an
extent but not completely in fact when
the sofa status force agreement was
being debated the commentary in the
press was quite intriguing what was said
standardly is that the Maliki they hoped
was our man is giving in to popular
pressure he doesn't really mean it you
know if he's forced to appease the
public when he says you have to have a
time they will of course he doesn't
really mean it that's an interesting
concept like if suppose he was
responding to popular pressure but
that's bad you know i mean the hatred of
democracy is so intense and deeply
rooted that it's taken for granted that
if a political leader is responding to
the public and not to us was something
wrong and maybe he doesn't really mean
it so we can go on but he did mean it
and finally the i guess it was about
november two thousand seven the bush
administration laid out its conception
of the status of forces agreement which
was permanent basis give priority to
american corporations and oil
development exploration
what series of measures they're all out
of the sofa the US had to agree you know
what actually happened i think is that
it's it has been a tremendous victory
for non-violent master resistance for
the last six years a significant victory
I mean the US could kill insurgents but
couldn't deal with hundreds of thousands
of people in the streets and therefore
step by step it's backed off and of
course this is going to interpret it is
interpreted as a great victory but on
the contrary it means giving up the war
ends not and Obama's try to sustain them
to keep 50,000 troops there remains to
keep an occupation 50,000 account
logistics and so on you know pretty soon
you got a hundred thousand and then try
to hang on to what you can but Iraqis
have been very explicit about this now
maybe you can sort of be leadership over
the head so they'll say they're going
along in other words disregarding public
opinion but it's that's what the real
debate is or should be about and in fact
we should be saying nothing about the
rate of withdrawal it's not the role of
the aggressors to decide when to
withdraw when the Russians invaded
Afghanistan we didn't suggest it today
our decision should they were throw
faster they would throw slow lately
50,000 troops there I mean they have no
business being there okay so get out but
when it's us since tacit Lee we own the
world we decide and Iraqis literally are
not mentioned that read the discussions
not there so yes there's discussion
among sectors of power in the United
States as to try to finesse the the
demand of Iraqis so that we can still
get what we want it's extremely
interesting the way they see the way
this is put like I guess what maybe
something yesterday or two days ago The
Times had they had a kind of a monthly
report from Iraq by two leading
specialists Michael O'Hanlon and
kenneth pollack and they had their big
report and they were warning that the
situation in iraq is very unstable and
it's of enormous strategic importance
all of which is correct the truth is
sort of leaking out you can't talk about
you know the fake quorums anymore and
they they happen to say it as on the
side that if iraq collapse into chaos it
will be hard to pressure Jordan Syria
Saudi Arabia to make the hard decisions
required to accept peace with Israel now
that's a very intriguing example of how
ideological fanaticism with constant
media and public reiteration can
completely invert the truth with nobody
noticing there's no problem getting
Jordan Syria and Saudi Arabia to agree
they would be they agreed 30 years ago
you know i mean the US in fact had the
veto a Security Council resolution back
in 1976 that they introduced a calling
for a two-state settlement on the
international border and up to the
present it's the US that's blocking it
and has been for over 30 years of bala
himself has made it explicit that he
continues to block it but facts are just
irrelevant in an atmosphere of religious
fanaticism the religion here is just
state worship so it must be somebody
else is causing the problems even if you
know the facts are so crystal clear in
this case that could hardly be clearer
and a complex situation but it's
inverted so going back to the withdrawal
from iraq iraqi whatever you think of
the elected iraqi government they're
missing and the same strew in
afghanistan I mean recently there's been
very harsh criticism in the press of
cars I President Karzai at why is he
different than he was two years ago I
was a hero well yeah he's different two
crucial respect my first of all his
first message to Obama
just as I know remains unanswered is
that the US should stop killing Afghan
civilians well that's not appropriate
but his second statement was even worse
he called for a timetable who with all
the foreign troops well you know now
we're getting really intolerable so he's
now a bad guy you've got to do something
about him bypass him and so on but
that's true that's his position we don't
exactly know the details about public
opinion in Afghanistan but it very
likely as public opinion to the extent
that we know there's a substantial peace
movement in Afghanistan it's had you
know conferences Georgas brings together
large segments of the population they're
basically calling for an end to violence
and a move towards diplomacy they you
know they're not opposed to having
outside forces there if they're there
for reconstruction not destruction which
is quite a big difference the even in
the mainstream like foreign affairs the
establishment journal you can read harsh
critique of the idea that we have to aim
for military victory and recognition
that it's going to have to involve
internal reconciliation meaning with the
Taliban which is what a large majority
of the population want according to
Western run polls and also a regional
involvement meaning Iran you know Russia
India and so on all of China all of
which have interests and that's the
what's recommended by specialists like
happens to be Barnett Ruben and aqua
Rashid in this case with many others
well Obama's going the opposite
direction military victory increasing
military force and again Afghan voices
though not unknown are not part of this
discussion so in this sense it's like
your act
you
