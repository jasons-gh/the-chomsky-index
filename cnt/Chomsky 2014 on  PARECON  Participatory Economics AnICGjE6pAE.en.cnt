so a nuclear war and environmental
catastrophe you argue the global society
must be reorganized so that care for the
Commons becomes a very high priority as
it has been in traditional societies
quite often you make similar conclusions
in an essay from that summer reflecting
on the importance of the efforts to
defend gezi Park in Istanbul which you
frame as being part of a struggle in
which we must all take part with
dedication and resolve if there is to be
any hope for decent human survival in a
world that has no borders how do you see
the possibility of thoroughgoing social
transformation and the devolution of
power taking place in the near future
through the emergence and sustained
replication of workers and community
councils as in the participatory
economic model or Paragon for example
that's well worked out detailed proposal
for one form of democratic control of
popular institutions of social economic
political others and it is particularly
well worked out and extensive detail
whether that's the right form or
something other I think it's literally
to tell my own feeling is that fair
amount of experimentation has to be done
to see how societies can and should
function I a little skeptical about
possibility of sketching it detail in
advance but that certainly should be
taken very seriously along with other
proposals but something along those
lines seems to be a prerequisite for
official for reasonable just reasonable
life put aside the environment just the
way a society ought to work with people
in a position where they can make
decisions about the things that matter
to but also I think it is a prerequisite
for survival at this point I'm the human
species is reaching a point which is
unique in human history I'll just take a
look at species destruction forget
humans a species destruction now is at
the level of 65 million years ago when
an asteroid hit the earth and destroyed
the dinosaurs and a huge number of
species massive species is George that's
being replicated right now under human
units of the asteroid and we're on the
list not for
