[Applause]
of course there's a voice and many
voices that you will recognize today and
one of them is the news director who was
covered Nicaragua Mexico especially East
Timor and now very much Haiti WBA is own
news director Amy Goodman
when I was in Haiti in 1985 in 1986 and
1987 1988 covering elections covering
massacres covering bodies on the streets
covering journalists being killed
covering the absolute negation and
denial of the democratic impulses and
struggles of the Haitian people
throughout all those years there was one
man and one name that I heard about that
I saw that I recorded it's almost 10
years now he's the leader of the largest
peasant movement and Haiti is mostly a
peasant country you know about the
illiteracy rate there you know about
much about Haitian history it is the
peasants that are the backbone of the
struggle for democracy have always been
in the forefront for a democratic and
pluralistic Haiti there's nobody like
him and it's our pleasure today he's
come right from Haiti to be at this
event
siobhan Jean Baptiste
before I introduce the other very hard
worker who has been working for Haiti
and many other progressive causes I'd
like to thank many of the WBAI staff who
helped us organize this event including
Louis Henry Sibyl Wong summary marksman
on Oh Friedman many volunteers who
helped us this afternoon and throughout
the week day bursting is here and now I
want to introduce Laurie Richardson who
started working in us on this idea of
weeks and weeks ago she is with movement
base on Popeye in Boston so from Boston
to New York we organized and telephone
called in conferenced and she went to
Washington they did an event there we've
been trying to help each other all the
way along because Haiti is so important
so it is my great pleasure to introduce
the other co-sponsoring organization
here and the other co-worker on this
wonderful event and I'm so glad so many
of you have turned out and that is
Laurie Richardson
it's really great great to see everyone
here today in order to dialogue with a
very distinguished panel and to talk
about what lies ahead not only for those
of us that are working on democracy
human rights and economic justice in
Haiti but increasingly all of those
issues that have relevance here in the
United States we of the movement pays on
popeye education and development fund
are very happy to be here this afternoon
to present the event to you along with
WBAI the nation Institute and new
channels Communications we're an
organization that was born in 1990-91
after one of the members of the peasant
movement of pop I Bosley Jean Baptiste
who's seated right over here and who is
an agronomist with the MPP and Chevron
Jean Baptiste brother was blocked out of
Haiti after the coup d'etat and as
activists in Boston talked about how to
make the US public understand what was
happening in Haiti and what the US
government was doing the MPP Education
and Development Fund was begun our
mission is to link efforts for
structural change in Haiti and in the
United States because as we well know
the same struggle that's being waged in
Haiti is a struggle that we are waging
here in the United States we link up
activists in the United States whether
there are people working in the labor
movement people working in the student
movement people working on human rights
people working on issues of US policy we
link them up with their counterparts in
Haiti we monitor events in Haiti and we
work to pressure the US government to
change its policy but we're pretty clear
that that's a long struggle and so in
the meantime one of our major foci is to
bring the voice of Haiti's popular
movement up to the United States the
voice that's too often absent from the
debate in the United States about what
US policies should be what the impact of
US policy is the popular movement in
Haiti has been active
since 1986 it burgeoned it brought down
the Duvalier dictatorship it refused in
the years after 1986 to accept duval yer
ISM without Duvalier it was responsible
for the election of Haiti's first
democratically elected president
president jean-bertrand Aristide and its
resistance was the key to president era
Steve's return even if his return did
not occur perhaps in the way that the
popular movement would have envisioned
as we'll hear more about this afternoon
it was the resistance of Haiti's people
and their popular organizations that
forced the international community in
the United States to have to resolve the
question and bring president Aristide
back to Haiti in October of last year
one of the other activities of the MPP
Education and Development Fund is to
facilitate the exchange of technical and
material resources between the community
in the United States and the popular
movement in Haiti and that is not only
material support but also political
support because as we'll be hearing this
afternoon the voices and as I've just
said of the peasants of the workers of
the students of the women of people in
marginalized communities too often don't
make it up here and it's our
responsibility as US citizens whose
government is so involved in Haitian
history to act to counterbalance that
and one of the ways that we can do that
is not only to provide material support
but also to provide political support
without further ado I'd like to turn
over the program to this evening or this
afternoon's moderator that is Miss Amy
Goodman which has already received a
wonderful introduction who I've had the
opportunity and the pleasure to be with
in Haiti and I'm very happy to introduce
her to you today miss Amy Goodman
I want to thank everyone for coming
today it's nice to know there's someone
on the other end of that microphone when
we wake up in the morning because
valerie has introduced the speakers for
today I just thought I'd share two
experiences very briefly before we go to
our first speaker it was my time in
Haiti I'd gone down to Haiti when
president Aristide was returning and in
the last few days as we've been
preparing for this event and at the same
time some of the motives and some of the
people who may have been behind the
Oklahoma bombing have been becoming
clearer I've had a very strange
experience of a kind of coming together
of the two situations Believe It or Not
the Oklahoma City bombing and Haiti
right after our steed returned there was
a large demonstration against the US
forces in Haiti because of their close
relationship with frappe and how they
were working with the Haitian armed
forces and frapp the paramilitary
organization there there were many
Haitians who were Joe are you okay
there were many Haitians who were
protesting this relationship in a place
called pitty guav and guangwu about an
hour outside of port-au-prince after
this protest I went to ground guav to
meet with the Special Forces where they
were stationed to find out about their
relationship and how they perceived
their relationship with the people with
the armed forces and with frappe and I
met one commander one one of the
soldiers in the Special Forces trained
particularly in counterinsurgency and
after discussing a few things on Mike
and on the record after I closed my mic
he started to really talk he brought me
up to the second floor of the Haitian
military barracks where his office was
he closed the door he took out a stack
of papers there were 89 pieces of paper
each of them a membership application of
a member of frat with their photograph
and their full family history and what
they did he said these are the peep
we're working with when I asked him
about lava loss and Aristide he muttered
communists stone communists and then I
asked him about what he was doing there
then if that's since he was coming back
to shore up our steed and he said that's
a good question he said what these
people are about and what that guy and
the palace is about is redistributing
the wealth expropriating property and
tyranny of the poor getting something
for nothing he talked about the frappe
and the military there as people who had
businesses landowners people who had
something to lose he had told them he
said to stay in their houses he had said
they did not disarm them as long as they
didn't take their weapons into the
streets he had said they were the first
group the frappe that he had come that
he had met with ingrown guav that yes
the Haitians who were protesting were
right because he said they were the only
organized responsible group and he
showed me as proof the membership
application as each of each member of
frappe he then went on to talk as the
Sun was going down to rail against the
one-world government
the Socialist World Bank and he got
angrier and angrier as he talked about
the lack of direction in America today
and how he would be leaving the military
because precisely because of what he was
doing in Haiti and he wanted that to
stop and said he would continue to work
with the forces he was in Haiti I said
how many others of the soldiers you work
with there was a group a dozen of them
feel the same way you do and he said
eleven of the twelve well certainly the
Haitians in that area understood it he
said that the leader of the lava loss in
that area was in the next town there was
a priest there who's armed who only had
half an arm and he said the leader of
the lava loss is that asshole with a
Bible under his stump that's how he
viewed the overwhelming majority of the
people of Haiti he called them Street
ship continually as he talked about them
said they were unemployed and they were
students and they would take whatever
they could get
and as this whole week has unfolded with
the Oklahoma bombing I could only think
back to this man as they describe the
people possibly involved with the
Oklahoma bombing disgruntled military
men well trained in explosives and use
of weapons and I keep thinking of the
soldier in grogg love the other
experience leads right into today which
is the day after era steed returned era
steeds return was quite an anticlimax
for many people in Haiti he returned on
a military jet came in spoke behind
plate-glass spoke behind bulletproof
glass the people very far in the
distance kept away from the palace very
different from his inauguration day when
he actually washed the feet of peasants
in the palace to show his connection to
the people of Haiti it may well have
been a disappointment to him but it
certainly was a disappointment to the
people of Haiti as they came out in the
thousands to greet him but were kept far
away by the US forces well the next day
after Era steed returned we went out on
a five-hour drive to hench following
Siobhan Jean Baptiste one of our
speakers today who was returning to his
home after years in exile during the
coup as we drove out we were coming just
over a hill before we arrived in hench
and before us were more than 10,000
people who had streamed out who had
walked for many hours some more than a
day to cook greet this leader of the
peasant movement of Popeye a man who had
been working to bring down baby doc
Duvalier trained hundreds of peasant
organizers over the years had to leave
because of the coup and now was
returning the Haitians could touch
siobhan and they came out to do it and
as he came in a caravan with Basel a
Jean Baptiste and other supporters they
crowded around him they shouted they
danced and they sang and this was the
kind of homecoming that I think many had
hoped would be the scene for our steed
but he had been surrounded
by US forces and shavonne jean-baptiste
wasn't and that's the kind of support
that Siobhan has out in the countryside
because of his years of working with the
peasants in Haiti and so we very much
look forward to hearing from him today
as he's just flown up to address this
group and to go around the country to
talk about the situation in Haiti right
now when you won't see described on the
front page or even the inner pages of
the New York Times but before we go to
Siobhan and to Noam Chomsky who will be
wrapping up this program today we're
going to turn first to Allan Nairn
a journalist well known to many of you
who's been working in Latin America for
the last 15 years most recently when
working on Haiti returned from a
five-week trip there as Valerie said
he's just recently won the George Polk
award in the James Aronson award for
social justice journalism for his three
part series on Haiti in the Nation
magazine the first one being occupation
Haiti predicting what the occupation
would look like the second being just as
he revealed the connection between the
fraf and immanuel kant's tal who headed
up this Haitian paramilitary
organization that has so terrorized the
Haitians over the last few years and the
CIA and other intelligence agencies
within the US government so without
further ado Allen there
thank you
both Valerie and Amy mentioned the the
Oklahoma City bombing and one thing
that's that's very striking about that
is that this is one of those occasions
one of those fairly rare occasions were
Americans people living in this country
are actually able to feel and to see in
a graphic way in experience some of the
emotions that are connected with the
explosion of bombs and the discharge of
guns usually those of us who live in
this country have the political luxury
of being able to think about those
things in abstract
or distant terms especially if you live
in the top two thirds of the society
economically who don't have to worry
about them on the street every morning
and we hear it discussed in Washington
we hear the the pundits and the
politicians talking about the dispatch
of bombs the dispatch of guns to this or
that country and it's it's framed as a
policy discussion it's framed as
something dignified and elevated but
when we see this TV pictures from
Oklahoma City those little kids with
their limbs torn off and you hear
accounts of the rescuers finding a
finger here and a head there a body part
there you get a bit of a sense of the
real human horror the utter terror that
lies at the end of these the explosion
of these munitions now just imagine this
imagine if it turned out that when the
people who had perpetrated this bombing
were were rounded up if it turned out
that those people were on the payroll of
a foreign government and it further
turned out
that the idea for putting together the
terrorist cell that had launched this
attack had actually originated in the
embassy of that foreign government in
Washington that one day the military
attache for that foreign government
which by the way is say 300 times the
size of the United States and which has
a vast military and which is just a few
miles off the shore of the United States
this vast looming power it turned out
that the military attache had approached
some unsavory characters and said to
them you know it might be a good idea in
terms of the way we see we would like to
influence American politics
if you formed a group that could
counterbalance some of the the forces
that we find objectionable and they had
launched this group on its way and they
had been paying them and at the time of
the detonation these people were
actually agents of a foreign government
and further imagined that Oklahoma City
was just another day's work for this
foreign funded foreign created group and
that over the course of say three years
for example they exact that a death toll
through terrorist bombings through
assassinations through dragging people
from their homes in the middle of the
night and hacking off their arms with
machetes and hacking off their ears with
machetes and dumping their bodies on the
roadside and strolling into a
neighborhood say Upper Manhattan and
putting it to the torch and that over
the course of say three years this
foreign created and funded terrorist
group killed let's say 1.5 million
American civilians all with a political
motive just to just imagine that and
just try to get a sense of what that
would do
emotionally and psychologically and
politically to the people of this
country as wealthy and as strong as this
country is
and when you start to imagine that when
you start to project that you get just
an inkling just a very small inkling
just a pale imitation of what has what
it has been like for the residents of
Haiti for whom this latest spasm of
foreign-funded
terrorism has been just another incident
in a very long history of
state-sponsored terrorism brought in by
this looming foreign power more than 300
times their size next door the analogy
of course in Haiti is the frappe the
frappe of a manual constant US
government employee on the payroll of
the CIA encouraged to form the frappe by
Colonel Patrick Collins the Defense
Intelligence Agency attache working out
of the US Embassy in port-au-prince and
simultaneously detailed by the CIA to a
group called thus in the National
Intelligence Service where he teaches a
course on Liberation Theology Liberation
Theology
being as constant tells his students the
military intelligence operatives who
were engaged in a program of terrorizing
catechists and other church people in
the countryside Liberation Theology
being this dangerous notion that the
poor ought to be empowered that they
ought to be able to go to the rich and
make demands and as cansada explained to
me in this course that he was teaching
for the CIA to the CIA created unit one
of his messages was there is not just
one ERA steed
there are tens of our Steve's out there
there are aris deeds who can come out of
the woodwork at any moment so you must
be constantly vigilant constantly ready
to put them down and i think later
professor Chomsky will give you more of
the history in the the context of this
but to really understand what the US
has been doing in in Haiti you have to
look back a few years and realized that
in many ways the the motive force behind
the US policy has been the fear of a
popular movement the fear of the
population organizing and stepping
forward and seizing control of Haitian
society in the Haitian government take
the case of the Duvalier's for many
years the Duvalier's were favored
clients of Washington US Marine missions
came in to train the tonton Macoutes the
CIA came in to train the Macoutes
Washington was happy with the Duvalier's
but in late 85 early 86 as popular
movement started to surge it looked like
they were losing it looked like baby
duck was losing its grip the u.s.
decided this looks too dangerous it's
time to go we have to ease them out
Colonel Steven Butler who was the u.s.
Pentagon official in charge of military
planning for the Caribbean at the time
explained that they feared that if baby
Doc stayed in they would have a popular
uprising on their hands so the
alternative was to move him out bring in
another military group now the military
officers who the u.s. supported in the
the coup that ousted baby Doc were
actually engaged in running cocaine into
the United States as Butler explained he
also explained the u.s. had known for a
number of years that baby doc himself
was running cocaine in the United States
US radar in the new in the Dominican
Republic had actually spotted planes
taking off from one of baby Doc's farms
flying the drugs into the US but none of
that had been sufficient reason for the
u.s. to pull the plug on him that reason
only came when it looked like he was
losing his repressive force and the US
might be facing the facing the danger of
an actual popular uprising in Haiti and
they opted to replace him not with a
popular force but with another group of
criminals
a group of criminals who it seemed to
Washington could maintain control now in
this period there was a certain chaos on
the political scene popular groups were
coming forward on every front the old
tonton Macoutes was in disrepair so is
it this moment that the CIA stepped in
to launch the sin well the US Congress
had ostensibly legally an aboveboard cut
off US military aid to Haiti I grew up
the terrorized Haitian dissidents
engaged in surveillance on a national
scale it wasn't enough though it wasn't
enough to crush the Haitian popular
movement which continued to grow in
force in 1990 Washington decided that to
stabilize the situation it would make
more sense to have a legitimate elected
president mark bazan was the u.s.
candidate the u.s. sponsored elections
at the last moment though the popular
movement completely confounding the
plans of the u.s. embassy put forward
IRA steed as the candidate he swept to
victory before the u.s. knew what had
happened and within weeks Colonel
Collins from the embassy was approaching
a man well constant saying we need a
force we need a force to counterbalance
the popular movement to counterbalance
Aris deed this was what became the
terrorists frappe now in the ensuing
years of the coup regime
the death toll perhaps 5,000 civilians
murdered not just by constant but by the
forces directed by Sedaris Francois also
US government employees also in the pay
of the CIA the US on paper was opposed
to this regime they supposedly wanted
them to leave but they kept paying those
who are directing the terror they kept
paying those who were overseeing the
terror and simultaneously were using
that terror to twist the arm of IRA
Steve in Washington aresty was being
given a set of conditions
the u.s. saw that it had a problem with
the coup regime the coup regime was not
consolidating control they were not
succeeding in obliterating the popular
movement Haiti remained unstable
investors did not want to come in
refugees were still fleeing to Florida
creating political problems for the
Democrats in Florida who hoped to hold
on to that state as they finally did in
the elections after the after it was
clear that I received after the return
of our esteem the u.s. realized that a
point that they had to bring Eris need
back that was the only way to stop the
flow of refugees that was the only way
to stabilize the situation but with with
conditions they wanted Aristide without
the old era steed platform era steed
without the popular movement Laurence
pezzulo the former US envoy to Haiti
explained to me that in their
negotiations with IRA steed
they used the terror of the frat now
pezzulo denied any knowledge of the u.s.
connection to the frat but he said that
in October of 93 as the killing was
rising the trapped terror was rising to
its peak the u.s. sat iris-t down and
said look the frappe has now become the
dominant force on the ground the only
way to counteract that is for you to
join with us and move to the right bring
old Duvalier elements into your into
your government I mean think about that
think about the cynicism of that above
ground you have the u.s. declaring for
democracy saying heiress deed is armed
and underground you have US government
employees slaughtering the constituents
of Eros deed and behind closed doors the
US negotiators saying to Aristide you
know we got a problem here with all
these terrorist killings the only way to
stop this is for you to move our way
most importantly signing on to a World
Bank IMF structural readjustment plan
which if finally implemented would
probably be the most radical ever
attempted anywhere in the world
involving a whole range of measures from
laying off
government employees - privatizing all
significant state enterprises creating
special parallel courts that would be
more favorable to corporations direct
subsidies to export corporations laying
aside the old agenda of dramatic
increases in the minimum wage
redistribution of land redistribution of
wealth overturning the table of
exploitation and so forth era steed
signed on to that program the u.s.
brought him back and now you have a
situation where in the countryside in
Haiti as a result of an order that came
down from through the US military chain
of command in October of 1994 where the
US special forces are collaborating
directly with the frappe
as Amy mentioned with that example this
is not the initiative of individual
Special Forces units this is policy from
Washington it's not just that the
paramilitaries have not been disarmed
the paramilitaries have been politically
aided and abetted and protected by the
u.s. occupation forces the night of Aris
deeds return we went over to the Army
General Staff headquarters just across
the street from the palace and
port-au-prince and we're out there
standing on the balcony talking to a
young Haitian American US soldier who
had left Haiti when he was young and it
now returned with the US troops and we
were looking out at the crowds of people
in the street and he said you know if we
weren't here if we weren't here to
protect this building they'd burn this
place down this this this building would
be cinders this army would disappear
overnight he knew very well from his own
experience and from the people who he
had been talking to who the US troops
were protecting major Luis carnosine who
was Colonel Pat Collins's assistant in
the Defense Intelligence Agency office
in port-au-prince and who was then put
in charge of the police training
programs in Haiti he explained it to me
this way
this was right before the occupation
this is the way he he said who are we
going back to save you're going to end
up dealing with the same folks as before
the five families that run the country
the military and the bourgeoisie they
are the same folks that are supposed to
be the bad guys now but the bottom line
is you know that you're always going to
end up dealing with them it's not going
to be the slum guy from CJ Soleil
the best thing he can hope for is
probably oh I'll help you offload your
cargo truck because that's all he has
the capacity to do it'll be the same
elites the bush huazi and the five
families that run the country that was
Curtis and right before the occupation
as it's played out it has worked out
that way now you have Ira steed back but
coming out of Eros Dean's mouth is the
economic program of mark bazan the World
Bank IMF structural readjustment even
more radical than that which bazaine had
ever dared to propose now within Haiti
they're popular movements like the MPP
which are trying to push in the other
direction which are trying to resist
which are trying to enable Aristide to
slip out of the straitjacket the
political and military straightjacket
which has been imposed on him by the
United States the people in this country
should understand very clearly that
that's where the initiative comes from
in Haiti that's where the movement for
change in Haiti comes from from the
grassroots groups it is not going to
come from Aristide himself and from the
aresty administration when you talk to
Aris seed and his Paris need people
about this and say well what about the
old program of overturning the table of
exploitation
what about redistributing wealth
redistributing land etc what they'll say
is look we are surrounded we don't have
an army on the streets those are not our
troops those are US troops this is an
occupation we can't do that it's only
the popular movements that can start the
initiative for those kinds of for those
kinds of changes in Haiti and finally
I'll just want to make the point that
the popular movements in Haiti people
like those of the MPP they know what
they're up against
they see what they're facing they share
the experience of people in so many
other countries people like say those of
the gum the relatives that had
disappeared in in Guatemala or people
like the east to Murray's occupied by
the Indonesian Armed Forces with the
backing of the US government they know
the price they pay they know the risk
they run if they decide to stand up and
speak and demand their rights
politically in Haiti its frappe terror
in East Timor it's the kind of reception
that those who march to the Santa Cruz
cemetery on the morning of November 12
1991 received they were walking across
town in protest they were commemorating
the death of a young man who had been
murdered by the army when they stormed a
Catholic Church ten days before they
were holding up banners calling for the
us-backed Indonesian troops to honor the
UN Security Council resolutions and get
out of their country and as they stood
outside the cemetery while some were
laying flowers on the graves the
Indonesian soldiers marched up in
formation Amy and I were there we went
and stood between the soldiers and the
Timmer ease we thought of foreign
presence would deter them it didn't they
swept right past us they raised their
rifles to their shoulders all at once
they opened fire they slaughtered that
crowd of people they killed I don't know
exactly how many people are here today
but de Hill killed perhaps as many
people as are here in this audience
today blowing them away right before our
eyes with American m16s we actually saw
the pieces of flesh leaving their bodies
flying into the air the kind of scenes
of which we're now seeing the aftermath
and Oklahoma City we saw there were
results of those explosions of munitions
we saw with those policy decisions
result in in Guatemala it's a sin
our story just a different method there
you have the clandestine abduction in
the middle of night people brought away
to torture chambers where they cut off
their digits one by one their bodies
displayed in public or their bodies
dumped in mass common graves that are
only disinterred a few years later it's
a worldwide policy systematic one
country after another and in Haiti even
though I received is back even though
it's called democracy on paper people
are still looking into the barrel of
that gun
a member of the MPP was assassinated not
long ago not long ago US Special Forces
troops came into the headquarters of the
MPP and as Siobhan can tell you made
threats and reminded them as if they
needed to be reminded that the US had
the firepower to level that headquarters
at any moment if they chose to do so
people in this country really have to
understand something they really have to
start to think about the consequences of
what happens when the US government acts
in this way overseas its people overseas
who are living with this kind of terror
and I think it's only when we start to
think about it in a different way that
there'll be any chance of changing it
I think first we've got to stop
dignifying these actions these decisions
with the mantle of policy it's not
policy it's crime and it's actually
illegal
and it's actually illegal under
international law you have a whole set
of principles things like the Nuremberg
principles which say that mass killing
torture political rape and so on these
are crimes for which people can be
prosecuted you know President Bush a few
years ago said that Saddam Hussein
should be put on trial for crimes
against humanity for what he'd done in
Iraq and Kuwait I think that's a good
idea
but if you're going to talk about that
if you're going to be serious about it
and not use it as a political gimmick
you have to be willing to apply that
across the board you have to be willing
to say okay we'll look at Iraq will look
at Kuwait but this let's also look at El
Salvador let's also look at Guatemala
let's also look at East Timor let's also
look at Haiti and when you start to look
at those things you're looking not just
at crimes but also criminals you're
looking at Colonel Collins in a manual
constant you're looking at Donald Terry
the CIA station chief running the sin
from behind the scenes you're looking at
the US officials on up the line through
the the Reagan and Bush and Clinton
administration's on up the line to the
very top you've got to be serious about
calling people to account recently I had
a chance to put this idea to Elliott
Abrams on the
I'm on the Charlie Rose show discussing
Guatemala who suggested to Abraham's
that he should be tried by Nuremberg
style tribunal for crimes against
but I agreed with a point that he always
makes and and he's correct about this
that he was not acting as a renegade he
was not acting out of control he had the
support of the full administration for
what he did in Central America and he
had the support of a majority of
Democrats in Congress those policies in
nicaragua salvador guatemala those were
ratified on a broad level by congress
and that there should be democrats there
in the dock with him next to him if you
look at Haiti they're talking about eros
need some people in Haiti you're trying
to talk about justice now the
assassination of he's MIDI the
assassination of a father bents at the
attack on st. John Bosco church the
torching of CTA Soleil the hacking off
of the arm of mrs. alert balanced by the
frappe imagine if you had a process of
justice that did not stop with the frank
romance in the Emanuel Constance and the
French woz and the said dresses but also
went up another notch to their employers
the policymakers in Washington who sent
down the money who set this on its
course only then would you start to come
face to face with political reality only
then would you start to see what we're
really talking about here you know when
a bunch of people get together and say
let's knock over the corner drugstore
and they go and do it and in the course
of it they shoot the clerk and a couple
of customers you don't say
they made a policy decision they made a
policy decision to hit the drugstore no
you say they committed or they planned a
crime they committed a crime this should
be brought to justice and punished and
the sooner we realize that much of
American governance involves these kinds
of actions the closer we'll be to
dealing with reality
there's another point though another
angle that I think is important to
realize because you know people often
say when you have discussions like this
god it's so depressing to hear all this
you know it's so discouraging it's so
shocking and disheartening and it really
is I mean there's no doubt about it in a
certain sense I mean this kind of horror
I mean these are the worst things in
life these are the worst things that
humanity has to offer and it's even
worse when you start to realize that
they're not the result of the actions of
nuts or vibrations but rather the
results of deliberate decisions taken by
the people who happen to be running your
very own government that's even worse
but it shouldn't get you down instead it
should get you up it should get you
rising to your feet in rage and in anger
and in determination to stop it because
if you don't stop it if the people in
this country don't stop it it won't get
stopped the people in Haiti
are doing all they can Siobhan's people
come out onto the streets they organize
they risk their lives going up against
the Macoutes
the people in East Timor walk to that
cemetery stand face to face with those
American m16s take the American supplied
bullets in their faces the people in
Guatemala hold their union meetings hear
a knock on the door and are never seen
again they're doing everything they can
but they can't demonstrate on the
streets of the United States they can't
vote in American elections they can't
lobby the Congress of the United States
they can't disrupt the operations of an
American state which is exporting this
kind of terror systematically to country
after country only people here only
people here can do that and there's a
key thing to remember just in terms of
the practical politics of this
I happen to think that this whole
American system of worldwide oppression
is in a sense very vulnerable
politically for this reason because so
much of it is done in effective secrecy
so much of it is done beneath the
consciousness of the majority of the
American public most of the American
public is not aware of this kind of
systemic terror being perpetrated in
Haiti and Guatemala and Salvador and
Timor that creates an unstable situation
for the state you have different say for
example slavery was a very different
situation in the case of slavery the
white population knew exactly what was
going on they acquiesced in it they
supported it there were no surprises
that was a stable form of repression in
this case I really believe that the more
that the facts leaked out about what the
US is doing overseas the more and more
vulnerable the government becomes and
it's why you see such panic at moments
like toward the end of Vietnam when this
kind of thing was coming out onto the
table or you see such efforts to to shut
down the the expose days that were
coming on Guatemala in the past few
weeks to contend that these are just
rogue operations a few people out of
control because an underlying basis I'm
convinced that if the u.s. population
knew about this they wouldn't stand for
it and the terror wouldn't wouldn't
continue and finally when you hear
shavon later
I'd suggest that Americans listen kind
of on two tracks on one track listening
in terms of thinking about well what can
we do to help what can people in this
country do to try to stop the u.s.
support for the elites and the killers
in Haiti and directly support groups
like the MPP and on the other track
listen to think about well how can we
learn from this great success the way
the MPP has under the Duvalier's and
under the said dress and the frappe been
able to organize and sustain themselves
and keep going in the face of this
terror because we need something very
much like Anna Mae
American popular movement to mirror the
Haitian popular movement it's a very
different country very different society
very different problems but we have a
lot to learn from what they've been able
to accomplish there and chivon is a very
good person to impart those lessons so
I'll just leave it at that and try to
remind you that we're linked to what's
happening in Haiti whether we like it or
not it's not something that can be
ignored the blood that shed in Haiti
it's blood that was a writ it's blood
that is shed as a result of decisions
taken here and we're the ones who are
capable of stopping that but only if we
stand up and do something about it thank
you
[Applause]

MPP women's Congress was held soon by
December 1990 by the time of the
elections of aresty there were more than
35,000 members of the MPP and they were
seminal in the organizing in the work
that elected jean-bertrand Aristide
President of Haiti after the coup
soldiers based in hench attacked the
NPP's work sites and unleashed a wave of
Terror aimed at breaking the back of the
organization they arrested and beat and
killed MPP members destroyed the
organization's property as you could see

has long been a close friend of Aris
deed and he became a key advisor to the
president during the coup period while
Aristide was here projecting the voice
of the popular movement on his
Presidential Commission and later in his
private cabinet he was forced to remain
an exile here but in his time here

solidarity work here educated Americans

may sue to clappa miserable and for us
to have that final victory we count on
the support of all of you here and from
the support of all those that are
supportive of democracy real democracy
not only in Haiti but throughout the
world
thank you professor Noam Chomsky needs
no introduction
Amy had a real good speech that she was
planning to make but you didn't let her
get to it well just so that no one's
misled I'm not going to talk about the
announced title eyewitness report I do
have some vivid impressions but there
are other people here who know a lot
more about it and can say much more and
have said much more so I'll keep the
things that I understand somewhat better
the can you hear me back there
no backgrounds and yeah I'll keep to the
backgrounds in US policy for what's
going on and the framework for it this
these are factors that have had a very
significant role in Haiti's history for
200 years a an overwhelming role in this
century and an absolutely dominant role
today well there's both the negative and
a positive side to that the negative
side is the nature of the impact the
positive side is what Ellen Erin
stressed so well mainly that we can
change that course well the history is
in fact very revealing as you know
there's a big debate going on now but
whether we should study Western
civilization and I'm a reactionary on
that when I think we should I think
there's a lot to learn from studying
Western civilization and I want to
describe some of those things we should
this we can start with the barbarian
invasion that emanated from the western
fringe of Europe west and northwest
Europe about five hundred years ago
swept over most of the world devastated
everything in its path was guided by
what already over 200 years ago Addams
called the savage and justice of the
Europeans one of the earliest victims
the earliest victim in fact was Haiti
much like Bengal and other early victim
both of these were regarded with awe by
the conquerors as paradises densely
populated rich peaceful in the case of
Bengal in fact very highly
industrialized developed by the
standards of the time the conqueror
robert clive compared its capital city
to London the capital city is Dhaka
that's now the capital of Bangladesh
it's a striking fact which indeed
generalizes very broadly that the two
first paradises Haiti and what is now
Bangladesh were are now the very symbols
of destruction and misery that's
something that we can learn something we
can learn from if we want to understand
the nature of Western civilization right
into the through the 18th century Haiti
was the richest colony in the world it
was the search source of a large part of
France's wealth wealth of other Imperial
countries early in this century
Americans still regarded Haiti as a a
very rich material prize in the 1970s US
aid was confidently turning it into what
they called the Taiwan of the Caribbean
the the there was as you know 200 years
ago about three hundred years ago a
rebellion a slave rebellion which
overthrew French rule overthrew colonial
rule that terrified Western civilization
it terrified the civilized world because
it appeared that this would put a would
impose barriers to the savage and
justice of the Europeans and the reason
was pretty simple it was described not
long ago by one of the leading Haitian
historians Patrick Bella guard Smith who
pointed out that Haiti was the first
nation in the world to argue the cause
of universal freedom for all humankind
revealing the limited definition of
freedom that was adopted by the French
and American revolutions that had
preceded it napoleon set forth in his
words to annihilate the black government
that had dared to live to liberate the
country as he indeed proceeded to do
with extraordin tried to do at least
with extraordinary savagery and he
explained the reasons in terms which
have a very contemporary ring not much
changes over the centuries he said I
have been less guided by considerations
of Commerce and finance then by the
necessity of stifling in every part of
the world every kind of germ of disquiet
and trouble that's actually an early
version of what's nowadays called the
domino theory nowadays you don't talk
about destroying the germs of every
described and trouble modern terminology
is the kind favored by Dean Acheson or
Henry Kissinger is that you have to
watch out for those rotten apples that
might spoil the barrel or viruses that
might infect others but the fear is the
same it is the fear of what Oxfam once
called the threat of a good example the
fear of the demonstration effect of
freedom and independent development
which Napoleon understand understood
very well and he went on to say that the
specter of the new world would sooner or
later fall into the hands of blacks
unless he succeeded in destroying this
of freedom well blacks here is to be
understood in a pretty broad sense it
means anybody who's not white it's to be
understood in the same sense as the was
used by the distinguished British
statesman Lloyd George about sixty years
ago when he was explaining why Britain
could not accept disarmament treaties
because as he put it with the proper
elegance of the upper classes we have to
reserve the right to bomb the niggers
and the niggers that he had in mind at
that point were mostly Kurds and
Iranians and the Arabs in the Middle
East and North Africa in fact pretty
much the same niggers that we feel the
right to bomb today anytime it meets
satisfies their fancy so again not much
has changed the leading French diplomat
of the day pala Ron he wrote a letter to
instantly one of Kissinger's most
admired models he wrote to James Madison
in 1805 that the existence of the Negro
people in arms occupying a country it
has soiled by the most criminal acts is
a horrible spectacle for all white
nations and it was hardly necessary for
him to emphasize that fact the leader of
one of those white nations that was then
just undertaking its own Industrial
Revolution basing itself primarily apart
from high protective tariffs on the
exist on the fact he was able to keep
the major commodity of the day cotton
very cheap through the process of
exterminating the indigenous population
and bringing in slaves from Africa and
shortly after robbing a third of Mexico
the it was also about at that time about
to enter into its the first executive
war the kind of
that's become the norm in the mid and
late 20th century the war that was
undertaken in self-defense as of course
all wars are in self-defense against
hordes of lawless Indians and runaway
Negroes in Florida as John Quincy Adams
wrote while defending this act of
self-defense conquest of Florida again
defending it in quite astonishing racist
diatribe full of outlandish lies which
to this day is regarded as one of the
outstanding state papers in American
diplomacy and wish we would all be
reading if we were to study Western
civilization the slave revolt had a
tremendous impact on American history
enormous one in fact it led the success
of the slave revolt led France to
relinquish its interest in the Louisiana
territory which opened the way for the
United States to take over a huge part
of the continent that was indeed well
understood in the time in his classic
history of Jeffersonian America about a
hundred years ago Henry Adams pointed
out that the prejudice of race alone
blinded the American people to the debt
they owe to the desperate courage of
half a million ocation nigras who would
not be enslaved
well that debt was indeed paid although
in a somewhat different fashion the
Haiti was devastated by the war that was
undertaken to stop the germ from
spreading something that we have many
examples of in modern times I should say
one being discussed on the front pages
right now Indochina
fought for the same reasons and with
much the same consequences Haiti was
forced to
[Music]
- it was punished for the crime of
liberation from France by huge
indemnities that it had to pay to France
France being the injured party by the
standards of Western civilization
it was also punished by a very harsh
embargo the most relentless torturer
being the slave society right next door
not very surprisingly the United States
was the last major country to even
recognize Haiti that was in 1862 in the
context of the Civil War and the same
year incidentally the Lincoln government
recognized Liberia and it was pretty
much for the same reasons they
recognized that they were going to have
a lot of these blacks around with
nothing much to do with and they were
hoping to export them so that the
country could be free of blot or mixture
as Thomas Jefferson put it when he was
looking forward to the day when it could
be a country without niggers around the
niggers being black and red and those in
the in in those days
well the torture continued through the
late 19th century right into this
century reached its peak with the
invasion of Haiti but Woodrow Wilson
that's one of the actions which are we
have a technical term form they're known
as Wilsonian idealism western
civilization this particular act of
Wilsonian idealism killed thousands of
people about 15,000 according to the
leading Haitian historian of it
reinstituted slavery dismantled the
parliamentary system turned the country
into a plantation and American
plantation and most crucially of all
instituted an army which had the task of
destroying any germ of
freedom as Napoleon would have put it
and has been doing that so ever since
was going to stifle every kind of germ
of disquiet and trouble was designed for
that purpose has been intent on
achieving it with the aid of the
founders exactly the same thing happened
in the Dominican Republic at the same
time right next door also an exercise of
wilsonian idealism which turned out
about the same way it was marginally
less awful because the prejudice of race
was less extreme in this case that is
the Degas and the specs as the Wilson
administration called them were a little
less disgusting than the niggers next
door so therefore they got off a little
little bit easier though not much well
there are good and it's also stayed that
way under the rule of the same of a
National Guard established at the same
time for the same purposes I should just
mention that there are pretty good
reasons why American history has never
taught one can learn far too much from
it and the lessons are much too
dangerous for the rabble to understand
especially because they apply so well
through the present day there's nothing
I said that with a few changes of words
doesn't apply to everything going on now
and recall this as hundreds of years ago
well let's continue to break the rules
and look at what came next what came
next was World War two which led to a
big change in world affairs the u.s.
came out of World War two the world
dominant power of course very
self-consciously said about organizing
the world and in particular the Western
Hemisphere the United States was finally
able after World War two to realize the
goals of the Monroe Doctrine that is to
drive out of the hemisphere its primary
enemies of Britain and France and to
take it over for itself and it indeed
proceeded directly to do that in quite
important than interesting ways by now
the nigger's extended from the Rio
Grande and the Caribbean all
to Argentina and Chile and throughout
that whole large region most of them
felt the lash bitterly in the next half
century another chapter in Western
civilization well in February 1945 of
these plans were right as the war was
coming to an end the plans were being
laid there was a major hemispheric
conference and Chapultepec Mexico and at
that conference there was what's called
a clash of civilizations at the bar the
rhetoric of the professor of science of
government as they call it at Harvard
he's talking about the clash that we're
now facing but there was a big clash of
civilizations right then which had to do
with fate of the hemisphere on the one
hand was Western civilization
represented by us of course on the other
half what on the other hand was Latin
America and here I'll just borrow the
terminology the State Department at the
time since they said it well enough
Latin America was guided by what the
State Department called the philosophy
of the new nationalism it was swept by
kind of a disease which was calling for
broader distribution of wealth and
raising the standard of living of the
masses Latin America I'm continuing to
quote Latin Americans are convinced that
the first beneficiaries of a country's
resources should be the people of that
country well that was the philosophy of
a new nationalism which naturally
horrified the leaders of the civilized
world who and the u.s. demanded
something else an economic charter for
the Americas as it was called which
would block what they called excessive
industrial development and keep to what
was called complementary development
meaning the kind of development that
would be complementary to the needs of
the Masters of the US economy and it had
to be understood that the first
beneficiaries of a country's resources
are definitely not the people of that
country but rather us investors
well civilization had the guns so the
u.s. won that clash of civilizations and
the consequences are quite evident the
World Bank every year discusses with
great distress the fact that Latin
America has the worst record of
inequality in the world although I
should say we're doing pretty well in
that competition New York City has just
passed Guatemala with regard to
inequality although that I think is
likely to be improved there's a general
belief that the current budget of the
governor and the the mayor alone what's
going on Congress we're gonna increase
the inequality of New York and I suspect
that that's wrong I think it's gonna
improve the situation so that it's more
equal because the poorer part of the
population meaning very substantial part
will either just be killed or driven
away and at that point the Equality
figures will improve so it may not be as
bad it's got them all in a few years
in any event the and that's the
conscious and deliberate social policy
it's pretty obvious when you look at
what's happening the Western Hemisphere
has the worst record Latin America the
worst record of inequality in the world
it's a total disaster area for the vast
majority we're not supposed to
understand the reasons for that well
that's one of the defects of not
studying Western civilization and
American history you don't see the
reasons which are pretty easy to discern
they start from the Chapultepec
conference and the victory of
civilization in this class of
civilizations well that was only part of
it the Truman administration understood
that the way to prevent the philosophy
of the new nationalism from spreading
the way to prevent any threat of
democracy any shred of any germ of
describe and trouble and the poland's
phrase the way to do that is to make
sure that the US
around the security forces was a lesson
that already been understood from Haiti
and the Dominican Republic and other
places nearby but now it had to be
extended hemisphere wide so the u.s.
took over control of security forces
1951 u.s. training and arming of the
security forces of the hemisphere was
initiated and it was quite successful
within three years by 1954 13 out of 20
countries were under military
dictatorships now this got a lot worse
during the Kennedy years which is the
peak of terror and aggression in modern
American history in 1962 the Kennedy
administration reached a decision of
extraordinary importance and one which
would definitely be studied if American
history were a subject that were
permitted in the schools
the in 1962 the Kennedy administration
shifted the mission of the Latin
American military from hemispheric
defense to internal security while
hemispheric defense was a kind of a
residue from the Second World War which
was by then outdated but internal
security was something pretty serious
internal security is a euphemism that
means war against her own population the
kind of war that say the Haitian and
Dominican National Guard carry out
that's internal security and that was
that mission that decision was extremely
important again instead of my describing
the consequences let me describe them in
the terms used 20 years later by the man
who headed the counterinsurgency for the
Kennedy administration Charles meach
lling he says that that decision that
1962 decision led cause to change from
toleration of the rapacity and cruelty
of the Latin American military to direct
complicity in massacres and crimes of
the kind carried out by Heinrich
Hitler's Heinrich Himmler's
extermination squads so that's the
change that took place in nineteen
- and the description is quite accurate
the first major beneficiary of the
change was Brazil where the Kennedy
administration undermined and destroyed
the parliamentary regime which was
having these germs of disquiet again and
instituted a rule of neo-nazi generals
and what the Kennedy liberals called the
greatest victory for freedom in the mid
20th century the author of those words
then went on to become president of
Johns Hopkins University and the where I
guess they still don't understand the
study of American history at least they
didn't the last time I was there and
went through this and more detail the
Brazil is a big powerful country and of
course that had a domino effect and
pretty soon a plague of repression
without any you know I know no model in
the whole bloody history the hemisphere
had spread all over the place the the
the reasons were also understood and
made clear the Canadian situation also
greatly enhanced the training and arming
of the Latin American military as Alan
Aaron showed years ago that's the
origins of the contemporary death squads
the purpose was pretty clear it was the
same purpose that had always been
established it was made very explicit in
National Security Council memoranda and
other high-level reports which
fortunately we don't study not having a
subject like American history but their
public so for example the one that was
NSC nine five four three two which was
reached right after the successful
overthrow of Guatemalan democracy said
made it explicit that the major threat
facing the United States was the threat
of radical and nationalistic regimes
which were under pressure by the
majority by the mass
of the population for rapid improvement
in low living standards and development
for domestic needs in other words that
disease of the philosophy of the new
nationalism and obviously we couldn't
tolerate that because we represent
civilization so therefore we had to
increase the funding and organization of
the security forces as the Kennedy
administration did they were the
ultimate barrier as always Robert
McNamara who's in the news these days
explained it to McGeorge Bundy the
national security adviser he pointed out
that in the Latin American political
culture illan vironment these guys are
intellectuals remember so they Harvard
type so they talk in big words in the
Latin American cultural environment the
military has the responsibility of
removing from power civilian governments
when in the judgement of the military
the civilian the acts of civilian
governments are injurious to the welfare
of the nation he didn't say which nation
he had in mind yes that and he also
explained that we can rely on the
judgment of the military because the
enhanced us training that was initiated
by the Kennedy administration had led
them to an understanding of an
orientation towards our objectives
so therefore when they carried out these
acts that are required in the Latin
American cultural environment they would
do it the right way
well the u.s. a global power remember so
exactly the same thing was done
worldwide at the fact that exactly the
same time it was done in Indonesia where
there was also the threat of a political
party political party that won there was
one mass political party it was
recognized being without the controversy
at the party that was defending the
interests of the poor and that's another
one of those
you know germs of disquiet the US was
training the military and succeeded in
1965 in 1965 there was a military coup
which slaughtered which carried out what
the New York Times described with
enormous enthusiasm as a staggering mass
slaughter that created a gleam of light
in Asia as Times headline put it it
namely wiped out the party that was
defending the interests of the poor
carried out a mass huge mass murder the
biggest one since the Second World War
this was greeted with total euphoria in
the United States across the board you
want a sample of it I reviewed it in a
recent book but it's kind of
embarrassing so it's off the agenda and
the way in which people reacted with a
with Time magazine called the boiling
bloodbath and was is not too well
remembered but it was true and McNamara
explained at that time to Johnson that
the United States had played a
significant role in that by training
military officers it's good to bring
them to places like Harvard and so on
because they get the right orientation
and therefore they're able to cleanse
their society in the required way and to
stifle shreds of germs of disquiet and
trouble the support of the United States
for the Indonesian slaughters and
East Timor in part has a lot of reasons
but one reason is just gratitude for
this achievement for which Indonesia won
plenty of points you can assume well
everything else that happened is kind of
deducible from that there's really much
going on in further details those are
the basic outlines of policy that's the
basic vert that's those are the basic
facts about Western civilization in our
particular case of course it's only one
version of history and it has only one
merit namely truth so it's therefore
under a total ban but there's also
another version of history which has a
another virtue namely the virtue of
being politically correct so that one
very commonly heard in fact everywhere
well of course this is a free society so
the politically correct version is not
uniform there's a spectrum in fact
you're watching the spectrum unfold and
the great debate over or mcnamaras
there's a left and a right on the left
you have the people who say that we made
mistakes in an excess of moralism and
wilsonian idealism and misunderstanding
and ignorance then way over on the right
you have the people who say we made
mistakes because we're too humane and
too sentimental and too cowardly and
within that spectrum you're allowed to
participate in the discussion but to
suggest there's of course another in the
case of Vietnam there happens to be
another logically possible position
namely that it was not a mistake rather
fundamentally and morally wrong that
position is actually held believe it or
not by an exotic group of people outside
of the educated sectors namely 70% of
the population in Gallup polls from
which I've just been quoting
ever since the question was asked in an
opening question starting in 1970 but
there you know that's just what
Alexander Hamilton once called the Great
Beast the people we have to cage so
naturally they don't participate in this
debate between left and right the the
right wing is is interestingly exhibited
as is the left incidentally on the pages
of the New York Times every day a good
example was just Friday there's one I
really urge you to read there's a left
and a right you know Anthony Lewis and
am Rosenthal
of course talking about Oklahoma City
over on the right Rosenthal former chief
editor so you learned a lot about what
the times is like by reading his columns
I'm kind of surprised that they let him
write actually it gives them none
tremendous insight into what was going
on there for many years anyway but his
column said that he's the one one the
one who said their problem is we make
mistakes because of excessive humanity
and cowardice well talking about
Oklahoma City he said we don't yet know
who was responsible but we should bomb
the bastards anyway that's essentially
what it came to and the bastards are
everyone in the Middle East with one
notable exception that is we should bomb
the people lloyd George's niggers I mean
they're still there and we have to
reserve the right to bomb them and
whether they were responsible would not
we don't know it wasn't quite sure
whether they were responsible but you
could just hear the you could hear him
salivating with pleasure as he described
this prospect well that's over on the
right on the left Anthony Lewis was
saying that we have to have reason and
we have to wait until we find out that
they're responsible before we bomb them
that was
that was the hidden text he didn't say
this word but we have to be reasonable
the common description was also
interesting the standard description
headlines so on is that Oklahoma City
looks just like Beirut and that's a real
turning point in American history and
that's a fair description but so far
nobody's made the obvious comment Beirut
has looked like Beirut for a long time I
not just today and since we love
anniversaries so much one time when they
route looked like Beirut was exactly ten
years ago in March 1985 rather important
year because 1985 was the peak year of
Middle East terrorism that was the year
when editors all over the world picked
Middle East terrorism as the biggest
story of the year and in fact it was a
pretty terrible year and the worst
atrocity in Middle East terrorism in
fact was the worst car bomb in history
which blew up in Beirut in March 1985
the it was it wasn't out of outside a
Federal Building was outside a mosque at
time so as to kill the maximum number of
people namely when people were leaving
the mosque 80 people were killed 256
injured babies in their beds mostly
women read the current newspapers and
you know exactly what it looked like
even the number seemed to be about the
same well right now we're still not
quite sure who to bomb or at least we
weren't on Friday but in the case of the
Beirut bombing in 1985 there's no
question about who to bomb and the US
Air Force certainly has the capacity to
do it the person primarily in charge
unfortunately he can't be bombed because
he died a few years ago but the CIA
director William cases co-conspirators
they're still around
quite happily in California and Texas
and around here I suppose in New York
and since this was a CIA organized
bombing we know exactly who to bomb for
that one when they were looked like
Beirut
we might drop a couple of bombs on
London too because British intelligence
also seems to have been involved in this
operation well going over to the voice
of reason since we don't want to follow
the crazies this sounds pretty
reasonable to me I mean maybe there's an
error in logic but if so I'm kind of
missing it so the voice of reason would
suggest that we should we should pursue
the perpetrators to the ends of the
earth as the president said and if we
have to bomb the governments that were
responsible are the places where they're
hanging out we know exactly how to do it
and nobody's stopping us
well let's return to Haiti and the
politically correct history let's begin
with the since I've been giving you this
odd version which is only true let's
begin with the higher reaches of
scholarship and we can begin right now
so take the current March 1995 issue of
the newsletter of the Society for
historians of American foreign relations
which incidentally is the most open and
honest and serious of the professional
associations that I know of in the
humanities and social sciences so I'm
not going off into some you know it's
not a brozen for this the March the
current issue that features one
scholarly article as they usually do
this one's by Frederick marks the third
and it is a scholarly critique of what
he calls American parochialism American
colloquialism is the failure of
historians to other standout other
cultures our naive belief that those
other cultures are sort of nice folk
like us and he says this leads us
historians into all sorts of errors well
here's one of his prime examples I'll
quote the reversion of Haiti to military
rule
after seven months under the renegade
priest era steed was seen by many in the
north as an anomaly rather than as a
statement about democracy the reason
being that we in this country have
trouble imagining that there could be a
deeply seated cultural longing for firm
rule by a power elite or in a leet of
intelligence and training so that's why
we misunderstand what went on and we
don't realize that the contrary to what
showing I was saying that the mass of
the people of Haiti were just pleading
for the rule of a elite of intelligence
and training and a firm rule after they
had had to suffer under this renegade
priest for seven months well Napoleon
couldn't have put it better or maybe
Stalin and since some have to admit I'm
kind of rendered speechless by this
display of scholarship I won't try to
comment so let's turn to some serious
thinkers in the press instead on the
occasion of the US intervention there
was historic of course there was a lot
of description but there was also
historical background provided both in
the New York Times in the Washington
Post two leading newspapers in the New
York Times the historical background was
presented by RW Apple who wrote that for
two centuries political opponents in
Haiti routinely slaughtered each other
the backers of president Aristide
followers of general cedrus and the
former tonton Macoutes retain their
homicidal tendencies to say nothing of
their weapons
he didn't had that the homicidal maniacs
in the slums and the hills that cleverly
concealed the weapons but anyway they
retain them then he added historical
depth which one goes like this like the
French in the 19th century and like the
Marines who occupied Haiti from 1915 to
1934 the American forces who are trying
to impose
a new order will confront the complex
and violent society with no history of
democracy well the fact that the vicious
terror and racism of the Wilsonian
idealists has been erased from history
that we're sort of familiar with I mean
we know that but Napoleon you know to
describe Napoleon in these terms that's
an innovation and I presume it's part of
the general project of rewriting the
entire history of the barbarian invasion
in preparation for the next phase well
that's the New York Times won't let's go
over to Washington Post where historical
background was presented by their deep
thinker David Broder he said that the
American forces landing in Haiti were
facing a real danger they said US troops
may be caught in an in the ongoing civil
war between heavily armed groups bent on
revenge and determined not to yield
power so we stand sort of uneasily
between these heavily armed gangs like
Napoleon's general Leclerc who warned
Napoleon that it would be necessary to
murder every Negro for the forces of
light to prevail or maybe like the
Soviet troops who occupied Prague and
were caught between heavily armed gangs
you know the Stalinist security forces
on the one hand the protesters on the
other and were in danger of being harmed
by their homicidal tendencies or maybe
to take another example the American
troops who liberated both involved and
faced the real danger that they were
caught between - they were caught an
ongoing civil war between heavily armed
gangs based on
with homicidal tendencies or pick other
examples that's the problem he then went
on to say that Clinton has fallen
quoting Clinton has followed the
idealistic President Woodrow Wilson in
sending American forces to Haiti we
tried for 19 years to created among
Democratic Society there and we failed
and now we're back again turning back to
the New York Times still aspiring to do
good works unable to comprehend the
division in Haitian society between the
rich and the poor that's just something
we just can't grasp the reason we can't
grasp it is that we love the poor it's
called in fact tough love there's even a
name for it that's the way you love the
poor when you're grinding them down and
you know in the Gingrich Pataki etc
style but since that's our nature we
just can't understand these divisions
between rich and poor and we're gonna
have so much trouble that we're still
aspiring to do good works well that's
the kind of history we're to remember
and in fact repeat and in fact to
memorize and to speak on every occasion
at least if you're properly educated and
there's also a properly a politically
correct version of the history of the
recent past so the New York Times again
laments that the renegade priest was
unable to guide the country's economy
during the seven months that he was in
office he he the they called on for
further comment
Petula who was Clinton's point man until
he was forced out because he had was
getting a little embarrassing he was
lying through outrageously to Congress
and they they get rid of him but he
remained an expert for the New York
Times and he explains that Aris teed
failed politically while in office
because he was unwilling to broaden his
political base that is beyond the huge
majority
population to include those the elite of
intelligence and training the what are
called in the in the West the middle
classes which refers to 1% of the
population and he didn't broaden his
base to them properly didn't have the
right people in power the he the other
problem he faced was his estrangement
from the elected parliament coupled with
his Chile relationship with the leading
element with the political and military
leaders that live that's what's what led
his overthrow so obviously pretty bad
character but of course what can you
expect in a country with no democratic
traditions only a vibrant lively civil
society of grassroots movements that had
come out from nowhere and had offered
the population a chance to participate
in local affairs and even national
affairs as America's watch put it and
something that caused outright horror
here the hatred for democracy in the
United States among the educated classes
is again has to be watched to be
believed as for the elected parliament
that the rsd couldn't get along with
they were elected indeed because the
popular movements didn't have the
resources to challenge the traditional
wealthy and military middle classes that
1% so therefore they were indeed elected
and now the chant of the front what the
President must do is to bring back the
business and the military and put them
in power so that then civil society will
be will be back functioning in the
proper way
well the crucial elements of this these
fairytales are endlessly repeated and
they're sort of interesting
the
the the economic failures of the rsd
regime were in fact described in a
secret February 1992 u.s. embassy cable
which reported the leaked but then
suppressed recorded these surprisingly
successful efforts of the rst government
which were quick quickly reversed by the
coup that that was also the same thing
was reported by the inter-american
Development Bank as it described how
Aris need successes during the 17 months
and their words were welcomed by the
international financial community which
therefore it gave him substantial
assistance further frightening
Washington incidentally and but that's
of course the wrong story so that's not
part of history what is part of history
is that once our state was brought to
Washington he was civilized he had been
what was called a demagogue a rabble
rouser a terrorist gangster and
ideologue he had even tried to raise the
minimum wage and interfered with market
forces but while in Washington he got
civilized so as his strongest supporters
put up put it I'm not talking about his
critics but his strongest supporters he
was given a crash course in democracy in
capitalism the leading commentator in
the new york times Elaine Selina said
that the Clinton administration really
worked hard force-feeding him with a
dose of economics and public
administration and the result of all of
this was that he became pragmatic
and he learned about democracy and
capitalism democracy means you follow
orders while you have a nice smile on
you shuffle around then you say Thank
You massa or something like that and
capitalism means about the same thing
and the idea is well maybe he got
civilized that's the hope there's big
headline in New York Times something
that he made there may have been a
transition from a Robespierre who was
only committed to terror to a Gandhi
kind of like us you know although we
weren't quite sure that that would was
achieved well that's
I'm not going to proceed with the
official history you've heard it and
seen it plenty of times it closely
resembles Stalinist history and that's
the history that were allowed to tell in
fact urge to tell but the real history
is just kind of old hat and boring and
the domain of ideologues and certainly
nothing the one would want to study and
of courses on Western civilization well
but the history aside and just go to the
last few years in the 1970s and the 80s
u.s. aid was laboring to turn Haiti and
to the Taiwan of the Caribbean as I
mentioned and they poured in plenty of
money and they had a lot of successes
they created what is called in technical
terms an economic miracle like the one
we've just seen in Mexico and elsewhere
the economic miracles always have the
same properties in Haiti exactly as in
Mexico for example real wages dropped by
about 50 percent agricultural production
was destroyed the country was shifted
over to import
siobhan was saying the terror continued
of course there were export platforms in
which women could be brought in from the
farms to work for five or ten cents an
hour
11 12 hour days to make say softballs
dipping their hands into toxic
substances so that the American
manufacturer
could advertise about how well they were
bonded and so on and so forth in general
was an economic miracle of the usual
kind the terror continued after the fall
of jean claude da it was fully supported
of washed by washington of course and
the ambassador explained that yeah there
was indeed terror but it's just part of
the culture I mean we're aspiring to do
good works but what can we do about it
that's the culture well so matters
continued until December 1990 when
Washington made its first mistake
they allowed an election no one had
noticed that the plague of democracy had
spread around the country nobody pays
attention to what's going on outside of
the middle class
you know the 1% up in Youngsville and so
on and this terrible thing that happened
they swept their own president into
office US aid and the National Endowment
for democracy and so on immediately
moved in to try to undermine the
government and they worked hard on it
nevertheless it was highly successful as
the State Department secretly in the
inner American Development Bank and
other international institutions pointed
out publicly that are not in the press
here but it was a political failure in
an economic failure because the
government was not run by US investors
or the mevs family and so on and because
there actually we're policies being
undertaken that might benefit somebody
outside the 1% there and the prime
beneficiaries of the country's resources
here
well then came the coup then along with
it the huge atrocities thousands of
people being killed and to the credit
the media did begin focusing on
atrocities at that point namely on the
atrocities committed under the the rst
government they managed to find I think
a dozen or so atrocities during the
seven months in office carried out
mostly or maybe all by the army and
there was actually more coverage of
after the coup then of the hundreds of
people later thousands of people who are
being slaughtered by the security forces
the Organization of American States
instituted an embargo but embargoes
don't mean anything if the chief Mafia
don doesn't take part everybody
understands that and George Bush
announced very quickly that the u.s.
wasn't gonna take part in a couple of
weeks after the embargo was announced on
Bush reluctantly formally joined it he
also announced that US companies were
going to be exempt from it and the New
York Times explained that he was
fine-tuning the embargo for the benefit
of the of the Haitian population who
they figured it sort of be better off if
American companies kept functioning well
trade with US trade with Haiti was not
all that much below the norm in 1992
though I don't think you could find that
in the press here it would have taken it
and it's hard to find out it took me
five minutes to call the Commerce
Department to get figures in 1993 under
Clinton it went up by about 50% they
also began you have to you know I read a
newsie magazine in places like that but
New York Times didn't have time for that
story the in in January 1990 the main
part of a embargo any embargo is oil
these days that's what an embargo means
keeping oil the way
oil continue the flow without a stop the
big rich families we're building big
tank farms and so on and so forth nobody
could figure out how especially the CIA
in January 1994 the CIA testified to
Congress that the coup regime was going
to collapse almost immediately because
all the oil had stopped and they were
monitoring it closely to make sure that
no oil got in and I suppose the meb's
family
laughing while they read this since they
were the ones who were building the big
oil tank farm to deal with all the oil
that was pouring in exactly how it was
getting in was that it was getting in
was not a secret to anyone exactly
except maybe the American public reading
the New York Times but the how it was
getting in wasn't entirely known
although it was revealed the day before
the US intervention that was a Monday
remember and on Sunday the day before I
happened to be monitoring the AP wires
because was obviously something's going
to happen you know Carter was there
having dinner with cedrus and his slim
attractive wife and all that kind of
business but so plainly something was
going on and the AP wires were you know
the way they work he sort of poor
stories out if you ever seen these
things and they have a lead story all
the time they have a lead story that day
too
the lead story was which was emphasized
over and over so that no journalists in
the country couldn't miss it the even if
the lead story was that there had been a
Justice Department leak obviously
somebody was irritated and someone in
the Justice Department had leaked the
facts and the documents indicating that
the Bush administration and the Clinton
administration had authorized the Texaco
corporation to continue supplying oil
illegally that is that they had told
them they warned them that it was
illegal but then when Texas the same day
they warned them that was illegal they
were called in and told there wouldn't
be any prosecution and when the Texaco
Corporation came to the Treasury
Department with a proposal for a fake
company that they could set up which
would then bring in the oil you know so
on they were informed that that was
illegal but that there wouldn't be any
prosecution and this went on right
through the Clinton administration so
that tells you exactly what the big
headline would have been the next
morning if there had been a newspaper in
the country the headline would have been
there never was an embargo okay there
never were any sanctions there was never
an embargo the Clinton and Bush
administration simply authorized the big
corporation in this case
texaco to keep supplying the oil well
like i say it wasn't a big surprise to
fritz miss you know he was building the
tank farms to take it in but it wasn't a
big surprise to the american population
either because they never read it i was
curious about this one and like I wrote
an article for the magazine the next day
discussing it but that comes out six
weeks later so I wrote it in past tense
I said well as we all know you know as
once again vastly underestimated this
servility of the educated classes in the
United States mistake I make over and
over Monday nothing was there just how
the sanctions failed so he had to invade
Tuesday it actually hit the press I did
an exit search later because I was
curious to see what happened Tuesday had
hit the press it was in Platts oil
Graham that's an oil industry Journal
which published the Clinton
administration denial of what they knew
to be true
Wednesday three days later there were
about like ten lines buried somewhere in
the Wall Street Journal also focusing on
the government denial but then it was
starting to leak out in small papers you
know like Dayton Ohio a places where the
editors aren't very sophisticated and
they don't understand what's the wrong
kind of news and so it continued in fact
it is day there hasn't been a word about
it in The New York Times or I think The
Washington Post it did make it to the
Miami Herald as far as I know the only
major newspaper in October 23rd like
like five weeks later they mentioned it
and actually did a pretty interesting
story they did their own investigation
which they describe some of the other
things that were going on during the
so-called sanctions for example they
described Conrad Brandt another one of
the rich families had just been in Miami
under the sanctions to buy a $45,000
Cadillac and they described the way the
Bush and the Clinton administration's
had had gone
to the assets of the coup leaders they
did actually go after the assets of the
chief of staff be humpy fifteen months
after the coup and waiting until when
they got there there were five dollars
and seven cents left so he really got
slammed and that's the way the sanctions
worked but since the sanctions failed
obviously what could we do but move in
ourselves and continue aspiring to do
good works well as I say been surprised
the medicine the Brants and the other
the rest of the middle class
it didn't surprise them either to find
out what the policies were going to be
if they were literate they could have
read what Americans also could have read
in this case thanks to Alan there and
once again who published released the
economic plan that was rammed down our
Steen's throat which he accepted now
that he's civilized and pragmatic
instead of being an ideologue and
fanatic the I don't think that one ever
made the press either I think it was on
him no one could say as far as I know it
was only a multinational monitor it
wasn't the the central line of that
economic plan said that the renovated
government of Haiti that we're
reestablishing we're we're doing good
works the renovated government must
direct all the foreign funds that come
in to civil society then they define
civil society primarily the private
sector both national and foreign yet
American investors are Haitian civil
society right but not Haitians in the
slums of the hills they're not civil
society they are the wrong people there
that just the ones that form grassroots
movements and create these germs of
disquiet that have to be crushed by the
armed forces that have the proper
orientation and understanding of our
objectives thanks to their efficient
training well that's where we stand now
you've heard the rest of it the
government has now been broadened
properly you know like the middle
classes in there where they belong we
have real democracy it's not a big
surprise that Fritz meds the you know
the leading spokesman of the richest
family is the most enthusiastic person
about the American intervention you know
running around for a press anything out
posters of our speed and so on and so
forth
just to make certain that nothing goes
wrong our estate is not being allowed to
finish his term now you can also read
that if we're in a free society because
it was pointed out in Canada but in
which also pointed out that decision the
Clinton administration not to permit him
to finish his term in their words
legitimizes the coup well that's in fact
correct our estates term has another
four years to run under the Constitution
that's not the way it's interpreted here
the interpretation here is that the coup
years were part of his turn so he was
serving it while he was in Washington
but that's not what the Constitution
says in fact that everyone appeals to in
fact Constitution doesn't say anything
about what happens when the military
coup takes place and the president's
driven out of the country and his
supporters are massacred and so on
that's something you make a decision
about if you happen to think that
democracy is of some interest you say
that he finishes at his turn namely the
five years if you happen to have total
hatred and contempt for democracy you
say he gets out of there fast so we can
get our guy in civil society in some
fashion well that's what we do with the
support as far as I know of a hundred
percent of the educated classes at least
you can do it you can do a study and
check it out
well Clinton's been very much praised
for his successes and there's some
justification in that following wishes
plans the program and just general
policy he did succeed pretty much in
restoring the status quo before the
mistake was made that is before the 1990
election so the traditional structures
of power are pretty much back in place
the popular move
months have been severely damaged if not
destroyed the though amazingly they're
still functioning
they don't just collapse and die the way
people do here in fact we have a good
deal to learn from the peasants and slum
dwellers in Haiti not only lessons in
democracy although that would be a good
beginning
[Applause]
and we want to thank professor Noam
Chomsky so much for well that incredible
background and speech and know that
you'll be able to hear this over and
over again on WBAI and on cable it will
be run but on various local cable
networks so that it gets out to a very
wide audience this entire event today we
did want to open the floor to some
questions we do have a few minutes for
questions and I do want to let you know
if you haven't contributed as much as
you wanted to today feel free to go to
the back of the room to the WBAI table
we're doing quite well again we're
trying to raise money today both for
WBAI radio that brings you this kind of
information as well as MPP EDF the
peasant movement of peopie education and
Development Fund that is trying to get
this kind of information out in Haiti
through a radio station that it's
developing working with women in Haiti
as well as advocacy work here in the
United States to bring the voice of the
Haitian popular movement to us in the
United States because we certainly have
something to learn from them so again
feel free to go to the back of the room
also at the back of the room is the
Haiti anti intervention committee has a
lot of books and information on that
side the East Timor Action Network is on
that side with all sorts of information
and videos because Noam Chomsky has so
inspired us around issues not only of
Haiti and his analysis of world
terrorism bringing a different
definition of terrorism to the airwaves
but also on the issue of East Timor so
we do hope you get to go back there we
also want to thank Lada Tom the
restaurant that has helped us today and
contributed so generously and the
campaign for peace and democracy is
selling its magazine in the back that
has an article on Haiti and we want to
let you know about an event that's
happening this week on Thursday captain
Rockwood speaks the captain who is
facing an army court-martial for trying
to rescue Haitian political prisoners
and
National Penitentiary on September 30th
of last year hear his story and you can
show him your support that's going to be
happening at the newspaper guild at 133
West 44th Street in Manhattan between
sixth and seventh on Thursday April 27th
at 6:30 a very important event to go to
well why don't we take a few questions
for our speakers if you are interested
in asking some yes
can you speak a little louder
[Music]
the question is does a professor Chomsky
see an end to the benevolence of Western
civilization and how does he see that
coming about well remember that 70% of
the American population disagree with a
hundred percent of the educated sectors
on the case of Vietnam and say that it
was not a mistake it was fundamentally
wrong and immoral so that they're off
the political spectrum
remember that notice that that seventy
percent is an extraordinarily high
number one reason is just technical in a
poll with an open question we have a lot
of choices seventy percent is unheard of
secondly nope everybody who said that
made it up for themselves they sure
didn't read in New York Times or
anywhere else because nobody who has is
articulate it's allowed to express that
view except way off in the margins so
70% of the population we're able to make
up for themselves that the whole
educated spectrum of opinion is off the
wall well that's because they knew some
of the facts and if people know other
facts I think they'll make the same
decisions in fact that's exactly why
there is such fear and hatred of
Hamilton's great beast that's exactly
why the germs of disquiet and unrest
have to be still that's exactly why and
the dependencies you have National
Guard's
you know trained to crush anybody who
lifts their head and why at home where
you really can't do that anymore
you have propaganda at a level which has
is absolutely unheard of in any other
society including totalitarian societies
so corporate propaganda in the United
States is a massive industry billions of
dollars are spent every year to do what
the leaders of the industry call
fighting the everlasting battle for the
minds of men you know controlling the
public mind and that they don't have to
win that battle you know I mean though
win it if nobody fights back how can
this end I mean we all know the answer
to that that overwhelming mass of the
population who is radically opposed
just about everything that's going on as
soon as they find out about it if that
great beast can become say as well
organized as peasants in the hills and
Haiti under slightly harder conditions
yeah then they can reconstitute the
foundations of a democratic society and
change things radically yes
[Music]
that
first she wanted to applaud Siobhan
jean-baptiste an MPP for putting
together a radio station and then she's
asking the question to Siobhan if the
MPP will be putting forward a candidate
in the June elections and will he be a
candidate myself a team member Coons in
doc y-yeah
the first thing I'm going to say is that
I'm not going to be a candidate for any
post superdumb MPP gang yeah
appeal back I exist who can forget
election however the MPP is looking at
several factors that would determine you
know that would be a checklist for
determining actually free and fair
elections met na MU meson ooh Prosecco
no Kaka Papa participate participate a
critic opposes Islam I participate
Galman the KPM extra napkins in de P
episode C Nacala vilasa phenomena critic
opposes lovely yeah Decker election no
participant up you can see that kind of
a Lhasa the first thing that we're going
to be doing is monitoring the process
itself making critiques when there are
problems in order to try and ensure that
the process be the best that it can and
we will be supporting candidates
candidates under the lava law spanner
gradua legal positive pagoda lectionary
Oh Papa Papa educatio to election a
component limit election or moderate
necessity to vote Ishiyama
you don't go technologic so the radio
will be used very much in this next
period this pre-electoral period in
order to talk about the limits of
elections in
of themselves but also to encourage
people that they can go out and vote for
candidates of change and those would be
the level of candidates yes a pair Raja
Abdullah see it took Candida makuhita
antenna choreo basic Telemachus Ziggler
and certainly the radio station will be
used to denounce any Macoutes who try to
put themselves under the democratic
sector another question yes
the question is MVP was originally
agriculturally oriented now the
questioner says he understands its
political because has it neglected its
agricultural base Poonam am to baggage a
politic for us everything is political
[Applause]
Sudha Valley Nevada ballad movement The

MPP affair my ship was rumors say
politically taboo amongst apology to

we also worked with the peasants in
agricultural activities but this was a
way also to carry out popular education
about the base issues that they were
facing that were preventing positive
changes for them because for us
everything is politic production of food
is political support for human rights as
political everything is political a
co-ed group wound up and sick be in
charge my economic people see sunshine
from a policy and it would be a mistake
to think that economic changes would be
possible without political changes
boomba you example a no-parent rapini

and to give you an example we have a
trainer
that was producing 500 seedlings for us
to plant now you would say trees don't
have anything to do with politics
nevertheless the section Chiefs in the
Akash is during the coup they went and
they destroyed that tree nursery bio
communist they say the trees were
communist doc NASA sir
Leo Mandela politics a political affair
so when someone says that they're not
involved in politics they are actually
carrying out politics yes
well you probably heard it but he said
putting these people on trial as war
criminals was a good idea and what did
professor Chomsky and Siobhan
jean-baptiste think of this and would
you sorry
and Ron Daniels there are a couple of
people's tribunals in fact there's one
called the people's tribunal which it's
based in Italy and it does carry out
regular trials of one of the most recent
ones was of corporate criminals involved
in GATT and things like that and there
are very interesting trials I have a lot
of interesting stuff one of them
actually made the newspapers a big story
they about 15 years ago they dealt with
the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and
that one
you know big stories about but as far as
I'm aware that's the only one that's
ever made the press but they do carry
out regular trials like this and others
could do as well I mean you're not going
to get government's doing it obviously
or any power center trials carried out
in fact Henry Adams who I quoted before
and worth reading a century ago also
pointed out that in regard to Haiti that
the reason they paid the indemnity to
France and not the other way around is
that international law always has been
and is the rule of force that's true
yeah that's international laws law of
force but people don't have to accept
that we can just as people can set up
you know can work for a Democratic
Society they can also work for of course
symbolic punishment that were criminals
now I'm myself you know like I'm not
favor the death penalty so I don't think
that these criminals should be to hang
the way they do to others when they
catch them but
symbolic trials I think make perfect
sense in fact they're a good educational
technique the Russell trial during the
Vietnam War educated a lot of people
and it's it's very important politically
to break the dignity of those who carry
out these crimes I actually think that
this is this is an issue and this is an
idea that can have a lot of appealed
among the majority of the American
population you know one problem is that
when discussions like this are held you
reach fairly small audiences of a few
hundred people here a few hundred people
there a few thousand people here a few
thousand people there because the
corporate press they don't want to put
these things on the agenda but as we
head into political times I think like
we're heading into now which will be
very tumultuous I think there will be
more and more opportunities to reach a
broader audience and this is a question
of whether you're soft on crime or not
I mean that that really is that really
is what the issue is I mean quite you
know seriously me Nadya's are not as a
rhetorical thing I think you have to be
tough on crime you know I think someone
who mugs an old person on the street and
you know takes away their their purse
and knocks them on the head I think they
deserve to to go to jail and likewise
someone who who oversees a massacre in
which several dozen old people are
murdered along with all kinds of other
people deserves an even longer sentence
I mean it's it's very concrete and very
simple I also you know there was a
question the first question was well
what what are the chances that all this
will collapse that the you know the
system of terror can be stopped well it
can only be stopped if you if you fight
against it I mean in a very determined
very aggressive way but I think that
right now the way the US economy is
changing the prospects for bringing this
system to a halt will actually be
improving considerably because up until
a few years ago
a case could have been made that the
high standard of relatively high
standard of living enjoyed by a majority
of the American working class and middle
class was in significant part a result
of the exploitation of people overseas
and the the the kind of exploitation
that's carried out through overseas
terrorists sponsored by the US
government I mean there are arguments on
both sides of it but you could make a
you could make a strong case for that
but now with the mobility of capital and
the living standards of the majority of
the US population being undercut
precisely by US jobs of fleeing overseas
to places like Indonesia and Guatemala
and Haiti and so forth where workers are
terrorized to keep them from organizing
unions that creating a downward pull on
wages which in turn is used back against
American workers now you have a
situation where in addition to the moral
outrage in addition to Americans being
complicit through through their
government in mass-murderer
overseas you also have their material
interests I mean indisputably clearly
being harmed by this policy of
repression overseas so that makes it in
practical political terms even more
feasible to think about eventually well
soon bringing it to a stop
I think following me who is that captain
Lauren Trotwood who tried to go into a
prison state political prisoners the
interested professor Chomsky what would
in this
[Music]
if you heard this question it's about
captain Rockwood whose faces a
court-martial for trying to rescue
Haitian political prisoners when he came
in with the occupation troops gonna add
something there's a he's speaking
Thursday April 27th at 6:30 is that here
in New York yeah
133 West 44th Street at the newspaper
guild Thursday April 27th at 6:30 the
prospects are you know it's like all of
these things depends on the public
pressures I mean the the politically
court system is very political and it
reflects the pressures that are on it if
the pressures come simply from power
meaning state power or private tyranny
which are very similar that are not
identical if those are the only pressure
is well sure it will be sentence
if the pressures come from the great
beast out there that we're all part of
it could be quite different so I don't
think that's a matter of prediction
that's a matter of choice of action
yeah I I don't know much dad about
Rockwell in particular I mean it's an
amazing display of courage what he's
he's done because of course when you
defy no it's one thing for you know I'm
Americans like us say you know
journalists or whatever to to criticize
what the United States is doing but when
he does it from inside the military he
faces quite severe discipline and it's a
it's a great act of courage on his part
one thing that I found very interesting
and talking to a lot of the American GIs
on the ground in Haiti was how many of
them were upset by the basic US policy
that they had been called into called in
to defend I mean you heard I mean there
were different views I mean there was
there's a lot of diversity among the
soldiers but you there was a substantial
number of them who would talk about how
you know just seeing the incredible
disparity between the you know the mevs
and the elite up on the the hill and
everyone else living on the on the brink
of survival and the fact that the you
know the US troops there were basically
there guarding those on the on the hill
and I I got the impression just from a
lot of the troops I ran into that many
of them came away from the experience
with with a feeling that this isn't
right we don't seem to be on the on the
right side here and Rockwell you know
captain Rockwood acted on it and put his
put himself on the line I just want to
let people know in addition to captain
Rockwood speaking this Thursday at the
newspaper guild in Manhattan at 6:30
there's going to be some hearings at
City Hall on May 10th Wednesday at 1:00
o'clock and there around the issue of
the children who are still Haitian
children who are still unwanted amo
they're still over 300 unaccompanied
Haitian minor children trapped on
Guantanamo many of these children saw
their parents killed by the paramilitary
forces or they drowned and trying to
escape and rickety boats the US
government
flatly refusing to allow most of these
children as young as six to join their
relatives in the US and yet at the same
time they've allowed the Cuban children
under the similar conditions to come
into the United States so there's going
to be a hearing at City Hall May 10th at
1 o'clock on the plight of these
children and some of the families that
want these children to join them will be
testifying we are now going to end this
program with the general manager of WBAI
Valerie the Nessler she has a few words
to say and I do want to remind you as
the situation with WBAI
is so critical now with the attack in
Congress on Corporation for Public
Broadcasting that whatever you can
contribute in addition again with MPP
EDF with whom we've had this joint
fundraiser their attempts to do projects
in Haiti you saw it in the video you
heard Siobhan describe it their offices
were decimated during the coup even the
US forces now whenever Siobhan or the
MPP speak up against occupation come and
threaten them recently one of the u.s.
captains came to them and said we could
destroy your offices in five minutes
this is what they're up against they
don't accept UA ID funding which is what
is so threatening to the US forces they
do accept support from US grassroots
organizations on us just people who are
in solidarity with a peasant movement in
Haiti so we do hope you can contribute
if you haven't already at the back of
the room Sybil long is there from WBAI
to take whatever you can give we
appreciate every penny acres today who
was returning to his home after years in
exile during the coup as we drove out we
were coming just over a hill before we
arrived in hench and before us were more
than 10,000 people who had streamed out
who had walked for many hours some more
than a day to cook greet this leader of
the peasant movement of Popeye
a man who had been working to bring down
baby doc Duvalier trained hundreds of
peasant organizers over the years
had to leave because of the coup and now
was returning the Haitians could touch
siobhan and they came out to do it and
as he came in a caravan with Basel a
Jean Baptiste and other supporters they
crowded around him they shouted they
danced and they sang and this was the
kind of homecoming that I think many had
hoped would be the scene for our steed
but he had been surrounded by US forces
and shavonne Jean Baptiste wasn't and
that's the kind of support that Siobhan
has out in the countryside because of
his years of working with the peasants
in Haiti and so we very much look
forward to hearing from him today as
he's just flown up to address this group
and to go around the country to talk
about the situation in Haiti right now
when you won't see described on the
front page or even the inner pages of
the New York Times but before we go to
Siobhan and to Noam Chomsky who will be
wrapping up this program today we're
going to turn first to Allan Nairn
a journalist well known to many of you
who's been working in Latin America for
the last 15 years most recently when
working on Haiti returned from a
five-week trip there as Valerie said
he's just recently won the George Polk
award and the James Aronson award for
social justice journalism for his three
part series on Haiti in the Nation
magazine the first one being occupation
Haiti predicting what the occupation
would look like the second being just as
he revealed the connection between the
frapp and immanuel kant's Dahl who
headed up this Haitian paramilitary
organization that has so terrorized the
Haitians over the last few years and the
CIA and other intelligence agencies
within the US government so without
further ado Allen there
thank you
both Valerie and Amy mentioned the the
Oklahoma City bombing and one thing
that's that's very striking about that
is that this is one of those occasions
one of those fairly rare occasions were
Americans people living in this country
are actually able to feel and to see in
a graphic way in experience some of the
emotions that are connected with the
explosion of bombs and the discharge of
guns usually those of us who live in
this country have the political luxury
of being able to think about those
things in abstract
or distant terms especially if you live
in the top two thirds of the society
economically who don't have to worry
about them on the street every morning
and we hear it discussed in Washington
we hear the the pundits and the
politicians talking about on issues of
US policy we link them up with their
counterparts in Haiti we monitor events
in Haiti and we work to pressure the US
government to change its policy but
we're pretty clear that that's a long
struggle and so in the meantime one of
our major foci is to bring the voice of
Haiti's popular movement up to the
United States the voice that's too often
absent from the debate in the United
States about what US policies should be
what the impact of US policy is the
popular movement in Haiti has been
active since 1986 it burgeoned it
brought down the Duvalier dictatorship
it refused in the years after 1986 to
accept duval yer ISM without Duvalier it
was responsible for the election of
Haiti's first democratically
elected president president
jean-bertrand Aristide and its
resistance was the key to president era
Steve's return even if his return did
not occur perhaps in the way that the
popular movement would have envisioned
as we'll hear more about this afternoon
it was the resistance of Haiti's people
and their popular organizations that
forced the international community in
the United States to have to resolve the
question and bring president Aristide
back to Haiti in October of last year
one of the other activities of the MPP
Education and Development Fund is to
facilitate the exchange of technical and
material resources between the community
in the United States and the popular
movement in Haiti and that is not only
material support but also political
support because as we'll be hearing this
afternoon the voices and as I've just
said of the peasants of the workers of
the students of the women of people in
marginalized communities too often don't
make it up here and it's our
responsibility as US citizens whose
government is so involved in Haitian
history to act to counterbalance that
and one of the ways that we can do that
is not only to provide material support
but also to provide political support
without further ado I'd like to turn
over the program to this evening or this
afternoon's moderator that is Miss Amy
Goodman which has already received a
wonderful introduction who I've had the
opportunity and the pleasure to be with
in Haiti and I'm very happy to introduce
her to you today Miss Amy Goodman
I want to thank everyone for coming
today it's nice to know there's someone
on the other end of that microphone when
we wake up in the morning because
valerie has introduced the speakers for
today I just thought I'd share two
experiences very briefly before we go to
our first speaker it was my time in
Haiti I'd gone down to Haiti when
president Aristide was returning and in
the last few days as we've been
preparing for this event and at the same
time some of the motives and some of the
people who may have been behind the
Oklahoma bombing have been becoming
clearer I've had a very strange
experience of a kind of coming together
of the two situations Believe It or Not
the Oklahoma City bombing and Haiti
right after our steed returned there was
a large demonstration against the US
forces in Haiti because of their close
relationship with frappe and how they
were working with the Haitian armed
forces and frapp the paramilitary
organization there there were many
Haitians who were Joe are you okay
there were many Haitians who were
protesting this relationship in a place
called pitty guav and guangwu about an
hour outside of port-au-prince after
this protest I went to ground guav to
meet with the Special Forces where they
were no manager of WBAI and it's my
pleasure to welcome you to this very
special forum called Haiti and
eyewitness report it's being sponsored
by WBAI Pacifica Radio as part of our
35th anniversary 35 years of
extraordinary powerful programming on
issues like Haiti is team or the budget
national elections Nicaragua you name it
WBAI has been there in this event and
for this event our partner has also been
will Montes own Education and
Development Fund
the nation Institute and new channels
communication before we begin this
program a moment of silence for all
those killed everywhere from Oklahoma
City to part of PLAs by hate groups by
fascist movements by paramilitary
organizations that all go by the name of
death squads a moment of silence
hey t as many of you know and it's the
reason you're here today has known this
reality for many more than 40 years
first as the tonton Macoutes and now the
frappe and always the deaths the
beatings the tortures and the dream of
democracy that seems forever ever
deferred but more of that during today's
program it's my pleasure to welcome our
special guests for this program and I'm
going to start out with the speaker who
in fact will cap this program and that's
of course Professor Noam Chomsky scholar
renowned author policy analyst and one
of the best minds on any planet in this
solar system and he's with us today
we also have the distinct pleasure of
hearing Allan Nairn who's a journalist
who is the writer for the Nation
magazine and who just won one of the
most celebrated awards in all of
journalism the George Polk award Allan
Nairn
and we have on the podium one of the
leaders of one of the most important
organizations in terms of protecting
what we've been trying to do for 35
years your First Amendment rights
freedom of expression and freedom of the
press it's our pleasure to have Ron
Daniels on the platform with us today
[Applause]
of course there's a voice and many
voices that you will recognize today and
one of them is the news director who was
covered Nicaragua Mexico especially East
Timor and now very much Haiti WBA is own
news director Amy Goodman
when I was in Haiti in 1985 in 1986 and
1987 1988 covering elections covering
massacres covering bodies on the streets
covering journalists being killed
covering the absolute negation and
denial of the democratic impulses and
struggles of the Haitian people
throughout all those years there was one
man and one name that I heard about that
I saw that I recorded it's almost 10
years now he's the leader of the largest
peasant movement and Haiti is mostly a
peasant country you know about the
illiteracy rate there you know about
much about Haitian history it is the
peasants that are the backbone of the
struggle for democracy have always been
in the forefront for a democratic and
pluralistic Haiti there's nobody like
him and it's our pleasure today he's
come right from Haiti to be at this
event
siobhan Jean Baptiste
before I introduce the other very hard
worker who has been working for Haiti
and many other progressive causes I'd
like to thank many of the WBAI staff who
helped us organize this event including
Louis Henry Sybil Wong summary marksman
on Oh
Freedman many volunteers who helped us
this afternoon and throughout the week
day bursting is here and now I want to
introduce Laurie Richardson who started
working in us on this idea of weeks and
weeks ago she is with movement paisa
Popie in Boston so from Boston to New
York we organized and telephone called
in conferenced and she went to
Washington they did an event there we've
been trying to help each other all the
way along because Haiti is so important
so it is my great pleasure to introduce
the other Co sponsoring organization
here and the other co-worker on this
wonderful event and I'm so glad so many
of you have turned out and that is
Laurie Richardson
it's really great to see everyone here
today in order to dialogue with a very
distinguished panel and to talk about
what lies ahead not only for those of us
that are working on democracy human
rights and economic justice in Haiti but
increasingly all of those issues that
have relevance here in the United States
we of the movement pays on Popeye
education and development fund are very
happy to be here this afternoon to
present the event to you along with WBAI
the nation Institute and new channels
communications we're an organization
that was born in 1990-91
after one of the members of the peasant
movement of Popeye Bosley jean-baptiste
who's seated right over here and who is
an agronomist with the MPP and Chevron
Jean Baptiste brother was blocked out of
Haiti after the coup d'etat and as
activists in Boston talked about how to
make the US public understand what was
happening in Haiti and what the US
government was doing the MPP Education
and Development Fund was begun our
mission is to link efforts for
structural change in Haiti and in the
United States because as we well know
the same struggle that's being waged in
Haiti is a struggle that we are waging
here in the United States we link up
activists in the United States whether
there are people working in the labor
movement people working in the student
movement people working on human rights
people working for station to find out
about their relationship and how they
perceive their relationship with the
people with the Armed Forces and with
FRAP and I met one commander one one of
the soldiers in the Special Forces
trained particularly in
counterinsurgency and after discussing a
few things on mic and on the record
after I closed my mic he started to
really talk he brought me up to the
second floor of the Haitian military
barracks where his office was he closed
the door he took out a stack of papers
there were 89 pieces of paper he
of them a membership application of a
member of frat with their photograph and
their full family history and what they
did he said these are the people we're
working with when I asked him about love
Alice and Eris teed he muttered
communists stone communists and then I
asked him about what he was doing there
then if that's since he was coming back
to shore up our steed and he said that's
a good question he said what these
people are about and what that guy and
the palace is about is redistributing
the wealth expropriating property and
tyranny of the poor getting something
for nothing he talked about the frappe
and the military there as people who had
businesses landowners people who had
something to lose he had told them he
said to stay in their houses he had said
they did not disarm them as long as they
didn't take their weapons into the
streets he had said they were the first
group the frack that he had come that he
had met with ingrown guav that yes the
Haitians who were protesting were right
because he said they were the only
organized responsible group and he
showed me as proof the membership
application as each of each member of
frappe he then went on to talk as the
Sun was going down to rail against the
one-world government
the Socialist World Bank and he got
angrier and angrier as he talked about
the lack of direction in America today
and how he would be leaving the military
because precisely because of what he was
doing in Haiti and he wanted that to
stop and said he would continue to work
with the forces he was in Haiti I said
how many others of the soldiers you work
with there was a group a dozen of them
feel the same way you do and he said 11
of the 12 well certainly the Haitians in
that area understood it he said that the
leader of the lava loss in that area was
in the next town there was a priest
there who's armed who only had half an
arm and he said the leader of the lava
loss is that asshole with a Bible under
his stump that's how he viewed the
overwhelming majority of the people of
Haiti
he called them Street continually
as he talked about them said they were
unemployed and they were students and
they would take whatever they could get
and as this whole week has unfolded with
the Oklahoma bombing I could only think
back to this man as they described the
people possibly involved with the
Oklahoma bombing disgruntled military
men well trained in explosives and use
of weapons and I keep thinking of the
soldier in grogg love the other
experience leads right into today which
is the day after Aristide returned era
steeds return was quite an anticlimax
for many people in Haiti he returned on
a military jet came in spoke behind
plate-glass spoke behind bulletproof
glass the people very far in the
distance kept away from the palace very
different from his inauguration day when
he actually washed the feet of peasants
in the palace to show his connection to
the people of Haiti and may well have
been a disappointment to him but it
certainly was a disappointment to the
people of Haiti as they came out in the
thousands to greet him but were kept far
away by the US forces well the next day
after Aris deed returned we went out on
a five hour drive to hench following
Siobhan Jean Baptiste one of our
