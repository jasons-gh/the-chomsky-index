this film you know embodies search for
ideas and it's executed with the supreme
inventiveness those are the qualities
that make us so happy to the director
Michelle why was because it was just
what was really attracting me is your
scientific work it's always great to see
to be able to capture the image of the
voice of somebody alive with who has
already such a rich legacy because I
watch I was talking about which a fan
man and all these great scientists who
are not here
I wish I had known them and I thought it
would it was important for me to try to
establish it what is your process you
know when you're tackling a scientific
question when you're coming up against
an employer in your work kind of was
like what Michel captured so with such
remarkable artistry in the film that's
usually a matter of going for a walk
thinking about things talking to
somebody hoping that somehow a what
looks paradoxical or impossible will
somehow fall into place how it happens I
don't think anyone knows it's not sure
it's the same when you're anyone is that
creating an artistic work just somehow
comes well the point that Michele
emphasized correctly is at least has
been a driving force to me not for
everyone in the field is to try to show
what oughta be truth try to pretend
straight what ought to be true it ought
to be true for various reasons some of
which indicated in the film that the
basic essential nature of language is
first of all the uniform for all
languages which is why children can
learn any of them and is also
fundamentally very simple and when you
look at the data of language it looks
extremely complex but that's true of
anything you don't understand if there's
anything you don't understand that looks
hopelessly complex the idea is to try to
see if you can extricate from the
complexity fundamental principles which
somehow make things fall into place
which otherwise didn't make any sense
like the one principle that was
mentioned at the end of the film about
to a seeking minimal structural distance
you can pursue that much farther and a
lot of things fall into place including
the the way in which quite complex
sentences are interpreted if you
continue to pursue the idea that there's
just has to be fundamentally simple
processes that interplay in a way which
yields observed complexity so that's the
basic work that I'm involved in
sometimes verifies your answer but I
always have this security to understand
what when I was a kid I cateresa some
didn't work we went to some cult and
Hudson my mother took me to some meeting
that would satisfy me and I found in
science some some constructive answer
that they the idea that you can build
something on the ground that people
agree upon is an astrologist thing that
attracted to norms work philosophy in
this idea that you like French
philosopher they say this thing is in
its fergie and it's it's very abstract
and I think
simple tool that you can I try to agree
on the grounder that so you can build so
in my movies it's not necessary apparent
but I always had this curiosity I don't
want to be corrupting the youth so tell
the truth tell the truth the truth is I
have absolutely no professional
credentials literally which is why I'm
teaching at MIT where they didn't look
that's actually true or they didn't care
no it's a science-based University they
didn't care if you had a guild card and
something or other so uh when he saw a
little of it there but Majed at high
school it was in it was the academic
high school in the city the one that all
the kids went to who were gonna go to
college teachers didn't really have to
work very hard because we were gonna
pass the exams anyway and I couldn't
stand it and essentially never had I
never had much of a formal education
that was one of the greatest education
educational experiences I ever had in
those four years it was at Harvard it
was to have a desk in the stacks and
those days the stacks row but not
anymore
graduate student had a little desk in
the stacks and yet the whole of Widener
Library this amazing library there you
can kind of walk around and pick things
out from all that place things you never
heard of and pursue them that was
fantastic experience I think it's a
great way to get an education I remember
the first time when I saw the first half
of the film to you know um yeah you said
basically at the other actually to get
on my computer as you signify and say I
can agree with it basically was saying
that you agreed with yourself
my own full impression over 75 years of
activism is that the level of energy and
dedication and commitment especially on
part of young people today as as high as
anything I can remember outside of maybe
a few very brief Peaks like maybe 1968
69 but it's quite substantial but you're
right that there are very intensive
pressures to try to beat it back well
actually that was my ten-year-old self I
did used to have nightmares about the
idea that when I die there is a spark of
consciousness which basically creates
the world is the world going to
disappear if this spark of consciousness
disappears and how do I know it won't
how do I know there's anything there
except what I'm conscious of so if this
spark disappears it's all gone later
when I got older I thought that this is
a rather classical concern and a lot of
to the writing and then agony and so on
about it but as you get older you just
realized that that's not true
the world's going to go on your children
will be alive your grandchildren your
friends other people's children the
children of those villagers in Colombia
who you saw there and so on and the
world will go on it'll go on without me
but ok went on for a long time without
me a lot of it goes on without me and
that will continue to happen it's it
just seems like today at least seems
like less and less of a problem as you
get older it becomes easy easy to
understand why this is really not
something to be concerned about
