the war and peace report I'm Amy Goodman
we're talking about the death of the
former prime minister Ariel Sharon who
died Saturday after eight years in a
coma he was 85 years old we are joined
by Professor Noam Chomsky in
Massachusetts by avi schleimann the
Israeli historian at Oxford University
in Britain and were joined here in New
York by Rashid holiday among his books
our brokers of deceit how the US has
undermine peace in the Middle East he's
the Edward C professor of Arab Studies
at Columbia University
you are also Palestinian your response
to the death of RL sharone well for me
the most important emotion is as a sense
of finally the man who carried out a war
in which 20,000 people were killed the
Lebanon War of 1982 who besieged they
who destroyed building after building
killing scores of civilians in a search
to destroy the PLO leadership has
finally left the world
I was invaded with that summer of 1982
and I to me it's it's horrific to watch
The Hague geographies that are being
produced by people like Vice President
Biden by the New York Times by much of
the media about a man who really should
have ended his days at The Hague before
the International Criminal Court he was
a man who from the very beginning of his
career started out killing people as the
commander of unit 101 he was the man who
ordered the fibia massacre explain what
is unit 101 unit 101 was a military unit
of the Israeli army formed at the orders
of the Israeli leadership of the time to
carry out savage reprisal raids but
we're talking about dozens of victims
in retaliation for in this case two or
three people being killed 69 people had
their homes blown up over their heads
this is 1953 in a small village in the
what is today the West Bank the this was
the first condemnation of Israel by
Security Council resolution this is
something that the United States at that
time was willing to say was a was a was
a horrible horrible crime and this is a
man who
since then really has only acted on the
basis of a belief that force is the only
thing the Arabs understand the idea that
he is now considered by some to be a
peacemaker is it's grotesque frankly
Noam Chomsky you wrote the fateful
triangle in response to what happened in
Lebanon it changed the discourse for
many in this country first explain your
reaction to the death of Ariel Sharon
and what we should understand about him
oh you know there is a convention that
you're not supposed to speak ill of the
recently dead which unfortunately
imposes a kind of vow of silence because
there's nothing else to stay there's
nothing good to say what he's - said is
exactly accurate he was a killer he had
one next idea in mind which drove him
all his life a greater Israel as
powerful as possible
a few Palestinians as possible they
should now disappear and in Israel which
could be powerful enough to dominate the
region the Lebanon War then Patricia's
worst crime also had a goal of imposing
a client state in Lebanon a Maronite
client state and these were the driving
forces of his life the idea that the
Gaza evacuation was a controversial step
for peace is almost farcical by 2005 the
Gaza had been devastated and he played a
large role in that as the Israeli Hawks
could understand easily that it made no
sense to keep a few thousand Israeli
settlers in Gaza using a
very large percentage of its land and
scarce water with a huge IDF Israeli
army contingent to protect them
what made more sense was to take them
out and place them in the West Bank or
the Golan Heights illegal that could
have been done very simply they could
have the Israeli army could have
announced that on August 1st
they're leaving Gaza in which case the
settlers that would have piled into the
trucks that were provided to them which
would take them from their subsidized
homes and Gaza to illegal subsidized
homes and other territories Israel
intended to keep and that would have
been the end of it but instead a what
Israeli sociologist called Barth
kimberlyn called an absurd theater it
was constructed to try to demonstrate to
the world that there cannot be any
further evacuations the the the farce
was a successful public relations effort
Joseph Biden's comments illustrate that
it was particularly farcical when you
recognize that it was a virtual replay
of what happened in 1982 when Israel was
compelled to withdraw from the Egyptian
Sinai and carried out an operation that
the Israeli press ridiculed this
operation national drama 1982 we have to
show the world how much we're suffering
by carrying out an action that will
benefit our power and our security and
it that was the peacemaking effort but
his his career is one of the
remitting brutality dedication to the
fixed ideas is life he doubtless showed
the courage and commitment to pursuing
this ideal which is an ugly and the
horrific one um
lavish lime go back to 1982 and what
happened in Lebanon first where were you
in 1982 Ariel Sharon was defense
minister in Menachem Begin 's government
and he was the architect of the invasion
of Lebanon and it was a war of deception
because Iran tricked his cabinet
colleagues into launching this operation
by pretending the aims were very
limited.we is in fact he had a big plan
to completely change the birdurer
politics of the region to create a new
order in Lebanon but by helping Israel's
Maronite Christian allies to come to
power in Lebanon and then sign a peace
treaty with Israel then to expel the
Syrian forces from Lebanon and to
replace Syrian with Israeli hegemony in
the Levant this war of deception ended
in tears he didn't achieve any of its
grandia's geopolitical objectives and it
ended also with the massacre in the
refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila there
was an Israel there was an israeli
community commission of inquiry which
found defense minister
wrong is responsible for failing to
prevent the massacre of the Palestinian
refugees by Israel's Christian allies
and Sharon was forced to step down he
was fired as Minister of Defense and no
one could have guessed at that time how
a man who was found unfit to serve as
Minister of Defence would bounce back as
Israel's prime ministers but this is all
of the peace in Sharon's career as a
soldier and as a politician because as
Professor Holly D pointed out Sharon
committed his first war crime as a young
major in 1953 when he destroyed many
houses in the Jordanian village of
Gibeah and he was responsible for the
massacre of 69 civilians so that was his
first war crime but it was not to be his
last and the consistent thread in his
career as a soldier and as a politician
was to use brute force not just against
the regular armies of the Arab states
but also against Palestinian civilians
and the other consistent thread is to
shun diplomacy and to rely on brute
force to impose israeli hegemony on the
entire region President George W Bush
famously called Sharon a man of peace
Sharon was nothing of the sort
he was a man of war through and through
and he called his autobiography warrior
not diplomat I his approach to diplomacy
reversed Clausewitz's dictum for sure on
diplomacy was the pursuit of war by
other means for the last 40 years the
arab-israeli conflict has been my main
research interest and I can honestly say
that I have never come across a single
scintilla of evidence to support the
notion of her own as a man of peace I
wanted to go back to 1982 the Commission
report you refer to Ava's lime and ask
Noam Chomsky about the kahan Commission
and what it is they found and how it is
that Ariel Sharon actually survived
politically beyond that the Commission
did condemn her run for what they called
indirect responsibilities where the
sovereignity lie Massacre the current
Commission I think was really a
whitewash it tried to give as soft as
possible and interpretation of what was
in fact a horrifying massacre actually
one that should resonate with people who
are familiar with Jewish history it was
almost a replica of the kitchen of
massacre in in pre secretary first world
war Russia one of the worst atrocities
and Israeli memories led to a famous at
the nationalist poem by the main israeli
poet
- Bialik city of killing these ARS army
had surrounded this town and allowed the
people within it to rampage killing Jews
for
for three days and they killed 45 people
and that was pretty much what happened
in Cyprus jet Tila Israeli army
surrounded it I sent in the Falange US
forces were obviously bent on murder
these were the Lebanese Christian forces
living his Christian and terrorist force
allied with Israel the soldiers watched
they illuminated it they felt the matter
they watched for several days while they
murdered not 45 people but somewhere
Israel claims 800 other analyses go up
to the several thousand that's the
subarray Aquila Massacre the idea of the
children had in direct responses are in
Italy was bitterly condemned
internationally for direct
responsibility that's in fact one of the
events that set off the huge flow of
refugees from Eastern Europe including
my father among others the so this was a
kind of a replica except far more brutal
and vicious and Sharon escaped more than
a mild century true that he was removed
as a defense minister but it wasn't long
before he came back and it's that's one
of a number of extremely shocking
incidents in his career I'm Amy Goodman
