my name is Eric Roland and I represented
the organizers of this very special
event I am very pleased to see all and
it's a great privilege that noam chomsky
has agreed to come to Utrecht and
deliver a lecture to our students on
responsibility and integrity the dilemma
we face the primary goal of our
humanities lecture series is to motivate
our students to look beyond their
disciplines become aware of broader
connections and to enable them to play
the role in society that our society
needs to be able to distinguish what's
going on under behind the surface this
crucial awareness is what we as
organizers I convinced non-toxic lecture
will help to develop an awareness of
what is hidden beyond the facades of
institutional Newsweek and that's why
we're here together what does a brain of
a Dean of humanities look like when it's
asked to introduce Noam Chomsky an
earring Roland asked me I thought this
is a chance of a lifetime and
immediately called my colleague at the
Medical Center with an ambulance they
took me to the seven Tesla and started
the MRI procedure clearly we could see
that there were several functions in the
brain activated at different stages
first of all the large area of proudness
in the left part lightened up years
later this Dean would be able to say to
everyone in the nursing home time and
again
I introduce Noam Chomsky the only thing
the Dean hoped for was that by then the
nurses would be so kind to believe him
then the brain activity moved to the
right part near the area of despair
introducing now Chomsky was a hopeless
and even impossible enterprise anything
that would come out at the deans mouth
would be hopelessly irrelevant for
everybody in the audience since everyone
knew who he was proved even before
eating the pudding was that it took only
two seconds before all seeds for this
event was sold close to this area the
small spot of Hope flared up yes maybe
there was one listener who did not know
which own ski was the Dean would design
his speech exclusively for that one lost
poor and wandering soul as the skin
preceded the Dean started designing his
academic and therefore familien it
introduction it would give the audience
the titles of the books Noam Chomsky had
ridden for that's what all scholars do
that someone who needs to be introduced
first they name the title then they give
a short description of the content and
finally they give a brief overview of
the impact the books had made lying in
the seventh Tesla the Dean took a cell
phone and called Eric how much time did
he have for his introduction five
minutes here at replied but I need at
least five hours the Dean cried out Noam
Chomsky has published 105 books between
1957 when syntactic structure saw the
light and october last year 2010 when
gaza in crisis appeared so one hour for
reading the titles and the second hour
for giving in
description of the content not only
linguistics but also philosophy like
power and ideology from 1987 or the
Chomsky Foucault debate from 2006 but
not only philosophy but also a political
theory like American power and the new
mandarins from nineteen sixty-nine to
failed States the abuse of power and the
assaulted and democracy from not 2006
and the other three hours the Dean
needed for discussing the impact they
would have to limit himself to only a
tiny part of this world the Netherlands
Europe the United States and the Middle
East when the scan was finished to Dean
walked out of the hospital like a new
man his brains felt clear and totally
blank like fresh fallen snow he knew the
opening line of his introductory speech
he would say dear professor Chomsky that
was the idea and then he would read a
poem where one of his most beloved poets
mark strand it was called the idea
for us to there was a wish to possess
something beyond the world we knew
beyond ourselves beyond our power to
imagine something nevertheless in which
we might see ourselves and this desire
came always in passing in waning light
and in such cold that ice on the valleys
lakes cracked and rolled and blowing
snow covered what are three soul and
seems from the past and the surfaced
again look not as they had but ghostly
and white among false curves and hidden
oratius and never once did we feel we
were close until the night wind said why
do this especially now go back to the
place you belong and there appeared with
its windows glowing small in the
distance and the frozen reaches a cabin
when we stood before it amazed at its
being there and would have gone forward
and opened the door and stepped into the
globe and warmed ourselves there but
that it was ours by not being hours and
should remain empty that was the idea
professor Chomsky welcome
not used to such eloquent introductions
that makes it a hard act to follow the
term intellectuals in the modern sense
in the sense in which we now use it that
pretty much came into the conventional
usage with the Dreyfus arts in the late
19th century and they're now very much
honored for their courage and standing
up for justice and human rights the
howre is worth remembering that the
Dreyfus are a small minority the great
mass of intellectuals in France and
elsewhere supported the state and that's
pretty typical in fact that helps us
distinguish two interpretations of the
common phrase responsibilities of
intellectuals one interpretation has to
do with the functions the tasks the role
that they actually fulfill question of
fact another question value of what role
sure they fulfill it would be nice to
say that the answer to these two
questions is the same but in fact what
the rather breath typical situation is
what in fact was illustrated by the by
the Dreyfus art example if you go a few
years beyond into the early years of the
last century World War one the
intellectual classes on all sides
passionately supported their own States
in in the First World War there were a
few exceptions as there always are in
England Bertrand Russell and Germany
resolution
karl liebknecht in the United States
eugene debs they all ended up in jail
which reflects another aspect of
intellectual life of those who depart
from the assigned task support for power
framing of issues to provide
justifications for power they usually
suffer in one way or another how how
they suffer depends on the character of
the state but it's it's pretty common so
for example in the Soviet Union in the
old Soviet Union in the postal and urine
it did the intellectually we call
dissidents were treated pretty badly for
example in Czechoslovakia Vaslav Havel
was jailed house arrest insulted condemn
similarly in in the other countries of
Eastern Europe sometimes worse but that
was the typical situation well that was
bad but it could have been worse so for
example hvala and his associates could
have had their brains blown out by elite
check forces the fresh from training in
the Soviet Union who already had tens of
thousands of bloodied victims of their
credit but that's not invented that's
what happened in exactly the same time
in u.s. domains that happened to be in
El Salvador one week after the fall of
the Berlin Wall the daily unit of the
salvadoran army fresh from training at
the John F Kennedy special warfare
school in North Carolina on the explicit
orders of the government than the High
Command which has since surface broke
into the University Jesuit University
killed the rector six leading Jesuit
intellectuals major figures in Latin
American intellectual life blew the
brains out killed their housekeeper and
daughter because the orders were not to
leave any victims and then escaped the
this battalion had already killed that
had a bloody role of victims in the
preceding ten years there were ten years
of major atrocities beginning with the
assassination of an archbishop reading
mass called the voice for the voiceless
Archbishop Romero and plenty of
religious martyrs in between plenty of
intellectuals attacked and killed in
between many escaped many escaped to
Nicaragua which in the 1980s was kind of
like Paris in the 1930s the place where
people escaped from the terror states
surrounding them then it was Stalinist
Russia Nazi Germany in the 1980s it was
the various terror states that the u.s.
was funding supporting and and
participating in their crimes the
