I started from the beginning with
Aristotle's politics which is kind of
the foundation for most subsequent
political theory and pointed out that he
assumed that at them it's mostly a lot
of it's about democracy and he took it
for granted that a democracy would be a
fully participatory and that it would
aim for the common good but that in
order to achieve that the democracy
would have to be what we today call a
welfare state and which would ensure
lasting prosperity for the poor relative
equality and moderate but sufficient
property for everyone if there are
extremes of who are enriched or if you
don't account if you don't make sure
that there's lasting prosperity for
everyone then you can't talk seriously
about a democracy and he went on to and
then I mentioned that that idea was runs
right through the good bit of the
tradition up and to all cut through the
Enlightenment and classical liberalism
including the major figures like the
Tocqueville than Adam Smith and others
you know is just kind of assumed
Jefferson and so on there's another
point that Aristotle made which took a
little twist in our own constitutional
system he pointed out that if you had a
perfect am i this is kind of theoretical
this discussion in part if you have a
perfect democracy
and you do have you haven't granted
blasting prosperity to the poor and you
do have big differences of of wealth
very rich and very small number very
rich and a large number of very poor in
that case in a perfect democracy the
poor will use their democratic rights to
take away the property the rich and he
regards that as unjust and if it is
unjust there two possible solutions one
is to eliminate poverty the other is to
eliminate democracy well James Madison
who was no fool noticed the same problem
but hid end whereas Aristotle solution
you know a couple of thousand years
earlier was to eliminate poverty
Madison's was to eliminate democracy so
he discusses quite explicitly in the
Constitutional Convention that we have
this problem that if we do have
democracy then the majority of the poor
may will use their power to do things
like what we would nowadays call
agrarian reform and that can't be
tolerated that would be unjust since the
goal of the primary goal of government
is in his words to protect the minority
of the opulent against the majority and
in order to any he also no fool again
pointed out that over time as time goes
on this problem is going to get worse
because there's going to be a growing
percentage of a part of the population
that will suffer from the serious
inequities of the society and will
secretly long for a more equal equitable
distribution of life's blessings and if
they have the vote they may do something
about it which is unacceptable
not for Aristotle's reasons but because
it would threaten the wealth and power
of the opulent mine our
so he therefore designed a system which
is pretty stable in which you would make
sure that democracy didn't function that
does he put it power would be in the
hands of the more capable set of men
those who hold the wealth of the nation
and the rest would be factionalized and
marginalized in various ways so that's
one solution therefore the problem is
real I mean if you I mean though that
whether you decide it's a problem or not
is another question but the fact is
correct if you have a democratic system
with a with large inequities of wealth
and the great majority is impoverished
and doesn't have access to to that and
secretly sighs for a more equitable
share of life's blessings in Madison's
words then they all probably do
something about it and they have
mechanisms in a democracy that part is
correct which means they will threaten
the rights of the wealthy to control the
property and remember property rights
are not like other rights
contrary to what Madison and other and a
lot of modern political theory says if I
have the right of free speech doesn't
interfere with your right of free speech
but if I have property that interferes
with your right to have that property
you don't have it I have it so the right
to property is very different from the
right to freedom of speech this is some
often put very misleading ly about
rights of property property has no right
but if we just make sense out of this
maybe there is a right to property one
could debate that but it's very
different from other rights and it is
surely the case that if the majority
lacks
the property and his suffering and
secretly desires a more equitable
distribution they have mechanisms to do
something about it that's right and as I
say there were two solutions the
classical one was to eliminate poverty
the one on which our own society was
founded was to eliminate democracy
that's sort of worth understanding and
it takes various forms over the years
but the problem never ends and we're
facing it right now I mean if a
democratic society were allowed to
function it's extremely unlikely that
the things that are now called
inevitable results of the market would
ever be tolerated because they simply
concentrate wealth and power and harm
the vast majority there's certainly a
reason for people to tolerate that
against this backdrop of globalization
and the growth and power of
transnational corporations what actions
should be taken to reverse this process
depends what time span and range you're
thinking of I mean there's you read
constantly that this is somehow
inevitable no way to stop it like Thomas
Friedman and yesterday's times or
whatever it was people who just mocks
people who say you can do something
about this well that's certainly not
true for one thing we should be aware of
the scale of globalization in many ways
the what's called globalization is
bringing about a situation which is not
unlike what it was when said at the
early part of the century if you look at
gross measures like say trade and
investment flow and so on its relative
to the economy it's about its getting
back to more or less where it was like
the one major change is the style of
financial flows
which is extremely fast and overwhelms
governments and so on okay that's new
but there's nothing inevitable about
that that's public policy I mean it
resulted from two major things one a
decision to break down the system of
regulated currencies which is a policy
decision made first by the Nixon
administration and another by the
telecommunications revolution which is
just the normal form of public
investment and public public cost in the
pub of the public assuming vast costs
and risks and then handing it over to
private power to use but this these
aren't things that are at all inevitable
the fact that the whole system is coming
to resemble in many ways what it was
early in the century apart from things
like this that's been made quite
mainstream circles incidentally it's not
a unusual idea though big differences
are crucial but under control now
beyond that the almost about
three-quarters of the international
transactions like trade for example an
investment and so on are within Europe
United States and Japan okay these are
all areas where in principle at least
mechanisms already exist which allow the
public to control what happens that
aside transnational corporations are
also a public gift they were created
their rights the rights of corporations
altogether were created mostly by the
judicial system they were granted
extraordinary rights early in this
century public doesn't have to agree to
that in fact they don't have to exist at
all all of us with input under public
control that aside
maybe we've talked about this if you
look at the top transnationals they rely
very heavily on public subsidy in fact
about going the major study that exists
about 20% of them wouldn't even survive
that wouldn't wasn't for public
takeovers well all of this is under
control in principle up to the long-term
goal which i think has very deep roots
and working-class movements and
enlightenment thought even in classical
liberalism that these institutions have
no right to exist at all they're
fundamentally illegitimate and they're
not a law of nature you know the fact
their current form is rather reason they
can be changed like other oppressive
institutions have been changed so what
are the limits without limit but where
do you see the fissures where do you see
those openings where we're popular
resistance can be mobilized around well
right now without anybody calling for it
about 95% of the population which is not
small thinks that corporations should
sacrifice profits for the benefit of
their work of working people and their
communities
well that's 95 percent is a good place
to start now I don't see why notice that
that call presupposes their their right
to rule it says be kinder 95 percent of
the public thinks they should be more
benevolent autocrat all right that's
place to start let's make them more
benevolent autocrat but I think that
same 95 percent can easily recover and
may indeed already have the point of
view that has been articulated all the
way through the working class movements
but they don't have any right to rule at
all it's not that they should be more
benevolent autocrat they shouldn't there
should be no autocratic structures so to
repeat what middle hands were saying
around here about 150 years ago those
who work in the mills went on
okay so we move from the idea that the
autocrats should be more benevolent
which is direct and fair to the question
of whether there should be a lot of
Craddock structures and I don't think
that's a long move
