well Noam Chomsky there's a really a
great pleasure and honor to welcome you
to Darwin castle to the University of
Durham and to the North East of England
when I mentioned to people that you were
going to come here
the excitement was palpable the Twitter
feeds which I by the way I don't follow
were apparently very excited and there's
been a great build-up really to your
visit but I everyone knows in a sense
Noam Chomsky we know you're formidable
scholarly achievements and your activism
but I thought it would be quite
interesting to spend 20 minutes half an
hour with you just talking about how you
got to be a political figure so I
thought I might start by asking you
about where you came from about your
family how you grew up and whether you
were always a publicly engaged recall we
always political as a young person my
parents were immigrant
my father fled from right near Kiev from
the people who are now in power so in
1913 right before the first world war my
mother came as a baby couple years
earlier I grew up in there a Jewish
family they lived in a kind of a Jewish
cultural ghetto not a physical ghetto
but there they were both Hebrew teachers
my father was uber scholar and the
environment in which they lived was
essentially Jewish cultural ghetto I
don't think they had any non-jewish
friends for example the they didn't know
it but we lived in a community that was
mostly German and Irish and very
anti-semitic so I grew up on the streets
and sort of running away from the tough
Irish kids and I remember a beer parties
and
Paris ville for example they were quite
for a Nazi and but my parents were
oblivious to this said no conception but
anything like this was happening those
days children and parents didn't talk to
each other I grew up in the depression
that the family was mostly unemployed
working-class and earliest memories are
childhood memories or people coming to
the door trying to sell rags riding on a
trolley with my mother and watching
passing a textile strike where the
police are beating people
bloody I'm talking with my relatives
about their lives uncle my uncle was a
had a newsstand which he himself had
never gone past about fourth grade but
very self educated self educated and
very cultivated person his newsstand
became a kind of a center of discussion
and debate a lot of em agrees and I sell
papers there and listened and so on and
by the time I was about 11 or 12 my
parents would we lived in Philadelphia
but my parents would allow me to go to
New York by myself stay with my
relatives I spent a lot of time and in
in those days Union Square in New York
used to be a center for radical offices
for our writers didn't you know other
Danica's to Jewish anarchist office
others and the street going down below
it 4th Avenue now all gentrified used to
have a lot of small bookstores many of
them run by recent dem agrees some of
them the ones I happen to be attracted
to by immigration Spain and I very
quickly got quite interested in the
Spanish Civil War in a particular in the
anarchist movement and
spam in fact the first article I
remember writing was which I can date
precisely was right after the fall of
Barcelona so it was February 1939 and it
was kind of a lament about the spread of
fascism over Europe I'm sure it was not
very profound
I hope it's disappeared forever but that
was the topic at least but and from then
on it was more or less the same when the
the second world war broke out right
after that so that became a big issue
I was rather I'm a variant anti-fascist
but critical of a lot of the way in
which the war was framed and fought as
I'm sure you know in the United States
there was a differentiated attitude
towards the Germans and the Japanese the
Germans were bad people you know that's
what the propaganda was but they were
not unlike us the Japanese were just
vermin they had to be destroyed and
crushed and the racism was just
incredible you know it's a number of us
were quite critical of that in fact the
high school where I was happened to be
right next to a prisoner of war camp the
barbed wire separating them and there
was the students in school would during
recess would go out and sort of mock the
prisoners and you know talk to them
across and a number of us tried to we're
quite opposed to that kind of stuff that
they look they're human beings like us
they were drafted they didn't make
choice and then went on when the British
took Advaita Greece it was very violent
brutal was strongly opposed to that but
a group of students
it just went on from there if I could
just clarify a little bit but it sounds
like your parents you make it very clear
actually your parents were not really
but we're not political they were had
little awareness of what was going on
around them
so was this something about the values
of your background that you know you you
you were you were an immigrant who came
from an immigrant family you were
something of an outsider so you were
both over the US but outside the US at
the same time do you think that tension
in a young person helped illuminate
things that you might not some others
may not have seen because it sounds like
from the beginning you had a critical
edge that is to say a critical awareness
of the circumstances of your life well
my parents were conventional Roosevelt
Democrats there were splits and the
Jewish community at the time there was a
Hebraic and it exists my parents for
both of them their native language was
Yiddish but I never heard of you
wouldn't talk it because they were on
the Hebrew side of the cult overcometh
and the revival of Hebrew my father was
a dedicated Zionist but in a sense
that's not considered Zionism today he
was a follower of
hadam who wanted to create a cultural
center in Palestine that would be the
revived Diaspora culture and so on and
revival of Hebrew was a natural part of
it his own he himself was Eber scholar
did a work medieval even grammar that je
ah they say she's a connection or when I
was kid I read his thesis but and that
was their world and I was part of that
of course my father from childhood
Friday night that we were together
literature
19th century they studied the Bible and
so forth but the other side of my life
was my own political interests which
came from elsewhere by the time you are
a young man at university how would you
characterize your your your kind of
political engagement I mean you
obviously were steeped in a diversity of
radical backgrounds
you've already described being drawn to
the Spanish anarchists but I wonder has
your political views developed whether
you whether you understood yourself to
be working within a framework within a
tradition or were you carving something
out that was distinctive from the more
or less from the beginning well I was it
was a very lively period remember the
late 1930s early days but not not like
subsequent theories at all and there was
every I mean I I would spend Saturday
afternoons and the Philadelphia Public
Library which for some reason had every
imaginable radical publication and I
just been working through these every
conceivable cult yes
by the time I was say 12 or 13 I was an
anti Bolshevik leftist daddy blow
through it from the left and so it was I
was a lot of my own personal commitments
actually were involved with what was
then called Zionism what would now be
called a desires and a commitment to
working for Arab Jewish cooperation and
a bi-national Palestine based on
working-class institutions and
cooperations of a kind of quasi and in
his time which is not as exotic as it
may sound today then it was maybe not
realistic but not off the planet you
know
and but I can and there was a one of the
Zionist groups was pretty close to this
in some respects at Romero it's a year
but I could never join them because they
were split between Trotskyite and in
Stalinist and I was supposed to both of
them so it's kind of hovered around the
fringes other than that it was a there
were I wasn't alone there were people
but not a lot
look looking back now from where you are
today and your extraordinary history
both as an academic but there's a public
intellectual and critic critic of
American engagements imperialism's the
war machines say American self-interest
our region's own how would you say your
views today are different from you know
they were when you were a young man I
mean what are the big changes that you
that you with would register as you know
formative of the chomsky today looking
back now I was late enough not not much
in principle of course I know a lot more
of the vision better then yeah I mean
for example at the time Second World War
I was and I had a kind of skeptical
attitude toward the Pacific War yeah but
it was only later that I learned about
the intricacies of the background and
what drove Japan to become a brutal
violent imperialist power the West had
plenty of considerable role in that the
British and the Americans and the same
in other domains so what kind of
fundamental principles other than kind
of sharpening modifying some extinct
evidence it said there weren't any
trigger points like the Vietnam War
which was because I was in the u.s. of
course during the last part of the
Vietnam War I remember in 1974 the sense
of celebrations when that was seen that
the war was coming to an end
you wouldn't describe the Vietnam War or
any successive events as as critical in
changing your kinds of engagements in
the way you stood out a little changes
for example uh August 6th 1945 it was a
change I was a counselor in the summer
camp the Hebrew speaking camp and the
news one morning that was announced that
her Shiva get bombed by an atom bomb and
I was shocked and even more shocked by
the fact that nobody cared
people listened and went on to the next
activity and I think I was so shocked
they just took off by myself walked off
into the woods and sat there for a
couple hours and disappeared and that I
mean I realized at that time I think
nobody could fail to realize that we're
now facing the possibility and the
likelihood of destroying ourselves that
was a significant change the Vietnam War
II I'm gonna follow that in the late
forties in the early 50s which was the
crucial period you didn't really know
then what we know now about the internal
deliberations they've been revealed
later
but in by about 19 and 61 or so when in
1961 Kennedy shortly escalated the war
the that was barely reported but there
was enough there were enough kid bits
coming through so you could see what was
happening he sent the American Air Force
to carry out bombing in South Vietnam
under South Vietnamese cover Tory
initiated chemical warfare to destroy
crops and ground cover began the
programs of rounding people up and into
what amounted to concentration camps
huge again what was clear that a
substantial escalation was going on and
I kind of debated with myself as to how
deeply to become involved I had enough
political experienced and
I just can't put one foot in if you
start involvement it's going to take
over and I had a pretty comfortable life
I had a young family I had a it was a
professor at MIT kind of job that I
liked did the research I wanted them I
knew perfectly well that if I get
involved in this this is going to change
and I thought about it for a while but
it did become involved at the time that
was a very lonely commitment if he
wanted to give a talk on the Vietnam War
say in 1963 it would be in somebody's
living room or a church with four people
just to illustrate you came later 74 if
the first there was an international day
of protest against the war in October
1965 and there we had an anti-war group
at the time we decided to have a
demonstration on the Boston Common
you know the tattered place for
political action there was a
demonstration but it was completely
broken up by counter demonstrators in
fact we were not supposed to be one of
the speaker's nobody could be heard we
were rescued actually by a big state
police contingent didn't like us but
didn't want people to be killed on the
blossom Parliament you take a look at
the Boston Globe the next day the
liberal newspaper bitterly denouncing
the demonstrators how dare you raise a
question about the bombing of North
Vietnam the next international day of
protest was March 1966 and we realized
we couldn't have a public demonstration
so we arranged it in a church around
intense research which was one of the
Centers of anti-war activity church was
attacked you know that's that's what the
mood was like then yeah by 1965 I was
organizing one of the people organizing
national
the tax resistance and in 1966 we began
to work and I as a group called resist
still exists which was involved in a
variety of forms of anti-war resistance
in fact that came up for trial in 1968 I
was probably gonna face a long jail
sentence but the Tet Offensive came
along and the government called off the
trials but it was a pretty serious
involvement for years I was staking out
a large part of my time and effort I
think Jack Rawls who you yes studied
with was one of the people who supported
the resistance but quietly wasn't a
person who was much engaged I'm mindful
that we have limited time so I've got
really two questions I want to ask you
already the first one is given that you
are very formed well formed figuring it
warmest by the time we get to the late
60s what was your how did you appraise
the rise of the not just the civil
rights movement the 68 is the explosion
of political engagement in the US and
Europe at that time and now looking back
at that you know was how would you
characterize the 68 period and its
impact in your political life well I 68
my feeling was it was declining
I was not overwhelmed that at all by the
68 events I thought they were mostly
negative the civil rights movements a
different different case yeah it and its
history is very revealing that gee I
went down to the South for a
demonstration and gentlemen but when you
say if you listen to the orations on
Martin Luther King Day if you you'll
notice that they stopped with his I have
a dream speech in Washington that's not
where Martin Luther King stopped he then
moved on to class issues and to the
north to racism and the north and to
develop he was when he was assassinated
he was
he was supporting a a sanitation workers
strike and he was about to organize a
poor people's movement not on the basis
of race just a poor people's movie and
there was to be a march on Washington
that should took place after his
assassination they set up a tent city in
Washington and tried to appeal for
legislation tensed he was smashed up by
the police and they were driven out of
Washington Martin Luther King lost his
liberal support when he turned the
classes and that part of his life has
kind of disappeared you know it's there
but it's not what's right not has been
that's quite a revealing fact that
northern liberals were perfectly happy
to have him condemned racist sheriffs in
Alabama but not to deal with issues of
class in the north and this is an amid
this was shifting in the mid 60s the
anti-war movement had a different
trajectory it was building up and it did
peak in about 68 69 and became a quite a
significant movement India surely
affected the course of the war but by
the sixty-eight was being split yeah and
the move and the anti-war movement
itself the student movement was breaking
up into a Maoist element PL the
regressive labor and weathermen which
were kind of let's overcome the state by
breaking up way they thanked windows and
so on and a lot of sectarianism and it
was a it was kind of dissolved you know
way that I thought it was dangerous
actually one of the main movements they
developed and the one that had in the
long-term the greatest impact on the
society was the women's movement which
was just barely beginning to take off in
the late 60s as an organized movement of
course origins go way back and then by
the 70s it was a major for yeah III make
a distinction um in thinking about the
impact of social movements between those
social movements which are on the one
hand egalitarian but on the other hand
they are seeking in a sense equal access
into the system itself so you could say
the civil rights movement and partly
some wrong elements of the women's
movement were engaged in winning equal
rights and equal opportunities and one
reason we might say they were successful
and had been successful in in certain
profound ways is that you can appeal to
the system to live up to its principles
to ensure as it were equal opportunity
to allow space for the civil rights
movement in the women's movement to
flourish in contrast with social
movements that come let's say later like
occupy which seek to change the agenda
and the structure as it were of global
financial markets financial capitalism
American and Germany and so forth and
there the issue is not access on equal
terms as it were but the transformation
of the organizational principles of the
system and there it's much harder to
have an impact it's harder to change
that agenda and occupy today as is not
the force it will it was so I wanted to
ask you now I mean I mean looking back
on your time in public engagement as on
would you say that was a valid
distinction or not and would you say
looking back at that in a sense um is it
its extrude you agree that the
transformation of you know Western
capitalism as we know it and the
structure of financial capitalism
is a much tougher nut to crack than is
it were winning equal opportunities
however important that is as it were
within the structure I think the the
women's movement goes beyond seeking
equal opportunities
it was also breaking down attitudes
deseeded attitudes that justified
oppression and domination yeah
well have really internalized by the
victims in case a large part of the
women's movement was overcoming the
internalization of the sense that you
must be repressed and dominated indeed
so if you asked my grandmother say
whether she was repressed she would not
have known which we're talking yes
that's like asking directly you know
maybe the rest my mother she would know
but didn't think it was anything you
could do about it
if you ask my daughter there's three out
of the house that's a big that's a huge
that's a major change again women and
also men so I think it's it's more than
just equal access yeah as far as the
civil rights movement is concerned it's
it's it's a much more complex issue you
take a look at afferent african-american
history there were slaves in 1620 it's a
long period slavery formally ending with
the Civil War but about ten years later
it was reconstituted it was in a
different form
it was reconstituted by a the post
reconstruction or south compact which
essentially granted the South II thority
to do what they liked so what they did
was criminalized black life if a black
man is standing on a corner he could get
a he'd be fined ten dollars for vagrancy
which you couldn't pay in prison forever
and so on it created a new slave labor
force a large part of the American
industrial revolution was based on slave
labor coming out of the prison
and that lasted it was not a small
component it was you know we're familiar
with the chain gangs that's the
agricultural part but it was a mining
steel a significant part of the
industrial revolution of the late 19th
early 20th century it changed at the
time when the Second World War came the
there were you know there were jobs
there was an immigration to the north
there was plenty of labor you had then
about 20 or 30 years in which blacks had
relative freedom a black man could get a
job in the auto industry
it was unionized then so you have a
fairly decent job by home he sent his
kid to college and everything and the
civil rights movement encapsulated that
and formalized some of those rights and
expanded that did give equal rights but
after that it started the return again
by now take a look at the by the method
that was what actually happened since
about nineteen late seventies primarily
since Reagan is recriminate take a look
at the incarceration system and shop
until about 1980 the percentage of the
population that was in prison in the
United States is pretty much like the
Western world little on the high end but
after that it just zooms up mostly black
men by now Hispanic men some women and
it's essentially recreating the system
that was constructed in the from the
late 19th century so access to free
access is it's true for a small sector
yeah but not for the masses of black
coffee I mean these are very important
points
but that's a coupon yeah let's take acid
III think occupy was a reformist
movement right they were not saying
let's dissolve the financial sector they
were saying things like let's impose a
financial transaction tax quite that's
easily accommodated it is in the
existing institutions in fact it exists
in the end but an occupied was really a
tactic not a movement yeah it was
important but it is a tactic and you
can't carry out a tactic beyond a
certain point well let me put the
question differently to you
we've just you know lived through one of
the biggest financial calamities in
which nearly pushed the system off the
edge certainly one of the biggest since
the Great Depression
in in many sense the burdens of this
crisis had been absorbed taken off the
private sector and resorbed into the
public sector and pushed back onto the
relatively immobile population and
higher taxes if you are city traders
today in London what's changed they will
say very little in other words somewhat
as Mark said the state is a committee
for managing the affairs of the
bourgeoisie and if their huge cost to
bear they are passed on to thee the
movement speed the middle classes and
working classes the labor movement today
is weaker than it's been for some time
the system of industrial and commercial
capitalism is global the rise of Asian
is partly their success in engaging with
this economic system China brings
together two of the greatest ideologies
of the 20th century nationalism and
capitalism into a successful re-entry
into the global order where is the the
spirit of what carries the spirituals
the spirit of criticism today what
carries the spirit of Christmas today of
that complex system that now global
system of capitalism labor movements
certainly in relation to this seem
weaker than and more disorganized than
ever before would you agree with that or
not it's a liberal movement is
wicker that it has been but you know
this is a cyclic pattern I take the
United States again there was quite a
powerful labor movement in the late 19th
century early very powerful was taking
over it was running cities in western
Pennsylvania I saw a very substantial it
was pretty much smashed by Woodrow
Wilson on the ridge squeeze scared and
the first word pushed for a war period
1920s labor it was essentially dead one
of the great labor historians David
Montgomery has a book called I think
it's called the fall of the house of
labor he's talking about the 1920s I was
serious decline 1930s it revived and it
was the vital force that basically
spurred the New Deal legislation CIO
organizing and sit-down strike future
very frightening to management because
they're just a step before taking over
the factory and that did lead to welfare
state legislation of a significant kind
immediately afterwards there was a
business reaction by the late 1930s it
began that's when you had the movement
for scientific methods of strike
breaking and so on it was put on hold
during the war after the war had started
enforce strong taft-hartley 1947 huge
propaganda efforts to which are quite
astonishing scale to try to turn the
population against labor labor made its
own mistakes of the American labor
movement the tried to make a compact
with capital will work together you know
and that compact will be called off by
business as soon as they want to and the
labor movement began its decline at that
point by now in the United States
so maybe 7% less than 7% of the
a private of the private workforce
public sector unions are still more
protected but they're under attack if
that's happened before and it could
revive again and in fact it is reviving
again in an interesting way
so if you go to there's a in the old
Rust Belt say northern Ohio Indiana
there's a revival of something new a
worker owned enterprises so take a young
step it take Youngstown Ohio was a major
steel town in 1977 or so the US Steel
decided to close down the it's
Youngstown enterprises as a town that
was built by the labor movement all
surrounding the steeple with all the way
everything proliferate from it and so on
the Union wanted to buy this steel
company and take it over the steel
executives didn't want to do it went to
the courts Union lost but they didn't
give up
they moved towards small-scale worker
owned enterprises which are now
proliferating in northern Ohio that's a
possible germ of an alternative form of
of organization and activism which
actually has a revolutionary potential
it changes the structure of the system
if it can succeed that's one kind of
development if you look around
say the tech side college students that
sector of the population they're much
more politically engaged now than they
ever have been except for there was a
very brief period late 1960s when there
was a lot of student activism of a mixed
kind but now that's much broader for our
mental issues women's
solidarity movements they're not there's
nothing that kind of coordinated you
know there's no movement you can point
to but a lot of ferment a lot of
opposition to the corporatization of the
universities the many things happening
it could go a lesson to something let me
finish by asking you this question one
way to put it would be what keeps you
awake at night him what keeps you awake
at night would be one way to put my last
question to you but another way to put
it would be how would you characterize
today the dimensions of your engagements
in the public domain what are your
priorities and how would you sketch that
I mean there are plenty of problems but
there are tombs that are absolutely
overwhelming one of them goes back to
August 6th 1945 we're still living under
the shadow of potential self-destruction
and if you take a look at that record it
is horrendous it's a miracle that we
survived anyone who looks closely at the
record of near nuclear war very near
minutes is shocking and that's still
there in fact it's growing but the other
which we weren't really aware of until
the 1970s is the threat of environmental
disaster which is an overwhelming threat
I'm really at a point in human history
where we have to decide are we going to
destroy the prospects or decent
existence that's never happened before
and it's very close everything else kind
of fades into the background in the face
of these two kind of overwhelming
dangers are the grounds for optimism
well I
I like to think of my favorite comment
from the Analects Confucius there's a
definition there of the exemplary person
presumably the master himself it's the
person who keeps on trying even though
he knows there is no hope I don't think
it's quite that bad there isn't much
hope there's some I'd have to keep on
trying
I'm Chomsky thank you very much
