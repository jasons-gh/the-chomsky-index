I want to turn to Ellen Segal she was a
jewish-american nurse who worked at a
hospital at the sabra camp at the time
of the sovereign should tell a massacre
in September 1982 we interviewed her in
2001 and played it on the 20th
anniversary of the killings she
described some of what she witnessed
during the massacre the 18th which was a
Saturday morning it was also the first
day of freshman shot uh we were told to
come down to the the entranceway to the
hospital that the Lebanese army was
downstairs well it wasn't the Lebanese
army it was the Falange
and here were a group of soldiers who
looked who looked quite neat that Queen
and they told us that they were going to
march us out of the camp and they took
our passports from us and they started
to march us down the main street of the
hospital as we were marching we saw dead
bodies they started to holler us this
militia telling us that we were not
Christian that we came to help people
who hated Christians that we were
terrorists they were talking on
walkie-talkies there was constant
communication with someone there was um
there was a Palestinian who had been
working in the hospital who did not flee
when the rest of them did and he was
terrified and he asked for someone to
give him a lab coat and so we gave him
the lab coat but of course he was picked
out immediately because he looked very
different than these white and blonde
and Scandinavian and American and
British health workers and I turned her
and I saw him when his knees pleading
and I was told to keep walking and the
next thing I heard was a shot I never
looked back
as we continued walking there were new
soldiers there was a whole contingent of
other soldiers lining the streets and
these militia people looked quite crazed
they were looked very dirty very messy
and looked like they they had been on
drugs or something they were just tense
wide-eyed nervous extremely nervous
there was a group of Palestinians and
Lebanese refugees who they forced to
line up against oh they were always
lying during this pathway and one of the
women had an infant in her hands and she
tried to give this infant to one of the
doctors and the Falange said no you
can't can't take this baby and they were
watching us and they were giving us the
V sign it was hard to tell who was more
uptight about what was going to happen
to it
so as we continue down this street we
there was a area that had been part of
the camp and suddenly there were there
was bulldozers with an Israeli with the
Hebrew letter on it and it was going
back and forth back and forth that I
short turned out to be the mass grave we
were we kept on walking walkie-talkies
we reached the end of the camp and we
turned a corner this was outside of the
camp they lined us up against a
bullet-ridden wall and they had their
rifles ready and we really thought that
just I mean it was a firing squad
suddenly an Israeli soldier comes
running down this street and halt it I
suppose the idea of cutting down foreign
health workers was something that was
not very appealing to the Israelis but
the fact that they could see this and
stop it shows that there was there was
some communication that was Alan Siegel
Jewish American nurse who was working at
Gaza Hospital in the Sabra camp at the
time of the Sabra and Shatila Massacre
in 1982
I asked her what should happen to our
ell Cherone I think what should happen
to him is what has happened in our
history in Jewish history ever since I
was a child I have learned
that what happened during the Holocaust
happened because people were silent
people did not speak up people allowed
bad things to happen to other people and
did not do anything about it we should
be the last people on earth that should
allow that to happen Simon Wiesenthal
continues and the Jewish agencies
continue to look for Nazi war criminals
and indeed they should and bring them to
justice
Ariel Sharon is a war criminal and the
legal aspects of this I am I understand
as a non legal person put him in that
category he allowed innocent people to
be murdered he did nothing to protect it
he knew that they were just warned enemy
of the Palestinians and so he should be
tried that was Ellen Siegel the nurse
who worked in the Sabra camp at the time
of the massacre in 1982 professor Rashid
holiday also with us your relative
headed that hospital called Gaza
hospital correct that Ellen Siegel
worked in my cousin Ozzy as it was the
director of Gaza Hospital at the time
and you were in Lebanon he was there at
the time describe the reaction
afterwards how what he was doing at that
time what my cousin
Aziza what she was doing she was well
she was trying to stay alive first of
all they were treating patients as
victims of the massacre came in and then
as Ellen describes the only critically
injured patients there at the time they
were trying to clear precisely precisely
and most people realize that a massacre
was going on in most of the Palestinians
fled my cousin was completely
traumatized obviously by it as for that
matter were my children and thousands
and thousands of others Lebanese and
Palestinian children who were living in
in Beirut during the 10-week siege of
the city bombardment and siege of the
city one of the things that nobody has
talked about is the new documents that
have been revealed in the Israel State
Archives which I think pin direct
responsibility for much more of what
happened in sub-branch Athena on not
only Ariel Sharon and the Israeli
government but
reveal American responsibility for what
happened the New York Times on the
thirtieth anniversary of the massacre
September of 2012 published an op-ed
with links to some of these documents by
a student of mine actually which shows
that in fact Sharon's responsibility was
far greater than indirect shows that the
Israeli government knew perfectly well
what was going on that the Israelis
stonewalled to prevent the massacre
being stopped American diplomats were
sent to tell the Israelis on the 16th of
September in the middle of the massacre
you must withdraw your forces from
Beirut and one can read in these
documents which the New York Times has
put a link to on their website exactly
how Charlaine basically fended that off
so that the killing could continue for
another day what was Israel's goal in
Lebanon the pretext was an assassination
attempt on Israel's ambassador in London
and the shelling of northern Israel
literally had been stopped for a year
ambassador Philip Habib since 1981 had
stopped the cross-border exchanges so
that pretext was removed and Sharon was
dying for a pretext we have now the text
of his meeting with Secretary of State
Haig in May and he lays out his
objectives he says we're gonna turn
Lebanon into a satellite state much as
IV and and and Chomsky said we are going
to eliminate Syrian influence and we're
going to destroy the PLO those were his
objectives and he exactly as Professor
Salim said sold this to the Israeli
cabinet baikin to the Americans by
saying it would be much more limited
operation in fact he intended to reach
Beirut and he intended to do all of
these quite ambitious things to change
the entire map we're gonna break then
come back to this discussion we're
talking about the death of RL sharone
we're talking about his life and legacy
the former general and former Prime
Minister of Israel stay with us I'm Amy
