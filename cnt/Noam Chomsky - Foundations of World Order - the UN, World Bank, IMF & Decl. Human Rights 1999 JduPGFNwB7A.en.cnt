you patient souls who've been here for a
long time holding your seats welcome I'm
Jane Gould the coordinator of the
technology and culture forum and I'd
like to welcome you to tonight's program
Noam Chomsky on the foundations of world
order 50 years of the UN the World Bank
the IMF and the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights before we turn to tonight's
program I call your attention to the
technology and culture forums next
program reinventing universities for the
21st century there's a sign with all the
information above my head and do come
Wednesday March 3rd at 5:30 p.m. in six
one twenty the technology and culture
forum will be hosting four more programs
this spring if you'd like to be on our
mailing list you can either sign on one
of the sheets of paper on the table in
the hall as you leave or go to our
website and just put yourself on to the
list now to tonight's program we're all
here because we want to hear Noam
Chomsky Chomsky is honored by MIT as an
institute professor his doctoral thesis
on transformational analysis began his
radical transformation of the field of
linguistics honorary degrees learned in
professional societies significant
awards his list is luminous few have
escaped his notice and yet as a public
intellectual professor Chomsky has
always taken seriously his
responsibility to stimulate and lead
public debate in addition to speaking
and writing on linguistics and
philosophy
he's taken on intellectual history
contemporary issues International
Affairs u.s. foreign policy to name a
few of his key topics late this last
year I received an email encouraging me
to participate in a 70th birthday card
for Noam Chomsky online global hundreds
thousands the list went on and people
couldn't resist saying how they'd been
challenged and inspired by Chomsky
tonight he's here to look at the last 50
years what we created what we have and
where we are to go Noam Chomsky
[Applause]
just realized well listening to Jane
announce the title that it's also just
about fifty years since I walked into
this building for the first time but I
won't talk about that we've just passed
the 50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights that was a
few weeks ago the human rights regime
which was encoded in that declaration is
one of the pillars of the system of
world order that was constructed on the
wreckage of world war ii there was there
were two other major foundation stones
one was the international political
order which is articulated in the United
Nations Charter and the third is the
international economic system sometimes
called the Bretton Woods system designed
primarily by the United States and
Britain right at the end of the war
these three systems were closely
integrated conceptually and in fact the
thinking behind them illustrates that as
does the their interactions over the
years and to a degree that's quite
unusual in world affairs the three
foundations reflected public attitudes
and concerns over quite a wide range for
that very reason the principles that
were articulated and some extent
instituted those principles were quite
distasteful to elite elements who were
in a namely those who were actually in a
position to construct and shape and
guide the actual world order and they
very quickly took steps to dismantle or
at least attenuate
lofty principles the conflicts over
these matters constitutes a large part
of modern history post Cold War history
that's not the usual framework of
analysis for discussing it but in my
opinion it ought to be well large issues
there's lot in print
there's many treatises yet to be written
even to be researched I don't think the
topics have been addressed with anything
like enough seriousness but to try to
give I'll try to give some indication of
why I think that's an appropriate and
instructive way to view the contemporary
world system it's it's our origins
I'm the Second World War and maybe it's
likely future so the main question that
I want to get to is what has been the
fate of the three basic and integrated
pillars of world order that were
established half-century ago and
specifically what has been the role of
the United States which has been the
primary actor on the world scene
throughout remains so and the one that's
most important for us for obvious
reasons independently of the
significance and scale of its
contributions which are usually quite
great for equally obvious reasons well
that's the main question that I want to
get to but I'd like to approach it by a
detour
just to make life more complicated and
the detour has two tracks that I'd like
to explore a little bit and then from
them get back to the questions the first
track is simply to remind everyone of
what you already know we have to bear in
mind that the questions are not abstract
and they're not about some distant
planet so it's not like academic topic
for an academic seminar we're dealing
with questions of life and death
of suffering and pain and despair the
voices that are heard not that one the
voices that are heard are those of the
are those are the rich and the powerful
naturally there are also those who have
sought to be a voice for the voiceless
their fate hasn't been too happy some
were simply assassinated by our hands or
those working for us a chapter of modern
history that one doesn't read about too
much in fact they were assassinated and
there's quite a number of them doubly in
that they were first killed and then
silenced so you can do a check and see
how many your friends can tell you the
names of Eastern European dissidents and
murdered their murdered counterparts in
Central America and how many books
you've read by one and by the other and
so on
it's an instructive lesson the but the
voices that we hear the ones that remain
are typically the powerful and that's
important because that's not the only
voice that's the voice of a small
minority here and on tiny minority
worldwide well let me illustrate from
right now there are major stories in the
press these last few days on the g7
meetings the meetings of the seven
richest industrial countries and on the
interchanges between the their leaders
so for example the president sure acts
of France his interchanges with Robert
Rubin who I guess might be called Co
president of the United States we have
to give Alan Greenspan at least half the
president
the so that's been all over the the
front pages and those discussions are
interesting and tell you a lot look at
them closely they even not so closely
they review the outcome of these
discussions g7 and the other
interchanges reveal the power of the
United States in a rather dramatic form
and also its extreme isolation even
among the richest countries and if you
will go more closely and you learn a lot
about the true nature of the actually
functioning international economic
system of the difference between the
doctrines that apply to the rich and the
powerful by their insistence and the
opposite doctrines which are imposed on
everyone else that comes out with great
starkness and the articles discussing
the these these issues come back to that
in connection with the third pillar of
World Order the international economic
system well there are no stories and I
mean none on the g15 meetings which have
taken place at the same time in Jamaica
last couple of weeks in the in the
national press it's literally zero I
rely on a database search done by a
friend who has access to that monster
the New York Times The Washington Post
and The Wall Street Journal have no word
on them there's no shortage of
information Associated Press had stories
- they weren't run and the BBC World
Service has had extensive coverage and
if you look around the peripheral press
particularly in Florida there was
coverage Florida I presume them because
of the Latin American connection but the
National Press blanked it out no these
aren't sunny that these aren't minor
countries these are major these are not
what are dismissed as basket cases like
I'm sarin Africa
this is Argentina Brazil Chile
Mexico India Indonesia Nigeria quite
substantial countries in which people
expect to make a lot of money as they
can
17 of them even though it's called g15 a
good part of the world and they do have
something say believe it or not and you
can even read it for example you can
read it on the front page if you happen
to subscribe to the leading journal and
Egypt the the which has an English
edition so you can read it in English
the United States what they say at the
g15 meeting is that the United States
and Britain this mostly quotes are
unwilling to enter into a dialogue with
the south the south is what is
euphemistically called the developing
world which direction they're developing
you can argue about the US and Britain
are unwilling to engage to enter into a
dialogue with the south which is always
forced to make concessions in the World
Trade Organization to the benefit of the
rich the true story of globalization
they continue is that the North has its
g7 has to make maximum benefits and the
south is only entitled to a limited
margin of development and if this margin
is crossed the Western speculators are
there to take you down as quickly as
they can
that's not false but it's a considerable
understatement and the writers surely
know it us power and violence has also
been there to take you down as quickly
as it can if countries try to pursue the
path of independent development of
what's called in u.s. planning circles
radical nationalism or economic
nationalism or sometimes even excessive
development that's not to be permitted
in the current period of globalization
for reasons I'll get back to you don't
have to send the Marines that often the
speculators can do can do the job the
g15 meeting goes on to issue a plea to
Western investors it says we don't want
to stifle you but we want to know who
you are and we want you to come and go
in an orderly fashion that's precisely
what the North will not accept the
demand that that not be accepted is a
core part of the multilateral agreement
on investments which has been deflected
thanks to activist pressure which
succeeded in escaping media controls but
deflected not stopped coming back in
other ways and the point is to prevent
what the g15 plea from being realized
the this then is accompanied by grim
account of the effects of the specific
form of globalization that's been
instituted in the past 25 years it has
two major aspects that are relevant here
one is that it's been an economic
failure from from the point of view of
statistics at least not from the point
of view of rich people so economic
growth has slowed over most of the world
and as a fraction of gross domestic
product as a fraction of economic
product the proportion that goes to
working people has declined so working
people are getting a declining part of a
slowing economy that's essentially the
story the long term tendency of this is
a form of globalization it's kind of a
globalization of the structural model of
the third world and that's a very clear
structural model you find it just sped
anywhere which is a relic of European I
include here US imperialism
so you find societies with a very small
sector of extremely extremely wealthy
people usually linked to the
masters a large number of people who are
somewhere between survival and suffering
and a category of superfluous people in
our dependencies they're often called
disposable people as in Colombia where
you dispose of them send out the death
squads or the paramilitaries I wear a
more civilized society we throw them in
jail instead on various fraudulent crime
words but that model is spreading it
takes a different form in a rich country
like the United States and a poor
country like say Haiti but the structure
is quite similar and the United States
and Britain it's pretty very explicit
and the rest in the other rich country
is it's partially true and it's
devastatingly true in most of the world
including now Eastern Europe now that
the end of the Cold War has led to it's
more or less predictable outcome and the
countries of Eastern Europe are
returning to what they were before that
attempt at independent nationalism so
the ones that were deep third world
poverty are like Russia or removing
returning to that status the ones that
were part of the West like the Czech
Republic are returning to that status
about us one should have expected in my
opinion that's pretty much what the Cold
War was about but so that's that's
that's that model is a familiar one and
it's now being kind of globalized that's
the globalization process
well that's the g15 view of it you get a
much I'm not sure more pained and
anguished view when you get to the
poorer countries those are the richer
countries outside the really rich world
well so they are silenced take a second
example a year ago the World Trade
Organization celebrated the fiftieth
anniversary of the world
the global trading systems originally
cat now the world trade organization and
that one got plenty of media coverage
there was lots of coverage of the
inspired rhetoric by Bill Clinton and
world leaders talked about the marvels
that had been achieved through global
trade and so on there was also a
spokesperson for the United Nations
there it was the secretary-general of
Punk'd at the UN conference on Trade and
Development the main United Nations
economic research and analysis
organization which is according to its
Charter committed to an international
trading system that promotes economic
and social development and he gave a
talk to representing the rest of the
world the United Nations and he as a
economist at the E closed his speech by
saying no one should be fooled by the
festive atmosphere of these celebrations
outside there is anguish and fear
insecurity about jobs and a life of
quiet desperation well there was ample
media coverage as I said but it much
preferred in fact kept to the festive
atmosphere within although again you can
read this if you happen to subscribe to
a very good third world journal that's
published in Penang Malaysia the
secretary-general of is a name for that
it's called Free Press I think the
secretary-general of unk Ted presented
the same message same message pretty
much at the recent g15 meeting couple
days ago he predicted a bleak future for
the vast majority of the people of the
of the South although a small sector is
and will continue to be quite wealthy
well the story that he describes is also
similar here including the part about
insecurity and that's not exactly a
secret
so Alan Greenspan when he was testifying
before Congress and at Banking Committee
taking pride in the fairy tale economy
as it's known over which he presided a
tribute attributed it in large measure
to what he called greater worker
insecurity meaning workers are just
intimidated and they're frightened
they're not gonna have a job tomorrow
and they're afraid to ask for a raise or
for benefits and so on and that
contributes substantially to what's
called the health of the economy it's a
concept that's uncorrelated with the
health of the people in the economy but
it's a concept it's it's good it keeps
inflation down keeps profits up does all
sorts of good things and it's real if
you look at polls taken say by
Businessweek you find that like round
ninety percent of working people are
have are insecure about their job some
meant very insecure about 70 percent are
afraid that if they try to get involved
in union organizing they all will be
fired the reasons for this these this
intimidation or several some of them
pretty straightforward
some of it is just straight corporate
crime which is very easy when it's
backed by a criminal state the Reagan
administration made it clear was clear
and open to the business world that it
was simply not want to enforce the laws
as a result firing of union organizers
went way up approximately tripled and
other measures could be used to ensure
that workers would stay intimidated that
continues under the Clinton
administration another measure of
intimidation is what are mislabeled free
trade agreements they're not about free
trade and surely not agreements at least
if the population matters the fact that
they're called agreements is interesting
because it's recognized that at least in
any country that's democratic enough to
take polls like Canada in the United
States that the population is against
them but their agreements nevertheless
which
tells you something about the conception
of democracy if they were about
free-trade say cutting back tariffs
enough that could have taken two pages
it's 2,200 pages because it's not about
free trade but what are called free
trade agreements have the property that
they are a way of threatening workers so
the even some studies on it by one by a
very good labor historian it
Cornell Kate run from Brenner showing
that in about half of organizing efforts
since NAFTA there's been an effort to
disrupt by threat of transfer and it's
not an unreal threat we're organizing is
nevertheless exceeded the number of
transfers is tripled and if you look
where it's triple that's in the mobile
industries like not construction but
manufacture so it's a real threat and it
helps intimidate intimidate people and
it contributes to the health of the
economy and of course in a poorer
country it's a much greater threat so
that's part of the fairytale economy
which is indeed a fairy tale economy for
some people including people in the
sector that most of us come from me in
particular for that sector of the
population it's a fairy tale when you
look at the reports of the fairy tale
economy you find two things mentioned
return on capital and the stock more and
for those who have stock say the rapid
asset inflation of the past years has
made them very rich what it means for
the economy is debated but it certainly
made them very rich so it's a fairy tale
for the 1% of the economy who owned
about half the stock similar figures for
other assets and for the 10% who owned
most of the rest about 85% of the
benefits have gone to about 10 percent
of the population if you go to the next
end percent ii desu isle they've
actually lost net worth during the
clinton recovery go down further looks
uglier over the past years in fact this
recovery is unusual
I think unprecedented in that for the
first first of all it's quite slow by
this but even the standards by the
standards in the post-war period
certainly not very different from the
sluggish recoveries of the 70s and 80
much below the earlier ones but it's
also unusual and that most of the
populations been left out just now after
this is the peak of the business cycle
it was 1989 so it's almost 10 years just
now the median is getting back to where
it was in 1989 there's never been such a
slow recovery for the majority it's
probably 70 80 % of the population never
been anything like that before
wages are about real wages are about 15%
below what they were in 1973 in fact
they're back to the level of the around
1964 or so and a little how you measure
incomes to the extent that they stay up
or staying up because people are just
working a lot more so the typical
American family is putting in about 15
weeks a year more of work than it did 20
years ago to try to keep it a stagnating
or declining level if you're interested
in data about this the best general
database about this kind of stuff also
written quite clearly comes out every
two years called the state of work in
America Economic Policy Institute just
came out with their 1998-99 edition just
a couple of weeks ago which can fit you
in on details up to up to the current
evidence well let me put off for a
moment how this return relates to the
fate of the three pillars but the point
that I'm trying to stress is that all of
this stuff has to do with real human
beings and their fate it's not a
pleasant story and when we bring in the
fate of future generations who don't
have a vote as it's called in the market
and the very restricted market systems
that exist if we bring them in then the
stories even though
well that's the first detour the second
one is and I will get back to the topic
it has to do with the norms and the
conventions for discussing all of this
for discussing World Order and there are
some norms and conventions and if you
depart from them you're kind of not
quite at the discussion the norms and
the conventions are that the goals the
intentions the purposes as they're
sometimes called of the United States
and its leaders are high-minded sincere
benign and other good things and that
crucially is true independently effect
and it is understood to be true
independently effect so for example the
very same books and scholarly articles
and so on that pronounce that as a truth
often also are dedicated to showing that
it's refuted by the facts and that's
called an irony or departure you know
some exogenous factor or something or
other oh that's pretty standard so it's
in indeed the thesis is refuted
overwhelmingly by the doc internal
documentary record the doc record of
planning and even more dramatically by
the historical record of practice but it
doesn't matter the principle remains
true and it provides the framework of
discussion and one part of a good
education is to understand that to get
that internalized enough so you can then
take part in the debate which proceeds
in this fashion there are it's
reminiscent of medieval and early modern
theological dogma and it's interestingly
it's sometimes even presented in those
terms especially in what's called
realist international theory however
although the comparison comes to mind I
think it's unfair it's kind of an insult
to medieval theology oh I mean that
quite seriously and I'll explain why if
you're interested but let me put it
aside anyway it has something of the
flavor of a theological principle notice
that these principles don't apply to
anyone else so for example nobody pays
anything
to the high-minded rhetoric of Stalin's
Constitution or the exalted rhetoric
that accompanies what those who carry it
out call humanitarian interventions
which the most obvious cases in this
century I suppose at least to be judged
by the rhetoric are Mussolini's invasion
of Ethiopia the Japanese invasion of
Manchuria and North China and Hitler's
invasion of Czechoslovakia the rhetoric
was very impressive and full of
humanitarian ideals and noble purposes
and so on I'm like most propaganda
wasn't totally false like fine fragments
of truth in it the so for example Hitler
was invited in by the President of
Slovakia and the Japanese actually had
one of the leading Chinese nationalists
as a puppet and so on but we don't pay
any attention to that stuff we don't
regard that as evidence that of benign
intentions in those in other cases the
principles hold only at home not
anywhere else and here they hold
irrespective of the facts and in the
very often in the very same documents
Ayse got all the articles which present
the facts to refute them it's kind of
misleading to give examples because that
would understate the uniformity and the
extremism and it would be misleading the
quote the press so I won't because
that's too easy let me just give one
example which happens to be the last one
that I looked at last night in a current
Journal of International Affairs it's
kind of an interesting case is a very
good scholar highly critical of US
government policies which makes it more
interesting this article - it's worth
examining not only because it
illustrates the conventions but because
of what we discover about what we
discover when we look a little more
closely not only about contemporary
history but also about ourselves what we
do how we deal with that the record is
particularly instructive in this case
because the Cold War is almost totally
irrelevant
this goes back a long way and never has
been any cold war irrelevant the
institution has been recognized the
institutions of power and decision
making remain unchanged from that we
conclude if we're rational that it's
likely to be a pretty good predictor of
where things are going to go at least if
we allow them to go that way these well
these in fact the the articles by a
well-known milli scholar
there's also a leading policy analyst at
the Council on Foreign Relations and
elsewhere
he's been highly critical of US policy
toward the Middle East which is his
specialty the article is to and he gives
a recommendation which in fact is
highlighted by the journal so it's like
the most important part of the
recommendation it says the United States
should more energetically promote
central u.s. foreign policy themes
especially freedom democracy and human
rights notice these are central u.s.
foreign policy themes no argument or
evidence is presented to establish that
fact because none is needed that is a
theological dogma it's like God is great
or something you don't have to present
evidence for that it's just a truth then
the article proceeds after having
established the truth and it goes on and
this is quite typical to describe how
the United States has consistently acted
contrary to its central aren't foreign
policy themes in the Middle East he then
the author then goes on to say I'm
quoting now there is no doubt not only
is true but there is no doubt that
American foreign policy does adopt a
separate standard for the Middle East
when it comes to such values as
democracy and human rights well to show
that there's a double standard you do
need evidence so he presents some
evidence the evidence is that as he
shows the United States does not uphold
such values in the Middle East which is
the area of his expertise and attention
but it does uphold them elsewhere
strikingly he points out four major
Muslim states the most in the Middle
East so that makes the point very clear
and the most important case of course as
he notes is Indonesia largest Muslim
state which he cites to establish the
certainty of the judgement that the
United States has a separate standard
for the Middle East well breaking with
the convention let's look at the dogma
keeping to the single and most important
examples cited namely Indonesia where
the United States upholds its values of
democracy and human rights well very
much like Hitler Mussolini and Japan
this doctrine isn't totally false so on
May 20th 1998 all right so that's last
May the United States did make its first
statement in favor of democracy
in Indonesia Secretary of State Albright
on last May 20th called upon President
Suharto to resign and provide for a
democratic transition a few hours later
he resigned
maybe coincidence maybe it tells you
something about power relations you can
figure that out for yourself so last May
we called for democracy from the time
that the Suharto took power in October
1965 until May 1998 this gentleman was
our kind of guy as the Clinton
administration called him while he was
massacring and torturing and robbing in
a quite impressive fashion kind of one
of the world records of the modern
period the Clinton administration even
went so far as to suspend its
congressionally mandated review of
Indonesia's appalling labor practices
while at the same time praising
Indonesia for bringing them into closer
conformity with international standards
and the Clinton administration also
avoided congressional restrictions on
military support for our
and a guy found various ways to pay for
it out of other pockets and that sort of
thing but it is true that last May the
United States underwent religious
conversion and for the first time called
for democracy in Indonesia the force of
the comparison with the Middle East
however somewhat weakened by the fact
that the same conversion occurred there
pretty much the same time in December
1998 Secretary of State Albright
announced and quoting we have come to
the determination that the Iraqi people
would benefit if they had a government
that really represented them so in both
the middle-east and Indonesia contrary
to the theses of the United States
underwent a religious conversion in
favor of the central themes of its
foreign policy at least on paper you can
evaluate the accuracy about at the same
time last last year in the case of Iraq
before that the US policy was to support
what was called an iron fist the iron
fist was Saddam Hussein
for a long time he was our kind of guy
right through his most murderous crimes
and most monstrous crimes after he
committed his first true offense the
thesis shifted we still wanted an iron
fist but it had to be a clone someone
who would rule with an iron fist
just as Saddam Hussein had done during
the period when he was our kind of guy
that was pretty much official policy but
on paper at least it's now changed
because as of last December we
discovered that they would benefit from
a government that represented them so in
1998 then the United States did announce
support for democracy but both in the
Middle East and Indonesia well what does
this tell us about the central themes of
u.s. foreign policy answer tells us
nothing whatsoever because these are
doctrinal truths and therefore facts are
simply irrelevant like you know god is
great and merciful you know look at
factual truth
if you look more put it aside let's look
don't take too many detours
let's look a little more closely at
Indonesia where there is no doubt that
these themes of democracy and human
rights were put into practice there's a
lot of concern right now about the
possibility that Indonesia may break up
in two separate you know kind of either
Federation or maybe separate territories
and that prospect is very much deplored
however the objection to it whatever it
may be is certainly not an objection of
principle and we can find that out quite
easily if we bother to look at the
irrelevant facts so in 1958 that
happened to be official US policy secret
but we now know it was official US
policy to break up Indonesia the and the
United States in fact sponsored carried
out a major insurgent counterinsurgency
well insurgency operation subversive
operation probably the major one of the
post Second World War period to try to
break up Indonesia supported a rebellion
in the outer islands those the islands
where the oil is and where most US
investments were and the that was the
goal to separate them off and the
purpose was the reason was that the
national government was neutralist and
independent and in fact was far too
democratic which was extremely worrisome
to Washington the government was not
suggesting it was a model democracy but
it was allowing parties of the pores to
function there was a major party which
represented were peasants and it was
allowed to function I was doing better
and better in each election and that was
appalling news in Washington if we look
at the internal record we discover that
most of which has been suppressed
incidentally but bits and pieces of
leaked and there's some good scholarly
studies of it one in fact by the leading
founder of US Southeast Asian Studies
George canna Cornell he the
some documents that have come out in the
official channels the fear was that the
government was they say far too
democratic and it would be impossible as
they say as they put it to suppress the
parties of the of the left by ordinary
democratic means and therefore they
would have to be the word is eliminated
that's the Joint Chiefs the meanwhile
the outer islands would be separated off
so inside what's left bad guys have to
be eliminated the outer islands will be
separated the u.s. will take them over
well the rebellion failed but not before
destroying whatever fabric of
parliamentary democracy existed in
Indonesia and now after 40 years we're
calling for it to be restored the after
the failure of the rebellion the United
States turned to what is standard
operating procedure when you want to
overthrow a civilian government support
the try to undermine the civilian
government but support the military
because they're the ones you're gonna
overthrow the government for you that's
absolutely standard case after case you
know is one example the the real
story about what lies behind the
iran-contra is the same and we know it
had nothing to do with hostages because
it was started when there were no
hostages but that's and it's just
standard operating procedures in
Indonesia it worked the u.s. tried down
there - civilian government supported
the military worked by 1965 there was
indeed a military coup so hard to took
over an army inspired massacre then took
place the CIA described it as one of the
worst massacres of the 20th century
comparable to Hitler Stalin and now it
was fairly accurately reported in the
United States it was a staggering
bloodbath New York Times called it a
boiling blood staggering mass slaughter
that was The Times phrased
Time magazine devoted a whole section to
to what they call the boiling blood bath
and which hundreds of thousands of
people were massacred mostly for
peasants and the leadership of the
peasant of the poor peasant party was
indeed eliminated it was reported
accurately and with complete euphoria
there was such joy over it that it
couldn't even be suppressed
it's kind of been written out of history
but go back and read the journals of the
time the euphoria is total across the
intellectual spectrum freedom house was
applauding and so on all right the the
US government applauded Secretary of
Defense McNamara testified before
Congress that the military aid that we
had given to the millet to the
Indonesian military had paid dividends
in private letter to President Johnson
he was particularly proud of the
training that Indonesian military
officers received that American
universities were they've gotten the
right ideas about how to carry out mass
slaughter comparable to Hitler Stalin
and Mao the country became paradise for
investors Suharto became the darling of
the United States our kind of guy
remained so when he invaded East Timor
like that maybe third or a quarter of
the population and that continues right
into 1997 then something went wrong he
apparently committed a crime what crime
is it well in fact the crime if you look
closely which led to the religious
conversion in favor of a democratic
transition here there were actually two
crimes two standard ones one crime is he
started dragging his feet about IMF
workers the IMF rules were imposing
extremely serious hardships on the
people of Indonesia and so hard it was
kind of slow about following orders
crime number one the second crime is he
just lost control there was a democratic
uprising and
the army wasn't backing him anymore and
at that point he's useless so therefore
he got the advice to permit a democratic
transition in which he handed power over
to his hand-picked vice president well
that's the moment at which the United
States after 40 years began to at least
on paper to implement its central theme
of its policy in the area where there is
no doubt that it has always implemented
it remember as distinct from the Middle
East by committing those two crimes so
hard to have followed a very classic
path another recent example is Mobutu
Saddam Hussein do that yay Marcos Somoza
Trujillo it's kind of a long list same
two crimes or the ones that mattered you
stopped following orders
you lose control you're out and we're in
favor of a democratic transition this
happens routinely regularly but it
doesn't teach anything you don't learn
anything about policy from that because
the nature of policy is a theological
dogma and therefore no evidence tells
you anything well let's look a little
more closely at 1958 I still promise to
get back to the theme if you're willing
to hold down it's very revealing in 1958
the National Security Council main
planning body had been secret meetings
now publicized in which john foster
dulles secretary of state presented
described the crises on the world scene
so there's three major crises in the
world seen in 1958 one was Indonesia
the second was Algeria the third was the
Middle East notice that they're all
Muslim countries but there was no clash
of civilisations at that point those of
you who are respectable intellectuals
will know that now we have to soberly
debate the classroom civilizations
because the Cold War pretext for
vention has collapsed and we need what's
called a new paradigm but then we still
had that pretext so we didn't need a new
paradigm so the three major crises were
Indonesia Algeria and the Middle East
more in fact they were Muslims
irrelevant but something isn't
irrelevant namely they all had oil in
fact there were oil centers and in fact
the effort to cut off the outer islands
was related to the concern u.s. concerns
over Middle East oil there were some
concerns that it was getting out of
control and they needed some temporary
supplements temporary because Indonesia
is nor near the scale of the Middle East
but significant well you look back at
what happened and bear in mind that the
United States is a global power so its
policies are usually carried out
consistently in many different places
and a lot of other things were happening
in 1958 the subversion in Indonesia the
rebellion Indonesia was the largest of
the clandestine operations maybe the
largest ever but there were others in
Burma of the United States was moving to
overthrow the regime supporting a
Chinese nationalist army that had
partially taken refuge there and that
the United States was supporting there I
won't go into the details but that led
Burma at that time had an elected
government that led to a military coup
the installation of the current military
regime in Burma one of those myrtl in
the world it also was instrumental in
making Burma the leading heroin producer
in the world of position it now holds
and a real horror story the state of
Massachusetts now has a kind of boycott
we can trace that right back to 1958
right parallel to the when we were
carrying out the central themes of our
foreign policy in Indonesia another case
right next door was Cambodia also at a
neutralist government which the United
States didn't like the US was supporting
an attack on it that attack didn't work
in 1958 but it did work in 1970 the same
forces overthrowing
princey anok's government that led to
the huge u.s. bombing the Khmer Rouge
everything that followed did not talk
about that a third a third place where
something was going on in 1958 was again
right nearby and Laos Laos had its first
and last free election in 1958 came out
the wrong way parties the left one US
wouldn't accept that military coup took
place the u.s. installed what was called
a pro-western neutralist and he wasn't
good enough so ultra-right general was
put in that led to a total disaster it's
sort of paved the way and that came very
close to a World War I the it ended up
with us carrying out the heaviest
bombing in history against a defenseless
peasant Society in northern Laos and the
effects of that are still with us though
you wouldn't read it you can even read
it in the US newspaper there's a very
good article on it in a Wall Street
Journal by their veteran Asia
correspondent about a year and a half
ago unfortunately it's the Asian edition
of The Wall Street Journal they didn't
have it in the US edition but it's quite
a good article he gives an estimate of
there's honey
unknown numbers of unexploded bomblets
just littering the Plain of Jars
hundreds of millions of them were
dropped they're much worse than
landmines these are not aimed at
property they do nothing against a truck
they're aimed to kill people they're
their murder weapons they're little
think colorful things that you know kid
can pick up a farmer can hit or
something they had an
failure to explode rate of about twenty
to thirty percent according to their
manufacturers Honeywell and you know
crummiest technology maybe it's hard to
believe that that wasn't built in but
maybe the technologists among you can
assess that likelihood anyway they're
supposed to have a twenty to thirty
percent failure to explode rate which
means they're around all the time as any
personnel weapons and they're still
they're huge numbers of them there is a
the estimated according to The Wall
Street Journal report the casualties may
range up to
thousand a year of which more than half
our deaths other numbers or less but
some since nobody's counting you know
nobody really knows but numbers of that
kind are considered not unreasonable by
the Wall Street Journal in its Asia
edition the there is a mine clearing
group british-based
mine advisory group civilian but you
know based ultimately in the British
Army and other countries have come in as
the British press reports the United
States is conspicuous by its absence in
the mine clearing operation and
furthermore the right-wing British press
is bitterly complaining over the fact
that the United States the Pentagon
refuses to provide what are called
render harmless procedures procedures
that would defuse the mine so they
wouldn't kill the people who are trying
to clear them that's a military secret
and in fact the whole thing is a secret
in the United States have to work pretty
hard to find out anything about it
that's a fact so that's Laos another
case in 1958 was Vietnam I won't even
talk about that in each case including
all of these including Indonesia the US
interventions which were significant
were led to hideous atrocities and in
fact destroyed the basis of democracy
and in fact were to a large extent
driven by that purpose as in several of
the cases I've mentioned however that
doesn't influence the dogma it's still
correct it is still there still no doubt
that in the Middle East only the United
States doesn't live up to its high
ideals but does in these places well
take a little more closer look at 1958 I
won't go into this and bring it up later
if you like but the other major case was
in fact Iraq Iraq was pulling out how to
nationalists revolution it was Politico
to the u.s. anglo-american condominium
over oil that was going on right in 1958
and was a major phenomenon look at the
documentary record then you get a pretty
good explanation of everything that's
going out until
today okay let me drop that one of the
things that's going on today which is
quite striking and leads me to the topic
finally is a kind of a minor aspect of
the bombing last December the US UK
bombing one interesting aspect of it
what was that it is in blatant and flat
violation of the UN Charter and
international law international law
that's one of the three pillars the
world order the basic principle the UN
Charter is that the threat or use of
force in international affairs is banned
except under highly restricted
circumstances which don't apply or if
specifically authorized by the Security
Council otherwise banned threat or use
of force there's no serious doubt that
the US and UK just flatly ignored that
they didn't try to get you a Security
Council authorization for the simple
reason they knew they'd never get it so
therefore they just bombed
now in the United States there is
essentially no discussion of this I've
done a fairly extensive review and where
it's discussed as it occasionally is
it's considered a kind of a technicality
the reason being if a reason is ever
given that we cannot allow others to
veto our policy decisions as required by
the UN Charter and international law but
we alone cannot others must stand by
that but we can all right that is
unchallenged as far as I can discover
try to find some interesting exercise
try to find some challenge to that
doctrine I haven't found it there is
some in England there's a lot elsewhere
so for example the Indian in India the
Association of jurists has a case before
the World Court condemning the US and
Britain for war crimes you won't read
about that either but here it's not
discussed because it's taken for granted
that that's correct
we cannot submit ourselves to
international law or the UN Charter
because we are a violent lawless
criminal
rogue state and that is right and just
that's what it means and there is near
Universal endorsement of that principle
among educated sectors at least which
should be taken as a warning by the
world and indeed is taken as a warning
by the world which doesn't like it but
can't do much about it
we're the ones who can do something
about it the official stand we seem
displeased judging articulate sectors
educated sectors support it so I don't
really do anything about it
the official stand during the bombing in
December was quoted that we prefer to
act through our allies but will resort
to force alone if we have to notice that
we don't even prefer to act through the
United Nations as required by
international law on the Charter we made
the first join our allies if they're
willing to but UN is out in fact the
timing of the bombing was presumably
intended as a slap in the face to the
Security Council the bombing was timed
just as the Security Council was being
called to an emergency session to deal
with the question of Iraq and it hadn't
been notified and if that didn't make
headlines here people understood it
elsewhere I think like that don't happen
by accident and they were understood
well that's accepted across the spectrum
and it's accepted in other cases too so
take a look at the rumbly a meetings in
Kosovo there was a debate there about
just what to do the debate was between
the United States and its allies and the
NATO powers nobody else around and the
debate was over the wording the should
the wording of the NATO decision to bomb
be stated as being authorized by the
United Nations or only being endorsed by
the United Nations the u.s. insisted on
endorsed as the New York Times put it it
wanted to avoid the neuralgic word
authorised which would entail that the
that international law has some
significance and the US won't accept
that even at the rhetorical level and as
usual the u.s. won
so the most they get to do is authorize
is endorsed not authorized the little um
order which is what these cute law
requires and it's not just in this case
it's in every case so take say the
bombing the Sudan last August I'm it's
now conceded no nobody can't rise to
very few even try to deny that the US
just bombed the pharmaceutical plant in
Sudan and destroyed half of Sudan's
pharmaceutical industry well you know
sometimes things go wrong there's no
talk about war crimes no talk about
reparations not even any talk about an
apology I mean why should we apologize
if we destroy half of the
pharmaceuticals in a poor East African
country be serious furthermore that's
accepted across the spectrum okay
there's a further history for this ten
years ago the United States took the
same stand explicitly with regard to the
World Court dared to carry out a follow
a case against the United States and
indeed to condemn the United States for
the unlawful use of force and its war
against Nicaragua the United States
position was clear and explicit the
State Department legal department said
that we cannot accept world court
jurisdiction they explained why the
reason is that other states do not agree
with us they do not accept their
policies that's and they said we must
therefore reserve to ourselves the right
to decide when court rulings apply and
we must reject court rulings I'm quoting
now for any dispute involving matters
essentially within the domestic
jurisdiction of the United States as
determined by the United States the
example in question was the US war
against Nicaragua and the United States
determined that that was within its
domestic jurisdiction so the World Court
could get lost and that was done with
virtually a hundred percent support of
educated intellectuals including leading
advocates of world or
write articles and law journals and so
on and so forth
the New York Times dismissed the court
as a hostile forum and so it went other
court judgment was never even reported
and it was radically violated okay
that's the world court this goes back
much further back in 1962 Dean Acheson
highly respected statement statesman you
know advised senior advisor the Kennedy
administration informed the American
Society for international law that a
situation in which our country's power
position and prestige are involved
cannot be treated as a legal issue he
was referring to the US embargo against
Cuba which of course he recognized was
illegal but nothing in which our power
position and prestige are involved can
be treated as a legal issue and
accordingly at that time you heard Adlai
Stevenson at the United Nations
defending the u.s. attack against South
Vietnam as defense against internal
aggression the Vietnamese South
Vietnamese were carrying out internal
aggression in South Vietnam and we were
defending South Vietnam against them we
were defending South Vietnam against
what John F Kennedy called the assault
from within that's when he launched the
assault from without this goes way back
in earlier years that had been in secret
so in earlier years the flight rejection
of the Charter is explicit very explicit
but in secret goes back to 1947 first
memorandum of the National Security
Council in which it called for national
mobilization in the United States
support for military action paramilitary
action other such things in Italy if the
Communists took power by legal means in
an election in other words if a
democratic election came out the wrong
way we would use force to overthrow it
that's 1947 NSC one story goes on from
there the innovation in the Reagan years
was that the contempt for international
law became completely overt wasn't even
secret anymore under
- lost any pretense so the conclusion is
the only reasonable conclusion is that
the first pillar of world order the
International political order has
totally disappeared it's available as a
weapon against enemies but nothing else
remains except the theological dogma
that we uphold world order international
law that remains independently the facts
so nothing else remains well let's
proceed turn to the universal
declaration second pillar of world order
this is a tightly integrated document
the the it has conventionally divided in
three parts civil and political rights
socio-economic rights and we're called
solidarity rights the integration of all
of those was stressed from the beginning
you look at the background it's clear
repeatedly been stressed since times
short so I won't run into run through
the history the major Law Review article
that just appeared on the 50th
anniversary by Harvard Law Professor
Mary and Glendon stresses that the
universal declaration elevates socio
social economic and cultural rights to
fundamental rights status and that that
is a crucial part of the
universalization of rights carried out
in the Universal Declaration in short
there is no place for any sort of
relativist demand that certain rights
must be relegated to secondary status in
accord with say Asian values or some
other pretext Glendon also points out
quite accurately the support for that
was very broad-based at the time have to
remember the time this is right at the
end of the Second World War there were
values of that kind that kind of
expressed in the UD were deeply
entrenched in the anti-fascist popular
forces in Europe and in the colonial
world and even in the United States that
was deeply disturbing to us a leets who
intended to create a very different kind
of world order and indeed were quite
explicit about it but the dog
remains and it proclaims a more
self-congratulatory version well there
were some who did dismiss the Universal
Declaration as meaningless so there's an
often quoted phrase of Andre wyszynski
'he's the Russian delegate whose record
doesn't have to be paint us he dismissed
the Universal Declaration as a
collection of pious phrases and it was
dismissed as quoting a letter to Santa
Claus by Jean Kirkpatrick Reagan's UN
Ambassador who was deriding the
socio-economic provisions of the
Universal Declaration moving on a couple
of years it is an empty vessel a
dangerous incitement preposterous
that's Morris Abram UN ambassador to the
UN Commission on Human Rights he's
explaining Washington's rejection of
what was called the right to development
which if you look at it's a very close
paraphrase of the socio-economic
provisions of the Universal Declaration
that was vetoed by the United States
alone
essentially vetoing the socio-economic
provisions of the UD the u.s. also
radically violates the civil and
political provisions
I won't go through the details but quite
clear and not surprising one of the
latest major Amnesty International
reports is about this in brief two
pillars of World Order have been
effectively demolished except as
ideological weapons that doesn't mean
that the people of the world shouldn't
defend them they do remain ideals that
people should try to defend they should
fight for and that they should also
transcend because they're not the end of
the road by any means but to take that
stand in the United States you have to
first carry out an act of intellectual
liberation you have to free yourselves
from the doctrines of the faith you
don't do that you can't even enter into
the into the fray first I have to free
yourselves from the doctrines of the
faith and at least be willing to subject
them to him
verification if they're not even subject
to empirical verification there's no
point discussing these matters clearly
if they are you can ask whether this
analysis is correct there's some
different analysis is correct well
that's a radical that just the
willingness to subject them to
examination the doctrines that's a
radical departure from prevailing norms
including everything in the educational
system and academic scholarship in the
media and everywhere else so it's not
small well a couple of words about the
third pillar the Bretton Woods system
one of its central which again was
totally tightly integrated with the
others and that's worth understanding a
central component of the Bretton Woods
system was regulation of Finance and
there were several purposes for the
reasons for this one reason was that it
was an effort that was understood that
the regulation of finance would harm the
global economy they're good reasons for
that and they've been illustrated in
recent years the trouble is that
financial markets as was understood are
quite volatile and unpredictable at the
quote a couple of MIT economists
specialists on this financial markets
are governed by panics manias and
crashes by they swing far above and
below any kind of sensible fundamental
values creating bubbles that will burst
Paul Samuelson who says the evidence for
that is overwhelming and this was
understood back in the 40s no so you
deregulate financial markets gonna have
a disaster and it will harm the general
economy that was one reason a second
reason was closely related to world
order in human rights one reason for
both capital controls and keeping
currencies within a narrow band was that
it's that it was understood that the
regulation of capital is a tremendous
weapon against democracy and social and
socio-economic rights before mentioning
that let me just say that the current
debate between the United States and its
g7 partners is over keeping currencies
within a narrow band
if you read the articles on this you
notice that the US the g7 position
Germany Japan and France and so on is
maybe not written but the other g7
countries is that currently major
currencies should be kept sort of
closely interconnected
and that was rejected as crazy by US
Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin
because if we were to agree to that it
would mean that some other authority
might determine that we're not allowed
to lower interest rates to stimulate the
economy if we want to so if the economy
sinking into recession we won't be able
to allow interest rates because that'll
affect currency values and it would be
crazy to allow other country to any
other country to allow us to any
international organization to prevent us
from carrying out those fiscal policies
exactly the fiscal policies that we
force on every other country as the very
same articles point out without any
sense of contradiction take a look think
about it
why is deregulation of Finance a weapon
against democracy and human rights well
very obviously and it was understood the
reason is that if capital flow is
unregulated it will it can it will
quickly create what some international
economists call a virtual Senate a
Senate consisting of concentrated
international financial capital which
will simply impose decisions on
government but by the threat of capital
flight so if some government pursues
irrational policies so policies that are
aimed at helping the population let's
say instead of raising profits for
investors and are therefore irrational
like education or health or
environmental policies or whatever it
may be you can force them to stop simply
by pulling all the capital out of the
country which sends the country of
course this interest rates up since the
country the depression the usual
consequences so therefore unless capital
is controlled you've got you very
sharply restricted
democracy and human rights well--that's
was understood then and it is understood
now the Bretton Woods system with
financial regulation persisted through
roughly in 1970 that's a period that's
commonly called the Golden Age of
post-war capitalism period of high
growth high growth of productivity
expansion of the social contract
so-called welfare state which turned the
Universal Declaration into something a
little more than a letter to Santa Claus
from the early 1970s that system was
dismantled first at the initiative the
United States Britain came along later
others other major economies not until
the eighties and the results wouldn't
have surprised the founders of the
Bretton Woods system the results have
transferred some economists call it a
transfer from a golden age to a Litton
age in the period since there has been
slowdown of the economy globally and the
social contract has been dissolved
dramatically in the US and Britain some
extent elsewhere inequalities going way
up consequences I have party described
briefly one region of the world
temporarily escaped from this that's
East Asia which is quite different from
Southeast Asia there there was quote the
chief economist of the World Bank
there was an unprecedented economic
miracle which was based on the fact that
they disregarded the religion as he
calls it the religion that markets know
best and they disregarded the
prescriptions of the international
financial institutions so-called
Washington Consensus and they carried
out an unprecedented economic miracle in
the early 1990s South Korea liberalized
capital flow under very heavy US
pressure I should say one of several
factors that's a large factor in the
subsequent collapse that's generally
agreed nine up till 1997 or 1998 the
global economic system was considered
really great it was in fact what's
called an economic miracle fairytale I'm
very much the way Mexico was an economic
miracle during the period when the
number of billionaires was rising about
as fast as the poverty level that's
there was no crisis until 1997-98 all
there was was anguish and fear
insecurity about jobs and a life of
quiet desperation ahead of debt that's
not a crisis that's I think that's a
miracle it because that was only outside
the doors remember inside the festive
atmosphere was exuberant so but by 1998
the festive atmosphere inside was a
little becoming a little disturbed the
interests of rich people were being
affected so we moved from economic
miracle to crisis those are technical
terms again don't have much to do with
what's happening to the people has to do
a lot with what's happening to rich
people rich powerful people and their
interests were starting to be disturbed
so all of a sudden we had a crisis as
distinct from anguish and fear and so on
well that crisis is now all over the
paper front pages wasting time on it so
it's interesting one side effect of the
crisis is that all of these certainties
have dissolved so the Bank for
International Settlements in Basel which
is you know the most conservative and
respectable institution that exists it's
called the central bank of central
bankers and their latest report last
summer they said nobody knows nobody has
a clue as to what's going on and they
urged that we have humility instead of
issuing confident pronouncements let's
at least have enough humility to admit
that we haven't got a clue as to what is
happening or what to do about it leading
economists from around here Cambridge
have been recently publishing articles
in which they say that the international
economy is dimly understood that we may
be heading into
third-world style xxx style depression
and we don't what to do about it
actually the real crisis is much more
fundamental and I'll finish by just
giving two quotes but I think capture it
rather will one of them both reason one
is from an event that was organized by
Jesse Jackson / Martin Luther King
weekend in January this was an event in
Manhattan to support Bill Clinton in the
moment of his terrible trials there were
lots of celebrities who came and sort of
admired one another and so on among them
was the president of the New York Stock
Exchange I'm quoting from the press now
he told New York Times he told mr.
Clinton that dr. King is surely smiling
down on the gathering recognizing how
Clinton had benefited my little corner
of southern Manhattan which is quite
accurate other little corners of
southern Manhattan fared rather
differently but the stock exchange on
that mr. Clinton doubtless showered many
benefits so no doubt Martin Luther King
is smiling down on that's a an
appropriate comment reflecting the
realities of a political system in which
in the last election November 1998 95
percent data have just come in recently
ninety-five percent of winning
candidates outspent their opponents
meaning you could predict up to 95
percent accuracy
who's gonna win just looking at how much
money they had so it's not like Russia
where he could brick a hundred percent
that it was going to be the Communist
Party it's only 95 percent furthermore
if you look at the contributions same
data business contributions outspent
labor contributions by that twelve to
one which is highly misleading remember
because labor represents way more people
and individual contributions that
measure undoubtedly or skewed at least
as much so what that translates into to
put it into English is that a small that
a little corner of southern Manhattan
and a couple of other little corners
like it essentially purchase candidates
and put them in office and then set
conditions that they're going to have to
meet or else and also set the general
framework for policy just by virtue of
their power becoming the virtual Senate
as I mentioned once these instruments
are in their hands the second quote of
course they also require a powerful
state they're very insistent on that
there has to be a powerful state which
will socialize risks and costs and will
make sure that there's no unpleasant
noises and servants quarters so that
still got to be there but not with its
own functions second quote last one is
from David Rockefeller reflecting on the
current scene recall that David
Rockefeller is at the liberal end of the
spectrum he's what's called the part of
the establishment left it's called
without irony I should say he's
commenting on the reduction of the role
of government in public affairs
something that business has always
favored he says side comment the role of
government means the role of the
population right of all institutions
that are around with all its flaws
whatever they may be government is the
only one in which at least in principle
there's some possibility of
participation often in practice too in
the operations of General Electric there
are no possibilities in principle so
government is the one institution of the
general institutional framework in which
people may have a role sometimes do and
that role is declining businesses happy
about that but he says well that
reduction of democratic participation is
of course welcome there's another side
to that
somebody has to take government's place
and business seems to be the logical
entity to do it okay that's Rockefeller
it's there he goes on say it's the
responsibility of business to fill this
gap made by the disappearance of
democratic government it's certainly not
the role of the public that's for sure
that's the establishment left when you
move over to the right the message gets
a lot harsher well that's a pretty fair
picture of the current drift of policy
sure you know corporations gain the
right of persons through judicial
activism early in this century they're
not ordinary persons like you and me
they're are immortal persons they have
extraordinary power unlike
flesh-and-blood persons they also demand
the rights of states and they get them
under NAFTA they've partially gained
them under the amai they gain them still
more fully in fact they would gain
additional rights which are described as
if they're innocuous but they surely
aren't if you think about them under ma
eye these persons fictitious legal
persons are demanding what they call
national treatment that's a right that
no flesh-and-blood person can claim so
under national treatment general
electric can function freely in Mexico
but suppose that some flesh-and-blood
Mexican tries to get national treatment
in New York no that's not gonna work so
this is only for fictitious collectivist
legal entities those kind of persons get
the rights of states the rights of
national treatment all right and
furthermore they have a right and a
responsibility to take over the
functions of government they must do
that that would therefore reduce
democratic form still further internally
they're basically tearing those I mean I
think that's in question and they try to
run the global society including the
sort of minimal market system in an
integrated fashion they do rely on the
powerful states to make sure that they
can get what they want they also demand
and in large part gain the right to
shape opinions and attitudes and beliefs
that's the role of the corporate media
and in fact the educational system to a
large extent that is if the right to
define what a human being is what
constitutes a human life and do so well
quite apart from the continuing assault
against the proclaimed values of
democracy and human rights and freedom
and all good things these tendencies if
they are tolerated could lead to quite
serious and possibly even terminal
catastrophes that's only a speculation
of course your speculations are as good
as anybody's what is not a speculation
is that the tendencies don't have to be
tolerated that's a choice you can make
it and not make it it's not a necessity
the ability to make that choice is
roughly measured by your share in
privilege more access to privilege you
have more of a choice you can make it's
also measured by the freedom of the
society that means that for people like
us the options are wide open and one
thing we can be reasonably confident of
I think is that neither conscience nor
history is going to look favorably upon
an unwillingness to face those decisions
with care and dedication
[Applause]
very nice
are there any mics not in house okay if
people want to say something maybe stand
up so maximize the chance somebody will
hear you good okay you guys
we're here in Massachusetts John Silber
someone from I believe demand for our
source is leading the war against public
education and he and his college using a
variety of text tactics there's a lady
bill before the Massachusetts Congress
which will take away collective
bargaining rights for teachers
completely got the union's when is that
some of us the teachers unions are going
to confront silver and from that
mistaken he was Simon Kissinger
commission that investigated purported
to investigate American policy in Latin
America
one of his favorite characters about him
you know you make your own decisions
yeah I mean the quarry the question or
the comment really is that John Silber
who's a chancellor something of the
state system or something is leading a
campaign now to try to undermine the
teachers union which is part of a
general attack on the public education
system sorry I then come some questions
about our personal relations which yeah
but to the side the because this is a
general issue that this is a there's I
think very little a serious issue very
serious one of the areas of government
meaning public participation that still
exists is the schools and at the left
end of the spectrum people like David
Rockefeller would very much like to get
rid of this government intervention in
the economy or as contempt I'm told that
the latest edition of Paul Samuelson's
economics changes the phrase to
government interference in the economy
no tell me I'm right that would then
introduce an important doctrinal
assumption into the description so we
want to get rid of government
interference in the economy like public
schools which have all sorts of bad
features like they cultivate a sense of
solidarity or of care for other people
like if there's a public school system
that's an expression of the fact that
you care whether the kid down the street
gets an education and that's a very bad
thing because you're supposed to be you
know you get this message from infancy
on through the television set and
everything else that the only value of a
human life is to maximize with the
advertising industry called invented
once so they're supposed to invent once
for you and you're supposed to maximize
them and that's the only thing you're
supposed to care about not care about
anybody else you know
not care about control your life and
work that's out of the door but maximize
your own fabricated once and the public
the existence of the public school
system is inconsistent with that because
it's expression of solidarity and care
for others and compassion and all sorts
of ideals that are not supposed to exist
in the system that is being created the
ideological system that's being created
it's not only John Silber there's a
major assault across the boards on
public schools
I got a inkling of this a couple of
years ago and Alain Bernard who some of
you know sent me a brochure from Lehman
Brothers which was being set out to
their you know Prime investors or you
know people who put a lot of money in
and so on and it was about new
investment opportunities and this one
was about what they called IMO's give me
a second to figure out what that means
but the point is you know prison systems
being privatized the health system such
as there was is being given the
insurance companies with HMOs there's
still this residue the educational
system so the next target is going to be
IMO's educational management
organizations which will be privately
run publicly funded of course all this
stuff gets publicly funded in one way or
another but the profits are privatized
and that will achieve great gains for
example by hiring teachers who are
non-union staff that's non-union doesn't
have to be paid decent wages doesn't
require any security attempts and so on
and so forth so it's very efficient by
some measure and also it'll be a way of
breaking down this lingering sense of
solidarity and mutual support that the
public school system provides just by
its very existence so I think you can
expect a lot of such attacks okay not
just on that but on every other residue
of human life that reflects any value
other than
individual maximization of invented once
anything beyond that is fundamentally
unacceptable its reflection in fact that
a lot of people are worried about these
issues never write to be the only thing
to do is to go beyond being worried
about them doing something about them
[Applause]
turn your attention in the light of your
comments tonight to Latin America and
specifically to the country of Colombia
and what's going on there and the
purported rationale for the ratcheting
up of US military support the purported
rationale being the supposed war against
drugs and a neighboring country to Kola
Colombia which is the nation of Pano's
and I have a particular reason for
wanting to ask you about Peru
which is that there is an American woman
who was a student here at MIT whose name
is Laurie Berenson who's been in prison
in Peru for over three years now without
a trial and perhaps in the
your comments about Colombia and Peru
you might also have something to say
about her situation well there's really
two questions one is about Laurie
Berenson who was a student here a couple
of years ago and is now in a prison
prison in Peru without trial and you
know that's something we really could do
something about
I mean pressure by the US government
meaning pressure from the population on
the US government on Peru would deal
with that case no question about that so
that's a simple choice you can do things
about it or not choices open the more
general question about the whole Andean
region Colombia Peru Bolivia has to do
with several things there is there has
been a Colombia which the point Jack
point is that the the u.s. is now
increasing its military aid to Columbia
actually Colombia's been one of the
leading recipients of US military aid
right through the 90s going up under
Clinton it's also the most violent
country in there in the hemisphere there
are State Department reports would
suggest that about ten people a day are
victims of political violence has well
over a million internal refugees most of
the violence is attributed to
paramilitaries including by the State
Department paramilitaries are
essentially a front for the military and
landowners other atrocities of the
military directly there are also
guerrilla atrocities but the large
majority are government paramilitary
they're all connected to in complicated
not so complicated ways to landownership
resource control now in the last year's
narco trafficking and so on and the u.s.
is fighting what it calls a drug war
including and certainly biological
warfare so new fungicides are being
introduced nobody knows what effect
they'll have they're supposed to kill
coca but something else happens not our
business
crop spraying
just government and power military
violence everyone knows that the
paramilitaries and the military are tied
up with the drug traffic just a couple
of months ago a Columbia Air Force plane
was picked up one of the Air Force
commanders full of drugs this is this
happening all through the region
incidentally the presidential jet of the
president of Nicaragua was recently the
subject of a major scandal in Nicaragua
kept out of that press here because he's
our boy and it was found that it was via
the jet was being used for a drug
transport from you know Miami
wherever going through Nicaragua which
has become a major drug transit area
ever since the u.s. took it over in 1990
but Colombia is a much bigger one the
whole drug war you can't really talk
about the tactics in my opinion because
the whole thing is conceived in a way
which you know it's it has a kind of a
rationality from the point of view of
those who are executing the war but it
has no rationality from a human point of
view so from a human point of view the
drug problem is in the United States in
fact the u.s. is the major maybe the
major producer or one of the major
producers of the most of the drug that's
the substance is it's gold that's most
rapidly increasing namely synthetics
they're made right here even the drugs
that are made that are produced in the
Andes or product produced with u.s.
chemicals the money mostly goes through
US banks the drug problem as it's called
is largely a manufactured problem so you
want to figure out what it's like the
peak of marijuana there has never take
say marijuana there has never been any
medic medical evidence presented that
it's probably not good for you you know
just like good for you or something I'm
sure it's not good for you but the
evidence about it is extremely slim
certainly no medical evidence was
presented to justify its being criminal
in fact the American Medical Association
never favored the criminalization was a
different thing as an interesting
history the peak use forgetting the
criminalization the peak use of
marijuana is every I'm remembering
figures so like they may not be exactly
right but something like this was around
1980 and the criminalization level was
very low
the reason was quite straightforward it
was people like you you know and they
don't get sent to jail or their parents
make a fuss and do things about it and
so on so those guys don't go to jail
through the 1980s two things were
happening use of substances over a very
broad range was declining among educated
people and that's very broad marijuana
hard drugs coffee tobacco red meat you
know big spectrum of stuff it was
declining I mean all sorts of changes in
lifestyle but it was remaining steady or
maybe even increasing among poor people
which means and there's a close the
United States is almost alone in the
industrial world in that though it has
statistics on everything it does not
have statistics on class that's an
ideological decision so you can't get
figures on class out of the Census
Bureau you have to reconstruct them in
some fashion well unlike other countries
but there is a closed class race
correlation and among the poor and hence
heavily among minorities there was
either steady or increasing use of the
substances well you take a look at the
trend lines and ask yourself when the
drug war was called and it was
approximately when they crossed so you
could predict victory in the drug war
among educated people because the trend
lines were already going down so I'll
continue going down and you could also
predict what was pointed out by Senator
Moynihan my favorite character but he
does happen to be one of the few
senators who paid attention to social
statistics social scientists and he
pointed out that we are determining to
declare a war a criminal
an upper a rise in crime or you know
something like that among mine are
we're determining to declare a crime
wave among the minorities that's exactly
what we're doing by declaring the drug
war and I think it was done and I think
it was done for reasons of social policy
this is a superfluous population they
are the counterpart of the Columbian
disposables disposable people and you
want a crime war among them for two
reasons for one thing because you can
get rid of them toss them into jail and
for another thing you can frighten
everybody else and that's important
crime in general is a you know in the
United States it's a kind of a political
construct the the crime in the United
States is not very different from other
industrial countries you know with the
single exception of killings with guns
which is special thing about the gun
laws and the gun culture but apart from
that it's kind of at the high end of
other industrial societies fear of crime
on the other hand is way beyond other
societies and it's manufactured it's
manufactured by politicians by its the
only one of the very few countries in
which politicians stand up and you know
debate about who's going to be tougher
on crime elsewhere crime is considered a
problem you know it's like cancer or
something you try to deal with it but
you don't decide who's we tougher on it
in the United States you argue about
who's going to be tougher on it back
around 1980 the United States was pretty
much like other industrial societies
again sort of at high end in
incarceration rates since then it was
going way up by the end of the Reagan
years it was like five to ten times as
high still going up mostly a reflection
of the war on drugs victim mostly
victimless crimes possession of some
sort or another which is given
extraordinary sentences that's one of
the human rights violations for which
the United States is regularly condemned
by the human rights organization the
outrageous sentencing for victimless
crimes which is just targeting poor and
the spoke the disposable people and
frightening the rest so instrument of
social control you go over to the Andes
you know the places where coke is being
produced
there you find another story so Columbia
for example was once a wheat exporter
why isn't it a wheat exporter anymore
well the u.s. flooded it with subsidized
US agro exports
it was called food for peace back in the
50s and it undermined the Colombian
wheat industry not exporting anymore
same thing happened elsewhere Colombia
is a coffee exporter but coffee is not
very good for small peasants for a very
simple reason the u.s. refused to permit
arrangements among the producers to keep
prices stable now if prices you know
fluctuate all over the place doesn't
hurt agribusiness I mean they got enough
but you know they own another enough
other things and so on so they can make
out if coffee prices go down
if you're a small peasant you can't do
that you gotta feed your kids tomorrow
you know price goes down too low you're
dead so that drove people out of coffee
production out of wheat production out
of other production well where'd they go
well you know they were being taught a
lesson
it's called structural adjustment all
throughout neoliberalism all throughout
this region the lesson is stop producing
things for a local consumption like say
food we can do that cheaper with
subsidized agribusiness you be a
rational peasant produced for
agro-export and produce what's going to
make the most money in a grow expert
that's a rational peasant that's
following the rules well they did you're
a rational peasant you produced coca you
know grows well makes a ton of money and
so on so one part of US policy is trying
to drive the population towards
producing drugs and the other part of US
policy is to murder them if they do it
that's the support for the military and
the counterinsurgency and so on and
those two policies are going on side by
side and they don't anything to do with
drugs in the United States they do that
stuff as much as you want the drug price
remains stable the quantity of drugs
remains stable and so on this is an
internal us problem having to do with
serious social problems inside US
society and furthermore it is well
and agreed by criminologists and other
specialists across the board that the
best way to deal with serious drug
problems is education but that's you
don't spend money on that because that
has no use as for social control or for
eliminating disposable people so I don't
think talking about the tactics of the
drug war makes a lot of sense you know
the whole thing is constructed in a way
which is totally insane except for rich
people like New York banks most of the
money flows through instantly what's
happening to the money it's an
interesting question of course it's
illegal so nobody tracks it actually you
could track it so the u.s. especially
with computers and so on a Federal
Reserve System is which is well
regulated requires notification of large
deposits last time I looked it was over
$10,000 so you know it's a lot of money
suddenly coming in they tell right away
and in fact there was a campaign an
effort by federal prosecutors back in
the early 80s to carry out some you know
entrapment exercise against banks in
southern Florida which were suddenly
piling up huge amount of money for
reasons that nobody doubted it was
called off however it was called
Operation greenback it was called off by
the Reagan administration's drug czar
George Bush that was called off so the
money's supposed to come into US banks
where's it go well take a look sometime
the this is a guess nobody's ever
studied it but the US Department of
Commerce does publish regularly I think
quarterly tons of details about
everything you can imagine and one of
them is foreign direct investment FDI
you take a look at the record I haven't
done this for a year or two but I was
doing it for a couple of years in the
mid 90s you take a look at the FDI for
Latin America first and for that for the
Hemisphere the Canada is separate
category that's like Europe no but take
the rest of the hemisphere - Canada look
at foreign direct investment it turns
out that regularly about 25% of it was
going to Bermuda about 15% was going to
the British
Islands about 10% to Panama so that's
roughly 50% of what's called foreign
direct investment and the this is the
period of the emerging markets you know
everybody's excited about the emerging
markets so about half of it was going to
these places well what was it for
certainly wasn't building steel mills
notable veal plants
all right many of them in Bermuda there
is a kind of benign interpretation it's
just a way of ripping off the public by
you know evading taxes so that just
harms poor people there's a less benign
interpretation which is possible and
might be discovered if anybody bother to
look at it but I'm able to find one
technical paper and the whole literature
that even looks at the topic some of you
may know if there's some economists in
the audience but I can't find one and no
friends can find one and it's not a
minor phenomenon it's 50% of US FDI and
the big emerging market no big numbers
well you know make your own guesses
anyhow the whole system is so corrupt
and rotten from the bottom that to talk
about tactical changes is just beside
the point the current policies exactly
as you say are to increase the military
and biological warfare component of
these policies abroad and to continue
the you know the criminalization of the
disposable people at home those are the
current policies Laurie Berenson is a
very unfortunate victim of this I should
say the violence in Colombia you want to
take a look at it it goes back very deep
it goes back to a socio-economic system
in which a tiny sector of the population
has most of the wealth in a pretty
wealthy country and a huge as
extraordinarily high poverty rates
starvation and so on that's where the
violence is coming from yeah
here's the World Bank the World Bank
published a report saying they made all
sorts of mistakes you know they were
over enthusiastic and their commitment
all these wonderful things were
happening in Indonesia and being a
little over enthusiastic they kind of
played down the corruption and so on
that's not quite the story but yeah kind
of interesting the fact is that the
World Bank and the IMF were praising
Indonesia to the skies along with
Thailand Malaysia South Korea for their
solid economic fundamentals and the way
they'd been following all the rules and
all the Magnificent things they've been
doing and to their dismay the major
publications appeared exactly as the
whole system was crashing it's not the
first time that's happened incidentally
but it was a pretty dramatic case so
they've been kind of running backwards
ever since and yes they did say they'd
made a lot of mistakes
that's mild they knew what was going on
and decided they liked it cost rich
people in Indonesia were profiting and
rich people abroad for poverty so what's
the fuss no crisis now there's a crisis
so they're yeah looking back and so on
and they want to sort of reconstruct the
situation and they don't know how
because it may be that Indonesia will
simply come apart there's there two
issues that you raised one is the
disintegration possible this integration
of Indonesia the other specific case of
East Timor the East Timor cases
is difficult to figure out I mean
Indonesia let's take that one Indonesia
has agreed to grant what they call
autonomy within the Indonesian you know
Federation or something beyond that
there's a policy split which may reflect
two different tracts of Indonesian
policy or it may be two sides of the
same cynical policy nobody knows in fact
I suspect that part the people making
the policy probably don't know they're
waiting to see how things turn out one
policy track would lead towards
independence the other policy track
leads towards increasing violence
so while Indonesia is talking about okay
you guys can be independent if you want
it's also at the same time organizing
paramilitaries arming them they're
carrying out violence in fact they're
killing people driving people out by the
thousands and the places you know
exploding the same going back to the
question is happening in Colombia it's
not an unusual pattern move towards
peace negotiations and at the same time
unleashing the paramilitaries with the
military right in the background to tear
the place apart you know if there's
going to be negotiations of some kind
you want to make sure that your thugs
have it under control that those two
paths quite commonly go side by side the
you find it elsewhere to the in this
case I think it's hard to say I mean it
could be two sides of the same policy it
could be conflicting policies it could
be just uncertainty but they don't know
what's going to happen I don't think
there's much point speculating about
this frankly as I said I doubt that the
Indonesian generals know they're waiting
to see what happens what is significant
here as always is that what we do about
it could make a difference a big
difference so one of the factors and
undoubtedly a major if not decisive
factor will be how the United States
response to all of this and that's the
one factor we can do something about so
there's no point in speculating about
the others you know
what we do about these as for Indonesia
breaking up it could happen
there's a strong independence movement
in Aceh the what they call Durand Jaya
West Papua was given to Indonesia over
the objections of its population that
has an independence movement there's an
independence movement in the Moluccas it
could go all sorts of ways don't forget
that whole wreath thing was patched like
most of the world that was just patched
together but you're being imperialism
you know they put it the other for the
air reasons not for the reasons of the
countries so if you sort of randomly
broke up the United States and put them
under different flags and so on and so
forth yeah you have plenty of violence
after a while because these breakdowns
don't I mean do with what's happening on
the ground you know like for the Middle
East probably the only semi-rational
structure that's been around in the last
couple of thousand years was the Ottoman
Empire which allowed local autonomy to a
large extent within a rather loose and
corrupt and imperial framework okay you
know people were free or under the
Ottoman Empire than they've been since
they could go from one place to another
for example but they had national
treatment like General Electric ones but
then that's probably right for most of
the world actually it's probably right
for Europe too I mean the borders in
Europe are simply the result of hundreds
of years of mutual massacre in the most
violent and barbaric corner of the world
which is exactly what your was for
hundreds of years the highest goal of
Europeans was to slaughter one another
and the only reason that came to an end
in 1945 is because they all understood
that they had reached a level of
violence such that the next time they
tried that's the end for everybody
that's why you have political scientists
writing books on Democrat aren't wars
among democratic societies and so on
yeah they know they're smart enough to
know that they try once more what they
been doing for the last 500 years and
everybody's dead so right now they're
not fighting wars but the borders that
are left from these wars are pretty
irrational and in fact along with
European unification you're also finding
devolution so pressures towards regional
autonomy which probably makes a lot of
sense because the borders didn't make
any sense yes it's different in the
United States I mean here it was easy
just wiped out the indigenous population
and settle it with a fairly homogeneous
population okay no big problems but
Europe didn't develop that way and nor
did the rest of the world it was all
imposed on them by you know by competing
imperialism's the Dutch East Indies are
what the Dutch were able to hold on to
and what form it takes you know I don't
think anybody can to prescribe bits for
them to work out somehow I'm not easy
I haven't said that I don't think there
is much free trade in fact the standard
a standard figure among international
economists is that maybe 15 percent of
world trade could be called free in some
sense trade not free everybody supposed
to admire Adam Smith but you're not
supposed to read him that's very crucial
if you read Adam Smith you discover that
one bad thing that you discover is that
his argument for the market was based on
the assumption that under conditions of
Liberty a market will lead to equality
which is obviously a desiderata
so therefore he argues markets are good
it doesn't need to be quality out you
also find out he was against division of
labor or other things you're not
supposed to know but one thing you're
not supposed to know is that free trade
is based on what he called free
circulation of Labor well you know he
wasn't thinking so much about crossing
borders in those days because nobody was
even thinking of capital crossing word
or much in those days but the principle
is there so surely you don't have
anything like free trade unless you have
free circulation of Labor around the
world otherwise you know you just all
have labor markets I mean we're not
supposed to think about that along with
a lot of other things but yeah that's
true should you have free circulation of
labor well you know that raises all kind
of questions questions about how people
want to preserve their own communities
let's see but then of course those very
same questions show up with movement of
capital it's just you're not allowed to
raise them in the case of movement of
capital ok so they're hard questions no
I don't think they have trivial answers
but you can't seriously talk about free
trade unless you have free movement of
people that's one of the many reasons
why the talk about free trade is mostly
a fraud it's an ideological weapon it's
not a descriptive set and there are many
reasons not just that
Kosovo is what's called a crisis unlike
say Angola
Kosovo and it's bad you know it's not a
true like they've been a lot of
atrocities in Kosovo current estimates
are that about 2000 people were killed
it's about one night bombing by Jonas
Savimbi the the reason Kosovo is a
crisis and Angola which is way worse
it's not a crisis is because Kosovo
threatens the interests of rich and
powerful people
I mean Europe is disturbed by conflicts
that are essentially within it you know
and they don't want them to spread for
one thing to be a big flow of refugees
and for another you know if that whole
reason starts to fall apart you could
end up with wars between Greece and
Turkey and maybe a world war Russia
might get involved so it matters in
Angola it's just a lot of those guys
killing each other who cares
besides it's not a nice one to talk
about since the main killer happens to
be the person who was highly praised and
lauded as a great freedom fighter in the
United States back in the days of what
was called constructive engagement which
was a nice name for supporting South
African Marauders who were tearing the
place to shreds and killing you know
over a million people well one part of
it was our freedom fighter in Angola
who's now still tearing the place apart
not that the opposition is so great
either that's another story
anyhow it's it's a huge massacre that
doesn't harm Europeans at least as long
as the resources flow out and they are
flowing out so Savimbi's forces unit is
being supported by mostly Dimond flow
which is monopolized by a couple of
companies and they can trace the death
technically there's an embargo against
diamonds from Angola and all the
specialists in the field say that it
not hard to identify the diamonds that
come from there but the name of that
company De Beers yeah the De Beers
company claims they can't do it
you know only all the other experts can
but they can't so they are oh there's a
free flow of diamonds out of there and
all sorts of you know Belgium is really
is like that and that's supporting one
side the other side they got oil which
is going right to Western companies so
who cares
it's meanwhile they're killing each
other or starving or whatever but not
bothering rich people so it's not a
crisis you can read the journals from
Penang and Cairo the same way I did it
takes a lot of work no but it can be
done and in fact nowadays for those of
you who do use the internet I don't it's
a lot easier but the real answer is
nobody can do it alone unless they
aren't crazy so because you have to be a
fanatic on the other hand if people do
it in common that's not that hard
I mean you travel through Midwest
churches in the 1980s I mean I've done
it
you know you come to a church and you
know Lawrence Kansas or someplace they
know more about they know more about
Central America than CIA did way more
you know because there was a lot of
people and they cared about it you know
and there were people who went up and
back and they circulated information and
they were in contact with others and so
on yeah that way you can find out about
things and in fact sometimes remarkably
well I mentioned the multilateral
agreement on investments a few times if
you don't know that story you ought to
because it's a an amazing story about
how this Oregon you know activist groups
around the world without any
says to the press because the press was
keeping a lid on it for years
how much can an individual scientists do
like suppose you're alone and Tahiti you
know and you decide to work on quantum
physics how much are you going to
achieve if you are in a lab at MIT where
everybody else is interested to and you
can talk to each other and you
interchange and you know somebody read
something and somebody else comes in and
gives the paper and so on and so forth
yeah you find that you all of a sudden
you know it's magnified quite a lot it's
not different in this case that's part
of the reason for the enormous efforts
that are made to separate people from
one another I mean that's why there's a
barrage literally from infancy to
separate people from one another and
