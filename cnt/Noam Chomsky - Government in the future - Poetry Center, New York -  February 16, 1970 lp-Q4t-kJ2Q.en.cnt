the sound seminar you're about to hear
was recruited at the poetry Center of
the New York ym ywh a on February 16
1970 this program presents noam chomsky
speaking on government in the future
here is Noam Chomsky I think it's useful
to set up as a framework for discussion
for somewhat idealized positions with
regard to the role of the state in an
advanced industrial society I'm going to
call these positions first classical
liberal second libertarian socialist
third state socialist four state
capitalist and I want to consider each
in turn also I'd like to make clear my
own point of view in advance so you can
evaluate and judge what I'm saying I
think that the libertarian socialist
concepts and by that I mean a range of
thinking that extends from left-wing
Marxism through anarchism I think that
these are fundamentally correct and that
they are the proper and natural
extension of classical liberalism into
the era of advanced industrial society
in contrast it seems to me that the
ideology of state socialism that is what
has become of Bolshevism and of state
capitalism the modern welfare state
these of course are dominant in the
industrial countries in the industrial
societies but I believe that they are
regressive and highly inadequate social
theories and that will end a large
number of our really fundamental
problems stem from a kind of
incompatibility and inappropriateness of
these social forms to a modern
industrial society well then let me
consider these four points of reference
in sequence beginning with the classical
liberal point of view classical
liberalism asserts as its major idea an
opposition to all but the most
restrictive minimal forms of state
dimension and personal or social life
well this conclusion is quite familiar
however the reasoning that leads to it
is less familiar and I think a good deal
more important than the conclusion
itself
one of the earliest and most brilliant
expositions of this position is in
Vilhelm von Humboldt's
limits of state action which was written
in 1792 though not published for 60 or
70 years after that in his view the
state tends to quote tends to make an
instrument to make man an instrument to
serve its arbitrary ends overlooking his
individual purposes and since man is in
his essence of free searching self
perfecting being it follows that the
state is a profoundly at a human
institution that is its actions its
existence are ultimately incompatible
with the full harmonious development of
human potential in its richest diversity
and incompatible with what Humboldt and
in the following century marx bakunin
Mill and many others what they see is
the true end of man and for the record I
think that this is an accurate
description the modern conservative
tends to regard himself as the lineal
descendant of the classical liberal in
this sense but I think that that can be
maintained only from extremely
superficial point of view as one can see
by studying more carefully the
fundamental ideas of classical
libertarian thought as expressed in my
opinion and its most profound form
bye-bye-bye Humboldt I think the issues
are of really quite considerable
contemporary significance and if you
don't mind they what may appear to be a
somewhat antiquarian excursion I'd like
to expand on them for Humboldt as for
Rousseau and before him the Cartesians
man's essential attribute is his freedom
quote to inquire and to create these are
the centers around which all human
pursuits more or less directly revolved
but he goes on to say all moral cultures
Springs solely and immediately from the
inner life of the soul and can never be
produced by external and artificial
control Ennis's the cultivation of the
understanding as of any of man's other
faculties is neroli achieved by his own
activity his own ingenuity or his own
methods of using the discoveries of
others well from these assumptions quite
obviously an educational theory follows
and he develops it but I won't pursue it
but also for
or fellas Humboldt goes on to develop at
least the rudiments of a theory of
exploitation and of alienated labor that
suggests in significant ways I think the
early Marx so I mean Humboldt in fact
continues these comments that I made
Leah that I quoted about the cultivation
of understanding through spontaneous
action in the following way he says man
never regards what he possesses as so
much his own as what he does and the
labourer who tends a garden is perhaps
in a truer sense its owner than the lit
then the listless voluptuary who enjoys
its fruits and since truly human action
is that which flows from inner impulse
it seems as if all peasants and
craftsmen might be elevated into artists
that is men who love their labor for its
own sake improve it by their own plastic
genius and inventive skill and thereby
cultivate their intellect a noble their
character and exhaustion refine their
pleasures and so humanity would be a
noble by the very things which now
though beautiful in themselves so often
tend to degrade it freedom is
undoubtedly the indispensable condition
without which even the pursuits most
congenial to individual human nature can
never succeed in producing such salutary
influences whatever does not spring from
a man's free choice or is only the
result of instruction and guidance does
not enter into his very being but
remains alien to his true nature he does
not perform it with truly human energies
but merely with mechanical exactness and
if a man acts in a mechanical way
reacting to external demands or
instruction rather than in ways
determined by his own interests and
energies and power he says we may admire
what he does but we despise what he is
for Humboldt and man is born to inquire
and create and when a man or a child
chooses to inquire or create out of his
own free choice then he becomes in his
own terms an artist rather than a tool
of production or a well trained parrot
this is the essence of his concept of
human nature and I think it's very
revealing and interesting to compare it
with Marx with his early with the early
Marx manuscripts in particular his
account of quote the alienation of Labor
when workers external
worker not part of his nature so that he
does not fulfill himself in his work but
denies himself and is physically
exhausted and mentally debase this
alienated labor that tests some of the
workers back into a barbarous kind of
work and turns others into machines thus
depriving man of his species character
of free conscious activity and
productive life recall also Marx's well
known and often quoted reference to a
higher form of society in which labour
has become not only a means of life but
also the highest wanted life and recall
also his repeated criticism of the
specialized labor which quote again
mutilates the worker into a fragment of
a human being
degrades him to become a mirror of
pertinence of the machine makes his work
such a torment that it's essential
meaning is destroyed estranges from him
the intellectual potentialities of the
labour process in very proportion to the
extent to which science has incorporated
into it as an independent power robert
tucker for one has rightly emphasized
that Marx sees the revolutionary more as
a frustrated producer than as a
dissatisfied consumer and this far more
radical critique of capitalist relations
of production flows directly often in
the same words from the libertarian
thought of the Enlightenment for this
reason I think one must say that
classical liberal ideas in their essence
though not in the way they developed are
profoundly anti-capitalist
the essence of these ideas must be
destroyed for them to serve as an
ideology of modern industrial capitalism
writing in the 1780s and early 1790s
Humboldt had no conception of the forms
that industrial capitalism would take
consequently in this classic of
classical liberalism he stresses the
problem of limiting state power and he's
not overly concerned with the dangers of
private power the reason is that he
believes in and speaks of the essential
equality of condition of private
citizens of course he has no idea
writing in 1790 of the ideas of the ways
in which the notion private person would
come to be reinterpreted in the era of
corporate capitalism he did not foresee
and now quote the anarchist mr.
and Rudolf rocker he did not foresee
that democracy with its model equality
of all citizens before the law and
liberalism with its right of man over
his own person both would be wrecked on
the realities of capitalist economy whom
both did not perceive that in a
predatory capitalist economy state
intervention would be an absolute
necessity to preserve human existence to
prevent the destruction of the physical
environment
I speak optimistically of course as Karl
Polanyi for one has pointed out the
self-adjusting market could not exist
for any length of time without
annihilating the human and natural
substance of society it would have
physically destroyed man and transformed
his surroundings into a wilderness I
think that's correct
Humboldt also did not foresee the
consequences of the commodity character
of labour the doctrine again in Kalani's
words that it is not for the commodity
to decide where it should be offered for
sale to what purpose it should be used
at what price it should be allowed to
change hands in what manner it should be
consumed or destroyed but the commodity
in this case of course a human life and
social protection was there for a
minimal necessity to constrain the
irrational and destructive workings of
the classical free-market nor did humble
understand the 1917 1790 that capitalist
economic relations perpetuate the form
of bondage which long before that in
fact as early as 1767 see Mullin gay had
declared to be even worse than slavery
writing it is the impossibility of
living by any other means that compels
our farm laborers to till the soil
fruits they will not eat and our masons
to construct buildings in which they
will not live it is one that drags them
to those markets where they await
masters who will do them the kindness of
buying it is once that compels them to
go down on their knees to the rich man
in order to get from him permission to
enrich him what effective gain has the
suppression of slavery brought him he's
free you say that is his misfortune
these men that have said have no master
they have one and the most terrible the
most imperious of masters that is need
is this that reduces to the most cruel
dependence and if there is something
degrading to human nature in the idea of
bondage as every
spokesmen for the Enlightenment would
insist then it would follow that a new
emancipation must be awaited
what Fourier referred to as the third
and last emancipatory phase of history
the first having made serfs out of
slaves
the second wage earners out of serfs and
the third which will transform the
proletariat to freemen by eliminating
the commodity character of labour ending
wage slavery and bringing the commercial
industrial and financial institutions
under Democratic control these are all
things that Humboldt in his classical
liberal doctrine did not Express and
didn't see but I think he might have
accepted these conclusions he does for
example under degree that state
intervention in social life is
legitimate if freedom would destroy the
very conditions without which not only
freedom but even existence itself would
be inconceivable which are precisely the
circumstances that arise in an
unconstrained capitalist economy and he
does as in the remarks that I quoted
vigorously condemned the alienation of
Labor event his criticism of bureaucracy
and the autocratic state stands as a
very eloquent forewarning of some of the
most dismal aspects of modern history
and the important point is that the
basis of his critique is applicable to a
far broader range of coercive
institutions than he imagined in
particular to the institutions of
industrial capitalism though he
expresses a classical liberal doctrine
Humboldt is a primitive individualist in
the style of for example Russo Joe Russo
of tolls the Savage who lives within
himself but Humboldt vision is entirely
different he sums up his remarks as
follows he says the whole tenor of the
ideas and arguments unfolded in this
essay might terribly reduce to this that
while they would break all fetters in
human society they would attempt to find
as many new social bonds as possible the
isolated man is no more able to develop
than the one who is fettered and he in
fact looks forward to a community of
free association without coercion by the
state or other authoritarian
institutions in which free men can
create and inquire achieved the highest
development of their powers back far
ahead of his time he presents an
anarchist vision the
is appropriate perhaps to the next stage
of industrial society we can perhaps
look forward to a day when these various
strands will be brought together within
the framework of libertarian socialism a
social form that barely exists today
though its elements can perhaps be
perceived for example in the guaranty of
individual rights that has achieved so
far its fullest realization though still
tragically flawed in the Western
democracies or in the Israeli Cuba scene
or in the experiments with workers
councils in Yugoslavia or an effort to
awaken popular consciousness and to
create a new involvement in the social
process which is a fundamental element
in the third world revolutions
coexisting uneasily with indefensible
authoritarian practice so I mean
summarize its first point the first
concept of the state that I want to set
up as a point of reference classical
liberal its doctrine is that the state
functions should be drastically limited
but this familiar characterization is a
very superficial one more deeply the
classical liberal view develops from a
certain concept of human nature one that
stresses the importance of diversity and
free creation and therefore this view is
in fundamental opposition to industrial
capitalism its wage slavery its
alienated labor and its hierarchical
authoritarian principles of social and
economic organization at least in its
unbolting inform classical liberal
thought is opposed as well to the
concepts of possessive individualism
which are intrinsic to capitalist
ideology so it seeks to eliminate social
fetters but to replace them by social
bonds not by competitive greed not by
predatory individualism not of course by
corporate Empire State or private
classical libertarian thought seems to
me therefore to lead directly to
libertarian socialism or anarchism if
you like when combined with an
understanding of industrial capitalism
well the second point of reference that
I want to discuss is the libertarian
socialist vision of the state a French
writer rather sympathetic to anarchism
once wrote that anarchism has a broad
back like paper
anything and there are many shades of
anarchism and I'm concerned here only
with one namely the anarchism of Bakunin
who wrote in his anarchist manifesto of
1865 that the an anarchist one must
first be a socialist I'm concerned with
the anarchism of Bayda a Fisher one of
the martyrs of the Haymarket affair in
1886 who said that every anarchist is a
socialist but not every socialist is
necessarily an anarchist a consistent
anarchist must oppose private ownership
of the means of production such property
is indeed as Kazan as famous remark
asserted a form theft but a consistent
anarchist will also oppose the
organization of production by government
I'm quoting it means state socialism the
command of the state officials over
production and the command of managers
scientists shop officials in the shop
the goal of the working class is
liberation from exploitation and this
goal is not reached and cannot be
reached by a new directing and governing
class substituting itself for the
bourgeoisie it is only realized by the
workers themselves being master over
production by some form of workers
councils these remarks that happens are
quoted from the left-wing Marxist anton
Pannekoek and in fact radical Marxism
what Lenin once called infantile
ultra-left vism merges with anarchist
currents there's an important point I
think and let me give one further
illustration of this convergence between
left-wing Marxism and socialist
anarchism consider it the following
characterization of revolutionary
socialism the revolutionary socialist
denies the state ownership can end in
anything other than a bureaucratic
despotism we have seen why the state
cannot democratically control industry
industry can only be democratically
owned and controlled by the workers
electing directly from their own ranks
industrial administrative committees
socialism will be fundamentally an
industrial system its constituencies
will be of an industrial character thus
those carrying on the social activity
and industries of society will be
directly represented in the local and
central councils of social
administration in this way the powers of
such delegates will flow upwards from
those
the work and conversant with the needs
of the community when the central
administrative Industrial Committee
meets it will represent every phase of
social activity hence the capitalist
political or geographical state will be
replaced by the Industrial
Administrative Committee of socialism
the transition from one social system to
the other will be the social revolution
the political state throughout history
has meant the government of men by
ruling classes the Republic of socialism
will be the government of Industry
administered on behalf of the whole
community
the former meant the economic and
political subjection of the many the
latter will mean the economic freedom of
all it will be therefore a true
democracy these remarks are taken from a
book called the state its origins and
function written by William Paul in
early 1917 just prior to Lenin state and
revolution which is his most libertarian
work William Paul was one of the
founders of the British Communist Party
later the editor the British Communist
Party journal and it's interesting that
his critique of state socialism
resembles very closely I think the
libertarian doctrine of the anarchists
in particular in its principle that the
state must disappear to be replaced by
the industrial organization of society
in the course of the social revolution
itself foregone in 1851 wrote that what
we put in place of the government is
industrial organization and many many
similar comments can be cited that in a
sense is the fundamental idea of
anarchist revolutionaries what's more
important than the fact that many such
statements can be cited is that these
ideas have been realized in spontaneous
revolutionary action several times for
example in Germany and Italy after the
first world war in Catalonia in 1936 one
might argue I least I would argue that
council communism in this sense in the
sense of a long quotation that I read is
the natural form of revolutionary
socialism in an industrial society it
reflects the intuitive understanding
that democracy is largely a sham when
the industrial system is controlled by
any form of autocratic elite
whether of owners managers technocrats a
vanguard party a state bureaucracy or
whatever under these conditions of
authoritarian domination the classical
liberal
ideals which are expressed also by Marx
and Bakunin and all through
revolutionaries cannot be realized man
will in other words not be free to
inquire and create to develop his own
potentialities to their fullest the
worker will remain a fragment of a human
being degraded a tool in the productive
process directed from above now the
ideas of revolutionary libertarian
socialism in this sense they've been
submerged in the industrial societies of
the past century the dominant ideologies
have been those of state socialism and
state capitalism but there's been an
interesting resurgence in the last
couple of years in fact the theses that
I quoted from Anton Penacook are taken
from a recent pamphlet of a radical
French workers group and the quotation
that I read from William Paul and
revolutionary socialism was taken from a
paper by Walter Kendall at the National
Conference on workers control in
Sheffield England last March both of
these groups the French and the English
one represents something significant the
workers control movement in England in
particular has developed into a I think
remarkably significant force in the last
few years it includes some of the
largest trade unions for example the
amalgamated engineering Federation which
i think is the second largest trade
union in england and which has taken
these principles as its fundamental
ideas it's had a series of successful
conferences putting out an interesting
pamphlet literature and on the continent
there are parallel developments May 1968
in France of course accelerated the
growing interest in council communism
and similar idea to other forms of
libertarian socialism in France and
Germany as it did in England given the
general conservative cast of our highly
ideological society it's not too
surprising that the United States is
relatively untouched by these currents
but that too may change the erosion of
the Cold War mythology at least makes it
possible to discuss some of these
questions and if the present wave of
repression can be beaten back if the
left can overcome its more suicidal
tendencies and build on the achievements
of the past decade the problem of how to
organize industrial society on a truly
democratic lawn
with Democratic control in the workplace
as well as in the community this should
become the dominant intellectual issue
for those who are alive to the problems
of contemporary society and there's a
mass movement for revolutionary
libertarian socialism develops as I hope
it will speculation should proceed to
action now may seem quixotic
to group left Marxism and anarchism
under the same rubric as I've done given
the antagonism throughout the past
century between Marxists and anarchists
beginning with the antagonism between
Marx and angles on the one hand and for
example pre-dawn bakunin on the other in
the 19th century at least their
differences with regard to the question
of the state was significant but in a
sense it was tactical the anarchists
were convinced that capitalism and the
state must be destroyed together angles
in a letter of 1883 expressed his
opposition to this idea as follows the
anarchists put the thing upside down
they declare that the proletarian
revolution must begin by doing away with
the political organization of the state
but the destroy at the moment would be
to destroy the only organism by means of
which the victorious proletariat can
assert its newly conquered power hold
down its adversaries and carry out that
economic revolution of society without
which the whole victory must end in a
new defeat and a mass slaughter of the
workers similar to those asked the Paris
Commune the Paris Commune I think it's
fair to say did represent the ideas of
libertarian socialism of anarchism if
you like and Marx of course wrote about
it with great enthusiasm he in fact the
experience of the commune led him to
modify his concept for the role of the
state as you can see for example by
looking at the introduction to the
Communist Manifesto the the addition of
it was published in 1872 and to take on
something like a more anarchist
perspective of the nature of social
revolution well the commune was of
course drowned in blood as the anarchist
communes of Spain were destroyed by
fascist and communist armies and it
might be argued that more dictatorial
structures would have defended the
revolution against such forces but I
doubt this very much at least in the
case of Spain it seems to me that a more
consistent libertarian policy might have
provided the only possible defense of
the revolution
of course this can be contested and it's
a long story which I want to go into
here but at the very least it's clear
that one would have to be rather naive
after the events of the past half
century to fail to see the truth in Baku
nuns repeated warnings that the red
bureaucracy would prove the most vile
and terrible lie of the century
he once said takes the most radical
revolutionary and place him on the
throne of all the Russia's to roll
Russia said in 1874 given a dictatorial
power and before a year has passed he
will become worse than the Tsar himself
I'm afraid in this respect the Koonin
was all too perceptive and this kind of
warning was repeatedly voiced from the
from the left for example the
anarcho-syndicalist for an envelope Jay
asked 1890s must even the transitory
state to which we have to submit
necessarily and fatally be the
collectivist jail can't assist in a free
organization limited exclusively by the
needs of production and consumption all
political institutions having
disappeared I don't pretend to know the
answer to that question but I think it's
tolerably clear that unless the answer
is positive the chances for a truly
democratic revolution that will achieve
the humanistic ideals of the left or
perhaps rather slight I think Martin
Buber put the problem quite succinctly
when he said one cannot in the nature of
things expect a little tree that has
been turned into a club to put forth
leaves for just this reason it's
essential that a powerful revolutionary
movement exists in the United States if
there are to be any reasonable
possibilities for democratic social
change of a radical sort any within a
capitalist world and comparable remarks
I think undoubtedly hold for the Russian
Empire Lynn until the end of his life
stressed the idea I quote that it is an
elementary truth of Marxism that the
victory of socialism requires the joint
effort of workers in a number of
advanced countries a very least it
requires that the great centers of world
imperialism be impeded by domestic
pressures from counter revolutionary
intervention only such possibilities
will permit any revolution to overthrow
its own coercive state institutions as
it over as it tries to bring the econ
under direct Democratic control well let
me summarize briefly again I've
mentioned so far two reference points
for a discussion of the state classical
liberalism and libertarian socialism
they're in agreement that the functions
of the state are repressive and that
state action must be limited the
libertarian socialist goes on to insist
that the state power must be eliminated
in favor of the democratic organization
of industrial society with direct
popular control over all institutions by
those who participate in as well as
those who are directly affected by the
workings of these institutions so one
might imagine that a system of workers
councils consumers councils communist em
Blees regional Federation's and so on
with the kind of representation that's
direct and revocable in the sense that
representatives are directly answerable
to and returned directly to the well
defined and integrated social group for
which they speak in some higher order
organization something obviously very
different than our system of
representation now unlike very well we
asked whether such a social structure is
feasible in a complex highly
technological society there are counter
arguments and I think they fall into two
main categories first category is that
such an organization is contrary to
human nature and the second category
says roughly that it's incompatible with
the demands of efficiency and I'd like
to briefly consider each of these
consider the first that a free society
is contrary to human nature it's often
asked the men really want freedom do
they want the responsibility that goes
with it or would they prefer to be ruled
by a benevolent master consistently
apologists for the existing distribution
of power have held to one or another
version of the idea of the happy slave
200 years ago Rousseau denounced the
sophistic politicians and intellectuals
who searched for ways to obscure the
fact so he maintained that the essential
and defining property of man is freedom
they attribute to man a natural
inclination to servitude without
thinking that it is the same for freedom
as for innocence and virtue their value
is felt only as long as one enjoys than
oneself and a taste for them is lost as
soon as one has lost them as
of this doctrine he refers to the
marvels done by all free peoples to
guard themselves from oppression true he
says those who have abandoned the life
of a free man do nothing but boast and
secondly of the peace and repose they
enjoy in their chains but when I see the
other sacrifice pleasures repose wealth
power and life itself for the
preservation of this soul good which is
so disdained by those who have lost it
when I see multitudes of entirely naked
savages European voluptuousness and in
your hunger fire the sword and death to
preserve only their independence I feel
it does not behoove slaves to reason
about freedom a comment which to which
we can perhaps give a contemporary
interpretation rather similar thoughts
were expressed by Conte forty years
later he cannot he says Express the
proper accept the proposition that
certain people are not right for freedom
for example the surface of some landlord
if one accepts this description he
writes freedom will never be itseif
for one cannot arrive at the maturity
for freedom without having already
acquired it one might be free to learn
how to make use of one's powers freely
and usefully the first attempts will
surely be brutal and will lead to a
state of affairs more painful and
dangerous than the former condition
under the dominance but also the
protection of an external authority
however one can be written only through
one's own experiences and one must be
free to be able to undertake them to
accept the principle that freedom is
worthless for those under one's control
and that one has the right to refuse it
to them forever is an infringement on
the right of God himself who has created
man to be free this particular remark is
interesting because of its context as
well content and this miss occasion was
defending the French Revolution during
terror against those who claimed that it
showed the masses to be unready for the
privilege of freedom and his remarks to
I think have obvious contemporary
relevance no rational person will
approve of violence and terror and in
particular the terror of the
post-revolutionary state which is fallen
into the hands of the grim autocracy has
more than once reached indescribable
levels of savagery at the same time no
person of understanding or humanity will
too quickly can
the violence that often occurs when long
subdued masses rise against their
oppressors or take their first steps
towards liberty and social
reconstruction Humboldt just a few years
before Kant had expressed the view very
similar to that he also said that
freedom and variety are the
preconditions for human self-realization
nothing promotes this rightness for
freedom so much as freedom itself this
truth perhaps may not be acknowledged by
those who have so often used this on
rightness as an excuse for continuing
repression but it seems to me to follow
unquestionably from the very nature of
men the incapacity for freedom can only
arise from a want of moral and
intellectual power to heighten this
power is the only way to supply the want
but to do so presupposes the freedom
which awakens spontaneous activity and
those who do not comprehend this he says
may justly be suspected of
misunderstanding human nature and
wishing to make men into machines Rosa
Luxemburg fraternal sympathetic critique
of Bolshevik ideology and practice was
given in very similar terms only the
active participation of the masses and
self-government and social
reconstruction could bring about what
she described as the complete spiritual
transformation in the masses degraded by
centuries of worship our class rule just
as only their creative experience and
spontaneous action can solve the myriad
problems of creating a libertarian
socialist society
one might say she went on say that
historically the error is committed by a
truly revolutionary movement are
infinitely more fruitful than the
infallibility of the cleverest Central
Committee and I think that these remarks
can be translated immediately for the
somewhat parallel ideology of the
soulful corporation which is now fairly
popular among American academics for
example Carl Kaizen who writes no longer
the agent of proprietorship seeking to
maximize return on investment management
sees itself is responsible to
stockholders employees customers the
general public and perhaps most
important the firm itself as an
institution there is no display of greed
or grasping this there's no attempt to
push off on the workers of the community
at least part of the social costs of the
enterprise
the modern corporation is a soulful
corporation similarly the vanguard party
is a soulful party and both faces those
who urge that men submit to the rule of
these benevolent autocracies may I think
justly be accused of wishing to make men
into machines now the correctness of the
view which is expressed by Rousseau and
Conte and Humboldt and Luxembourg and
innumerable others I don't think that
the correctness of this is the moment
susceptible to scientific proof one can
only evaluate it in terms of experience
and intuition but one can also point out
the social consequences of adopting the
view that men are born to be free or
that they are born to be ruled by
benevolent autocrats
one of the second question the question
of efficiency is democratic control of
the industrial system down to its
smallest functional units incompatible
with efficiency this is very frequently
argued on several grounds some say for
example that centralized management is a
technological imperative but I think the
argument is exceedingly weak when one
looks into it the very same technology
that brings relevant information to the
board of managers can bring it at the
time that it is needed to everyone in
the workforce the technology that's now
capable of eliminating the stupefying
labor that turns men into specialized
tools of production this technology
permits in principle leisure and the
educational opportunities that make them
able to use this information in a
rational way and furthermore even an
economic elite which is dripping with
soulfulness
to use Ralph Miliband phrase is
constrained by the system in which it
functions to organize production for
certain ends power growth profit but not
in the nature of the case human needs
needs that to an ever more critical
degree can be expressed only in
collective terms it's surely conceivable
and perhaps it's even likely that
decisions made by the collective itself
will reflect these needs and interests
as well as those made by various soulful
beats in any event it's a bit difficult
to take seriously arguments about
efficiency in a society that devotes
such enormous resources to waste and
destruction as everyone knows the very
concept of efficiency is dripping with
ideology maximum maximization of
commodities is hardly the only measure
of a decent existence the point is
familiar
no elaboration is necessary well let me
turn finally to the two final points of
reference the bolster state socialist in
the state capitalist as I've tried to
suggest they have points in common and
an interesting respects they diverge
from the classical liberal ideal or its
later elaboration in libertarian
socialism since I'm concerned with our
society let me make a few rather
elementary observations about the role
of the state it's likely evolution and
the ideological assumptions the company
and sometimes disguise these phenomena
it's obvious to begin with that we can
distinguish two systems of power the
political system in the economic system
the former consists in principle of
elected representatives of the people
who set public policy the latter in
principle is a system of private power a
system of private empires that are free
from public control except in the remote
and indirect ways in which even a feudal
nobility or pellet Aryan dictatorship
must be responsive to the public will
there are several immediate consequences
of this organization of society the
first is that in a subtle way an
authoritarian caste of mind is induced
in a very large mass of the population
which is subject to arbitrary decree
from above and I think this has a great
effect on the general character of a
culture the effect the belief that one
must obey arbitrary dictates and accede
to Authority and I think in fact the
remarkable and exciting fact about the
youth movement in recent years is that
it's challenging and beginning to break
down some of these authoritarian
patterns second fact that is important
is that the range of decisions that are
in principle subject the public
Democratic control is quite narrow for
example it excludes in law and principle
the central institutions in any advanced
industrial society that is the entire
commercial industrial and financial
system and a third fact is that even
within the narrow range of issues that
are submitted in principle to democratic
decision-making the centres of private
power of course exert and inordinately
heavy influence in perfectly obvious
ways through control of the media
through control of political
organizations are in fact for this by
the simple and direct
of supplying the top personnel for the
parliamentary system itself as they
obviously do dick Barnett in a recent
study of this reports his study of the
top 400 decision-makers in the post-war
national security system that most have
I quote now come from executive suites
and law offices within shouting distance
of each other in 15 city blocks and five
major cities and every other study shows
the same thing in short the democratic
system at best functions within a very
narrow range in a capitalist democracy
and even within this narrow range its
functioning is enormous ly biased by the
concentrations of private power and by
the authoritarian and passive modes of
thinking that are induced by autocratic
institutions such as industries for
example it's a truism but one that must
be constantly stressed that capitalism
and democracy are ultimately quite
incompatible and a careful look at the
matter I think merely strengthens this
conclusion there are perfectly obvious
processes of centralization of control
taking place in both the political and
the industrial system as far as the
political system is concerned in every
parliamentary democracy not only ours
the role of parliament and policy
formation has been declining in the
years since World War two as everyone
knows and political commentators
repeatedly point out the executive in
other words has become increasingly more
powerful as the planning functions of
the state become more significant the
House Armed Services Committee a couple
of years ago described the role of
Congress as that of a sometimes queer
ulis but essentially kindly uncle who
complains while furiously puffing on his
pipe but who finally as everyone expects
gives in and hands over the allowance
and careful studies of civil military
decision since World War to show that
this is quite an accurate perception
senator Vandenberg 20 years ago
expressed his fear that the American
chief executive would become the number
one world warlord of the earth his
phrase that has since occurred clearest
decision is the decision to escalate in
Vietnam February 1965 and cynical
disregard of the expressed will of the
electorate this incident reveals I think
with perfect clarity
the role of the public and decision
about peace and war the role of the
public and decisions about the main
lines of public policy in general and it
also suggests the relevance of electoral
politics to major decisions of national
policy unfortunately you can't vote the
rascals out because you never voted them
in in the first place the corporate the
corporate executives and the corporation
lawyers and so on who overwhelmingly
staff the executive assisted in
increasingly by a university-based
Mandarin class these people remain in
power no matter whom you elect and
furthermore it's interesting to note
that this ruling elite is pretty clear
about its social role as an example take
Robert McNamara who's a person widely
praised in liberal circles for his
humanity is technical brilliance and has
campaigned to control the military his
views of social organization I think are
quite illuminating he says vital
decision-making in policy matters as
well as business must remain at the top
that is partly they're not completely
what the top is for and he goes on to
suggest that this is apparently a divine
imperative I quoted God is clearly
democratic he distributes brain power
universally but he quite justifiably
expects us to do something efficient and
constructive with that priceless gift
that's what management is all about
management management is in the end the
most creative of all the Arts for its
medium as human talent itself the real
threat to democracy comes from under
management the under management of
society is not the respect of Liberty it
is simply to let some force other than
reason shape reality if it is not reason
that rules man then man falls short of
his potential end of quote so reason
then is to be identified as the
centralization of decision-making at the
top and the hands of management the
popular involvement in decision making
is a threat to Liberty a violation of
reason reason is embodied in autocratic
tightly managed institutions
strengthening these institutions within
which men and function most efficiently
is in his words the great human
adventure of our time well this has a
faintly familiar ring to it and I think
it is the
authentic role of the the authentic
voice of the technical intelligentsia
liberal intelligentsia the technocratic
corporate elite in a modern society
there is a parallel process of
centralization and economic life
there's a recent FTC report which notes
that the 200 largest manufacturing
corporations now control about
two-thirds of all manufacturing assets
at the beginning of World War two the
same amount of power was spread over a
thousand corporations I quote the report
it says a small industrial elite of huge
conglomerate companies is gobbling up
American business and largely destroying
competitive free enterprise furthermore
it says the 200 corporations are
partially linked with each other and
with other corporations in ways that may
prevent or discourage independent
behavior and market decisions
what is novel about such observations is
only their source
the FTC they are familiar to the point
of cliche among left liberal
commentators on American society the
centralization of power also has an
international dimension it's been
pointed out that on the baseline quoting
from foreign affairs that on the basis
of the gross value of their output US
enterprises abroad and the aggregate
comprise the third largest country in
the world with a gross product greater
than that of any country except the
United States and Soviet Union American
firms control over half the automobile
industry in England almost 40% of
petroleum in Germany over 40 percent
that tell of the telegraphic telephone
and electronic and business equipment in
France
75 percent of the computers within a
decade given present trends more than
half of the British exports will be from
American owned companies and furthermore
these are highly concentrated
investments 40% of direct investment in
Germany France and Britain is by three
firms American firms George ball has
explained that the project of
constructing an integrated world economy
dominated by American capital and Empire
in other words is no idealistic pipe
dream but a hard-headed prediction it's
a role he says into which we are being
pushed by the imperatives of our own
economy the major instrument being the
multinational corporation which George
Ball describes as follows
in its modern form the multinational
corporation or one with worldwide
operations and markets is a distinctly
American development through such
corporations it has become possible for
the first time to use the world to
resources with maximum efficiency but
there must be greater unification of the
world economy to give full play to the
benefits of multinational corporations
these multinational corporations are the
beneficiary of the mobilization of
resources by the federal government and
its worldwide operations and markets are
back to ultimately both American
military force now based in dozens of
countries it's not difficult to guess
who will reap the benefits from the
integrated world economy which is the
domain of operation of these American
based international economic
institutions well at this stage and
discussion one has to mention the
spectre of communism what is the threat
of communism to this system for a clear
and cogent answer when can turn to an
extensive study of the Woodrow Wilson
foundation the National Planning
Association called the political economy
of American foreign policy very
important book which was compiled by a
representative segment of the tiny elite
that largely sets public policy whoever
is technically in office in effect it's
as close as you can come to a manifesto
of the American ruling class here they
define the primary threat of communism
as a quote the economic transformation
of the Communist powers in ways which
reduce their willingness or ability to
complement the industrial economies of
the West that is the primary threat of
communism communism in short reduces the
willingness and ability of
underdeveloped countries to function in
the world capitalist economy in the
manner of for example the Philippines
which has developed a colonial economy
of a classic type after 75 years of
American tutelage and domination it's
this doctrine which explains why the
British economists Joan Robinson
describes the American crusade against
communism as a crusade against
development the Cold War ideology and
the International communist conspiracy
function an important way as essentially
a propaganda device to mobilize support
at a particular historical moment for
this long time Imperial
Enterprise in fact I believe that this
is probably the main function of the
Cold War it serves as a useful device
for the managers of American society and
their counterparts in the Soviet Union
to control their own populations and
their own respective Imperial systems I
think that the persistence of the Cold
War can be in part explained by its
utility for the managers of the two
great world systems
well there's one final element that has
to be added to this picture namely the
ongoing militarization of American
society how does this entry in to see I
think want us to look back at World War
two and to recall that prior to World
War two of course we were deep in the
depression World War two taught a an
important economic lesson it taught the
lesson that government induced
production in a carefully controlled
economy centrally controlled could
overcome the effects of a depression I
think this is what Charles II Wilson had
in mind in 1944 when he proposed that we
then that we have a permanent war
economy in the post-war world of course
the trouble is that in a capitalist
economy there are only a number of ways
in which government intervention can
take place can't be competitive with the
private empires for example which is to
say it can't be any useful production in
fact it has to be the production of
luxury goods goods not not capital not
useful commodities which would be
competitive and unfortunately there's
only one category of luxury goods that
can be produced endlessly with rapid
obsolescence quickly Westing and no
limit on how many of them you can use we
all know what that is this whole matter
is described pretty well by the business
historian Alfred Chandler he describes
the economic lessons of World War two as
follows the government spent far more
than the most enthusiastic new dealer
had ever proposed most of the output of
the expenditures was destroyed or left
on the battlefields of Europe and Asia
but the resulting increased demand sent
the nation into a period of prosperity
the like of which had never before been
seen
moreover the supplying of huge armies
and navies fighting the most massive war
of all time required a centralized
control of the national company this
effort brought corporate managers to
Washington to carry out one of the most
calm
flex pieces of economic planning in
history that experience lessened the
ideological fears over the government's
role in stabilizing the economy as a
conservative commentator I went out made
added that the ensuing Cold War carried
further the D politicization of American
society and created kind of a
psychological environment in which the
government is able to intervene and part
through fiscal policies and part through
public work and public services but very
largely of course through defense
spending in this way to use for
Chandler's words the government acts as
a coordinator of last resort when
managers are unable to maintain a high
level of aggregate demand as another
conservative historian Joseph Monson
writes enlightened corporate managers
far from fearing government intervention
in the economy view the new economics as
a technique for increasing corporate
viability of course the most cynical use
of these ideas is by the managers of the
publicly subsidized war industries there
was a remarkable series in Washington
Post about this last about a year ago
but Bernard noscitur for example he
quoted samuel downer financial vice
president of LTV aerospace one of the
big new conglomerates who explained why
the post-war world must be bolstered by
military orders he said it's basic it's
selling appeal is defensive a home this
is one of the greatest appeals the
politicians have to adjusting the system
if you're the president and you need a
control factor in the economy and you
need to sell this factor
you can't sell Harlem and Watts but you
can sell self-preservation and new
environment we're going to increase
defense budgets as long as those
bastards in Russia are ahead of us the
American people understand this of
course those bastards aren't exactly
ahead of us in this deadly of cynical
game but that's only a minor
embarrassment to the thesis in times of
need we can always follow the u.s.
Cubert Humphrey and other luminaries and
appeal to the billion Chinese armed to
the teeth and setting out a world
conquest
again I want to emphasize the role in
this system of the Cold War as a
technique of domestic control technique
for developing the psychological climate
of paranoia and psychosis in which the
taxpayer will be willing to provide an
enormous endless subsidy to the
technologically advanced sectors of
American industry and the corporations
that dominate this increasingly
centralized system well of course
probably obvious that Russian
imperialism is not an invention of
American ideologists it's real enough to
the Hungarians of the Czechs for example
what is an invention is the uses to
which it's put for example by Dean
Acheson or 19 in 1950 or Walt Rostow a
decade later when they pretend that the
Vietnam War is an example of Russian
imperialism or by the Johnson
administration in 1965 when it justifies
the dominican intervention with
reference to the sino-soviet military
bloc whereby the kennedy intellectuals
who as townsend Hoopes put it in a
article in the Washington Monthly last
month were deluded by the tensions of
the Cold War years and not perceived
that the triumphs of the National
Revolution in Vietnam would not be a
triumph for Moscow and Peking the most
remarkable degree of delusion on the
part of presumably literate men or for
example by Eugene Rostow who in a recent
book that was very widely praised by
liberal senators and academic
intellectuals outlined a series of
challenges to World Order in the modern
era as follows
Napoleon Kaiser Vilhelm Hitler and
continuing in the post-war world general
strikes in France and Italy the civil
war in Greece and the attack on South
Vietnam where he writes in 1968 Russia
has put up two severe tests in its
efforts to spread communism by the sword
now there's a very interesting series of
challenges to World Order
Napoleon Kaiser Vilhelm Hitler general
strikes in France in Italy the civil war
in Greece and the Russian attack on
South Vietnam if one thinks it through
he can some pretty interesting
conclusions about modern history well
one can continue this indefinitely I
mean to suggest that the Cold War
highly functional both to the American
elite and its Soviet counterpart who in
a perfectly similar way exploit Western
imperialism which they did not invent as
they send their armies into
Czechoslovakia it's important in both
cases in providing an ideology for
empire and for the government-subsidized
system here of military capitalism it's
predictable then that challenges to this
ideology will be bitterly resisted by
force if necessary
now in many ways American society is
indeed open and liberal values are
preserved however is poor people and
black people and other ethnic minorities
know very well the liberal veneer is
pretty thin Mark Twain once wrote that
it is by the goodness of God that in our
country we have those three unspeakably
precious things freedom of speech
freedom of conscience and the prudence
never to practice either of them
those who lack the prudence may well pay
the cost roughly speaking I think it's
accurate to say that a corporate a lead
of managers and owners governs the
economy and the political system as well
the political systems well at least in
very large measure the people so-called
do exercise an occasional choice among
those who Marx once called the rival
factions and adventurers of the ruling
class
and those who find this characterization
too harsh may prefer the formulations
for modern Democratic theorists like
Joseph Schumpeter who describes modern
political democracy favorably as a
system in which the deciding of issues
by the electorate is secondary to the
election of the men who were to do the
deciding a political party he says
accurately is a group whose members
proposed to act in concert in the
competitive struggle for political power
if that were not so it would be
impossible for different parties who
adopt exactly or almost exactly the same
program that's all the advantages of
political democracy as he sees it this
program both parties adopt more or less
exactly and the individuals who compete
for power they express a narrow
conservative ideology basically the
interests of one or other element and
the corporate elite with some
modifications now this is obviously no
conspiracy I think it's simply implicit
in the system of corporate capitalism
these people and the institutions they
represent are in effect in power and
their interests are the national
interest it's this interest that is
served primarily and overwhelmingly by
the overseas Empire and the growing
system of military state capitalism at
home if we were to withdraw the consent
of the governed as I think we should we
are withdrawing our consent to have
these men and the interests they
represent govern and manage American
society and impose their concept of
World Order and their criteria for
legitimate political and economic
development in much of the world
although an immense effort of propaganda
and mystification is carried on to
conceal these facts nonetheless facts
they remain we have today the technical
and material resources to meet man's
animal needs we have not developed the
cultural and moral resort
or the democratic forms of social
organization that make possible the
humane and rational use of our material
wealth and power conceivably the
classical liberal ideals as expressed
and developed in their libertarian
socialist form are capable but if so
only by a popular revolutionary movement
rooted in what strata of the population
and committed to the elimination
repressive and authoritarian
institutions state and private to create
such a movement is the challenge we face
and must meet if there's to be an escape
from contemporary barbarism
