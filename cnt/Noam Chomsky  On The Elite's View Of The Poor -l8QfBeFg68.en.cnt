my dad is a professor of health
economics at Northwestern we're not
arguing about they can't remember what I
told them that wages in the US were much
lower than most industrialized countries
and he said that it wasn't his fault
that people decided to blow their
paycheck on a big-screen TV I think that
statement in my mind sums up how most
the leads feel about the poor it's your
fault here poor do you mean this took it
take a look at post-war period
it's basically economic history of push
work period breaks up roughly into two
phases the first phase was from the end
of war until the early 70s that's what
many economists call the Golden Age of
capitalism we have state capitalism they
should say it was a period in which
there was unprecedented growth and very
egalitarian birth so waitis rose in fact
the lowest percentiles of population do
that as well as the upper ones there
were some level of social benefits were
introduced a partial welfare state
quality of life improved the social
indicators improved all that went on
until about the mid 70s since then the
situation has been quite different there
was growth less than before but it
didn't go but wait wages did not go up
they said real wages stagnated pretty
much for the majority of the population
working hours went way up and you had to
have two members of a family working
just keep food on the table
forgetting the flat-screen television
just true necessities and that means
that families are negatively affected
unless there's support systems which are
very weak in the United States
it's comparative with you know daycare
and so on and so forth so farm families
benefits decline declined and quality of
life indicators decline in fact it is
the standard statistical indicators
social indicators rose this sort of
tracked wages during the first period
but starting in 1975 and wages roughly
stagnated real wages and social
indicators began to decline right is
that the flow of working people
partly I mean that's clearly the result
of institutional changes and decisions
about the structure of the economy and
we know what they were
that's when financialization of the
economy began manic ideas about
efficient markets took over regulations
started being eliminated claims about
reduction of government began to be
popular I mean it didn't happen like
quicker McGrew under Reagan but the
claims and indeed the tax on you know
started dismantling welfare state
measures went on Americans now work many
more hours than the Europeans and for
best not even comparable wages no but is
that the far these changes the fall to
the floor I mean it's pretty irrational
we know that major changes were made in
the structure of institutions and that
led to dramatic outcomes so it's
irrational to say that's the quarterly
individuals in the same individuals who
were there in the golden age
