as for the human rights violations they
were horrendous and here is one of the
cases where it really is important to
look at facts before you make decisions
and we know the facts not secret
so yes Saddam Hussein carried out
horrendous human rights violations in
fact he's on trial for him right now but
have a look at the trial Saddam Hussein
is on trial for crimes that he committed
in 1982 killed he's charged with killing
probably accurately killing about 150
you're signing the death warrant for 150
or so Shiites who were involved in an
uprising yeah that's a crime that 1982
happens to be an important year in u.s.
Iraqi relations this should be headlines
and a free press in my opinion it was a
very important year 1982 was the year in
which Ronald Reagan dropped your act
from the list of states supporting
terrorism so the US but starts providing
him with extensive aid including
military including means to develop
biological and chemical weapons and
missiles and weapons of men and nuclear
weapons he was dropped from Donald
Rumsfeld the next shortly after went the
firm up the agreement the next charge
against Saddam Hussein was going to come
along it's been announced is a much more
serious crime the atrocities against the
Kurds in 1997 1988 they all unfold
massacres Halabja you know they were
terrible I'm fella killed hundred
thousand people u.s. didn't object in
fact the Reagan administration blocked
efforts in Congress even to protest
against it furthermore the support for
Saddam increased and continued in fact
Saddam was given an extraordinary
privilege remarkable and he was allowed
he got away with attacking a US naval
vessel and killing 37 soldiers of seamen
in 1987
that's pretty astonishing nobody can get
away with that but we were supporting
the Reagan
ministration was so strongly in support
of Saddam right through the worst
atrocities they even let him get away
with that I mean in 1980 this continued
after the end of the war with Iran after
the worst atrocities in 1989 Iraqi
nuclear engineers were invited to the
United States to take part in a
conference I was in Portland Oregon in
which they were trained in how to
develop weapons of mass destruction
mrs. 1989 furthermore George Bush number
one told us why I was being done they
said we have to provide aid to Saddam
because it's of our responsibility to
help us exporters and because he
contributes to stability in the region
in fact that continued and I think they
after the invasion of Kuwait after he
was driven out of quake you know jurrac
was correctly bombed in the rubble the
US had total control of the area there
was an uprising April March April 1991
Shiite uprising in the South probably
would have overthrown it they were
rebelling Iraqi generals good chance he
would have been overthrown the Bush
administration determined that they
would essentially permit Saddam the
crush it they used the military
helicopters other armed equipment they
don't have to do that that led to a huge
massacre and it was described you know
you can go back and read the New York
Times right after that they said well
you know it's regrettable but there's a
consensus among the US and its allies
meaning Saudi Arabia and Britain there's
a consensus that I'm virtually quoting
that Saddam Hussein offers more hope for
the stability of the region than those
who are trying to overthrow him that's
1991 you know yeah the human rights
violations were horrendous
does that even do with invasion no
nothing
