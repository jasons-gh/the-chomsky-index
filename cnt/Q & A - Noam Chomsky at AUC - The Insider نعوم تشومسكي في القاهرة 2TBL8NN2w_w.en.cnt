catch up
no we didn't think so my definition
after chair for shopping no it's not
true
in the United States is probably a 6
code the economy is to go to the
deceiving and controlling beautiful mind
these industry is developed about a
century ago in the freest societies of
the world in the United States is reason
enough freedom had been one so it was
difficult to control people by force
there were brought on entry labour
party's getting the right to vote Maya
freedom labor rights were increasing it
was harder to control people what for
it's not possible at work and as it
became part industries rose to follow
David Humes control there in his
attitudes
and the goals of the public relations
industry for stayed quite open frankly
in the early days nineteen twenties
let's read the business press is
necessary to directly with attitudes
towards the insignificant things of life
like fashionable conjunct consumption
then I'll be out of our hair will be run
world property it's necessary to ensure
that folks call being stupid and
ignorant Republic doesn't get involved
the administration of affairs in policy
and of course this is totally benign the
reason is there they really are stupid
and ignorant and if we let them have a
voice things will be in trouble if we
run things everything will be great as
you can see but the industry's grew and
developed precisely where there was
freedom and as there's more freedom they
become they have to find more
sophisticated ways to keep the ignorant
and stupid majority out of their affairs
extremely natural but it's a fragile
system that can be broken very quickly
and has been done in many ways from
personal relations up till international
affairs of the women's movement in the
last 40 years of our striking example
the things that were considered
inconceivable 50 years ago are now the
norm so take my own University again
when I got there in 1955 that the
students were white male students
well-dressed jackets and ties the
discipline of obedient respectful knots
nothing like that fortunately it's it is
about half women third minorities in
formal dress which reflects informal
relations no deference is mostly gone a
lot of interaction and interchange a lot
of political activism which they never
was before and that hasn't just happened
there it's happened almost everywhere
I'm sure
happen here but has happened here this
is a very specific question that i'm not
sure if it can take a specific answer
but what can the general public due to
pressure israel in the USA to avoid an
escalation with iran in order to prevent
another war there's a lot that can be
done as i mentioned there's whatever
threat anyone believes Iran poses I mean
we could debate that but let's suppose
there some kind of threat the simple way
to end move towards a nuclear
weapons-free zone it's got overwhelming
international support that Egypt in fact
has been in the lead of pressing for it
in the international arena since 1995 I
mentioned a majority of the population
in Israel favors that one thing is
blocking the US and the Israeli
government the American public has no
opinion about it as far as i know i've
never seen a poll in fact no even those
that the option exists to repeat what i
said before it happens to be a very live
opportunity right at this moment there
is a conference coming up probably in
january and helsinki to carry forward
the international effort through the UN
to move towards implementing this
proposal if there's enough public
pressure us will have to go along there
can't be public pressure unless people
at least know about it and the media
have been highly effective in making
sure that nobody knows about it
literally do a google search try it I
don't think you'll find a mention of
this in the mainstream media in the
United States probably in Europe either
I haven't checked Europe well okay as
long as that continues nothing will
happen and we'll move on towards
likely war but there's a point where
public activism and education could make
a huge difference I think if the facts
become known that you'll get substantial
public support for nobody wants a war
and this is a perfectly sensible
proposal let's just have a nuclear
weapons-free zone these are spreading
throughout the world and let's have one
there end of problem total you know it
doesn't end every problem but it
certainly significantly mitigates
whatever threat there is so that's a
very clear way to proceed professor
Chomsky thank you this is a the question
I'll ask as a version of a question I
have here in four or five different ways
but I think they they more or less
coincide and in light of the rise of
Islam assists as a reactionary movement
in the region and the growing confidence
of the workers to organize and midsize
mid-sized strikes and fight social
injustice how do you see the
confrontation given the cultural weight
of Islam and the apparent conflict
between the ruling elite and the
Islamist tycoons conflict in quotation
marks it's a it's a version of a
question about political Islam that is
maybe an unfair question for you but I
think a number of people would like your
opinion on it well I don't think there's
any particular reason y politicas
political Islam should be opposed to
workers struggles for workers rights
fact it might participate with them may
not but if so that ought to be changed
you could ask the same thing about a
Christian evangelical groups can they be
brought into supporting the workers
rights but one of the problem the main
problem here I think is what I mentioned
an answer when the earlier request
it just isn't in the consciousness of
working people that they can in fact
take over enterprises run on themselves
kick out the bosses and managers make
decisions about how the work should be
carried out what should be produced how
it could be produced and so on and these
are not utopian thoughts the first of
all there are a lot of things like that
happening I thiel know more than I do of
course but I've been told that there are
moves in this direction right here in
Egypt there have been several attempts
apparently in the past few years to by
working people to take over factories
and run them they've been crushed by
force under the dictatorship maybe would
be freer now I know in the United States
it's not huge but there's an expansion
of efforts like this quite a few and it
could go well beyond so if consciousness
had been high enough and remember
consciousness is something that can be
influenced right that takes activism and
organization it's within our power to
modify consciousness if it had been high
enough a couple of years ago when the
auto industry collapsed in the United
States it was basically nationalized
Obama took it over on the most
government owned most of it well there
are a number of possibilities as to what
to do one possibility which is the one
that was followed was to use taxpayer
subsidy to restructure it reconstruct it
to hand it over to pretty much the same
network of owners you know banks
investors maybe some different names but
fundamentally the same structures and
have it go back to producing exactly
what it in producing automobiles so we
can have a bigger traffic jam another
possibility that would have been to hand
the factories over to the workforce
and the communities that have them
decide what should be done with them and
one of the things that could have been
done is to modify them so that instead
of producing fossil fuel intensive
private transportation they could
constructive help produce something the
country very badly needs high-speed rail
the United States is very deficient in
this worse than plenty of third world
countries it's harmful economically it's
harmful humanly very harmful you sit in
a Cairo traffic jam or a Boston traffic
jam this huge waste of waste of human
resources waste of fuel you know it's
just ludicrous way for a society to
function tonight and it doesn't have to
work this way I mean these things can be
changed an efficient public
transportation system it's just
enormously beneficial to everyone and
also is a way of dealing with this very
serious problem of environmental
catastrophe that's facing us so that
could have been done well it with no
moves in that direction because it's not
part of people's consciousness it's like
asking my grandmother or whether she was
oppressed the thought just wasn't in
people's minds but it can be and these
things can happen Professor Charles gave
another very simple question for you own
what is the solution for the Syrian
crisis and your opinion
I don't know what this I don't know of
any solution I mean I don't know of any
proposal better than the very low
probability suggestions of luck there
brahimi if there's a better idea I don't
know what it is it's not it's very
unlikely that it's going to work I mean
the forces that are operating seemed to
be just driving the society towards self
destruction and it's a horrible thing to
watch but if anybody has a constructive
proposal I haven't heard it it also has
a reputation of having a close
relationship to the US Defense
Department and the largesse that you
described in some detail earlier so I
wonder if you would talk about locating
yourself as an intellectual as a scholar
within a complex intellectual
institutional environment like MIT I
think you have one of your own rights
right this is working yeah well i joined
MIT in 1955 actually I was in a lab that
was a hundred percent supported by the
three armed services there was a study
about 15 years later the impetus was a
student strike about this issue good
thing to do they pressed for an analysis
a study of em it's-- finances actually I
was on that committee that looked into
it the students wanted to have a
sympathetic representatives and it was
quite interesting it's nineteen seventy
so it may not
remember the details precisely but you
can find out it turned out at that point
that about half of MIT s budget was
devoted was involved to military
laboratories separate military
laboratories the bookkeeping was so
crummy we couldn't figure out whether
MIT was gaining or losing from
administering these laboratories but
they were off campus on campus where I
was about ninety percent of the funding
was coming from the Pentagon that meant
if you were in the music department you
were being funded by the Pentagon the
students read tuition scholarships
Muslim do were being funded by the
Pentagon and that but there was a bit as
we look closely there was no military
work going on campus with one exception
the political science department that
was the one place where there was
classified work going on they actually
had this was during the Vietnam War that
they had the political science
department had what was called a Peace
Research Institute that tells you
everything they had
in Saigon where students were going to
work on counterinsurgency under the
rubric of Peace Research that secret
seminars on counterinsurgency and soul I
thought I was the only place where
there's any war related work going on on
campus and that tells you something
about the Pentagon which people often
don't understand part of the Pentagon
system is you know controlling the world
by force but there's another part and
that is sustaining the advanced economy
in the United States says in other
industrial countries there's a lot of
talk about free markets entrepreneurial
initiative and how wonderful they all
are but the people who care about the
economy know perfectly well that it's
substantially subsidized by the public
and that's particularly true of the
high-tech economy so if you use a
computer or the internet or satellites
anything with micro electronics and so
on why that was being developed in the
1950s and early 60s under Pentagon
funding the reason is that the Pentagon
is a very natural funnel for taxpayer to
gouge the taxpayer but if you have
programs in the same National Institute
of Health Congress feels that they were
responsibility to look at them to see if
not he's being wasted but if it's in the
Pentagon that they don't look at it we
got to defend ourselves from the
Russians of the terrorists whoever the
end so ever
next so that's free and that's exploited
to provide the basis for the advanced
industrial system and plenty of other
things so for example in the 1950s there
was a major development of Interstate
Highways that's now highly praised as a
government constructive government
stimulus it was technically it was
called the National Defense interstate
system defense because you have to stick
defense into anything to get it funded
and they'd even had a pretext they were
going to use it to move your continental
missiles around the country why we had
to do that you can work but the program
was part of a major state effort at
social engineering huge effort which
suburban eyes the country drove the
society towards the wasteful use of
fossil fuels against the underlined
efficient transportation like rail
system as you may know the United States
has one of the most backward rail
systems in the world there's plenty of
great highways and airports and so on
was under the parts of it were under the
Pentagon system I suppose everything
else we flew here of course across the
ocean if you take a commercial flight
you're pretty much flying a modified
bomber a lot of the research is done
through the air force this is it
complicated avionics you know the
metallurgy and all that kind of stuff
and it's kind of adapted to commercial
production so in effect the Pentagon
system is a way to use public funds to
increase corporate profits it's the kind
of the funnel for which this is done and
one can certainly criticize that and
show
but it's not military related it has to
do with the way the know the economy is
designed so that the poor subsidize the
rich there are many such ways and this
is one of them of course these things
were never put two Democratic decision
so for example in the 1950s and nobody
asked the public do you want your taxes
to go to go to a system where maybe your
grandchildren will have an iPod or do
you want your two taxes to go to
building decent community's health of
providing for health for education for
you know environment and so on those
presents are never asked it's much too
dangerous to ask questions like that
this is one of the many ways in which
democracy has to be avoided so it's a
real issue plenty of real issues but
they're not the military ones I'm sorry
we can't hear the question up here could
do somebody of a mic down there
good I'm sorry we can't you can't hear
you sorry
yes of course
yes please do
I didn't hear I'm sorry would somebody
just hand this microphone to this man
from lower place I don't evade the
question but I can't hear it maybe he
can come up and take a mind oh thank you
very much for giving me the floor now I
can say you are welcome back to Egypt we
have an exclusive interview with you 19
years ago I'd like to give you the copy
a copy of that interview and my question
is you mentioned something about fear of
democracy do you think that there are
two responses here is enacted under
practiced against the Egyptian
revolutions whether inside or outside
and do you think that the vitality of
the Egyptian people have stood for
baguette is that all the traps are so
well designed is there something like
you mentioned about Orwellian
linguistics when you mentioned the word
on people during the process of
suppressing the Egyptian people will to
continue its revolution thank you sir
spiracy outside
manipulate is there a conspiracy inside
or outside to ensure that the unpeopled
depends what you mean by a conspiracy I
mean if you think that say General
Motors the car producer the board of
managers get to get together and makes
plans as to how to make profit is that a
conspiracy I mean it's true that groups
of people that those in powerful
positions get together and make plans
okay that's what they do then they make
the plans and their own interests
typically that's the point of the
failure by design that i quoted i think
if we call those things conspiracies
we're just depriving the world of the
word of any meaning that's just planning
it's rational planning so is there
rational planning say by the Western
powers with regard to the Arab Spring
yeah I mean we don't have internal
documents so you have to kind of
speculate but in the light of history
and a light of what you see you can make
a pretty plausible speculation the great
fear is losing control of the region on
its resources if there's popular
democracy that's very likely to happen
just take a look at public opinion as I
say the West Western planners know a lot
about public opinion here that's why
they take extensive polls in public
opinion on major issues is the way I
described the Western planters want
policy to reflect those opinions do they
want policy in Egypt to reflect the view
that the main threats that the world
faces are Israel in the United States
and that Iran whether you like it or not
is not much of a threat and that may be
it would even be better for Iran to have
nuclear weapons to offset us power do
they want to take say the 1979 so-called
peace treaty Egyptian Israel peace
treaty public opinion I haven't seen a
poll but he told me if I'm wrong I think
public opinion here is not opposed to a
peace treaty but is very opposed to the
way the United States and Israel are
violating the treaty take a look at that
treaty President Carter's here now is he
going to ask you are in Jerusalem or
somewhere so you can ask him the treaty
or you can read it the treaty calls for
Palestinian autonomy okay the treaty
does not a call for Egypt to be removed
from the confrontation so that Israel is
then free to attack its northern
neighbor as it did it once and has done
repeatedly since and to expand
settlement and the occupied territories
as it did at once that's the way that
the US and Israel have interpreted the
treaty the treaty doesn't say that and I
assume that the Egyptian public opinions
opposed to that interpretation of treaty
well does the United States and its
allies one that position to become
policy no and we can go down the line I
presume that it I haven't seen a pole
again that the Egyptian public is not at
all delighted with the neoliberal
policies that have sharply raised the
poverty rate increased concentration of
wealth destroyed benefit such as they
are on public services and would rather
see different policies well you know the
banks and the investors and the
government's that you know
that the carry forward their interest
they don't want those policies to be
implemented any more than they do in the
United States so therefore there's a
threat of democracy but I don't think
these things are conspiracies they're
just rational planning perfectly
rational planning and they're very
systematic they make good sense and I
think we just obscure the picture if we
interpret them as some kind of hidden
conspiracies they're mostly pretty open
pretty open I mean the United States for
example is quite an open society you
have a tremendous access to internal
planning documents you know an awful lot
about what planners are thinking the
public doesn't know because this stuff
is all kind of sequestered in scholarly
studies and so on would have to kind of
dig it out or in documents that it's
hard if it takes them work to find them
but it's there then when you look at
them you see fairly systematic rational
planning like the Grand area planning
that I mentioned it's been public since
the 1940s I mean what happened at the
end of the when the Russians collapsed
in 1989 the US government policies that
i mentioned we're completely public okay
but the public doesn't know about them
scholarship doesn't discuss them the
media of course doesn't discuss them you
can find them without much effort and
you and the perfectly understandable
programs but there was no conspiracy and
I think the same is true year
professor Chomsky has given us a great
deal of his time which is enormously
valuable as we all know and he's been
incredibly generous unfortunately he has
to go right at this moment and that's
going to be the last question I'm going
to give him a present on stage here from
a UC and I suspect you would like to
join with me in thanking him for the
richness of his presentation Thank You
professor
