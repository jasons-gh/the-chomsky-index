I've been asked to say a couple of words
on the topic of the corporate assault on
public education which is very real
I'm sure you've all experienced it it's
real and it's important to keep in mind
what we all know that it's not taking
place in isolation it's just one part of
a corporate assault on the population
generally and it's also I don't have to
tell you it's not new goes on all the
time we can go back to 1776 when Adam
Smith warned that the he putteth the
masters of mankind relentlessly pursue
their vile Maxim all for ourselves
nothing for anyone else and they used
their control of the political system as
he also pointed out to assist this
pursuit his word he's talking about
England of course said the principal
architects of policy in England are the
people who essentially own the country
them in his day the merchants and
manufacturers and they make use of their
wealth and influence to ensure that
their own interests are very scrupulous
Lee served that no matter how Grievous
the effect on the people of England or
of course on their much worth victims
abroad the victims of what he called the
savage injustice of the Europeans and he
was particularly concerned with India
the place where England was carrying out
its savage brutality at the time well
that's a voice from 1776 and if it
sounds familiar it
shouldn't resounded over and over again
since then century later after Adam
Smith so early mid 19th century the
those the early days of the Industrial
Revolution in the United States mostly
around eastern Massachusetts and the it
was working people condemned vigorously
the new phase of the assault on the
population by the masters of mankind
following their vile Maxim they were at
the time being driven into the
industrial system which they condemned
because for many reasons one thing they
claimed argued rightly as it was
depriving them of their basic rights as
free men and women and in Women's
History Month it's worth remembering
that women were in the forefront of this
the women driven into the mills were
young women from the farms called the
factory girls at the time they had a
lively press this is the period of the
freest press in the history of the
United States ethnic press labor press
very lively vigorous and it's worth it's
worth reading what they said the
contributions to the freest press in our
history by the factory girls and
artisans from Boston and others who were
being driven into the mills it's also
well to remember that that time a
working-class culture and that means
high culture was alive and flourishing
there's a great book about the 19th
century a British working class and what
they were reading Jonathan Rose the
intellectual life of the British working
class it's a monumental study of their
reading habits and he contrasts quote
him the passionate pursuit of knowledge
by proletarian autodidact with the
pervasive Philistine ISM of the British
aristocracy and pretty much same was
true here so around eastern
Massachusetts an Irish blacksmith and
Boston let's say if he could afford it
would hire a young boy to read classics
to him while he was working the factory
girls from the farms were reading what
we call classics the best contemporary
literature of the day and the actual
classics this went on for a long time
and I'm old enough to remember the 1930s
not too far from here in fact where a
lot of my family lived mostly unemployed
working-class but they had a that many
of them didn't even go hadn't even gone
to school you know fourth grade maybe
but they were part of the high culture
of the day you know discussing the
latest Shakespeare plays and free plays
in Central Park the Budapest string
quartet the different varieties of
psychoanalysis every political movement
you can think of
there were also there was also quite
lively workers education and some of the
outstanding scientists and
mathematicians of the day were directly
involved in workers education and books
like mathematics for the millions by
Lancet Hogben great introduction to
mathematics
JD Bernal others a lot of them came out
of the Communist Party as I say I can
come old enough to remember well a lot
of this has been lost under the
relentless assault of the masters but
it's not it can be recovered it's not
lost forever and it's important well the
labor press of the early industrial
revolutions 150 years ago they took
strong position
lots of things the positions which
should have a resonance today so they
took for granted that is they put it
those who work in the mills should own
them they condemned wage labor which
they argued was not very different from
slavery it was different from slavery
only and that it was supposedly
temporary that was such a popular view
in the 1860s that period that it was
actually the program of the Republican
Party that was you could read editorials
about it in the New York Times wage
labor is just the form of slavery and it
should be overcome one prime target of
their condemnation was what they called
the new spirit of the age gained wealth
for getting old but self that's one
hundred and fifty years ago and huge
efforts have been made ever since then
they going on right now to drive this
new spirit of the age into people's
heads
we're subjected to it constantly and
there's a reason in order to sustain the
rule of the Masters it's necessary to
pacify the public necessary to make
people think that's the way it has to be
that your suffering and your deprivation
seems right to you that's the new spirit
of the age if what we're supposed to do
is gain wealth for getting old itself
then if you're not wealthy it's your
full and nothing systematic about it I
got a that has to be driven into your
heads and it continues to the present
and there are huge industries devoted to
it I'm at about a sixth of the economy
one out of every six dollars is devoted
to what's called marketing which is
mostly propaganda it's designed to as
analysts put it indict to fabricate once
to drive people to the superficial
things of life like fashionable
consumption the lead of a public
relations industry huge industry is
quite explicitly devoted to this task
it's one of its leading figures one of
its founders Edward Bernays said that
the goal of the industry writing in the
1920s is what he called engineering
consent to make sure that the
intelligent minority he's a member of it
of course the intelligent minority can
rule without being bothered having their
lives disrupted by the masses who are
better most should be marginalized and
taught that to obey and to be passive
and nothing is left untouched about
twenty years ago the advertising
industry realized that there's a segment
of the population that they're not
reaching because there are may money so
they can't buy namely children but then
they figured a way around this what you
can do is propagandize children so that
they'll nag their parents to buy things
and if any of you watch television i
watch with my grandchildren little
children it starts at two years old and
in fact there's a there is even a field
of academic psychology in the college is
called nagging where you teach how to
get kids to nag in different ways for
different things and that way you can
trap children into the the pursuit of
superficial things of life like
fashionable consumption
and to be the passive and obedient
well--that's this of course includes the
schools in fact mass education was
understood the same way right at the
beginning actually mass public education
is one of the great achievements of the
United States it was well in the lead in
developing a massive public education
system college too so the US did pioneer
it but it had purposes but one purpose
was to drive independent farmers into
the industrial system to induce them to
give up their independence the rights of
free men and women and to submit
themselves to industrial discipline and
everything that went along with it to
accept the life of wage slavery which is
the way they described but to accept it
that's the right thing to do and that
didn't pass without notice so Ralph
Waldo Emerson discussed what he he
discussed the fact that the political
leaders of his day he noticed were
calling for popular education and when
he thought about why they were doing it
he said their reason is fear they say
that this country is filling up with
thousands and millions of voters and you
must educate them to keep them from our
throats
in other words educate them the right
way to passivity obedience acceptance of
their fate as right and just conforming
to the new spirit of the age and keep
their perspectives narrow their
understanding limited discourage free
independent thought frighten them into
obedience because the masters are afraid
you've got to keep them from our throats
and that's of course the task for the
school schools as well well this
spirit of the age from 150 years ago
which is a common theme right in front
of our eyes it's inhuman and it's savage
and it meets resistance and there are
victories
some of them significant ones so one set
of major victories was in fact the 1930s
when there was popular uprising
significant one on a cutting edge of it
were things like organization the CIO
which should reach the level of sit-down
strikes and sit-down strikes are
terrifying for the masters of mankind
because they recognize that a sit-down
strike is just one step before going on
with the slogan the idea that those who
work in the mills should on them and run
them why do we need the Masters we're
sitting here instead of sitting here
let's take it over and run it that's
frightening
at that point you began getting
significant New Deal legislation which
was real lot of progress led to what's
often called the Golden Age of state
capitalism 50s and 60s when there was
the highest birth rate in American
history pretty egalitarian growth wait
birth rate for the african-american
population it was actually the first
time that they had a test taste at least
of what it's like to become part of the
mainstream of American life as I don't
have to tell you after the Civil War
when theoretically slaves were freed
there were a couple of years of formal
freedom but by 1877 there was a
north-south compact which reinfected
Leary introduced slavery of criminalized
through criminalization of black life so
if a black man is standing on the street
he can be arrested for vagrancy if he's
looking with somebody claims he's
looking the wrong wrong way at a white
woman
be arrested for attempted break you put
it to jail with corrupt judges you never
get out you become part of a slave labor
force in fact a good part of the
American industrial revolution is based
on that mining steel mills and so on
that lasts until the Second World War
Second World War there was a need for
free labor so yes it changed then there
were a couple of decades say when a
black man could get a job in an auto
plant and you know a little money by
house sentence gets to college and so on
by the 1970s that ended and we're now
going back to the criminalization of
black life starting in the early
seventies reconstituting what happened
in the post reconstruction age major
technique for that's drug war but it's
very very striking anyway there was a
golden age a couple of decades quite
significant then but systems of power
that don't walk away this guy went on
through the 60s of the activism of the
60s had a big impact on the country
civilized it in many ways both the 60s
in their aftermath and systems of power
never walk away politely and say thank
you they prepare a new assault and in
fact that's been happening since the
early 1970s the latest phase of the
assault on the population began right
about then partly through major changes
in the economic system throughout the
whole of American history this had been
a growing developing industrializing
society and not in very pretty ways I
need not tell you but it was going on of
course with regression but generally
that's what was happening that changed
in the 1970s since then it's been a from
the point of view of producing things
that people need it's becoming a
stagnant or
the industrializing society it's a huge
change the economy shifted from
production for needs to financialization
a huge explosion of speculative capital
flows and long production didn't cease
it was just began to be off short to
Mexico China Vietnam anywhere any place
where you can get horrendous working
conditions no environmental constraints
huge profit for the Masters that had
happened before but it took went into
completely new new level starting in the
70s within the United States that set
off kind of a vicious cycle
it led pretty quickly to greater
concentration of wealth the more or less
egalitarian growth of the 50s and the
60s changed concentration of wealth
leads reflexively to concentration of
political power Adam Smith's maxim again
about the Masters of mankind and their
how their architects of policy the
concentration of wealth increasingly in
the financial sector a concentration of
political power of course translates
right away into legislation which
carries the process forward and fiscal
policies like cutting taxes for the
wealthy deregulation which permits the
financial institutions to do the kinds
of things you know about subprime
mortgages and so on leads right away to
regular financial crises through the 50s
and the 60s when New Deal legislation
was in place there were no financial
crises starting in the early 70s they
began each one worse than the next the
there a problem for the population there
no problem for the mass
because they can rely on the nanny state
that they nurture to bail them out that
means the taxpayer - bail amount happens
time after time it sets off a Doom loop
it's what it's called by the official of
the Bank of England who's responsible
for financial stability the leading
financial correspondent in the
english-speaking world the most
respected when Martin wolf of the
Financial Times no radical incidentally
now he describes the financial
institutions as an out-of-control
financial sector that's eating out the
modern market economy from inside just
as the larvae of a spider wasp eats out
the host in which it's been laid and it
continues and is getting worse as this
vicious cycle continues it does leave a
superfluous population namely the
producing the workforce there's a close
race class correlation in the United
States so you got to do something with
superfluous population and what's going
on is pretty much what happened in 1877
criminalize them sent them to jail and
turn them to factory work so they're a
labor force again in fact the American
prisons are even pretty you might have
seen in the papers either yesterday
today that some private industries are
complaining because they're being
undercut by a state-run prison industry
the prisons have a nice docile workforce
you don't get strikes you don't get
people asking for benefits you can
control that in ways that I don't have
to mention they even produce a clothing
so there's a there's a kind of genes
called Prison Blues produced in prisons
they're not allowed to be sold in the
United States but they sell in places
like China
so the
a fective way to deal with the the
industrialization of the country well
for the large majority live it's a rich
country so it's the life is kind of
stagnating for them wages and incomes of
pretty much stagnated for approximately
3035 years but people get by somehow
they get by by much heavier workloads in
the United States by now that working
people work maybe a month or six weeks
more a year than in Europe even higher
than in Japan the borrowing you know the
increasing debt which of course can't go
on forever and kind of trying to live
off the the bubbles the financial
bubbles that come along so the housing
bubble which gives you paper money but
they crash and wealth goes with it again
for the the african-american population
the last one has been a total disaster
net wealth is down to almost zero barely
detectable so that's the vast majority
of course it bursts and the perpetrators
are bailed out by the taxpayers that's
the doom loop in parallel you get
exactly what Adam Smith described the
political system is more and more in the
hands of those who concentrate wealth
and in fact the political system has
been shredded in the past roughly
generation in 30 35 years in order to
approach Adam Smith's Maxim even more
closely than it did before
cost of elections as skyrocketing that
means both parties are driven deeper
into the pockets of the corporate
pockets where the money is the
Republicans by now it's kind of level of
farce the Democrats who are what used to
be good
Republicans aren't that far behind and
it's not just elections it's also
Congress it used to be the case that in
Congress a position of influence say a
chair of a committee was gained by
service seniority or wasn't perfect but
at least that was the idea that's no
longer the case you have to buy by the
position by putting money into the party
coffers which of course drives Congress
even deeper than before into the pockets
of those who have the money some of the
current effects were reviewed recently
by the inspector general government
government's official who was the
Inspector General of the bush-obama
bailout programs Neil Barofsky his name
is he pointed out that the there was
legislation that authorized the bailout
nobody pointed out it was a bargain was
two-sided the financial institutions
that were responsible for the
catastrophe they would be saved by the
taxpayer as usual and the victims of
their misdeeds would be very partially
compensated by measures to protect home
values and secure home ownership well to
the surprise of no one who familiar with
the workings of the political system
only the first part of the bargain was
kept the financial institutions were
rewarded lavishly for having tanked the
economy the tarp bailouts which people
talk about are the least of it they're a
small fraction of the total bailout
meanwhile the rest of the program just
floundered so I'll quote parofsky
foreclosures continue to mount with 8 to
13 million filings forecast while the
biggest banks are 20% larger than they
were before the crisis and they control
the larger part of our
ever they reasonably assumed that the
government will rescue them again the
next crisis which is now being the basis
is now being laid and he goes on to say
that the credit agencies incorporate
future government bailouts into their
assessments of the largest banks so when
they you know assess the how reliable of
ank is they take into account the fact
that man goes wrong you will bill it out
that exaggerate s--
market distortions which already very
severe and it provides them with an
unfair advantage over smaller
institutions enables them the games more
and more power so in short he says
Obama's programs were a giveaway to Wall
Street executives and a blow in the
solar plexus to the defenseless victims
and very likely a stepping stone towards
the next and probably worse financial
crisis as business lobbying which is
extraordinary that chips away at the
dodd-frank regulation bill well the
latest phase in the class war the one
that took off since the 70s
now that was reviewed in a interesting
recent study by the economics Economic
Policy Institute that's the major source
of reliable data on these developments
year by year the title of their review
is called failure by design and the term
design is quite accurate
other choices have been possible along
the road they still out are they also
point out that the failure is
class-based so to adopt the imagery of
the Occupy movement it's a failure for
the 99% for the 1% to be more accurate
1/10 of 1% it's a spectacular success
and by design which is just what you'd
expect when policy is designed
by concentrations of power nothing
economic power nothing new trace it back
to 1776 well it's not just the United
States the masters of mankind are an
international class if you could turn to
Europe what's happening is very striking
there's what's called a troika the
European Central Bank European Union
International Monetary Fund and they're
imposing austerity at a time of
recession well it's not a very obscure
what's going to happen when you impose
austerity in a period of recession it's
Herbert Hoover the IMF just came out
with a big study in which they reviewed
about 170 cases where such policies were
pursued and they're all the same it
leads to further decline in economic
growth further suffering and so on no
escape from the effect makes the debt
worse and that's exactly what current
experience has been in England and
Greece and so on some economists
economists have been kind of critical of
this and some of them describe it as a
stupidity or madness even but I think
there's a much simpler explanation
failure by design actually it was just a
recent interview in The Wall Street
Journal with the president of the
European Central Bank Mario Draghi
and he says very cheerfully Europe's
social contract is obsolete we can get
rid of the hated welfare state we can
weaken labor we can entrench the rule of
the Masters and their vile Maxim now we
can devote major efforts to instill in
the public mind the
new spirit of the age there's no
alternative Margaret Thatcher's famous
slogan this is how it has to be so
they'll accept what's happening to them
there's nothing irrational about that at
all it's classic understandable
perfectly rational we of course have our
own variant there's always a gap between
public opinion and public policy but by
now that gap has expanded to a chasm so
within the Beltway you know Washington
discussion and hence in the media the
major issue is the deficit got to do
something about the deficit meanwhile
there was very heavily polled Society we
know what people think for the public
the main problems jobs not the deficit
and the public is right that's a much
greater problem the deficit is you know
maybe it's a problem in the long run but
right now certainly the markets don't
think it's a problem the US borrowing is
practically zero interest rate because
then finance financial institutions
don't care about the deficit like the
public when you turn to the deficit of
course policy is what the financial
institutions want the deficit is not
jobs actually the term jobs is used so
standard rhetoric is select the
Republicans ideologues never say we want
to reward the rich what they say is we
want to reward the job producers meaning
the rich the term jobs just means
profits you're not allowed to pronounce
the word profits a few PR Oh fi TS
garlic an obscene word if you notice
almost never used what's used as
creating jobs meaning creating profits
the if we turn to the deficit whatever
ranking you give it among the set of
problems the public also has opinions
about the
deficit which doesn't regard as a
serious problem
you should overcome the deficit by
taxing the rich I mean at least to the
level of the beginning of the latest
onslaught that during the Golden Age
they were taxed far more heavily and
that was great for the economy so at
least tax the rich and preserve the
benefits a Social Security the medical
benefits policy is the opposite this is
a range so at the extreme end you get
the pol Ryan Republican catechism that
everyone has to sign into Obama as a
kind of a milder version but if you look
it's similar with regard to the medical
system the expenses are real when the
press says the growth of medical
expenses would ultimately be very
serious blow to the economy they're
right but it's not Medicare it's the
private insurance system which is
hopelessly dysfunctional the US health
care system which is mostly privatized
and unregulated and off the
international spectrum in this respect
is about twice as high per capita as
comparable countries and doesn't have
particularly good outcomes and leaves 50
million people uninsured that's
estimated roughly 50 million extra
deaths year the so as long as the medic
Medicare has to go through the
privatized health system sure it will be
inefficient and expensive even though
Medicare itself is much more efficient
say much lower administrative costs than
the privatized system in fact if we had
a health system like other industrial
countries not exactly a utopian dream
there wouldn't be a deficit at all in
fact there would be a surplus it's been
worked out well by economist Dean Baker
but that's not discussed I can't discuss
that
natural institutions are too powerful so
that's off the agenda what about social
security it's an interesting case it's
not a fiscal problem
Social Security is in quite good shape a
little tweaking more let's go on forever
but it is a big ideological problem
that's why there's a constant attack on
Social Security
there's a reason I think Social Security
violates the new spirit of the age
Social Security is based on the
assumption that you care about other
people you care whether there's you know
it's like I personally I get Social
Security but I got a big pension so I
don't need it on the other hand so
therefore under the new spirit of the
age I'm not supposed to care if a
disabled widow across town is starving
right so in order to instill the new
spirit you got to get rid of things like
this teaches all the wrong notions
solidarity mutual support care for one
another all kind of terrible ideas that
have to be driven out of people's heads
and I think the assault on public
education is driven in part by pretty
much the same forces they think about
public education it's the same so like I
don't have kids in school so under the
new spirit why should I pay taxes for
schools you know what why should I care
if the kid across the street as a school
if you really have trapped into the new
spirit of the last hundred and fifty
years you shouldn't and public education
kind of teaches those values again
caring for each other caring whether
other children have opportunities we're
not supposed to think that that's what
you've got a drive out of people's heads
well coming to the assault on education
it has many different aspects so start
with the colleges and universities it
took off in the 1970s the activism of
the 60s as a
had a major civilizing effect on the
society in all kinds of ways and it
aroused deep concern right across the
mainstream spectrum that's why it's the
60s are conventionally called the Time
of Troubles
and it was troubles for the 1% it
civilized the country that's dangerous
and the reaction was immediate from
right to what's called left right across
the spectrum so I'll just keep to the
universities for the moment at the right
the most striking illustration of it was
a very influential the memorandum which
was written by Lewis Powell he's a
corporate lawyer later appointed the
Supreme Court by Richard Nixon it was
secret but it leaked you can find it on
the internet it's worth looking at at
the other end of the spectrum what's
called the left there was an important
study by the Trilateral Commission these
are liberal internationalists from the
three major state capitalist industrial
systems of the United States Europe
Japan the general outlook of the group
is given by the fact that they almost
entirely staffed the Carter
Administration that's where they come
from so that's the spectrum and both of
them merit attention they provide a good
insight into the ideological aspects of
the assault on democracy and rights on
schooling that was beginning to take
shape about 40 years ago escalated
sharply in the Reagan Thatcher years
picked up by Clinton Bush now reaching
new heights and they also provide
insight into why the assault targets the
educational system so let's start with
Powell memo it was 1971 it was sent to
the US Chamber of Commerce
the main business lobby intended to be
secret the title was the attack on the
American free enterprise system
and it's worth reading not only for the
contents which are interesting but for
the paranoid tone which is quite
characteristic of business live
literature now if you have a kind of
here the masters you have a kind of
totalitarian attitude then if anything
gets out of control the world's coming
to an end you know so the rhetoric tends
to be kind of inflated and paranoid and
that's true the Powell memorandum he
targeted particulars the major ones were
Ralph Nader with his consumer safety
campaigns Herbert Marcuse ooh who was
preaching Marxism to the masses anybody
ever heard of new leftists who were on
the rampage all over and of course
they're naive victims who he said to
dominate at the universities the schools
control TV and other media control the
educated community and virtually control
the government if you think I'm
exaggerating I urge that you read it I'm
not there take over the country he said
as a dire threat to freedom because the
only alternatives to free enterprise are
various kinds of bureaucratic regulation
of individual freedom ranging from
moderate socialism to the iron heel of
the leftists or rightists dictatorships
it's essentially the rhetoric of today's
Republican debates where the
center-right administration of Obama is
regularly cold you know
Marxist revolutionary or something like
that and that's what it looks like if
you're one of the masters because it
does slightly chip away at total
domination
well actually Powell himself was very
familiar with another alternative to
free enterprise and namely the system in
which he and his Chamber of Commerce
associates thrived remember he was a lot
he was a lobbyist for the tobacco
industry he was surely aware of the huge
federal subsidies for the production of
this leading killer which not only kills
users a scale vastly beyond the
mislabeled drug wars they which have a
lot more to do with control than they do
with drugs
but they also kill plenty of other
people so they were called passive
smokers it's called collateral damage
contemporary euphemism and Powell was
also surely aware of the great success
of lobbyists like him in assuring that
for many decades the government helped
the industry conceal what they all knew
about the lethal product they were
peddling the huge mounds of corpses to
show for their achievement still piling
up rapidly but that didn't keep him from
whaling in the memo that as every
business executive knows few elements of
American society today have as little
influence in government as the American
businessman the corporation or even the
millions of corporate stockholders to
translate that into English it means we
don't have a hundred percent control so
therefore we have nothing typical
totalitarian attitude often finds
extreme form and the business literature
and things like this well he he drew the
obvious conclusion from this the
campus's from which much of the
criticism emanates
are supported by tax funds generated
largely from American business
contributions from capital funds
controlled or generated by American
business the boards of trustees of our
universities overwhelmingly are composed
of men and women who are leaders in the
business system and most of the media
including the national TV systems are
owned then theoretically controlled by
corporations which depend on profits and
the enterprise system on which they
survive therefore we beaten-down
businessmen who have no power anymore we
should organize to defend ourselves
instead of just watching passively well
business and our fundamental freedoms
are destroyed by the Marxist onslaught
from the media universities and
government well that's the expression of
the sense the concerns elicited by 60s
activism at the right end of the
mainstream spectrum and that's more
revealing still I think is the reaction
at the opposite extreme the kind that
you get from the liberal
internationalists Carter type liberals
that spelled out in the correct in the
trilateral commission report that I
mentioned is called the crisis of
democracy and they say there was a real
crisis the kind of pre frank about it
again urge you to read it if you haven't
done it the crisis is there was too much
democracy the system worked fine they
said when most of the population was
silent passive apathetic obedient but in
the 1960s something happened the special
interests began to try to enter the
political arena to press for their
demands
so who were the special interests women
minorities young people old people the
farmers
working people in other words the
population and they're not supposed to
press their demands they're supposed to
be sitting quietly and obedient while
the intelligent minority run things and
everyone's interest there was one group
omitted and their lament of the
corporate sector and that's because
they're not a special interest they
express what's called the national
interest so therefore we can't touch
them and like the far-right the liberal
scholars just take it for granted that
the extraordinary power of the corporate
institutions is their control to the
state and other institutions that's just
the natural orders of this note one
mentioning it you mention the fact that
we breathe air and a primary concern of
the trilateral scholars was the failures
of what they called the institution's
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young their term not mine that's the
school's the universities the churches
they're not indoctrinating the young
properly that's why we have these
uprisings in the streets and the efforts
of the special interests to press their
demands in the political arena
so in general they said we have to have
more moderation and democracy if it's to
be preserved and the national interest
is to be protected and crucially we must
have more successful indoctrination of
the young well at that point the current
phase of the assault on the public
education system takes takes off and
these concerns expressed at both ends of
the ideological spectrum they have led
to vigorous action to restore order and
indoctrination one consequence is the
assault on the public education which
takes many forms I'll just give a couple
illustrations about a year ago and
having to be giving talks in Mexico at
the national university who know very
good University
it's hard to get in but it's free there
was an attempt to raise tuition about
ten years ago
led to a national student strike
correctly close the country down the
government backed off in fact one of the
administration buildings on the campus
is still a cue pocket by it's kind of a
community center so no tuition that's
doesn't have the wealth and you know
salaries of an American University it
was quite a high-class university a very
high standards good work so on but free
in the city in Mexico City there was a
leftist mayor Lopez Obrador he
established the University in the city
which is not only free but open
admissions so anybody can go if people
aren't ready they get compensatory
training took there too it's pretty it's
quite impressive also high standards
good achievements good faculty dedicated
faculty so that's Mexico poor country it
happened that from Mexico I went on to
California the Bay Area Berkeley that's
the richest place in the world outside
of maybe you know Qatar they're
destroying the greatest public education
system in the world systematically
destroying it
failure by design the public education
system in California which was really
you know the jewel of the system and in
fact better than anything in the world
it's changing it's now being the major
universities are being pretty much
privatized for the rich they're becoming
like Ivy League colleges and for the
rest of the system it's being slowly
modified to technical training for the
rest and that's happening across the
country by now in most state
the tuition covers more than half of the
costs for the state colleges the pretty
soon only the community colleges will be
publicly financed under current
tendencies and even they are under
attack so analysts agree on quoting that
the era of affordable four-year public
universities heavily subsidized by the
state may be over and their similar
developments and the private
universities where the costs are just
out of sight that's a very important way
to implement the indoctrination of the
young students come out of college with
in a debt trap they don't have many
options and the debt trap is now
approaching the trillion dollars beyond
credit card debt and it's an
exceptionally punishing kind of debt
like if you know few most debt that you
can get out of and unpleasant ways you
can escape through bankruptcy can't do
that here there's no expiration date on
the debt collectors can garnish your
wages for the rest of your life Social
Security unemployment benefits forever
you're trapped for the students that's a
very effective trap for life it does
sharply cut down options particularly
when employment opportunities are weak
actually the basic idea was explained by
one of the trustees of the New York
State University system he's been he
said there's been a shift from the
belief that we as a nation benefit from
higher education to a belief that it's
the people who are receiving the
education who primarily benefit so they
should foot the bill that's the new
spirit of the age again
actually that belief is not among the
population it's among the principal
architects of policy and it's always
been their belief but now they feel in a
position to implement it under the
rising assault well as usual the main
victims are the most vulnerable in this
respect it's quite similar to subprime
lending which went after the poorest and
most vulnerable and there's an
educational analog to that is called
for-profit colleges which are mostly
scammed they seem to offer opportunities
but when you take a closer look say just
take debt figures turns out that about
96 percent of the people that they're
mostly poor people about 96 percent are
in debt and within 15 years it's about
40 percent default so they're not a trap
they're robbed and the kind of education
they get isn't much either
well the Mexico California comparison
illustrates a crucial point the reasons
for the conscious destruction of the
greatest public education system in the
world the reasons are not economic New
Mexico is a poor country for a rich
country there are many other cases
including rich societies like say
Germany or Finland which ranks highest
in educational achievement in the world
is free actually post-war u.s.
experience is another example in the
post second world period period there
was a program the GI Bill which enabled
a huge number of people who would never
have been able to go to college to go to
college at public expense that was very
rewarding for them and it was extremely
beneficial to the country in fact that's
a large part of the reason for the
golden age economic golden age
so once again like austerity under
recession the policy of closing this off
makes absolutely no economic sense but
it is a good technique of class warfare
not economic but not necessary but a
technique of indoctrination and control
and in that regard it's quite Val
valuable well in parallel to all of this
there's a process of corporatization of
the universities going on there's a huge
increase over the past thirty years
thirty five years huge increase in
highly paid administrative staff payment
is way beyond the level of anything
except maybe football coaches
increasingly their professional
administrators in earlier days
administration which wasn't much of a
big deal was just carried out by faculty
on temporary leave or something now it's
professional administrators very high
paid carrying with them the corporate
culture as a very good study of the
process by a well-known sociologist
Benjamin Ginsburg it's called the fall
of the faculty the rise of the oil
administered of University and why it
matters and one effect is to introduce
the corporate culture into the
universities that has many
manifestations one of them is a drive
for what's called efficiency which is an
interesting concept it's not an economic
concept though it's called that it's
really an ideological concept and you
know we all know it also suppose you
call a bank or an airline or any other
institution you know complain that's
only was wrong or get some information
or whatever it may be you know what
happens you call them up you get a
recorded message the recorded message
tells you we love your business
love you hang on and you hang on while
this message is repeated every couple of
minutes and you listen to some music and
now finally at the end of it all you get
some kind of a menu which is totally
incomprehensible and doesn't have the
options you want and finally if you wait
long enough you may get a human being
I'm sure you've all been through this
well for the business
this increases efficiency their costs
are lower and for ideological reasons
that's all that's counted for the users
it's very costly I mean you're wasting
your time that's money you know you're
wasting your energy all that's costly
but that's not counted and those costs
are multiplied across the population
which means they can be quite huge but
it's called efficiency and it's the same
when you go to the universities so when
the university's efficiency means you
reduce the proportion of faculty to
students you have faculty replaced by
cheap labor
temps you know just like in business
easily replaceable temporary labor
graduate students adjuncts easily
exploitable you don't paying much and
they you know they can't ask for the
rights they're going to be out anyway
it's it's good for the bottom line for
the professional business administrators
who were running the colleges there's
also a harm namely to the students but
you don't count that that's part of the
ideological character of estimating
costs another process is eliminate
programs that are too expensive that you
may have seen an interesting discussion
of this in the New York Times couple
days ago
now they pointed out that state colleges
around the country are eliminating
programs in engineering computer science
and nursing which happened to be exactly
the fields where where there are job
opportunities where labor is needed but
they're expensive so buy good corporate
logic you eliminate the programs that
the society needs and the people need
because they get jobs but they cost too
much so eliminate them and bottom line
looks better it's good corporate logic
well you get down to K to 12 and it's
more or less similar the main technique
2 main part of the assault is just
defunding if you want to privatize
something and destroy it
the standard method is first defunded so
it doesn't work then people get upset
about it then they accept privatization
so for example when Margaret Thatcher
wanted to destroy the railroad system in
England she first be funded it didn't
work you know people have to wait
through long doesn't you know gets the
trains get stuck finally they said let's
privatize it they privatized it turns
into a total disaster now they had to
realize it to get it to function at a mo
much lower level now that's familiar and
that's what's happening with the schools
they're defunded so no work so people
say ok let's have a private school or
charter school or anything just to get
us out of this mess
which of course not as an economic
necessity or any other kind also just
plain dumbing down the schools I mean
they're there this debates that go back
to the Enlightenment about what
education ought to be during the
Enlightenment theme there was kind of
evocative imagery which contrasted
different approaches to education one
image is education as being like a
vessel into which you pour water and as
you all know it's a pretty leaky vessel
everyone of us has been to school has
gone through this and you know you
memorize something for an exam it all
leaks out the next day you are
interested in
attention week later he can't remember
what the subject would so that's one
image the other image that was used was
that teaching ought to be like laying
how to string along which the student
can progress in his or her own way
discovering rather than just memorizing
so the some structure you know like that
this topics that you want to cover but
design them in a way so that the the
process of going through of gaining the
understanding and information is one of
a creative individual activity in
cooperation with others often well
that's the Enlightenment idea the
pouring water ideal has a name now it's
called No Child Left Behind or race to
the top I which is exactly what it is
it kills interest that it deadens the
students but it makes them more passive
and obedient and not too much trouble at
least that's the idea the data can be
done I spend too much time on it but
they're very good models where it's a
cheat I'll give you one model that was
just happened to be discussed in the the
journal Science
the main Journal of the American
Association for advancement of science I
just had a series of editorials by its
editor on the destruction of science
education in the country through No
Child Left Behind type measures from
kindergarten to university so get the
kids to memorize something that they
don't understand and don't care about
like the periodic table or you know the
enzymes that metabolize something
write it down you want to the next thing
no joy of discovery
no and no invention you no conception of
why anybody should do this ridiculous
boring thing but it does you know you
get past the exam and if the teachers
salaries let's say our survival is
dependent on this in timing choices
either not any at least well that's one
way to do it and the same series of
articles does suggest alternatives it
was not necessary to suggest
alternatives at the university level
because they're actually done so at a
place like MIT for example a student the
lectures aren't intended to be poured
into a vessel in fact this standard
doctrine is it doesn't matter what you
cover in the course it matters what you
discover and you discover it in your own
way and you learn how to discover the
scientists couldn't survive if if that
wasn't pursued at least at elite
institutions so it is but you can do it
down to the kindergarten level and in
fact the the editor Bruce Alberts
discusses a kindergarten program which
suggests as a models for five-year-old
kids it's a program where the kids in a
class where each kid was given a small
dish which had in it pebbles shells and
seeds and they were supposed to figure
out which ones are the seeds so the
first thing they did was have a
scientific conference that they called
kids got together thought of various
ways in which you could test to see
which were the seeds and they tried some
of them they didn't work they tried
others they work better the exchanged
ideas improved them finally they got to
the point where they had figured out
what the seeds were and the next step
was to give them all magnifying glasses
and crack the seeds so they could look
inside and find the embryo which was the
source of the
energy that makes the seed grow okay
those kids learn something not only
about seeds but about discovery about
how to go on to the next task and why
it's fun to do so and important to do so
that can be done any of you who have
been teachers know way more than I can
say about this what could be done at any
level but it has a defect it empowers
the teachers instead of humiliating them
which is very important and it enriches
the lives of students and prepares them
for creative independent lives not
passive obedience well all of this is
more failure by design and again the
word design is quite crucial there are
alternatives there are successful models
in our own history elsewhere we should
be able to progress well beyond those
those models but only by dedicated and
struggle and not passive acquiescence
while all of this goes on before our
eyes Thanks
