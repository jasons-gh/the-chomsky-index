Noam Chomsky is a world-renowned
political activist writer and professor
of linguistics at MIT the New York Times
Book Review said of him judged in terms
of the power range novelty and influence
of his thought Noam Chomsky is arguably
the most important intellectual alive to
which he adds yeah nobody ever quotes
the next in how can he write such
terrible things about the u.s. foreign
policy or something like that that uh
that edition kind of made your day
didn't it oh yeah that made me feel it
wasn't doing something wrong tell me a
little bit about your background you
grew up in Philadelphia your parents
were Hebrew teachers I believe it was a
basically first-generation immigrant
family they were very much immersed in
the local Jewish community he bridge
occasion this is the 1930s so it's early
Zionism pre-state Zionism that was the
media my own life was soon became my own
life but that was the background that he
came out of and you went to camp as I
recall you later on when I was a young
teenager 11 12 we went to Hebrew
speaking camps and then I first as a
camper and laters counselor helped you
were proficient in Hebrew very early and
reasonably even a proficient but it's a
matter of measuring but yes I could get
by and I read read very easily had read
a lot of I grew up immersed in Hebrew
literature Bible and so on in Hebrew
phase you got part of I guess your
political education on a street corner
in New York in a sense you had an uncle
who this is again the 1930s and early
40s so what
family was mostly unemployed unemployed
seamstresses working people and so on
but there are a few vet jobs and one
uncle had a severe disability and he was
able to get a new stand under one of the
New Deal type programs that were around
in those days so the newsstand was the
place which supported half the family
but he was also a very he himself had
never gone through school but he was
very well educated more so than almost
anybody I met and the newsstand and
became a center for a lot of emigres
intellectuals from Europe who would hang
around there and evenings and had
fascinating discussions and there was a
lot of fun to just be serving newspapers
and listening so you would want to jump
on the train from Phil as soon as I was
old enough to take the train by myself
12 or so I head off to New York soon as
any chance stay with my relatives who
were a very lively Bunch Jewish
working-class left all involved in
intellectual cultures and a mixture of
strange Marxist groups and the budapest
string quartet and so on and so forth
and although very few of them had had
anything in the way of formal education
except very elementary but didn't matter
and then I spend my time wandering up
and down something that's long since
disappeared but fourth Avenue below
union square used to be full of little
secondhand bookstores again a lot of
European exiles would have their own
particular slant you know Spanish
anarchism or some of the things that was
fascinating to their very eager to talk
to some young person coming in wasn't
that usual so got special treatment and
picked up a lot a lot of literature to
fact when I started writing about these
things years later I used a lot of
primary documentation that I'd picked up
around that time which wasn't available
elsewhere what kind of stuff they talked
about the newsstand there was a lot of
many of the anti Grey's what happened to
be a psychiatrist's like German Jewish
psychiatrist so there's a lot of fried
dish steckel that sort of thing and then
every variety of left-wing politics you
can think of these were very lively days
and political discussion was common and
just part of everybody's life and how
did you discover linguistics as you were
filled through politics actually I this
is back in Philadelphia and met tzelek
Harris I was about I guess 16 or 17 and
pretty bored with college I was thinking
of dropping out but I happen to meet him
through political contacts he himself
was was a very influential figure among
young intellectuals mostly Jewish but
not completely much more so than is
known being right much but many people
passed through his influence of many of
them well known and I was one of the
younger ones and he was his interests
were sort of a rib independent left sort
of anti-bolshevik left and what was the
end called giantism now it would be
called anti-zionism commitment to a
future by national jewish pair of
working class based community in what
was in palestine which was part of the
Lions movement at the time
now it would be considered different and
I was already interested in that so
meeting him was a exciting became an
influence I later discovered he was
professor of linguistics at at Penn and
in fact one of the leading figures in
the world got drawn into his courses and
back into college hey you have come to
change your views about israel israeli
politics over the years not that much
still believe pretty much what I of
course it's different now than when I
was 12 years old but I basically the
same point of view I'm in these
circumstances have changed but the
mountain position hasn't changed very
much what is your position and how the
circumstances change well remember that
was pre state right and so of course
everything changed when the state was
established although I maintain my
involvement in interest if I came pretty
close for living there my wife and I
spent some time on a kibbutz we might
have gone back at this question but I
was opposed to the establishment of a
Jewish state which again was part of the
dynast movement at the time not a huge
part but there was a element of it the
thought of Jewish state is a bad at
stake I thought so then still think so a
Jewish state as opposed to a democratic
state the two are inconsistent I think
people can try whatever manipulation
they like but if the United States were
a Christian state in anything but
symbolism it wouldn't be a democratic
state I mean taking Sunday office okay
but if there's real discriminatory
legislation and practice that
distinguished Christians from
non-christians or whites from non-white
to that extent it would be a flawed
democracy almost by definition and
that's intrinsic in in the forum of the
Jewish state that was established I'm in
the High Court in Israel actually
declared it to be the state of the
Jewish people
in Israel in the Diaspora so my state
but not the state of a Palestinian Arab
citizen of Israel and this shows itself
in all kinds of ways but it became much
more all of these problems became far
more exacerbated after 1967 when the
military occupation began its known its
36th year and then all sorts of things
happen I mean in 1971 Israel really had
to make a what turned out to be a
fateful decision they received an offer
from Egypt through the UN mediator
Brunner tre to have a job offered full
peace treaty if Israel would withdraw
just from Egyptian territory not nothing
about the Palestinians no West Bank it
was discussed internally in Israel in
the now we know it from released cabinet
records but then in the Hebrew press
they knew that it was a possibility of
peace and integration into the region
the choice was that for expansion which
means permanent confrontation dependence
crucial dependence on the United States
and they chose the latter course and a
lot of things have followed from that
which are in my view very harmful to
society and extremely dangerous and
leading to a constant threat of very
serious war plus 35 years of persecution
of an oppressed population that has
changed things enormous me do you see
any end to that yeah very simple in fact
everyone in the world knows what it is
and has known for years the end is a
diplomatic set I mean it gets more
remote the longer you delay it but the
end has been for since the 1970s a
political settlement on the
internationally recognized border the
pre pre war border
pre June 67 with mutual and minor
territorial adjustments and other
arrangements about other matters the
crucial matter is territorial now that's
been the international consensus since
the mid-1970s the US has unilaterally
blocked it and still does and as long as
that continues there won't be a
political Salem what about Jerusalem
Jerusalem you can finesse one way or
another I mean theoretically it suppose
under the original UN resolutions are
supposed to be internationalized city
okay that's not about happen but Jewish
and Arab neighborhoods could be ceptin
mostly Jewish mostly Arab neighborhoods
could be separated two capitals could be
set up side by side but the Palestinian
one would have to have access to the
Palestinian state that's the crucial
issue and many people have pointed out I
think correctly that the Jerusalem is a
problem you could probably settle in 15
minutes the main problems are the
territorial boundaries as we speak the
White House has announced that it will
declare an end to the war in iraq
tomorrow in your opinion what was that
war all that well we can be certain
about one thing the White House made it
very clear that nothing it said could be
taken seriously so we know that the
reasons they gave can't be the reasons
the way we know that is because they are
contradicted every day I mean one day
the single question as they put it is
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction if
they rid of the weapons of mass
destruction it's all over the next day
it turned out that didn't make any
difference what they did about their
weapons we were going to we had to
impose it around regime it's called
regime regime change and the third day
it was some other stories so we can put
aside the official explanations they
made it clear to us that they're not to
be taken seriously so then we have to
speculate what was it about and I think
it's some pretty clear plausible
explanations I mean first of all is a
background issue which doesn't account
for the timing of the war but it's
always in the background and that is
that Iraq has the second largest oil
reserves in the world it's always been
clear that one way or another in the US
would regain control over them or seek
to do so it does dominate the u.s. does
dominate the Gulf energy producing
region which is by far the largest and
richest in the world and will be for
another couple of generations that's
been policy since the Second World War
the Iraq was kind of an anomaly and that
it broke out of it and it would be an
effort to get it back in that was
certain what about the timing well the
timing is kind of striking if you look
at the propaganda about invasion of Iraq
it really begins last September I mean
it was sort of simmering in the
background but in September that's when
Condoleezza Rice told us about the you
know the mushroom cloud and massive
government propaganda disseminated
uncritically by the media was produced
about Iraq being a threat to our
survival and intimations that Iraq was
behind the September 11th attacks and
was planning new ones and that showed up
very quickly in the polls or by the end
of September of majority of the
population actually believed that Iraq
was a serious threat to us security and
over the months the number of people who
believe that Iraq was involved in the
September 11th attacks is
something like fifty percent probably
that is nobody in the world who believes
anything like this including CIA but it
did come to be public opinion and those
opinions are very strongly correlated
with support for the war not
surprisingly or why September welcome
other things happened in September that
one thing that happened was it was the
opening of the midterm election campaign
and as Karl Rove campaign manager had
already informed Republican and
activists they cannot go into the
campaign with social and economic issues
being prominent or they'll get smashed
they have to be security issues which
will lead people to they hope correctly
to suppress their concerns about the
jobs pensions and Enron and so on in
favor of safety which will block the
power and it worked barely the Rove is
already said they're going to do the
next the same for the presidential
campaign and in fact that ran right
through the 80s when the same people
were running Washington pushing the
panic button every year over something
or other the other thing that happened
which i think is even more significant
is that they announced the national
security strategy in September which
calls for it's in clinic shatters around
the world including the US foreign
policy elite this was a substantial
change in official policy and there are
precedents but it's never been official
policy before there was a policy of
openly announced intention to rule the
world by force and to prevent any
potential challenge to that domination
it's called preemptive war but it's not
pre-emptive it's preventive and even
that's an exaggeration we'll just tack
anyone is in the way but when you
announce a doctrine you have to
illustrate
otherwise nobody takes it seriously to
illustrate the doctrine of preventive
war you have to pick a the appropriate
target first of all it has to be weak
and defenseless there's no point
attacking anybody who can fight back
that's ridiculous so it has to be weak
and defenseless on the other hand that
can't be say you know for runde because
that's worthless nobody who wants it has
to be weak defenseless and important
okay that spells a rank and that was a
perfect petre dish is the New York Times
called a test case for to illustrate the
new norm of preventive war to get the
world understand we mean and I think
those factors probably account for the
time in the background is the long term
interest but as I say you can't these
have to be speculations because there's
no official information it means
anything it's all self contradictory
what do you expect will follow in Iraq
do you expect democracy to blossom there
a special kind of democracy we have a
hundred years of experience in our
backyard to go buddy the US has
dominated Central America and the
Caribbean for a century it's had plenty
of influence in other places and it has
tolerated in foster democracy but on a
condition the Democratic decision has to
conform to US policy if country's
democratic choices ago in opposition to
US policy the government's overthrown
either by coup or invasion or economic
strangulation or something about and in
fact this is extremely explicit in
policy formation it takes discipline not
to see it so for example in the case of
Cuba the US international terrorist
attack on Cuba and that's what it is I
began within months after Castro's
takeover was very sharply escalate
by the Kennedy administration we now
have the internal documents that discuss
describe what they had in mind then it's
the same as everywhere else thought
amala I ran everywhere what the state is
that the very existence of the Castro
regime is successful defiance of US
policies going back 150 years policies
are that the region has to be
subordinated to us power and this is
successful provider that doesn't matter
what they do they've got to conform out
of the wars in Central America in the
1980s were to impose a form of democracy
which would be quote the leading
specialist top-down forms of democracy
in which traditional elites main who who
have been associated with the United
States retain power Jim quoting Thomas
for others it's a leading historian but
also writes from the inside he was part
of Reagan's so-called democracy
enhancement programs in the state
department and that's a correct
characterization and that's what will
happen in Iraq I mean if the majority of
the population happens be Shia I suppose
they call for a Islamic state the link
to Iran the United States and never
tolerate that fact has already said to
you can have a democracy as long as you
do what we say youth have felt that
politics are driven by the economic
interests of what you call the
privileged elite you tell me about that
and who these people are if I thought
it's not my opinion it's the opinion of
a hundred percent of people that work on
Foreign Affairs it's an opinion with
which you agree I'm it's almost a truism
it's true of every country not just the
United States I mean there's an internal
distribution of power in every country
no it's not that everybody is equal and
the internal distribution of power
reflected
and in decision making in the state
system in different ways I mean if a
country has a powerful union movement
for example there'll be a labor
contribution to policy United States
doesn't have that we have basically
business parties and there's a there's a
concentrated sector of economic power
and corporate sector linked to linked
closely to government and they tend to
set the basic framework for policy
choices it's not mechanical can deduce
that this or that policy is going to
come out but it's a very powerful
framework from which there's very little
deviation after the media don't even
tolerate any discussion of anything
beyond it except very much at the
margins even if the population happens
there are many striking cases where the
population is pretty strongly opposed to
policy but if there's a split between a
lead opinion and popular opinion the
these issues just don't even show up in
elections I mean international economic
arrangements are striking example
populations almost brought by
substantial majorities opposed the most
of the arrangement there's near a leak
consensus as a result they just don't
show up except very marginally in a
political debate and political campaigns
and other things actually what I've said
about the Middle East is another example
roughly I think about two-thirds of the
population has it supports the general
international consensus that I mentioned
but the USA lead opinion does not as a
result the issue just doesn't come up
the writer Tom Wolfe calls this the old
Cabal theory and implies that it's kind
of nutty I guess is that sort of
criticism if you think it's nutty for
people with wealth and power to use
their influence
about as nutty is the fact that the Sun
rises every morning couple of years
statements I will quote now the Japanese
bombing of Pearl Harbor saved tens of
millions of lives how did that happen
it's not supportive it it's just saying
you cannot evaluate an action by looking
at the range of consequence is actually
probably in India alone it saved tens of
billions of lives also kicking the
british one of the results of the jet
wasn't the intention of the bombing of
Pearl Harbor but if you look at the
events that unfolded one of the things
that happened is that the Europeans
mostly left Asia not easily so the
French for a brutal war the Dutch
Florida war they finally left and the
effect of that in Asia was dramatic and
if you look at the demographic patterns
and say India or there haven't been any
major famine since the British left
there were terrible famines before in
fact Indian you know they barely
developed during the British period
hundreds of years it had been the
commercial and one of the commercial and
industrial centers of the world when the
British to fit over the British turned
it into an impoverished and agricultural
society with a wealthy elite and some
infrastructure you know based on their
dominance but there's a miserable
situation people like neighbor who is an
Anglophile described the British is like
the Nazis after independence it's not a
wonderful place by any means but at
least the massive famine stuff and some
development picked up and it's much the
same throughout Asia as so an indirect
consequence of the Japanese aggression
and violence happened to be the
liberation of a good deal of Asia that's
incidentally why plenty of asian
nationalists supported the Japanese for
example so carnival and Indonesia sport
of the Japanese all the way through is
anti-fascist but supported the Japanese
because they were going to kick the
and it's the same throughout so no
actions have all kinds of consequences
but you cannot justify japanese
atrocities an aggression on the basis of
the fact that inadvertent consequences
happen to lead the deliberation of age
age that was the context in which that
comment was me and it's I don't think
there's any doubt of the historical
accuracy of the common the u.s. bombing
in Afghanistan was silent genocide know
what I said is that if they that the
assumptions they were making were that
that could well be a consequence
remember the bombing of Afghanistan was
taken on the assumption that it might
well lead put millions of people at risk
of starvation that assumption was very
widespread you can read it and Harvard's
a major international journal
international security the New York
Times were example estimated after a
month that the number of people at risk
of starvation had risen by fifty percent
from five million to seven and a half
million and in fact right after
September eleventh even before the
bombing or the u.s. murdered Pakistan to
terminate food supplies that were
keeping a good part of the population at
the edge of survival so that policy
under the assumptions in which the
policy was being conducted could well
have led to silent genocide that's one
of the reasons why rational people
should oppose policies like that you
said that if the Nuremberg principles
were applied every post World War two
president would be indictable and
probably true can we run run down real
fast what allies now or do it you would
indict him for Eisenhower overthrew the
conservative nationalist government of
Iran with a military coup
he overthrew the first and last
democratic government in guatemala by a
military coup ruin invasion leading two
years of in Iran it led to 25 years of
brutal dictatorship finally overthrown
in 79 in Guatemala led to massive
atrocities which are still continuing
that's after almost 50 years in
Indonesia this was known until recently
but he conducted the major clandestine
terror operation of the post-war period
up until Cuban Nicaraguan in an effort
to break up Indonesia strip off the
outer islands where most of the
resources are and undermine the what was
then considered as a threat of
Indonesian democracy Indonesia was to
free and open it was allowing a
political party of the poor to
participate they were gaining a lot of
ground so that the heisman are supported
and helped instigate a military
rebellion in the outer violence this is
just for starters these are all
indictable offences about Kennedy
Kennedy was one of the worst Kennedy
first of all invaded South Vietnam
during the Eisenhower administration
they had blocked the political
settlement in 1954 and instituted a kind
of a Latin American style terror state
which had killed maybe 60 or 70,000
people by at the end of the Eisenhower
period and had instigated a response a
reaction at Kennedy recognized that it
couldn't be controlled internally so he
simply invaded in 1962 about a third of
the bombing missions that were carried
out by the US Air Force it in South us
planes with South Vietnamese insignia
that US
the author he authorized Nathan he began
the use of chemical weapons to destroy
food crops they began programs which
drove millions of people into what
amount of the concentration camps that's
aggression in the case of Cuba it was
just a massive campaign of international
terrorism which almost led to the
destruction of the world led to the
missile crisis and that we can continue
again these are all indictable offences
Johnson Ron Johnson expanded the war in
the China to the point where ended up
probably leaving three or four million
people did he invaded the Dominican
Republic to block what looked like a
potential democratic revolution they're
supported the Israeli occupation in its
early stages again we think around the
world thank you take them takes a cart
I'll get there but Nixon's next the next
thing we don't even have to talk about
we can we can skip that one okay my
friend let the Fords Ben Ford well for
it was only there for a shuttle time but
long enough to endorse the Indonesian
invasion of east teamwork which became
about as close to genocide is anything
in the modern period they pretended to
oppose it but secretly support it affect
not so secretly the u.s. dip me d Utley
after the invasion the US did join the
rest of the world informally condemning
at the Security Council but the
ambassador of Moynihan was kind enough
to explain to us in his words that his
instructions were to render the United
Nations utterly ineffective in any
actions it might take to counter the
Indonesian and great invasion and he
says proudly that he did this with
considerable success
his next sentence says in the next few
months it seems that about 60,000 people
were killed and then he goes off to the
next topic that's the first few months
went on to probably hundreds of
thousands seek that formerly the u.s.
announced the boycott of weapons but
secretly increase the supply of weapons
including counterinsurgency equipment so
that the Indonesians could consummate
the invasion that's just a short period
in office but that's indictable
seriously in fact that's a major war
crime Carter Carter increased as the
Indonesian atrocities were increasing
they peaked in 1978 Carter's flow of
weapons to Indonesia increased when
Congress imposed a human rights
restrictions but then there was a human
rights movement in Congress to block the
flow of advanced weaponry to Indonesia
Carter arranged through Mondale vice
president to get Israel to send us
skyhawks to Indonesia to enable
Indonesia to complete what turned out to
be near jen is a killing maybe quarter
the population or something in the in
the Middle East Carter just won the
Nobel Prize his great achievement was
the Camp David agreements the Camp David
agreements are presented as a diplomatic
triumph for the United States in fact
they were diplomatic catastrophe yep
Camp David the United States and Israel
accepted finally Egypt 1971 offer which
they had then review as it rejected at
the time except that now was worse from
the us-israeli point of view because it
included the Palestinians in order to
accept get Israel to accept Egypt 1971
offer
after a major war in atrocities and so
on Carter raised aid military and other
aid that Israel to more than fifty
percent of total aid worldwide is really
used it it once and exactly the way they
said they were going to do as every sane
person moon as an opportunity to attack
their northern neighbor first in 1978
then in nineteen eighty-two and to
increase integration of the occupied
territories and that's for starters we
can continue Reagan I don't think we
have to talk about that one either I
mean Reagan is the first president to
have been condemned by the international
court of justice for what they called
the unlawful use of force meaning
international terrorism in the war
against Nicaragua again that's just for
starters they also the security council
endorsed it in two resolutions both of
which were vetoed by the United States
Bush one well first we can begin with
invasion of Panama the invasion of
Panama which according to the
Panamanians killed about 3,000 people
since it's never investigated know if
that's true or not this was done in
order to kidnap a disobedient thug who
had been supported by the United States
right through his worst atrocities
Noriega Noriega it was brought to
Florida and tried for crimes that he
committed mostly on the CIA payroll okay
that's aggression we could go into the
details of the war in Iraq but there
were plainly opportunities for they
might not have worked we don't know but
there were opportunities for diplomatic
settlement which the Bush administration
refused to consider and incidentally the
press would not report with a single
exception in Long Island Newsday which
did report the whole story
throughout accurately and is the only
newspaper in the country to have done to
the Bush administration then did attack
and the attack was carried out and in a
manner which is criminal under the laws
of war they attacked infrastructure and
if you attack New York City and you
destroy the electrical system our system
the sewage systems and so on that
amounts to biological warfare and that's
the nature of the attack then came a
sanctions regime which mostly Clinton
that began with Bush which is by
conservative estimates killed hundreds
of thousands of people while
strengthening Saddam Hussein that takes
us off to Clinton which that's the
beginning that's by no means the end the
clone through it well we can run through
that one case of Isis but there are
plenty of others bush too let's take
going with Clinton and one of Clinton's
minor s with minor escapades very minor
with sending a couple of cruise missiles
to the Sudan to destroy what they knew
to be a pharmaceutical plant there was
no intelligence failure according to the
only estimates we have from the German
ambassador and the director of regional
director of Near East foundation is does
field work in Sudan both of them
estimates several tens of thousands of
deaths from one crusens pay pretty
serious somebody did that to us we'd
regarded as bad news and again we can
continue during in the Middle East for
example the Clinton began by declaring
past UN resolutions in the words of his
administration obsolete and
anachronistic ok so we're finished with
that no more international law then
comes Apollo a period call the peace
process except the during the peace
process Israeli us at Israeli settlement
which means settlement paid
by the US taxpayer and sported by US
military aid and diplomacy continually
increased the most extreme year was
clinton's last year the highest level of
settlement the highest since 1992
meanwhile the territories were canonized
broken up into small regions with
infrastructure projects and new
settlement I don't know what you call
that but it's under military occupation
and if anyone else was doing it we call
it a worker and again we can continue
wish to I don't think we have to discuss
your call okay how does well I want to
get back to one thing you said Newsday
apparently got off the reservation is
somehow what happened they're having an
idea but one particularly one reporter
new boys kept reporting everything that
was happening I have a guess I mean what
was going on was that he was reporting
leaks from the government the government
US State Department was leaking reports
from August August 90 right up to
through December planning for the war
leaking report saying that Iraq was
making offers that the State Department
regarded as serious and negotiable maybe
not acceptable but negotiable now you
know no one in the state department
leaks reports to a suburban newspaper
what I assume was happening was that
they were leaking him to the New York
Times which was refusing to print them
and then they leaked them the news day
which appears on every newsstand in New
York City with a big full front page
headline saying you know Iraq offers
this and that I mean can you think of
any other explanation if you were in the
State Department would you leaked
documents to Newsday but it's a it's a
part of an immense cooperation
day times me relation right and somehow
that newspaper alone and this one
reporter and thing who I don't know but
he was doing very good job that kept
reporting but and what typically
happened is that Newsday would report it
big front-page story and a couple of
days later in the times and the sort of
back pages you'd see the phrase saying
will reports claim that iraq made an
offer but the White House denies it so
very few people in the country new at
this we've got a few minutes left before
we're going to open this for questions
from me from the people here in the
studio you've said either the general
population will take control of our
destiny or there will be no destiny for
anyone to control why is that so I think
we think we are in a situation with I
mean the human species has developed the
capacity to destroy itself and
everything else that's been true since
the Second World War and we are edging
very close to the possibility of that
happening it's come very close in the
past I mean during the Cuban Missile
Crisis which Arthur Schlesinger
described as the most dangerous moment
in human history we just learned last
October how dangerous it was last
October it was revealed at the
retrospective conference of participants
and then American Russian and Cuban that
the world was literally one word away
from terminal Diffley war Russian
submarine commanders turns out had a
nuclear-tipped missiles and they were
under attack by American destroyers at
the edge of Kennedy's quarantine zone
they assumed the nuclear war was going
on two of the commanders ordered the
missiles sent that would have led to a
devastating response picking out Moscow
incomes New York were over one commander
countermanded that was a consequence of
a international terrorist war aimed at
regime change those notions are right in
the headlines and that's we're trying
very close to that now i'm at the
preventive war doctrine last September
it's just a instructing people in the
world they get better develop weapons of
mass destruction or a means of terrorism
in order to enter the United States or
secondly or take another domain nobody
really understands in a detail what's
going on with a climate that's a
complicated issue but there's a mere
consensus among scientists that we're
playing with fire it could be it's kind
of like Afghanistan you're risking the
possibility of very severe destruction
if anything goes wrong these are sort of
nonlinear processes I mean a slight
change could have a big effect and you
know it's going to happen you know maybe
in ice age in Europe there's another
thing well you know we're very near the
edge in nuclear weapons development and
other weapons of mass destruction and
policies that are creating international
chaos in destroying possibly destroying
an environment in which decent survival
as possible nobody can't none of this is
predictable it's just all too close for
comfort and things are tending in that
direction I mean and it's been it's it's
not particularly new it takes a the
history of Europe now for hundreds of
years the Europe was the most savage
place in the world the main activity of
Europeans was slaughtering each other
and meanwhile on the side conquering
most of the world
in 1945 they called it off why well very
straightforward reason it was understood
by French and Germans and British that
the next time they played the
centuries-old game of slaughtering each
other from the end of the world because
they had developed means of destruction
so enormous that you just can't do it
anymore so now you're a visit peaceful
region but unless that extends to the
world same problems in our price what's
the good news the good news is that
there's lots of good news part of it is
that as a result of the activism in the
last 40 years which has been extensive
the United States of them more civilized
country than it was in the past and the
same has happened all over good parts of
the world there's no extensive under
there all kinds of things that we didn't
exist before women's rights minority
rights an environmental movement the
anti-nuclear movement its international
solidarity movements global justice
movements and if none of this existed 40
45 years ago most of it is post 1960s
that started at all the pennant took off
it's changed and changed institutions
but it has changed transmissive
awareness and it's true of a large part
of the world actually much of the
initiative for these developments is
coming from the south and there's a good
reason why the world Social Forum meets
in Brazil not in Paris or New York
that's because that's where the leading
edge of the activism is for significant
social change throughout much of the
self the north is joined to an extent
and these are hopeful possibilities for
popular movements reversing a course
that's a very dangerous one on that note
of optimism we'll take questions now
from people here in the audience I
noticed that you mention that when US
government tries to pick up a target to
attack they usually pick up
defenseless an important target so since
the Iraqi issue has now has been rina
announced it to be officially end and
also it is also said that zero several
possible targets at US government my
pick up so one example my be and the the
North Korea but it is recently it
recently it has been said that the US
Army stationed in North Korea have
retreated to to to Japan sorry excuse
fish in South Korea I also sorry in
South Korea sorry has has retreated to
Japan but it seems that not it seems
that the war will break out I mean
according to some people's belief but it
seems that North Korea is a country with
almost no resources but it's also a
quite defensive and it has it is said
that has nuclear weapons so I wonder
whether you have any opinion on this
issue and what kind of benefits will be
brought to America if you know the war
breaks well the first of all they visit
about attacking defenseless enemies I
actually happen to be paraphrasing a
leaked intelligence document from the
bush one administration when they came
into office like every administration
that he called for an intelligent survey
of the world usually we don't find out
about it for 34 years until it gets
Declassified but in this case someone
leaked a paragraph from it and it was
published by Maureen Dowd in the New
York Times her column is considered a
kind of gossip column so people are read
it very carefully but she actually did
publish in nineteen ninety or so the
paragraph that was leaked from that
document and what it said is that in the
case of confrontation with much weaker
enemies which it's passively assumed
that the only ones you're going to
attack in the case of confrontations
with much weaker enemies of the United
States must defeat them decisively in
italy because otherwise political
support will erode it's not the 1960s
when kennedy could carry out a war for
years and Johnson could escalated with
no protest now you got to build up the
enemy to look like a massive force and
then destroy him decisively and rapidly
and you got to pick a much weaker one
and that's a sensible yeah may not like
it but it's a rational doctrine and if
you look at the Wars of the 90s that's
what they are the North Korea case is a
complicated one the what the United
States has been telling the world loud
and clear for the last couple of months
is that if you want to prevent us from
attacking you you'd better have a
deterrent I mean Iraq had no deterrent
so therefore you can smash it and North
Korea had a deterrent not nuclear
weapons incidentally massed artillery
they have massed artillery aimed at soul
and that the American forces there and
unless the Pentagon can figure out a way
to take them out with precision guided
munitions before they're used it could
just be devastating actually the
predictions of the Clinton years from
the Pentagon were that if the US was to
go to war they was one general footed
they better have a hundred thousand body
bags ready so north Korea has a
deterrent which is conventional the
nuclear weapons they may have a couple
of years from now but that's not easier
now and that held off an attack well why
is not very important you're completely
right as no resources it's one of the
poorest most most horrifying countries
in the world but it's right in the
middle of a crucial area this whole
region is a rapidly developing economic
region I has tremendous resources in
Siberia you know lots of gas and oil and
other resources has huge countries that
are industrialized and need the
resources particularly Japan and
the South Korea but now China to which
is now a resource importer and there's a
good reason to expect that that whole
region is going to go off in its own
independent direction the United States
does not want that it wants that region
to be subordinated to us power and North
Koreans are right in the middle if
there's going to be pipelines from you
know Siberia through with South Korea
and off to Japan that's where they're
going to go so it itself has no material
significance but its position in one of
the most rapidly developing regions of
the world definitely does I appreciate
your emphasises it's on hope as her eyes
activism is being a source of hope and
as a academic and training and a
political organizer in the last two
years I've experienced an inertia in the
academic class so to speak that I've
never experienced before and I've been
organizing for a number of years
including the first Gulf War and so the
first part of the question is why do you
think it is that at absolutely the most
critical time the most you know the mask
has been removed in a lot of sense of
this of this push an expansion of empire
so to speak that that's the time that
the such extreme inertia has set in and
that people feel so impotent and then
the second part of the question is how
do you recommend breaking through that
particularly in an academic class
because they have such resources and I'm
wondering if something like the
french-based attack organization may be
somewhat of a model and I just want to
get your opinion on that well if first
of all your age is significant the
academic world has never been a source
of a rarely been a source of activism it
usually comes from somewhere else
there's a brief period in which it was
true in the late 60s late 60s of not in
the earlier period when parts of the
academic world mostly students
incidentally very few faculty did become
active
they engaged in a league universities
and elsewhere then it kind of died down
in the 1980s I had an extremely activist
period but it was not coming from the
academic world it was coming more from
churches in the Midwest and places like
that the Central America solidarity
movement was extremely significant
didn't get a lot of attention because it
was not coming from a leak centers but
this is the first time in the history of
imperialism hundreds of years that
people from the Imperial country
actually went to live with the victims
to try to help them and protect them I
mean nobody in France went to live in
Algeria during the Algerian word live in
an Algerian village or ever the Vietnam
War was never even thought about and the
whole history of European and US
imperialism never happened that happened
on a very substantial scale in the 1980s
that's the reason why you now have
volunteers in many parts of the world
including the israeli-occupied
territories so oil an outgrowth of this
but the academic world was almost
completely not involved the same is true
in the 1990s hasn't been the academic
world I like the global justice
movements which are the biggest ones
that they didn't commit I mean there's
students involved in a couple of faculty
here and there but it's mostly coming
from elsewhere I didn't mean to apply
that actually I didn't get applied at
the academic and we happen to be in the
academic so rightly we should be
concerned about what goes on there you
know you and I aren't going to organize
steel workers but we can do things where
we live so that's just the right
question and what can change it is
what's always done in the past you know
people working hard to educate to
organize to raise issues and we have
tremendous privileges you know in most
parts of the world that people try to do
things like this a face torture
assassination something or other we
don't face anything you know we're
completely free we have a legacy of
freedom that's an unparalleled we have
enormous resources and privilege to get
every opportunity we can think of what's
lacking is will I said one of the things
that's
common in a kind of a youth culture
student filter like the academic world
is a very short attention span you know
you figure things have to be done soon
and if they don't work in a week you
know we quit like I went to a
demonstration nothing happened okay now
I'm going to quit if you want anything
to change it's got it means work over a
long time lots of defeats occasional
victories ultimately you get somewhere
you think of any popular movement has
ever done anything you know abolitionism
women's rights anything to think of
that's why it works that was what was
different in the working class culture
that I grew up in as a kid are these
came from movements that thought you're
gonna have to work hard for a long time
that's right reaching something and
that's yes that's what happens it's not
going to be any quick victories but
there are plenty of opportunities and
just have to keep them attack yeah well
attack is an interesting group and it's
done important things it's fairly ailey
not fit but it's one of the groups that
with instrumental in setting up the
world Social Forum and their pre
narrowly focused on a few crucial issues
like one of their big issues is at togan
tax you know tax on financial
interactions which is probably a good
idea there's other possibilities like it
and it's a it's been a very influential
and important group and it's starting in
the United States incidentally so their
subgroups here its international based
in front and it's the kind of thing that
could be part of a serious us organizing
effort but only for it I think yes sir
given human rights violations by
corporations I was wondering how you
make your purchasing decisions and if
there are any products that you don't
purchase
well plenty of things I don't purchase
but not really for that reason I mean
these are questions of tactics I mean do
you affect human rights but let's take
coca-cola there's a big thing around
here I understand coca-cola is has just
been it's narrowly scraped by a district
court case in Florida that was brought
by the steel workers in support of
Colombian workers in a subsidiary of a
coca-cola plant which is one of those
vicious anti-union plants almost
anywhere and the particular case was a
union activist who was murdered by
paramilitaries in the plant and the
steel workers who are pressing these
human rights cases for Colombians they
can't do it themselves are using
provisions of American law which do
exist and have sometimes been applied
and they brought a case in Florida which
got to the district court and they sort
of have a half victory the district
court severed coca-cola from the case
but kept the subsidiary well you know
severn coca-cola was a technicality so
does that mean you should stop buying
coca-cola well if you stop buying
coca-cola is that going to help Indian
activists in Colombia that's the
question you have to ask these are and
you know I don't think there's a simple
answer like if you stop by coca-cola
let's not have any effect if there was a
massive quake out of it they'd notice it
in the corporate headquarters I'm
presenting and reap ceylon Reba course
and the guys who make sneakers and
things like that have modified somewhat
their horrendous human rights practices
in plants and Asia as a result of
pressure what must be coming from
students and that yeah that had an
effect but these are questions you just
have to answer in terms of their likely
consequences for people who are
suffering there's no point making
