a few weeks ago the US military
intentionally bombed the hospital in
kunas Afghanistan I mean the US
government felt it enough to just
apologize and there's people leaping to
the defense of the establishment here
saying there must have been a good
reason either they did it on accident
even though that we know that they
didn't or you know there was Taliban
hiding in there and so it justified
obviously this human shield logic just
like Israel does I mean how does this
specific example illustrate how American
exceptionalism functions well we have to
be careful about the term American
exceptionalism and for one think it's
not at all exceptional every imperial
power has bathed the same way sometimes
worse so it's just normal imperial
practice it's called exceptionalism but
nothing about that of course it's called
it it's supposed to be exceptional in
that we have the highest ideals so maybe
we make mistakes but it's always with
the highest ideals that's American
exceptionalism except that too is true
of every just about every imperial power
so when the British were destroying the
world they were always doing it with the
absolutely highest ideals the leading
figures leading intellectuals and people
like John Stuart Mill estimable people
were describing England as an angelic
country beyond anything that anyone's
ever imagined people can't understand
how marvelous we are and so on the
French were the same but hard to find an
exception so there's no exceptionalism
the in the case of the Kunduz hospital
apparently I don't think all the details
have come out but it seems that they
were trying to kill some people they
regarded as Taliban leaders or activists
and they happened to be in the hospital
so they killed every money and there's a
lot of credit there is a lot of
criticism of killing the others what
about killing the person they were
targeting I mean what right do we have
to kill somebody in some other country
who we don't like I mean I don't like
them either
you know don't like the Taliban at all
but does that mean we have a right to go
kill them I mean do they have a right to
go kill us if they don't like us
that's not questions at all what's
questions is then criticized is
attacking a hospital and killing the
staff and killing the patients and you
know it's not the first time so for
example when the when the u.s. one of
the lauded achievements of the US Army
in Iraq is the conquest of Fallujah in
November 2004 that take a look at it
just take a look at the New York Times
the days of the attack on Fallujah the
first day of the attack there's a
picture on the front page and
practically visualized it which is a
picture of the General Hospital in 12
June Marines attacked the General
Hospital through the patients off their
beds put them on the floor but shackles
around them through the doctors on the
floor went attacking a hospital is a
gross violation of international law but
they were asked and they were asked why
did you attack it they said because it
was a propaganda agency for the rebels
how was it a propaganda agency it was
releasing casualty figures and that was
okay that's an achievement but even
beyond that what were the Marines doing
in Fallujah I mean are there irani and
Marines and the in Cambridge that what
our US Marines doing in Iraq the
invasion of Iraq is the worst crime of
this century has had horrible effects
but snow swarmed sectarian conflicts
that are tearing the region apart but
suppose it had worked
I suppose it had pacified Iraq and there
was no disasters it's still a major
crime why do we have the right to invade
another country
and in fact if you look back there's
another Quran which is never discussed
in the 1990s the sanctions on Iraq were
so severe that they virtually destroyed
the society in fact the the sanctions
were administered by the United Nations
and the the international diplomats who
administered the sanctions were
respected international diplomats Dennis
holiday on Sun sponeck they both
resigned in protest on the grounds that
the sanctions were genocide all their
term not mine
they said the sanctions are genocide 'el
they're destroying the society the
strengthening the dictator they're
forcing the population to rely on them
for survival and probably they saved
them from being overthrown from within
has happened to one after another a
dictator of the same sort that was the
1990s if that's considered no problem
you know that was Liberal Democrats well
I mean by the time that bush and Blair
decided to invade Iraq the society was
half devastated so you hit a very
fragile system with a sledgehammer
you're gonna have horrible results and
but the very idea of invading is
criminal and try to find someone who
describes it as a crime right Obama is
praised because he describes it as a
mistake does he describe it as a crime
does anyone accept way out of the fridge
it was the dumb war right and dumb dumb
things we do smart work it's like the
German generals after Stalingrad this is
really stupid they have a two-front war
we should have destroyed England first
well our think it's interesting that
people use the rationale that we didn't
find WMDs as if that would have been a
rationale to invade and occupy a country
finding weapons about the start
we're seen in fact you know I say well
if they're concerned about weapons of
mass destruction there are ways to
proceed the UN inspectors were doing a
fine job actually the same pretty much
the same similar questions arise in the
case of the Iran nuclear deal so Iran
according to the United States poses a
grave threat to the world that's pretty
much an American and Israeli obsession
and most of the world doesn't see it
that way but say let's say it's a threat
suppose you ran poses of the threat how
do you are there simple ways of dealing
with this in fact there are and if I
very popular ones the best way to deal
with it would be to work towards
instituting a nuclear weapons free zone
in the region that's supported by almost
the entire world that's strongly
supported by Iran in fact they're one of
the leading advocates of it yeah when
you're not American Allah doing that
Israel has done them that's the problem
the US won't permit it because it does
not want Israeli nuclear weapons to be
open to inspection so therefore we block
the obvious way to deal with whatever
problem there is and it is supported by
virtually the entire world comes up
every five years at the
non-proliferation treaty review
conference and in fact the continuation
of the non-proliferation treaty is
actually contingent on doing this that
was agreed 20 years ago that's the most
important arms control treaty there is
if that treaty collapses we're going on
everybody will have nuclear weapons and
be using them but the u.s. is so
committed to protecting Israel's nuclear
weapons that it's willing to endanger
the non-proliferation treaty and prevent
the obvious means from keeping nuclear
weapons away from Iran in case they have
any interest in developing do you see a
word of discussion of this outside of
the arms control
literature I write articles but way out
of the fringes nothing that could
possibly make the mainstream
