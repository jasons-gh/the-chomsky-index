I think Putin is a Russian nationalist
who is reacting against the collapse of
Russia from the early 1990s what
happened with thee when the Soviet Union
collapsed there were a number of
directions that could have been pursued
one of them was actually advocated by
Gorbachev it was a move within Russia
towards social democratic policies which
would dismantle the oppressive system of
the so-called communist regime which had
absolutely nothing to do with communism
and just try to move towards a kind of
social democratic political social
political system internally and
internationally a europe-asia wide
security system Eurasian security system
in which Russia would be a participant
so the Soviet Union dismantled the
Warsaw Pact and the analogue would be
for the West dismantle NATO and form an
integrated security system with fair
participation on all sides well that
didn't happen either internally or
internationally the internally Russia
turned towards the wolf occult shock
therapy rapidly introducing radical
market reforms we devastated the society
predictably
and it was a demographic catastrophe
millions of people died it was a the
economy practically collapsed what was
left of the economy it was picked up by
the oligarchs you know super-rich
gangsters and Russia just collapsed
internationally
instead of NATO disintegrating and
bringing Russia into a security system
they to expand it right up to the
borders of Russia after Clinton and out
the day and Putin is reacting to that
right in a nationalist fashion I don't
like it
yeah I don't want to have dinner with it
but you can understand what he's doing
he's trying to reconstruct the powerful
Russia which will play its role in the
world and not be a victim of foreign
attack and it the effects of that are
often pretty unpleasant ugly but not
beyond comprehension I don't think that
Egypt is following a Putin model that's
following the model of the brutal
military dictatorship the military in
Egypt controls a large part of the
economy they have a very powerful stake
in the system they want to maintain it
and it's being implemented with really
violent and brutal means which I think
are probably going to lead to its
collapse just today there was another
major atrocity in the Sinai but but I
think things are not under control and
it's surviving mainly by vast subsidies
from Saudi Arabia which is but it's not
developing the economy it's not dealing
with the social problems it's throwing
tens of thousands of people in jail it's
a very violent and brutal
