can I invite the first question from the
audience and gree on every shirt where
are you agree on right at the back I
could evening after that my question is
can you include the mic right up to your
mouth do you think WikiLeaks is a force
of good and international politics was
it doing more damage world relations due
to her editor he said it oh he's ready
sorry I can't hear that will ya well I
hear is noise but oh I think it's a
wicked leaks it sir it's very beneficial
I mean power systems in general don't
want people to know what they're up to
for pretty obvious reason but people
ought to want to know what power systems
are up to and the WikiLeaks does not
give a deep revelations like it's not
like declassified documents so it's not
like the Pentagon Papers for example or
or just the documents that come out and
weird nerdy classification which deal
with planning you know and they gave
really deep insights into how planning
is executed this gives shallow insights
into what diplomats perceive or in fact
claim that they perceive because there's
a point that you ought to keep in mind
that was actually made by Craig Murray
many of you know who was the former
British ambassador who was a cashier
because he was ambassador was Becca Stan
and he was reporting back to the Foreign
Office about the hideous atrocities
carried out by one of their favorite
mass murderers Kerry muff and Uzbekistan
they didn't like that so he was kicked
out of the Diplomatic Service but he
pointed out and he's right that what
diplomats tend to report back home is
what they think the bosses want to hear
that's how your career
advances you tell them what they don't
want to hear you're going to be in
trouble so there is a kind of a filter
that you have to think about when you
read the wiki leaks exposures it may not
be what the facts are it's the way it's
either perceived or interpreted or you
know reshaped by the diplomat who's
sending it back nevertheless they're
revealing and they tell us a lot and
they helped us in fact they tell us
things related to what we've just been
talking about so some of the most
shocking revelations in WikiLeaks on how
it's been reported here have to do with
Pakistan Pakistan's most dangerous
country in the world it's there's a
combination of two tendencies in
Pakistan which have been developing
since the 1980s incidentally as part of
Ronald Reagan's legacy to the world in
the 1980s they had the worst of the
horrible series of dictators that
they've had all of them backed by the US
and Britain but the worst of them was in
the 80s that was eel Huck he was
carrying out two major policies one of
them was a policy of radical Islam
ization with sudi arabian funding he was
setting up a network of ultra religious
schools and madrasas where you don't
learn anything but the Quran you know
training for jihad and so on and Ronald
Reagan was patting him on the head he
said that's fine the the other was
developing nuclear weapons which the US
government I suppose the British
government pretended they didn't know
well of course they knew so now what you
have is a state which has the most
rapidly developing nuclear arson in the
world quite large a state which could
break up it's kind of like a patchwork
barely held together the only stable
institution by now is the army there's
also a big radical Islamist element
you've probably a couple of months ago
you may remember
a official was assassinated after he
criticized the uses of the blasphemy law
and there were huge demonstrations in
support of the assassins and among the
demonstrators were these black suited
young lawyers who were praising the
assassin and they're the ones where
they're reformers they're the ones who
demonstrated to overthrow the Musharraf
dictatorship and bring about reforms but
their products of this Islamize
theoretically Islamize digication system
that the US and Britain have been
supporting well you know I was coming
back to WikiLeaks the Ambassador who
does support US policies not criticizing
them and Patterson she is regularly
pointing out the Washington that US
policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan are
contributing to radicalizing and
dismantling Pakistan drone at the
country's extremely anti-american by now
just overwhelming drone attacks
pressures on the military to go into the
tribal areas which they've both always
left alone all these things are
contributing to possible splintering in
the military system radicalizing the
population and increasing the
probability as she points out that among
the tens of thousands of people involved
in the nuclear weapon system and many of
them kind of like those lawyers you know
products of a radical Islam eyes
educational system they may be able to
get their hands on fissile materials
have them leaked and that's not
impossible and it gives you the ultimate
nightmare at jihadi bomb going off
New York well that's what we're
contributing to buy the policies that
are now being undertaken there's plenty
of evidence about this without WikiLeaks
but what the WikiLeaks tells us is that
the planners in Washington and London
are being informed of this directly by
their own ambassador I assume the same
would be true in London and they're
going ahead with the policies the same
well it's kind of like these
institutional necessity as I was
describing you have a potential
catastrophe on your hand hands and so
let's march forward in advance it that's
one revelation of licky WikiLeaks that's
a good thing for people to know they
ought to know more more about it and
they're quite a number of other things
like that that could run through them at
this time but although most of it is
pretty palette actually what ambassadors
what diplomats tell the home office
isn't usually very interesting but
there's jewels in there that are worth
looking at them that are quite revealing
there's no sense at all in which it
damages world relations I mean may
embarrass some diplomats but you know
who cares about that they plenty of
things are going to be embarrassed about
so we'll have a few more but basically I
think it soon it's a good thing I mean I
don't think that Assange should be
regarded as a hero he's certainly
autoville and I think you should be
considered as somebody's doing a civic
duty helping the people in a formal
democracy learn something about what the
representatives are up to that and in
fact is make one comment on declassified
documents I've spent a lot on at the
time in my life going through secret
documents that are declassified by
governments or in the case of the
Pentagon Papers stolen and so on mostly
us but also British and one thing that
comes out very clearly I think anyone
who studied these documents will draw
this conclusion is that although their
secret on grounds of secure
the security is the security of the
State against its own citizens they
rarely have to do with any real issue of
security you know defense of the country
or something like that they have to do
with keeping the population uninformed
about what their leaders are up to and
there are pretty good reasons for that
that's the way power systems in general
are going to operate and this is one of
them but going back to WikiLeaks I think
yo that's the kind of thing that ought
to happen and you can see by the
harshness of the punishment how
seriously the government's take it
taking it Assange you familiar with but
the more striking case is bradley
manning the american soldier who's
accused rightly or wrongly of having
given the original leaked documents to
the WikiLeaks organization he's
undergone seven months of torture
literally he's been solid he's not he
has no charge yet but he's been in
solitary confinement for so seven months
solitary confinement is torture you most
people can't survive more than a couple
of days of it why is he being tortured
well you know the a warning to others
don't give away our secrets we want to
be protected from our populations I
think these people merit a lot of
support a lot more than they're getting
um thank thanks for that I was an
immediate convert WikiLeaks when I had
an email to say you're in WikiLeaks and
I was in WikiLeaks for my ambition on
climate change so clearly it was
worrying the US officials who actually
recorded that whales was interested in
playing on a global stage on climate
change issues but can I move on to our
next questions from the audience and
from soon Essex
thanks thanks Jane well actually this
question follows all very much from your
last comment because my question to know
ms is it possible for a small country
such as whales to show leadership or
have influence over critical
international issues the answer is right
here that's showing leadership on
critical international issues and having
an impact enough of an impact to weary
the US government that's good yeah of
course it is the it could be an
inspiration it can be a model you know
it can construct initiatives that the
big powers for one or another reason are
too ossified or lethargic or
bureaucratic to carry out you know a lot
of things can be done on climate change
dramatically affect and thank you v the
next question is from Rita Toivonen Rita
where are you please good evening the
Arab world is currently in revolt and
and it's not driven by religion what is
your opinion on what the implications of
the of the situation will be for
autocratic regimes worldwide we quite
right that it's not the riven by
religion and that's very important these
revolt that's taking place the uprising
all through the Arab world is quite a
spectacular development I can't really
think of any comparable and least in my
lifetime it's it just kind of hit the
public arena now but it's worth
remembering that's been going on for
some time so take Egypt which is the
most important case because of its
significance in the region and so on
those are you been following it know
that the january twenty fifth movement
the uprising was organized by a pretty
small group of young people tech savvy
young people who really didn't expect
anything like this they decided to try
to organize some small demonstrations
then it kind of blew up they have a name
they're called the April sixth movement
why April sixth because on april six
2008 the workers in the biggest
industrial installation in egypt the
mala textile complex we're planning a
major strike to protest against awful
working conditions under the
dictatorship and planning also
solidarity demonstrations along with it
well that was crushed by force april six
2008 and that's the name that they
picked because that means something in
egypt what it means is there's been a
long series of struggles against the
dictatorship it's no surprise they don't
get reported much but they're going on a
lot of them get crushed by force and
they're supported by the great powers US
and britain particularly so take this
one this is april six 2008 and not long
after that barack obama made his famous
trip to Cairo to show how much he loves
the muslim world on his way he was asked
in a press conference I think maybe by
ant BBC reporter whether he was going to
have anything to say about the
authoritarian Mubarak regime a bit of an
understatement it's one of the harshest
dictatorship surround his answer was
interesting he said he said I don't like
to use labels for folks now when a
political figure uses the word folks you
kind of
yeah get ready for the lie or horrible
statements going to come out otherwise
you talk about people but when you talk
about folks you're preparing the ground
so he doesn't like to use labels for
folks he said barks a good man he's
keeping stability which technical term
that means obeying orders he's keeping
stability he's doing good things he's a
good Ally I have no criticism to make
well you know Egyptian workers have just
been through this last crushing of a
major strike and plenty of others they
could hear that I could draw their own
conclusions the same with actually Tony
Blair who seems to have a genius for
making the most outrageous state than at
the wrong moment he came out with a very
similar statement right in the middle of
the uprising about Mubarak you may have
seen it but this was before and what all
this indicates is that there's been a
lot going on not just in in Egypt the
red tuna see it's all over the region
that's been going on for a long time
people don't like to live under
dictatorship harsh brutal dictatorship
with torture and violation of rights and
suppression of speech and so on it can
be below the surface for a long time but
it can come out and what these events
show us is it can come out very
significantly and it's quite striking to
see the reaction of the great powers
United States and Europe mainly there's
this happens over and over again
incidentally over and over again they're
there cases where it becomes impossible
to sustain your favorite dictator and
there's a game plan that's followed
routinely Marcos in the Philippines
davidian Haiti Chun and South Korea
sooo heart though and Indonesia and it
happens all the time sustain them as
long as possible when it becomes
impossible either the Army's turned
against them or the business world turns
against them popular up roars too much
whatever if you can't sustain them any
longer send them out the pasture
somewhere issue ringing declarations
about your love of democracy of the
people and rights and so on and then try
to restore the old regime that's the
game plan that's being followed here try
to restore the old system with new names
nothing new about it I mean it's the
kind of thing you learn in elementary
school it's happened maybe a dozen times
in the last 30 years and many times
before that it's a little bigger this
time but notice the way they're doing it
in the case of Egypt what in Tunisia the
first two cases there has been no regime
change there's been a change of names
which is significant and there's been
some softening of repressive structures
also significant there's been a freeing
up of the press which is very important
labor rights are being improved because
working people are just proceeding to
take over factories and run them
themselves that's significant but the
basic structure of domination and
control has not materially changed and
the US and Europe are trying to sustain
it it's worth bearing in mind and here
WikiLeaks again is interesting that the
US and Europe cannot support democracy
in the region is a very simple reason
for that elementary reason should be in
the headlines it has to do with our
public opinion in a democracy if it's
really functioning public opinion is
going to influence policy so what's
public opinion well it's known then get
reported but it's known there's
the leading polling agencies in the
United States take through studies of
error public opinion they're released by
major institutions working Institute and
so on planner certainly know them even
if they don't read them in the
newspapers just to tell you what's in
the newspapers about this in the United
States nothing in England I think one
article by Jonathan Steele and the
accordion that Jay asked him a couple of
days ago if anyone else had ever written
about it and he didn't know anything but
that was the one report I saw of the
latest poll results which are quite
striking what they show is that in the
Arab world an overwhelming majority of
the population regard the major threats
to them as the United States and Israel
Britain's not important enough to be
regarded as a major threat but if they
paid attention they'd have added that so
it's the United States and Israel of the
major threats one of the questions is do
you think he ran as a threat and some do
ten percent opposition to US policy is
so extreme that a considerable majority
think the reason be better off if you
ran had nuclear weapons in Egypt it's
eighty percent ninety percent think the
u.s. is the major threat and the rest
goes on like this you know under those
circumstances the Western powers are not
going to be able to tolerate they're
going to do anything they can to prevent
democracy if a democratic uprising
succeeded the US and Britain and France
and the rest of the be out and that's a
big change in world affairs control over
Middle East oil the major issue has been
a kind of an axiom of the world control
since the oil age began you know we've
actually the first world war so they're
going to do anything they can to stop
the democracy from going too far and you
can see how it's being done in Tunisia
and each
they're trying to keep the lid on the
serious places our places like Bahrain
and Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia of course
is the jewel in the crown that's where
all the oil is Saudi Arabia is the most
extreme of radical Islamist government
in the world it's also the center of
jihadism you know the funder of jhad ism
and so on that's where the you know the
men on the claims that hit the Twin
Towers were from and it's been the
leading ally of Britain in the United
States for decades very ever since it
was formed in the 1930s because most of
the oil the US and Britain have been the
major supporters of radical Islam all
the way through for good reason narrow
reasons but good ones it's a barrier
against independent nationalism and
that's what really worries them the
questioner pointed out that this is not
these uprisings are not based on
religion that's the frightening part if
there are a secular nationalist
development which might move towards
independence taking over your own
resources using over your own needs
that's the threat always has been that's
why the US and Britain have supported
the radical Islamism from way back and
still do anyway so if Saudi Arabia is
threatened then they got a real problem
on their hands you I don't know what
today there was supposed to be
demonstrations in Saudi Arabia haven't
seen whether anything happened but the
police are the security forces are all
over the place a very heavy police
presence yesterday they were already
using live fire of the ruling clerics of
you know is you all sorts of
declarations about how major crime to
demonstrate Bahrain is particularly
sensitive it's a it by the standards of
the region it's relatively free but
pretty repressive
it's a Sunni kingdom with a majority
Shiite population and more significant
it's you know 30 kilometers away from
eastern Saudi Arabia where the majority
the populations Shiite repressed you
know brutalized and that's where most of
the oil is so you have a situation
that's kind of like an odd historical
and the geographical accident took place
the boy the oil resources of the region
are right around the northern part of
the Gulf which are mostly Shiite areas
and the dictators are assuming that's
very explosive and has been concerns
about that for years if the Bahraini
uprising in facts as they put it eastern
Saudi Arabia then they're really in
trouble and they've been the the US of
the US and Europe of not even you know
have been holding but don't even
rhetorically support the demonstrators
there it's much too dangerous well those
are all things that are on their way
will it influence autocratic regimes
elsewhere I think they're all trembling
what they're all seeing is you can't be
sure you can keep the lid on that we can
try but these things are infectious
people see something someone doing
something somewhere as and say we can do
it too and the whole system of global
what's called global order no
suppression of populations by
authoritarian or worst regimes is in
serious danger including the whole
imperial system in its residue so yeah
it's a these are major events I don't
think there's been anything like them
how far they'll go you know who knows
but in it is certainly even if they're
defeated which could happen there's
certain to be a legacy their gains
already and they're not going to be
beaten
back and it sort of gives a plateau from
which the next struggle will take place
so I think we're in the midst of serious
historical transformations um the next
questions relating to language so is
David Jones anywhere near a microphone
Thank You Minister professor Chomsky
perhaps to follow on from the last
question to some extent I'd like to pose
or to pursue the question whether
whether you consider language itself to
be either the perfect or the imperfect
instrument of empire language is kind of
like asking that is a hammer an
instrument of destruction or of
construction hammer doesn't care I mean
the hammer doesn't care whether they use
it to whether a torturer uses it to beat
in somebody's head or whether a
carpenter uses to build a house hammers
happy either way and language the same
thing it's a neutral instrument it
certainly is used as a tool of empire
and a tool of domination and control
endless numbers of examples it can be
used as a tool of liberation and often
is so it's up to us really what it is
it's there you know has its options and
capacities we have a choice as to how to
use it people will use it for their own
purposes to dominate the control to
repress to liberate to educate not to
open up opportunities but as far as the
language is concerned it's happy anyway
and next from Jack Parker Jack hi
politicians are generally elected for
terms of just four or five years how can
any politician have a long-term view of
affairs when they say their sites may be
one winning the next election well you
know that raises a question about what
we think about the nature of real
democracy I mean I I think there's a
presupposition here that should at least
be questioned the presupposition is that
it's the politicians who should
understand have a long-term view of
affairs there's another way of looking
at it which is that the populace should
have that long-term view and the
political figures should be just
representatives of popular views and
understanding who are granted the the
authority the short term authority to
implement the will of the population so
I think the real question we should ask
you certainly right if we have a system
in which the population are supposed to
be spectators and the political leaders
are supposed to be the participants the
actors then it's important for the
political leadership to have a long-term
view of affairs but that's an assumption
that we need not make that is
incidentally the standard assumption of
democratic theory that the population
are supposed to be spectators not
participants if you look at maybe some
of you have studied political theory you
know this is the way it works in fact
it's it's it's it's advocated so in
progressive essays on democracy you know
theories of democracy the basic
conceptional quote from one of the
leading figures but it's
unfair to quote a particular person
because it's almost everywhere walter
Lippmann the leading public intellectual
of the United States in the 20th century
a Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy liberal you
know not on the right wing he well-known
Democratic theorists as highly praised
called progressive essays on democracy
and he articulates the common view quite
lucidly in fact what I just said was
quoting from him his view is that the
public who he refers to as ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders have to be
prevented from interfering with the
serious work they have to be diverted
somehow as he puts it we the real
thinkers deciders we have to be
protected from the trampling and the
roar of the bewildered heard they're
supposed to be spectators not
participants okay this is from the you
know not the far left but this is the
left of the spectrum you go to the right
it's much harsher and that's a standard
view it's the view for example of the
framers of the American Constitution
there was no the most democratic system
in the world may way still is but you go
back and read say James Madison the
mainframe ER he was concerned about the
danger of democracy regarded as a threat
because of what the people might do
actually had a concrete example in mind
he inland was the model they were
thinking of course and he raised the
question in the Constitutional
Convention of what would happen if in
England the vote were really free
everyone was allowed to vote and
everyone was a position to Norma cast a
vote but the influence policy he said
what'll happen is that the majority the
majority of the population who are
deprived and poor they'll use their
voting power
to take away the property of the rich
they'll carry out what we would call
land reform you know break up the land
of the states and give out property and
so on and that's obviously unfair can't
do that so therefore we have to somehow
reduce democracy and that's the way the
American constitutional system is set up
Britain even more so but the powers in
those days the executive president was
supposed to be really an executive just
an administrator power was supposed to
be in the Senate and as Madison put at
the Senate is the wealth of the nation
the more responsible set of men the men
who have sympathy for property owners
and their rights and the rest have to be
fragmented somehow so they don't
interfere with the decisions of the
Senate the Senate in those days was not
elected it was picked by led by
legislators which it was assumed would
be under the control of property owners
no direct election of senators until the
20th century House of Representatives
which is more democratic no closer to
the population very limited powers and
that that was the reasoning actually for
those of you are for those of you
interested in political theory there's
an interesting history to this Madison
was repeating probably unconsciously a
discussion that Aristotle had the first
great book on political theory is
Aristotle's politics and Aristotle and
considers the various possible political
systems it doesn't like any of them but
he says the least bad is democracy of
course he's talking about Athens you
know not the United States but but the
similarities are great Athens was the
most democratic place at the time but as
it was a democracy of propertied men you
know no slaves that no women the same
was true of the United States that women
didn't get the vote until nineteen
twenty four
incidentally the same year they did in
Afghanistan slaves of course no vote at
all and you had property qualifications
so it was a proper it was a democracy of
free property men Aristotle posed the
same problem he said if we have
democracy the poor will use their voting
power to take the property the rich
unfair he picked the opposite solution
for Madison Madison solution was to
reduce democracy Aristotle solution was
to reduce inequality and he discussed
what we would call welfare state
measures to try to get her going to be
middle class then you wouldn't have this
problem but the problem remains if you
have a highly in egalitarian
socio-economic system the majority the
population will be able to use their
voting power to create a more equal
distribution of resources opportunities
and so on and that's inconsistent with
the the the rights presumed rights of
those who are rich and powerful so
democracies are not a good idea that's
why the constantly get anally contempt
for democracy actually going back to
WikiLeaks the most is a very dramatic
illustration of this the the leaks that
got the most publicity you know big
headlines you for a commentary and so on
we're the ones that wear the newspaper
reports and the columns and the
commentators were very happy that the
WikiLeaks show that the Arab support US
policy on Iran now they were quoting
Arab dictators and if you remember Craig
Murray's comment that may or may not
have been what the dictator said but
let's say it was what they said the
dictators did say Iran is a serious
threat we got to do something about it
so we're delighted we're happy what the
Arab
what's what about Arab opinion I've
already told you what they say they're
in favor of Iran having nuclear weapons
but our contempt for democracy is so
profound that it doesn't occur to anyone
to read the commentary literally didn't
occur to anyone that if we're supported
by the dictators but the population is
overwhelmingly opposed that's fine as
long as the population is passive
quiescent diverted and so on and that's
the it's a dramatic illustration of the
democratic theory which is that just a a
deeply rooted elite conception and I
think that comes back to your question
which is a good question but it is based
on this presupposition that somehow the
population have to be spectators not
participants and I think that's that
that's a question I mean certainly not
everybody can spend their day making you
know the decisions but the people who do
ought to be responsible to the public
and the public or a debate and form and
want to implement the decisions and pick
somebody to administer it and that would
be a real democracy we're far from that
but in the conditions we have I think
your point is right was that you that
the people that whoever's making
decisions has to have a long view I
think would be preferable if it was the
general public that did and move in that
direction I think would be a healthy one
before before we came down as explaining
to nome that we we had a historic yes
vote last week in in Wales and the in
our fledgling democracy we had a
two-to-one vote in further of more
powers coming to the Welsh government to
take decisions here in Wales and what
was particularly I think wonderful for
those of us who were campaigning is that
vote was a strongest in some of our
poorest areas in Wales who have been
looking at two
assembly government for support over
over the last 12 years but another
aspect of of that vote last week was
that the campaign was conducted on email
by text by Twitter and by Facebook
