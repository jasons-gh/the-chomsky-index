we're here with dr. Noam Chomsky at the
peace march dr. Chomsky two
demonstrations like this make a
difference oh yeah they make a huge
difference in fact they reach two
different constituencies the their
noticed by people in power and they
worry them and they have to adjust at
least their tactics and ultimately their
policies but more important than that
they reach the demonstrators in the
community that they are part of and just
inspire them they go on to it really
matters which is a two day activities
that go on you know it's and deploy undo
are the big demonstration big mass
actions are important part of it but
they're only a part I mean the main part
is just changing understanding activism
engagement and sure it makes a
difference look where we are as compared
with say 40 years ago much improvement
what's your assessment of the peace
movement today last year when the war
was about to begin there were millions
of people marching around the world and
making their voices heard what's your
assessment of the situation today well
what happened last year is astonishing
it was the first time in centuries of
European imperialism counting US and
Canada first time ever that there had
been a huge mass popular protest against
the war before it even was started and
that's unprecedented
and it just has lays the basis for going
on from there certainly put a it
certainly slowed down the drive to
shredder aggression and it's laid the
basis for more organizing or activism
today's another these are all new things
they'd never happened before I'm just
think of Vietnam and it was years before
you had any practice at all none no and
even when it finally ended it was about
peripheral issues but the bombing of the
north which was real but not the war
this week there have been events in
Spain and and to some extent in Poland
which seemed to have begun to change the
situation what's your assessment of the
events in Spain last week and what do
you think is likely to happen in Poland
and in other countries of the so-called
Coalition of the Willing well what
happened Spain is actually being very
seriously misreported what happened in
Spain is that the population took the
same position as the overwhelming
majority of the population of the United
States they did not say they would
withdraw troops they said they wouldn't
keep them there under US command but you
know as far back as April a large
majority of people in the US have been
in favor of handing control over to the
UN apparently Iraqis not the same thing
Spanish went the same thing but it shows
is that Bush Blair and the people around
them are even more isolated even from
long populations and they were before
abeyance the issue is will the u.s. hand
sovereignty over to the Iraqis Bush
player and the rest say no the
population of the United States says yes
overwhelmingly the Spanish people just
voted yes the Iraqis overwhelmingly say
yes that's the issue the
saying that they caved in to terrorism
is just a cover for apologists for
violence with increased pressure on OSHA
lair what are the chances of a dramatic
change in what's happening in Middle
East what are the chances that power and
Iraq will be happy that the military in
Iraq will be handed over the United
Nations no that's no point speculating
about those things the point is to do
something about them I mean most of the
struggle is there in Iraq I mean we it's
our responsibility really to see that it
is that the u.s. is does get out but
that's our responsibility here we can't
shirk it and leave it to the people
under the whip and about that there
really isn't any point speculate just do
something about it one last question the
peace movement of United States in the
United States what do we know about it
how strong is that what kinds of actions
are they taking on what likelihood is
there that they will have some impact on
the bush well it's a stronger than it's
ever been but what the effect will be
again and I'm any point speculating I
mean it's an extremely broad movement
you have to remember that the u.s.
population is very frightened I mean
about probably over half the population
still believes that the Iraq had weapons
of mass destruction was involved in 911
and those people frightened and the
people who run the government we're the
same run sir ran it in the 1980s no just
as they knew then that if they terrify
people enough they can get away with a
lot of things in fact what they're
really getting away was a shafting
American population it's one of the
reasons why they have to keep screaming
terror and frightening people but it's
split and there's plenty of opposition
thank you very much dr. Noam Chomsky
you
