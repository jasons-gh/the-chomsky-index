one of the quotes that you referred to
as John Dewey in your mis-education book
and I'll just read it the ultimate aim
of production is not production of goals
or goods I'm sorry but the production of
free human beings associated with one
another in terms of equality could you
just maybe end with a few comments about
that
well John Dewey was a leading American
social philosopher was also by our
standards pretty radical I mean he I
think his positions correct
Bertrand Russell took very similar
positions and yes a decent education
ought to be creating free independent
creative human beings it doesn't have to
be developing them has to be allowing
them to follow those natural instincts
there's a natural among children the
educational system has to beat it out of
them and make them obedient and
subordinate and so on but a decent
educational system would be would allow
these natural aspects of human nature to
flourish and encourage them and it would
be part of developing a free and
democratic society of real participation
but of course that runs counter to elite
interests the worth remembering that the
United States was not founded to be a
Democratic Society and elites do not
want it to be a Democratic Society it's
supposed to be what political scientists
sometimes call a polyarchy system
basically of a league decision and
public gratification and if you had the
kind of educational system that do we
spend his life committed to you wouldn't
be able to sustain that now people would
become active involved engaged and would
try to create a truly functioning
democratic society which would as do we
also pointed out require industrial
democracy that means democratizing
production
and commerce and so on which means
eliminating the whole structure of
capitalist hierarchy these positions
were look he's very mainstream Main
Street America but radical from the
point of view of prevailing doctor and I
think he's quite right about that
in fact they're just to go to politics
or do he also pointed out that until
that's done unless that's done politics
will remain what he called the shadow
cast by business over society and the
educational system will be a system of
indoctrination and control
I was lucky as a kid to be sent to a do
a school and it was quite quite an
exciting experience
