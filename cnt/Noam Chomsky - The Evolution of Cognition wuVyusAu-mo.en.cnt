dr. Tomsky if I understand correctly
your you hypothesize the natural
language that kind of functionality in
the brain and what we actually speak is
kind of a simple epiphenomena on top of
that and that the actual language is
more complex and rich than we actually
ever use do you have any hypothesis and
how all this excess capacity came to be
there yeah so and it just seems to be a
fact that our language capacities
involve I mean some things just seem to
be factually correct stay that there are
a garden path sentences there are
sentences which are where our mind the
mechanisms of our mind assign to them a
certain set of properties but when we
perceive the sentence we don't our
interpretive capacity doesn't doesn't
assign them those properties we have to
go through some other course of inquiry
using our scientific capacities and so
on to notice that discrepancy there seem
to be things like that and that just
looks well-established so why did it
happen you know why don't we get this
system that's like asking how we got
anything else why'd you get a
circulatory system why do we have arms
virtually nothing is known about those
questions I mean you know there's things
knowing at the very you know there's
something known about why a mixture of
simple gases with an electrical spark
going through it can ultimately turn
into something remotely like a not
really like but the beginnings of a
bacterium I mean that level some things
are understood and they understood
because the physical laws involved are
more or less grass there are things
understood some things understood about
the basic forms that exist in you in
life you know bilateral symmetry you
know there's some biophysical things
that are understood more or less but
when you ask why particular organs exist
you can't say any you can say some weak
things you can say that things won't be
around if they're harmful to
reproduction because then they'll die
off through natural selection that you
can say and you can say few other things
you can say some things about population
genetics and so on but you can't say
anything much about these topics and in
fact you know I don't think serious
evolutionary biologists have anything
lots about this if you want to get a
good picture of it from the point of
view of one of the best I have a look at
Richard Lewontin 's article on the
evolution of cognition in the third
volume of the Encyclopedia of cognitive
sciences that was published edited by
Daniel Asher's and other people but
published by MIT press years ago well he
goes on to give I think a very plausible
argument as to why not only do we know
nothing about the evolution of cognition
but it's not even clear that there's a
question there that we can ask seriously
I mean the reason why we have the kinds
of systems we do in the brain is
probably because that's the way physics
work you know as he says breathe
reasonably for all we know when the
brain reaches a certain level of maybe
you know the brain may have gotten very
big in order to do things like to take
us I mean joke which he gives to cool
the blood and it could've been a thermo
regulator it's not impossible like
Aristotle thought that the brain was a
thermo regulator cool the blood got so
much blood flowing around when it
reached a certain scale and complexity
because of the way physics works and
biology works and so on it just had
certain properties and one of those
properties could have been no sort of
ability to solve some kind of problems
or a language capacity or something else
if cognitive capacities are like other
things in the biological world that's
probably the right kind of answer now
you know once some of those capacities
were around it's conceivable that they
contributed to differential reproduction
in which case you wouldn't tend to have
you know more individuals around with
those properties but as he points out
even that isn't very reasonable I mean
if you remember that most of human
evolution was sort of small
hunter-gatherer societies you know
little groups of people who are sort of
foraging around then the yeah
for food and trying to avoid
saber-toothed Tigers and things like
that and as the one who points out and
if you want to construct all kind of
fairy tales and stories about this he
says well how about the following fairy
tale how about the one that says that
you were more likely to live and hence
reproduce if you were dumber and less
imaginative no this is he points out
there's some plausibility of that I mean
if you've got a group of
hunter-gatherers
and one of them happens to be courageous
and you know imaginative and he wants to
try to see where that saber-toothed
tiger is going and so on
he'll probably it he's more likely to
get killed now his presence in the tribe
may help the tribe survive but his genes
aren't going to be transmitted because
he's more likely to get killed the
wounds were more likely to survive or
the wounds were cleverly sitting at home
and waiting for him to kill the tiger
and bring in the food so maybe there's
selection for stupidity and for lack of
imagination and so on so that then you
get the opposite of the development of
cognitive development as it points out
that's as good a fairy that was any
other
