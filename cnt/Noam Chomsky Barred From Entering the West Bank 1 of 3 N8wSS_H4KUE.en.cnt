imperialism and US foreign policy his
latest is called hopes and prospects we
welcome you to Democracy Now Noam
Chomsky it's good to have you with us
can you explain exactly what happened on
Sunday it's very straight forward the
report that you just read from the
ministry is accurate I have spoken but
we the basic facts are as you described
them my daughter and I along with two
old friends were going to Ramallah from
Amman and were stopped at the border
waited several hours several hours of
interrogation and finally my daughter or
not I were denied entry the reasons are
quite straightforward I've spoken at
piers 8 university
before but in every prior occasion it
was as a side trip when I was visiting
Israel and give you in talks of Israeli
universities this time differs in one
respect I was I had an invitation from
peers 8 and I accepted it gladly as in
many other cases and I had no intent and
student of going on to speak in Israel
as well this time that's the only
difference so essentially what Israel is
same thing is that they insist on the
right that's to determine who is allowed
to adjust Palestinian University at
their invitation can you talk about the
questions that they asked you how long
did they question you for and how long
were you held at the border murder I
guess was about five hours or so in the
questioning which was your mitten was
maybe two hours of the officer at the at
the immigration post was essentially
relaying the questions from the history
of occasion he was in telephone or
computer contact with I don't say again
who was he in contact with the border
guard the Ministry of Information
Ministry of Interior sorry Ministry of
Interior and what was he going back and
forth with the Ministry of Interior
about whether word to questions kept
repeating in various forms one was that
they don't like the kinds of things I
say about is real okay yes was quoted
aljazeera that puts them in the category
of just about everyone else in the world
every other country furthermore it can't
possibly in the reason since I've been
invited to by universities in Israel to
give talk specifically about Israel very
critical ones and the talks I was
invited for here were primarily about
the United States
u.s. foreign and domestic policies the
other question was just a critical one
and the one difference between this and
other occasions is that I was simply
coming to visit here's a university and
was not at same time that giving talks
at Israeli universities with a visit to
mutate on the side has been the case
previously and they didn't like that and
why didn't they like that they didn't
like that because I well I'm speculating
but I think the reason is clear they
don't like the idea that a post in
university can be independent and pursue
its on policies the same way that any
other university in the world both us
and it's almost unheard of that side of
totalitarian states were the government
to prevent someone from responding to an
invitation at the University to do at
all at the risk of sounding like a
border guard Noam Chomsky what were you
planning to talk about it verse 8
university the topics were announced one
was called the American in the world it
was about u.s. foreign policy including
Middle East policies as a special case
the other was America at home and it was
going to be the session of the
developments inside the United States
particularly in the last 50 years and in
the first case what was the speech could
you elaborate on what you intended to
say I was going to discuss and will in
fact by the day of the conference
discuss some persistent themes and us
international relations since the
founding of the Republic but primarily
in the past since the Second World War
when the u.s. a major error in the world
scene and the distressed our apologies
have developed through the Cold War
period and since the colder the present
including of course policies with regard
to the crucial Middle East region ever
since it was recognized as the oil was
going to be a primary reserve said
during World War one but essentially
after World War two when the United
States displaced written as the major
actor in rural affairs um what is your
assessment right now of the situation
with Israel and Palestine and were you
going to meet with the Palestinian Prime
Minister I did I was going to meet with
the Prime Minister unfortunately I could
but he his office called me here in a am
on this morning and we had a long
discussion he is pursuing policies which
in my view are quite sensible policies
of essentially developing facts on the
ground that's almost I think it's
probably a conscious imitation of the
pearly scientist policies establishing
facts on the ground and hoping that the
political forms that follow will be
determined by them and the policies
sound to me like sensible and sound ones
the question of course is whether the
extent to which Israel and the United
States which is a determining factor the
extent which they'll permit them to be
implemented but if implemented they and
if of course Israel and the United
States would terminate their systematic
effort to separate Gaza from the West
Bank is quite illegal if that you just
have returned into a viable Palestinian
state known you said that what I had
said at the beginning was not actually
accurate no reason was initially given
for the decision to bar you but the
interior ministry later told the Israeli
newspaper Haaretz that officials are now
trying to get clearance from the Israeli
Defense Forces an interior ministry
spokeswoman said we're trying to contact
the military to clear things up and if
they have no objection we see no reason
why he should not be allowed
in what isn't true about that I have
been I have spoken in thurs aid the
number of times no one ever asked for
clearance from the Israeli military but
the one difference in this case is that
on those occasions i was visiting Israel
and giving talks at Israeli universities
and meetings and so on and went to visit
some side trip in this case I was going
to verse 8 i'm not speaking at its
really universities and in fact the
interrogator reading the questions that
were coming from the ministry the
repeatedly asked well why aren't you
also going to talks give talks in Israel
but that's the one difference and it has
nothing to do with the idea how do you
know it has nothing to do with the
military he put it was the second heat
encased I was going to talk in the West
nine okay it's that that word was the
same the one part is different in this
case is that I was talking in the West
Bank and not in Israel and that has not
