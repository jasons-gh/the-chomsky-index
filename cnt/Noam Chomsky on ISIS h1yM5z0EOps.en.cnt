well there at least I mean at least
among these specialists on the topic
people who were on the scene been
following it closely intelligence and so
on there seems to be almost complete
agreement on the answer to the first
question Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states some of them and wealthy people
in the Gulf dictatorships but primarily
Saudi Arabia with direct funding but
more significantly with the missionary
zeal with which Saudi Arabia the most
radical fundamentalist Islamic state in
the world promulgates it's extremist
lobbies Salafi doctrines with funding
with madrasahs you know Quranic schools
mosques radical clerics and just
ideological pronouncements in fact one
of the most expert commentators Patrick
Coburn describes what he calls the
wahhabis ation of Sunni Islam as one of
the most dangerous developments of the
modern era now that's the early stages
when the Saudi Arabian government began
to recognize that Isis is a potential
threat to them they stopped at least
publicly I don't know what they're doing
privately funding and claim to be
against it I mean one of their other
ugly alliances for me
so take Turkey turkey is almost openly
supporting the on this referent Arora
Islam the other which are really not
they're not ideologically different from
Isis their fight fighting turf battles
as to who picks up the pieces but very
similar organizations in fact Turkish
support for illness seems to be so
extreme that there's pretty good
evidence that when the United States
recently infiltrated a couple of dozen
trained people who had been trained by
the United States
to Syria they were quickly attacked and
destroyed by a an inertia attack which
apparently was the details were leaked
through Turkish intelligence so it seems
and there's other very ugly alliances
Cathars playing its own game and so on
but I think the basic source of the book
the funding and the ideology that traces
back to the radical Islamist sources in
in the Gulf primarily Saudi Arabia which
has had a pernicious effect on the whole
region it's not the only source but one
of them another source of Isis which we
should not overlook is the US invasion
of Iraq which did as I mentioned
instigate sectarian conflicts which
hadn't existed before the invasion but
but became extremely serious in Iraq and
her wrecking the country at her now
spread throughout the region they're
tearing at the shreds I mean when you
hit fragile systems with a sledgehammer
unpleasant things can happen well I
don't think Isis is going to expand much
and a little movement around the
periphery but if you look at them
geographically they've spread to what
seemed to be pretty natural boundaries
the Sunni areas where they can gain a
measure of local support and like it or
not they do seem to be gaining a measure
of local support where maybe people
don't like them or even hate them but
still see them as some sort of defense
against other forces or they fear even
more and of course they're attracting
the jihadi elements from around the
world young people who are disillusioned
desperate they want to have some meaning
in their lives all sorts of reasons and
I suspect they've kind of expanded to
pretty much the natural boundaries
whether they'll be beaten back by
foreign attacks and we don't know in
fact it's a very mixed story so taken
Syria and in fact in Iraq
the main forces attacking Isis on the
ground or defending areas from them or
enemies of the United States
it's the Kurdish groups the ypk which is
an ally of the PKK which is an enemy of
the United States when Isis moved to was
beginning to encroach on Iraqi Kurdistan
it was beaten back by PKK and
iranian-backed Shiite militias that's
called in the United States
Iranian destabilization or Iranian
aggression meaning they were protecting
people from Isis and the turkeys attack
in Turkey made a deal with the United
States I mean if the United States
didn't understand what was happening its
stupidity beyond belief I presumably
understood the deal was that the US
would get access to Eastern Turkish air
bases which they want very badly and in
return Turkey would attack Isis however
what Turkey did of course is attack the
Kurds who are the ground force opposing
Isis that's what's going on right now so
what will happen out of this crazy the
other force opposing Isis is the Assad
regime horrible regime but doesn't
change the fact and what can come it's
hard to imagine anything decent emerging
from this the only hope it's a thin hope
is some kind of negotiated settlement in
Syria which would like it or not include
the Assad regime it's just no way for a
negotiation to take place without that
they're not going to say it will commit
suicide so if you want to end it and it
has to be ended just for the sake of
kind of human decency it's destroying
the country the population it must be a
negotiated settlement which in
the Assad murderers which is what they
are in a negotiated settlement that's no
way out of that
