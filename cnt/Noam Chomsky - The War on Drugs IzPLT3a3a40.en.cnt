let's take a look at the war on drugs
right it has been declared probably 20
times in the last 20 years or so every
couple years it's declared its declared
against the background of understanding
for example it was studied years ago by
the RAND Corporation the main government
advisory corporation and the army in
which they investigated the just
straight cost-benefit analysis of
various ways of treating the drug
problem drug problems here it's not in
Colombia so they said well you know
which ways of dealing with the problem
here
are cost-effective and they found that
which will surprise no one who's paid
attention to the history that the most
cost-effective way of doing it is
prevention and treatment okay in fact if
you think about it that's the way one of
the worst drug problems has been handled
I mean there is a drug which is much
worse than cocaine it's called tobacco
it kills far more people than the
cocaine does and it was handled pretty
well by cultural change so if you look
through the 1980s it's a class issue so
people with education and you know
degree of privilege simply adopted a
more healthy lifestyle they stopped
smoking they stopped eating red meat
they didn't drink as much coffee and so
on there were no police you know that
nobody carry out chemical warfare and
North Carolina and Kentucky that
destroyed the back of the field they
said it was simply an educational
process the kind of cultural change that
led to a significant decline of the use
of by far the most dangerous drug among
people who were a part of that cultural
change that took place thanks to their
privilege okay now that's exactly what
the rand on the army a study years ago
they weren't first discussing tobacco
but that's exactly what they concluded
about hard drugs and marijuana they said
the best
the cheapest and most effective way of
dealing with it is prevention and
treatment well in another way
use of police okay that's much less
effective and much more costly there's a
third way interdiction at the borders
that's still more expensive by quite a
large margin and far less of and far
more costly and the worst way of all way
more costly than anything else and
totally ineffective is what we call
fumigation but would in fact this
chemical warfare I've been down to
southern Colombia and seen some of it
this chemical warfare which is driving
huge numbers of peasants off their land
destroying the crops Colombia has the
second biggest refugee problem in the
world after Sudan and they're driven at
the urban slums and multinational
corporations come in and start mining
and so on and so forth that's the least
effective and the most costly and you
know the fact that we do it again if you
could kind of abstract yourself and
pretend you're a Martian looking at this
it's just kind of unimaginable I mean
the number of people in Colombia killed
by us tobacco is way beyond the number
of Americans killed by Colombian cocaine
maybe go to a country like China it's
astronomically more okay do they have a
right to come to the United States and
carry out chemical warfare and North
Carolina and Kentucky because they have
a tobacco problem and it's coming from
here I mean you can't even speak the
words it's so outlandish but we do it we
think it's just fine even though it's
known to be the least effective the most
costly and totally immoral as we see
right away if we think the situation
reversed well that's been going on for
decades
that's the war on drugs the use it has
affected the use of drugs here at all
