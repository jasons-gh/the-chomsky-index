well I think the Arab Spring was one of
the most significant events of
contemporary history did it succeed we
don't really know I think it's a work in
progress it if it take a look at varied
from country to country the first
actually the actually began in Western
Sahara nobody talks about that but they
should that's a country under it's kind
of like Palestine it's under foreign
military occupation violation of
international law was crushed very
quickly by Morocco but the first part of
the Arab Spring that kind of enters
history was shortly after in Tunisia
Tunisia is mainly under French influence
from the external side and the French
tried to crush it they were supporting
the dictator Ben Ali even after well
after the attempt the in fact even after
he'd been expelled they continued to
support him
they failed the it took roots and it's
had moderate success I mean I think his
improvements and it's a positive has
positive implications for the future the
next major case was Egypt the most
important country in the region and
there what happened I think was very
dramatic and quite exciting it's not
just what caught media attention Tahrir
Square that was very important that was
also there's a long background of a
labor movement activism in Egypt crushed
by the regime but significant in fact I
don't have to tell you but April 6th was
named after the participation in a major
strike in the big industrial centers and
that continued and it's had some
consequences which maybe are lasting it
seems to have given a kind of an opening
for the first time to independent unions
there have been continuation of labor
actions a lot of them crushed by force
of course as intended by any means
but that I think continued it opened a
space for discussion which I think is
probably going to have a lasting effect
on the culture in the society the
important external forces in that case
were primarily the United States
secondarily England typically they they
followed the usual procedure there's a
standard procedure when your favorite
dictator gets into trouble it's followed
all the time Somoza and Marcos devised a
long list of cases support him as long
as possible when it becomes impossible
because maybe the Army's turned against
him or the business classes have turned
against him then issue ringing
declarations about your love for
democracy
send your dictator off somewhere in this
case Rommel chef and then try to
reinstitute the same system as much as
you can that happens with such
regularity that it's kind of astonishing
that the intellectual and scholarly
world somehow can't see it and that's
what happened in Egypt there was we'll
go through the details but there was
finally a reaction a military coup it's
driving Egypt into some of its worst
days maybe ever and it's supported by
the United States tepidly like they
don't say we love you but they're
supporting it and if you go to other
countries the major countries from the
from the Western point of view the most
important countries are the
oil-producing dictatorships they are the
first efforts that reform were just
crushed violently there were in Saudi
Arabia the most important that were some
attempts to do what was being done
elsewhere you know things happening
after the Friday prayers the police
response was so overwhelming that people
were afraid to go into the streets in
Riyadh in one country Bahrain it did
make some progress than the suti
Saudi Arabia sent an army in to crush it
mainly out of concern for the
Shia areas in eastern Saudi Arabia where
most of the oil happens to be and they
want to make sure they keep that
repressed and the same elsewhere it just
couldn't get off the ground and the
dictator oil dictatorships Syria the
early steps were met with a vicious
response by the Assad regime which long
after elicited a violent uprising by now
the country is practically destroyed it
may not survive a huge number of the
population is just fleeing in
desperation it's led to a confrontation
between the brutal Assad regime on the
one hand and the murderous jihadi
organizations which are more or less
similar in ideology that they're
fighting turf battles Isis on the
forefront the HAR are no so it's just a
total disaster
well happened out of all of this I think
it's very hard to predict just as nobody
could have predicted the Arab Spring but
my guess is that when the fragments sort
of fall into place
there will be a revival of the forces
that led to the Arab Spring in the first
place and it's not the first time after
all there's been effort after effort in
the Arab and Muslim worlds to move
towards a democracy and development
almost always crushed by external force
a case after case
