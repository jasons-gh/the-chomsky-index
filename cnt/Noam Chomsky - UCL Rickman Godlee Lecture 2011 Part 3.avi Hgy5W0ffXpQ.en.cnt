I knew the heads new head of one of the
subcommittee's on environment he
explained that the global warming cannot
be a problem because God promised Noah
that he wouldn't have another flood so
that takes care of that problem well we
can you know if this was happening in
some small remote country you know we
might laugh but not when it's happening
in the most powerful country in the
world and it's know before we laugh we
might also bear in mind that the current
economic crisis is traceable in no small
measure to a fanatic faith in such
dogmas as the efficient market
hypothesis and in general to what the
Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz tiglah
it's about 15 years ago they've called
the religion that markets know best
given that Dogma it was unnecessary for
the Federal Reserve in central bank or
for the economics profession with
extremely rare exceptions it was
unnecessary to pay attention to the fact
that there was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble which had absolutely no
relation to any economic fundamentals I
was completely off the course of a
hundred years of statistics on this but
you didn't have to notice it because
markets know best so it'll be fine of
course it devastated the economy when it
burst well all of this is fine much more
can proceed as long as the washer
doctrine prevails as long as the general
population is passive apathetic diverted
the consumerism or to hatred of the
vulnerable then the powerful can do as
they like and those who survive can
contemplate the outcome thanks
wonderful service
hi I'm I'm guy I'm a student here at UCL
and i took part last term in the UCL
occupation along with quite a number of
other students like you mentioned the
the attack on public education in this
country in the privatization of
education we're all very happy to
receive a message of support from you
last term which you sent to the
occupying students so I just like to say
thanks for that firstly and secondly I
mean what we're seeing I think is the
kick started by the student movement is
hopefully what's becoming a much more
broad-based movement against austerity
in this country linking up of the trade
unions building to a big demonstration
central London much plenty safe
obviously there's parallels with what's
happening in Wisconsin well as a
economic crisis is being used to sub
carry through a politics of wage
repression and you're seeing a fight
back against that there as well so I
just wanted to ask you what do you think
are the prospects for these are kind of
emergent movements against austerity and
what do you think the lessons that can
be learned from earlier sort of fights
for economic justice well you know in
economic theory there's a name for the
policies that Europe is following
England who namely imposing austerity in
the middle of her session it's called
the Herbert Hoover principle that's
exactly what led to the world depression
it was reinstated again in 1936 under
the advice that business pressure led to
another recession one well-known
economist observed that European leaders
might perhaps be charged with violating
an ethical and in fact a legal principle
namely experimentation with human beings
that cannot be taken without their
consent okay this is an experiment to
see if the kind of policies which have
always been a disaster
past and which are likely to be a
disaster for good reasons again whether
these policies which have humans as
their experimental subjects whether they
should be permitted well that's up to
people who don't believe in the washer
doctrine to respond to as far as
education is concerned I don't really
feel qualified to talk about situation
here you obviously know much more about
it than I do in the United States it's
quite interesting as I think I may have
mentioned in that letter of support that
you brought up about i guess about a
year ago it by accident I happened to be
giving some talks in Mexico at the
National University and I went straight
from there to California to the Bay Area
more talk these are kind of you know
they're not the exact opposites in terms
of the economy California should be the
richest place in the world Mexico is not
the poorest country in the world but
it's a pretty poor country the National
University in Mexico has a couple
hundred thousand students at quite a
high level good facilities engage
students salaries of course are much
lower than the United States credit
functions quite well it's free the ten
years ago there was an attempt by the
government to raise tuition slightly it
was a student strike national student
strike government back down still free
okay that's one of the poorer countries
in the world you go to California one of
the richest places in the world it had
the greatest public education system in
the world it was excellent it's being
systematically destroyed has been going
on since the 1970s very systematically
deliberately for reasons that in fact
had been articulated it has nothing to
do with economic necessity these two
comparisons should suffice to show that
many others like them so it's not an
economic necessity but other reasons
reasons having to do with the vicious
cycle that I described and it's having
its effect next year for the first year
the public universities like a great
university berkeley elk UCLA and so on
they're getting more of their income
from tuition than from the state and in
fact that's true of most of this state
college state universities in the
country massachusetts bay area well
these are deliberate policy choices
designed they are designed essentially
to privatize the major universities so
very likely the stars in the system like
Berkeley and UCLA and maybe San Diego
they'll probably be privatized they're
they're almost like Ivy League
universities today huge tuition big
endowments and so on so they'll probably
be privatized and the rest of the system
will just shrink that was a very good
system and of course that has a dire
effects for the future economy but again
that's an externality in a so far as
market systems apply they do to an
extent you don't consider their
short-term gain is what not it so that's
that's happening all over the country
and the same is happening with the
public schools so there's major pressure
which Obama is contributing to as well
to privatize the public school system
what are called charter schools which
still paid for by the public but they're
out of the public education system
there's plenty of studies of them they
they do roughly as well as comparable
public schools even though they have
many advantages like they don't have to
run the special education programs they
don't have unionized teachers and so on
but no special performance gains and
that's a way of undermining public
education which has a kind of a deep
purpose behind it
it's very much like the effort to
destroy Social Security is a major
efforts been going on for years to try
to destroy the Social Security system so
it's claimed every open the newspaper so
you read the New York Times the
editorials will tell you we've got this
huge deficits album and so we have to
deal with entitlements Social Security
Medicare and Medicaid and not waste our
energy on other things Social Security
contributes zero to the deficit zero it
comes out of payroll taxes okay it's got
first of all and furthermore it's pretty
well funded for decades and demands a
little tinkering good funded forever but
that's got to be killed the Medicare and
Medicaid it's true but the reason for
that is something that they won't
mention it's because of the privatized
healthcare system which is extremely
inefficient the u.s. spends about twice
as much per capita as every other
comparable country on health care and
the outcomes are among the poorest and
if you look at the privatized
unregulated healthcare system you can
see why but you're not allowed to touch
the financial institutions the insurance
companies and so on so that's kind of
like off the agenda if the United States
had health care system comparable to
other industrial countries that not only
will do not be a deficit that actually
gets surplus the about half the deficit
addition to that is military spending
but those things are you know off the
agenda you have to go after Social
Security why social security it's
extremely efficient I'm an
administrative costs are practically
zero but it has a couple of deficiencies
it's no use whatsoever to privileged
people so you get it you know some
billionaire gets another small amount of
money that make any difference can't
even notice it but it's it's assessments
for most of the population especially
those who've been wiped out by the
fiscal catastrophe it doesn't pay that
much but it pays enough to
get you by a papa beyond that it has a
ideological problem which is never
discussed but I think it's quite crucial
actually has to do with that message
from come all of us to the workers of
Wisconsin that I mentioned social
security is based on the principle of
solidarity you're supposed to care if
the disabled Widow across town has it a
foodie and that has to be driven out of
people's heads you're supposed to be
concerned just about yourself same
defect in the public education system
like I don't have kids in school anymore
so if I follow the rules I'm not
supposed to care if there's a public I
don't want to pay taxes for public
education but if you're infected by this
disease of the Solidarity you care if
the kid across the street can go to
school now that's got to be driven out
of people's heads same reason for the
attack on unions so you get these
massive attacks and I think that's
what's happening to the public education
system you know better than I whether
that applies here but I wouldn't be
surprised thank you another question to
set the front
and thanks a lot for your tour professor
you've been a major inspiration for me
so thank you for all your work as well I
did have a question to ask you with
regards to popular resistance in the
Middle East so correct me if I'm wrong
but your position regarding the BDS
movement is one of ambivalence or I
think you actually oppose certain
aspects of it and if I'm correct that's
on the grounds that you feel that if we
should be applying that standard to
Israel we should be applying it to
American goods as well and it appears to
me that you know there's a question of
feasibility that surely comes into play
here I think it's feasible to boycott
Israeli goods but you know life would be
practically unimaginable without
American goods and so I'd like to know
in your opinion how how you balance that
aspect when you're making the BDS
movement and ok some of you aren't
turned in as the boycott divestment
sanctions movement about Israel okay
there is a story that circulates which
is what you repeated that I'm opposed to
it and that's kind of understand that's
an interesting it's interesting fact
about the popular movements we kind of
live in a Twitter generation where
anything that goes beyond 180 characters
it doesn't exist and can't be understood
literally actually I was involved in the
BDS movement before it even crystallized
10 years ago about five minutes before
it started I think it's extremely
important I've always supported it I
always advocated I still do but NE tak
it's a tactic it's not a principle and
if you're serious about choice of
tactics you ask a couple of questions
the one question you ask is what's the
effect on the victims it's not the only
question but you certainly have to ask
at least that well in some cases the
choice of tactics is helpful to the
victims for example if the EU which is a
major importer of goods from the
settlements if the EU were to stop
importing goods from these early
settlements which
illegal uncontroversial e if it intense
participating an illegal act they would
do that be good for the victims
similarly if they would follow the
advice of Amnesty International and
declare an arms embargo in Israel that'd
be good for the victims even more so for
the United States so these are fine
tactics on the other hand suppose that
you say I'm going to boycott Tel Aviv
University well there's an obvious
response that's going to come to that
lunch boycott Harvard Harvard it a much
worse record than Tel Aviv University
and that's going to be the immediate
response and it's unanswerable you know
it's basically correct and the effect is
that you're giving a gift to hardliners
that's harmful to the victims you don't
pick your tactics in such a way that
it's going to be a gift to the most
hardline advocates of repression and
violence that should be automatic and
you know these are debates that go on
and activist movements all the time
let's go back to say the 1960s in most
of you aren't enough old enough to
remember but some of you are in the
united states in the activist movements
in the United States in the late sixties
there were groups like the famous
weather men who decided that the way to
express their opposition to the war was
to go out and break windows and the beat
people up and so on and so forth the
Vietnamese were very strongly opposed to
that what they advised all the time is
to carry out nonviolent tactics in fact
what they favored and they said so with
things like you know women standing
quietly in front of a graves of American
soldiers that's what they wanted now
those are tactics that help but they
don't make you feel good it makes you
feel good apparently if you can go out
and break windows of banks
but as far as the victims are concerned
that's just harmful all it does is build
up support for the war which is exactly
what it did so and those questions our
eyes constantly you have to distinguish
feel good tactics from do good tactics
if you can make that distinction don't
even pretend to be involved in
solidarity movements I mean that's kind
of the minimum you know then come other
questions and I think those questions
arise in the BDS movement to unless if
you you know they're kind of suppressed
in a slogan based system in which you
have a catechism and you repeat it but
if you think about the matter those
questions are always going to arise
anywhere what whatever tactical choices
you offended you could have debates
about what the consequences are but at
least you have to recognize that those
issues arise and I think that's critical
in this case we have time for a couple
more questions they lady that the fact
yes you hello sorry I'm a bit nervous as
you mentioned the nuclear weapons-free
zone as well as the kind of the
situation with the military bases in
Diego Garcia but obviously here in the
UK and in the United States the arms
companies defense industry is very
closely linked to defense ministries and
I guess my question is in light of this
week Henry Kissinger saying that
deterrence is a useless system obviously
apart from the United States maintaining
their nuclear weapons until everyone
else gets rid of those I guess in light
of Kissinger who is a very strong voice
for previously for military kind of
intervention him saying deterrence is a
useless system how does that fit with
say the US or potentially the UK
adhering to their NPT commitments and
potentially diminishing the link between
the military and
defense industries well Kissinger is one
of several political leaders and George
Schultz the former secretary state under
Reagan Sam Nunn who in Congress has been
a conservative congressman Beasley is
now out of Congress he was the leader
and one of the leaders in trying to
restrict nuclear weapons proliferation
the three of them and somebody also
forgot who have come up with this
repeatedly with statement saying that we
should think seriously about honoring
our own NPT obligations the
non-proliferation treaty obligates
signers of the five nuclear powers who
signed it to carry out good faith
efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons
entirely that's article 6 and this group
visuals Kissinger and others who said
look we got to think about that
seriously I don't think that the issue
for them is deterrence the issue is
elementary rationality they understand
something which we all should understand
as long as nuclear weapons exist the
chances of survival of the human species
are quite slight and there have been
repeated occasions over and over again
when we've come very close to nuclear
war in fact we have Declassified us
records the Russian systems are
obviously much worse so whatever is true
of us gotta be worse for them but there
are literally dozens of occasions when
automated the nuclear weapons are on
automated response systems so you know
automated systems detect something going
on somewhere the computers calculate and
you get an order fire the weapons there
are literally dozens of cases where it
came up to within a couple of minutes of
sending off nuclear missiles it was
aborted by human intervention ok that's
the US side Russian side undoubtedly is
a lot worse because they don't have
systems are no good and so on well you
know that's just playing with fire
sooner or later there's not trying to be
a human intervention furthermore there
are explicit cases where we've come
literally within instance of this
instance of nuclear war on the most
extreme case which would really be
studied carefully is 1962 the missile
crisis that's been intensively
investigated now for one reason because
the people involved like Robert McNamara
and others who recognized how crazy it
was Arthur Schlesinger was in the
government and called it the most
dangerous moment in human history there
was actually a moment there when one
Russian submarine commander prevented
what could have been a nuclear war at
one point in the missile crisis Kennedy
had established an embargo of Cuba no
ships could come within a certain
distance and Russian ships were
approaching that line there were also a
turn that we knew it at the time but
there were Russian submarines there
which had nuclear-tipped missiles they
were attacked by us destroyers depth
charges and the commanders of the
submarines who had authority to fire
nuclear missiles same is true of us
systems they they thought a word started
there were three commanders two of them
decided to send off the missiles okay
the third possibly arkhipov who should
get 20 Nobel Peace Prizes he he rejected
the order and they had to have all three
agreeing that in fire I'm as they'd
fired these are not nuclear you know big
huge nuclear weapons but if they'd fired
nuclear-tipped missiles the u.s.
reaction we know from the internal plans
with you know they do something like
that we take out Moscow
take out London there goes on from that
you should read the studies that we know
what they were came that close there was
another moment in the missile crisis
which amazingly is described it as one
of john f kennedy's great achievements I
mean my tea was one of the worst crimes
in human history what happened the facts
are known and not debated at a peak
moment of the missile crisis you know
just coming to its peak her chef's a
red-letter to kennedy in which he
offered a way to end it the offer was
that russia would remove the missiles
from Cuba and in return the United
States would remove missiles and turkey
now the missiles in Turkey are much more
of a threat to Russia than the missiles
in Cuba worked the United States but
that's the usual symmetry we're allowed
to do things that others can't do now
Kennedy was kind of surprised when he
got that letter because he had already
given an order to withdraw them to the
missiles from Turkey because they were
obsolete they were being replaced by
much more destructive polaris submarines
in the Mediterranean so he pointed out
the internal discussion this is going to
be a hard offer refused you know it's
not going to sell in Peoria who it put
but he decided to refuse it I think just
to preserve the macho image and to show
that we run things so in fact they did
withdraw the missiles from Turkey but
secretly that was part of the process of
humiliating Kershaw and to reach that
goal he was willing to face what he
himself considered a probability about
one-third of nuclear war I mean these
are what goes on these are things that
go on in the minds of you know the
the brightest as they call themselves
just think of the rest well Kissinger
Schultz and others have been right in
the middle of this and they know that
we're on the verge of catastrophe so
they're saying look we got to do
something to get rid of this destructive
capacity this really doesn't have to do
with deterrence so much I mean as far as
deterrence is concerned there are
interesting discussion that one of the
most interesting is a very important
book written by one of Israel's leading
strategic analysts my name is Emma owes
its in English that's I think it's
called defending the Holy Land he goes
through it's about you know a thousand
pages of detailed analysis of Israel's
strategic objective since nineteen forty
eight he's very judicious he gives the
arguments on both sides it's carefully
knows what's talking about his basic
conclusion is that Israel's policies
have been selected in ways which harm at
security actually that's not unusual
that's true of the policies of most
states including written in the United
States so if you bother to look at the
chilcot englert inquiry you'll have
noticed that the head of British
intelligence testified that when they
decided to go to war against Iraq it was
on the assumption that it would sharply
increase tech the terrorist risk to
Britain and she points out that CIA had
the same assumption okay we already sort
of knew that from other sources but this
is the highest level confirmation and
that's correct and they decided to go
ahead anyway and the reason is the
security of the people of Britain in the
United States is not a high priority for
Flanders it's a low priority plenty of
evidence that other countries are
similar well in case of Israel that's
his conclusion when he gets to nuclear
he has chapter on nuclear weapons which
is worth reading and he argues I think
pretty judiciously and convincingly that
Israel's nuclear weapons program has
harm
security gives a good argument and if
security with the top concern i think
that argument would be taken seriously
it's that kind of consideration that
disinterred the others have in mind you
know kids enjoyed these especially these
guys have worked all their lives on
deterrence theory and they understand
that this does not contribute to
security and in fact it does contribute
very likely to long-term maybe not so
long term destruction incidentally not
so long term if you take a look at
WikiLeaks and most of it doesn't tell
you much but there are things that do
tell you some interesting things but
some of the most important I have to do
with Pakistan the American ambassador in
Pakistan ambassador Patterson as she was
regularly warning Washington that us
actions in Afghanistan which instantly
approved though that she was warning
them that these actions are having a
dangerous effect in Pakistan they're
contributing to the possible fracture of
Pakistan and it's radicalization I have
to reason is that you know like drone it
after at public opinion Pakistan is
overwhelmingly hostile to the United
States the military doesn't like what
we're doing they're being humiliated you
know when they're when the u.s. urges
them to attack the tribal areas that's
interfering with their prerogatives and
they don't like it they know it's not
the thing to do the drone attacks are
the same what she was arguing is that
there's morning Washington the cables
that these actions in Afghanistan and
Pakistan are threatening the stability
of Pakistan now Pakistan is a very
dangerous country most dangerous place
in the world that Pakistan has a huge
nuclear weapon system which is expanding
rapidly expanding more rapidly than any
other country in the world it's it has a
radical Islamic element which isn't a
majority but it's real you know if you
remember when us asanka seer was
assassinated a couple of months ago for
you know objecting to the blasphemy laws
there was strong support for the
assassins and it wasn't just from the
younger tribes it was a few in the
pictures in the newspaper showed
black-suited lawyers young lawyers
demonstrating in support of the
assassins this is the same lawyers who
were demonstrating to overthrow the
Musharraf dictatorship they're the
reformist but they were demonstrating in
support of the assassin all right these
are all consequences of actions that
were taken in the Reagan administration
with 22 clear consequences one was to
allow Pacus to help Pakistan develop
nuclear weapons Reagan was supporting
geohawk the most awful of the series of
awful Crusaders in Pakistan and the u.s.
pretended they didn't know that he was
developing nuclear weapons they could
keep supporting it of course it was the
other was radical Islam ization with the
Saudi funding Isaiah was carrying out a
program of changes in the educational
system where his famous madrasas in
which people only studied the Quran
become job that was all going on from
the 80s its extended its now had a big
effect so you now have a situation with
a radical Islamist movement nuclear
weapons you're provoking the military
the only stable force in the region
which might crack punjabi mostly a lot
of problems and it might she warns lead
to fissile materials leaking into the
hands of jihadi those are our actions in
Afghanistan okay there's actually an
interesting article by just came out a
couple of weeks ago and journal the
national interest kind of conservative
national affairs journal in the US by
anatoly gave and
is one of the specialists on Pakistan
maybe she goes through a lot of this and
his conclusion is that the US and
British soldiers are dying in
Afghanistan to make the world more
dangerous for the United States and
Britain well if you think it through
that's probably what's happening so yeah
that's right in front of our eyes of
going on right now US and Britain earn
continuing are contributing to it and
it's not unusual I'm as a striking fact
if you look over history that state
actions are often taken with the
understanding that they may very well
harm security you take a look at the
history of wars those who started the
war is very often losing or with
disastrous consequences and the you know
it's taken into account because their
higher priority and I think that's kind
of thing that this group you're talking
about has in mind and I think basically
the right and we should take it
seriously well I think on that note
sober and sobering as it was we must end
this evening I've invite you all to
retire to the Jeremy Bentham room in the
main part of college for some
refreshments if to lighten one spirits
and also to digest some of the
profundity that we've heard this evening
but I would also like you all to thank
me thank professor Chomsky again
you
