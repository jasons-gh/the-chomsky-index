each of you your thoughts on the BDS
movement the boycott divest sanctions
movement
well the BDS is a set of tactics right
these are tactics that you employed when
you think they're going to be effective
and in ways that you think will be
effective tactics are not principles
they're not actions that you undertake
no matter what because you think they're
right tactics are undertaken if you're
serious because you think they're going
to help the victims that's how you
adjust your tactics not because I think
they're right in principle but because I
think they will be beneficial that
oughta be second nature to activists
also second nature should be a crucial
distinction between proposing and
advocating I can propose now that we
should all live in peace and love each
other I just proposed it it's not a
serious proposal it becomes a serious
proposal when it is becomes advocacy it
is given I sketch out a path for getting
from here to there then it becomes
serious otherwise it's empty words
that's crucial and related to this well
when you took it take a look at the BDS
movement which is separate incidentally
from BDS tactics let me make that clear
so when the European Union issued its
directive or when the that I mentioned
or when say the Gates Foundation
withdraws investment ins if security
operations that are being carried out
not only in the occupied territories but
elsewhere that's very important but
that's not the BDS movement that's BDS
tactics actually BD tactics
we've got divestment tactics that's
important the BDS movement itself has
been an impetus to these developments
and in many ways a positive one but I
think it has failed and should reflect
on its so far unwillingness to face what
are crucial questions for activists
what's going to help the victims and
what's gonna harm them what is a
proposal and what is real advocacy you
have to think that through and it hasn't
been sufficiently done so if you take a
look at the principles of the VDS
movement they're three they vary
slightly in wording but basically three
one is actions should be directed
against the occupation that has been
extremely successful in many ways and it
makes sense
it also helps educate the Western
populations who are being appealed to to
participate enables so it's an opening
to discuss investigate organize about
the participation in the occupation it's
very successful a second principle is
that BDS actions should be continued
until Israel allows the refugees to
return that has had no success and to
the extent that it's been tried it's
been negative it just leads to a
backlash no basis has been laid for it
among the population it is simply
interpreted as saying oh you want to
destroy the State of Israel we're not
going to destroy a state you cannot
undertake actions which you think are
principled when the work real in the
real world they're going to have a
harmful effect on the victims there's a
third category having to do with civil
rights within is
and there are things that could be done
here one of the ones I mentioned in fact
the tax-free status for us organisations
that are engaged in civil rights via and
rights violations and remember a tax
exemption means I pay for it that's what
a tax exemption is well that's an action
could be undertaken others that have
been undertaken have had a backlashes
which are harmful and I won't run
through the record but these are the
kinds of questions that always have to
be asked when you're involved in serious
activism
if you care about the victims not just
feeling good but caring about the
victims that's critically important
