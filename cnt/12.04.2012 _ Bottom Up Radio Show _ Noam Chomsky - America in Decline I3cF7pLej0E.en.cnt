and welcome to the Rob call bottom up
radio shows of the edge ad 1350 a and
out of Washington Township reaching
metro Philly and my guest tonight is
when I'm very excited to have back he's
a world renown political activist a
linguist a cognitive scientist the
philosopher author the MIT professor
emeritus know'm Chomsky welcome to the
show
good to be with you now we met list
earlier this month in Princeton you were
speaking with Amy Goodman at the
Coalition for peace event and I wanted
to start off asking you about one thing
we talked about you compared objectivity
versus reality when you go into that a
bit well I was using the term
objectivity with a touch of irony there
is a concept of objectivity that's
taught in journalism schools and that
editors and journalists subscribe to and
they say so you know objectivity means
reporting accurately what's going on
inside the beltway you know within power
circles and if you report that
accurately then your objective if you
discuss it or critically analyze it
that's subjective if you talk about
things that aren't discussed within the
Beltway
that's biased and subjective it's a in
fact it came up pretty recently there
was a little item you know lead the
group called fairness and accuracy in
media affair that they have a journal
called extra which to journal critical
media analysis that interesting little
clip there where they quoted the the
editor of the managing editor some I
figure in one of the main journals with
Washington Post
York Times who is criticizing a writer
reporter because the writer had went had
reported this speech of famous speech of
Paul Ryan's which was just full of the
most outrageous fabrications and she
commented on the fabrications and
corrected them his point was no that's
not what you're supposed to you're just
supposed to report it objectively and
then they also quoted one of the main
reporters for the New York Times Ethan
Brunner who agreed young as our job to
be objective
so don't critically analyze what is said
that's four columnist and don't report
things that aren't discussed and there's
plenty that isn't discussed because it's
outside the south side the accepted
framework of dominant doctrines so
that's the technique of objectivity is a
it's a mode of censorship but of molding
of the world so that it looks the way
it's supposed to from the perspective of
the powerful the reality is what's
actually happening out there and
objectivity and reality can be quite
different and that really brings us to
this whole challenge of the disdain of
the media today what potato and where
the media is now and where it could be
well there's plenty to criticize about
the media but my own view is they're
probably better than they were 40 or 50
years ago in this regard the media like
the rest of the country were influenced
by the activism of the 1960s which had
quite a significant role than just
civilizing the country on lots of issues
and that's had enough first a lot of the
people in the media now say report
and others have lived through those
experiences but it just also just
generally changed the tenor of
discussion of things there's been a big
regression on a reaction against it but
nevertheless it made significant and
lasting changes and that means that
things are discussed now that were kind
of off the spectrum years ago so in some
respects I think the media Vakili
improved but the major issues remain one
of them is what we just were discussing
there's a strong tendency in fact an
overwhelming one even an ideology about
keeping to the kinds of things that are
discussed and debated within systems of
power and marginalizing things that are
outside that's very significant
in fact it both in domestic and
international politics
so take domestic affairs you've read
this morning's newspaper of lead story
in The New York Times about how
difficult it's going to be to cut
entitlements because people which has to
be done to deal with the deficit because
people are just resisting it well you
know there's so there's there are things
to be said about that which aren't
discussed within the Beltway for one
thing for quite a long time and by large
margins of the population the general
population is pretty much across the
board all the way over to Tea Party
people I think that the biggest problem
that we face is a lack of jobs that
that's much more important than the
deficit and in fact I think they're
right I mean even the business brisk
agrees with that plenty of economists do
but the banks and financial institutions
investors they are interested in the
deficit so therefore that's the focus of
attention almost all the discussion
inside the beltway metaphorically is
about the deficit we got to do something
about the deficit although in fact I
think the population is right
is a relatively minor problem
furthermore if you're concerned about
the deficit you can also turn the public
opinion and ask what people think about
it well that opinions for example
they're well studied you know the
majority think we ought to cut military
spending
we should sharply raise taxes on the
rich who are very much under taxed we
should not touch and on so called
entitlements Medicare and Social
Security in fact strengthen them and
that's those are ways to deal with the
deficit that's only the opposite of
what's being discussed and proposed and
in fact there's a further point which
people don't discuss probably because
they don't know the facts but the the
deficits such as it is could be overcome
if we move to a rational healthcare
system the US healthcare system is an
international scandal it's about twice
the per capita costs of comparable
countries and relatively poor outcomes
and the reason traces mostly to the fact
not entirely but mostly to the fact that
it's largely privatized and pretty much
unregulated and that leads to a huge
administrative expenses expenses on
other non-health other non health
expenses like advertising profits and so
on leads to cherry-picking all kinds of
things so it's a it's a highly
inefficient system and it's been pretty
good evidence and good economist have
worked on this especially Dean Baker
that if we move to just the kind of
health care system that other industrial
countries have it would wipe out the
deficit now that's not discussed and it
said what is being discussed is ways to
make our ways to make the system worse
so for example one of the proposals
about cutting down healthcare costs is
to raise
the eligibility age for Medicare say two
couple years well what does that do that
shifts people from a fairly efficient
government-run program Medicare to a
highly inefficient private program much
more expensive namely private insurance
so that's a way of making the problem
worse of course it makes it look a
little better from the point of view of
the power system because it shifts the
cost from from government to individuals
individuals still paying paying more
just themselves but the total healthcare
expenses go up not these things just
aren't discussed you don't read about
them in the media because they're not
discussed within the beltway and they're
opposed by major centers of power I mean
for example for for a long time there's
been strong popular support often
majority support large majority support
for some kind of national health care
system but when that's ever discussed it
was called the politically impossible or
something like that
meaning the big financial institutions
don't like it well you know that's on
domestic issues the major domestic
issues on international affairs are the
same lots of critical things either are
not discussed or discussed with such a
distorted through such a distorting lens
that you just can't get a realistic
picture of it well these are that's this
is part of almost the institutional
structure of the media we have a media
and a government and a political system
that has become corporatized what to do
it's more of a duopoly then separate
different parties anymore and there are
a lot of people who say that we're
almost humanity is facing a looming
collapse it is the Atlantic interview
that you did with yard and cats
you talked about was it an Atlantic
Anozie it was with Amy Goodman you
talked about how intelligent could be
lethal and I wonder do you see a way out
you see a future for our economics that
goes beyond the corporatist system that
we have now in any kind of an economy
whether it's capitalism or something
else that has light at the end of the
tunnel for the middle class for humanity
even we brought up the question the
issue of intelligence being legal in
terms of global warming and how all
these different leaders are going making
things worse rather than better
well Isis I don't recall the exact
discussion but if I was talking about
intelligence being a lethal property it
was probably in the context of her smile
aspire your smile yeah well I was just
giving a kind of slightly
tongue-in-cheek rendition of a
discussion of his he's it you know maybe
the grand old man of modern American
biology very important biologist I had
an interesting article one in which he
pointed out that in terms of biological
success biological success essentially
means how many of how many are there
around you know in terms of biological
success he said the successful organisms
are the least intelligent ones that
mutate rapidly like bacteria or ones
that have fixed ecological niches like
beetles
they all do fine and as you move up the
scale of what we call intelligence you
know two mammals the bigger mammals two
primates and so on planet you find less
by if I'm less biological success and he
concluded that you could looking at as a
biologist you could argue that
intelligence is a lethal characteristic
and then I added to that
that the organisms that's considered the
peak of intelligence namely us is now
engaged in the process of destroying
itself and destroying everything else
along with it which would give the final
touch to the theory and that's what
we're doing I think I was referring
specifically to environmental
catastrophe we don't have to do it but
we are doing it and it's not because
we're intelligent it's because we have
developed institutional structures which
kind of drive us in that direction so it
takes a market systems and we don't
really have market systems but but we
have partially market systems and in a
market a market system has a built-in
doomsday machine inside it in a market
system you don't pay attention to what
are called externalities so for example
effects on others so like if you sell me
a car let's say we if we're paying
attention we'll make a good deal for
ourselves you know you and I all both
come out okay but we don't bring into
the calculation the effect of that sale
on other people and there's an effect
there's another car on the road there's
more pollution there's more congestion
there's a greater chance of accidents
and so on and magnified over a lot of
people that can be a big effect well
that's that's inherent in the nature of
Marsh market systems unless they somehow
internalize externalities in which is it
not really market systems now when you
get to the that that's just an
individual transaction but you think
about it in terms of bigger institutions
like say banks and investment firms say
goldman sachs when they make a
transaction say a risky loan or
something like that they take into
account the effects on them will the
profits overcome the risk and so on but
they don't take into account what's
called
risk that is the chance that if the loan
goes bad and they're in trouble the
whole system may crash they don't take
that into account that's not part of the
calculation well that's a significant
part of what lies behind the the regular
financial crashes increasingly severe
ever since deregulation set in now if
you go a step higher than that and your
say you know the CEO of some Exxon Mobil
or something your job is to maximize
profit and market share you don't take
into account the fact that there's an
externality the fate of the species
you just don't calculate that in and
that's true for non energy corporations
to trying to maximize profit you don't
take into account the impact on the fate
of the species and that's no joke now
we're reaching a point in human
existence where the fate of the species
is indeed in danger and one major reason
for it is just that the it's not a
calculation that's made within market
systems well again we don't really have
we we don't have qualified market
systems but to the extent that they
function this is a built-in doomsday
machine
there may you're talking about economics
really now in your interview with yard
and tax in the Atlantic you talked about
how it whatever the science you need to
learn the fundamental science that's
going to be applicable whatever comes
along next you talk about that with
engineering reading physics with
medicine reading biology what do you
think the state of economics is because
this is that really the science that
marketing is based upon well economics
is not like physics and biology
I mean economics is you know it's an
interesting field an economist do a lot
of interesting things but to a
significant extent economic theory is
studying abstract systems that have only
a limited
- what goes on in the world that's one
reason why overwhelmingly a professional
economists didn't notice or didn't think
it was important that we're entering
into a huge housing bubble I mean does
you know through through the last ten
years until it crashed till first
housing prices were going way beyond any
basis in economic fundamentals but the
economists were so captivated by
concepts like efficient market
hypothesis and so on that they didn't
think was important regime notice it
well you know that's a dramatic and then
the whole thing crashed and in fact a
lot of the foundations of economic
theory crashed but it that's a
reflection to the fact that though the
fields are not denigrating the feels a
lot of important work nevertheless
there's respects in which they're quite
far from science many respect which is
not surprising economic systems are a
lot more complex than you know big
molecules and you've talked about
complex complexity and systems you talk
about how if you're really going to
study anything you've got to look at how
systems are highly modular and that the
different parts function differently yet
you also talk and I'll quote you
unification is kind of an intuitive
ideal part of the scientific mystique if
you like it's it's that you're trying to
find a unified theory of the world now
maybe there isn't one maybe different
parks work in different ways but your
assumption is until I'm proven wrong
definitely Paulo sitting with is a
unified account of the world that's my
test to try to find it and it seems what
you're describing in in the problems
with markets where all these levels
leave out the big effects on the whole
system that it is a unified theory that
needs to be addressed let me just make a
comment that this is the passages you're
quoting or about the hard sciences there
about basic physics and chemistry and
maybe biology and it's there that the
problems of unification that I was
discussing arise when you move up to
social systems market systems and others
it's so complex and there are so many
variables and so little is understood
that you can barely raise these
questions but isn't that the long ones
that be the long term vision you know
let's frankly dr. Chomsky I see you as a
big thinker as well as somebody who
knows the minutiae so I'm asking you
questions that are big questions really
because it seems to me like it applies
well you cannot the kinds of questions
that were being discussed in the passage
you quoted about unification it really
had to do with things like how early
20th century chemistry related to
quantum theory now that's way beyond
anything we can discuss in the case of
social social systems in human life we
might hope that someday we'll understand
enough about really really complex
issues to be able to raise these
questions but it's it doesn't make a lot
of sense to raise them now I mean take
even you quoted my saying that say
engineers should be studying basic
physics but remember the context of that
comment I was pointing out changes that
have taken place in the 20th century in
my lifetime in fact even during my
professional career I was pointing out
that when MIT is vermeer you know
engineering law science school in the
world maybe or certainly one of them
when I got here in the 1950s there were
a very advanced whant physics and math
departments really good ones but they
were essentially providing services to
the engineers given teaching them tricks
they could use engineers were still at
that time
the 1950s the engineering profession was
very largely based on craftsmanship an
artisans knowledge skill experience you
know the kind of thing that makes a good
carpenter so as soon as we're learning
how to build things make them and so on
using that kind of background now by the
1960s ten years later the curriculum had
significantly changed and instead of
studying you know hyah
build circuits or build a bridge or
something like that students in just
about every engineering in every
engineering department we're studying
basic physics and basic chemistry and
there were several reasons for that one
reason was that there were major
advances in science and technology
during that period and in fact one
effect was that if you wanted to do
serious engineering you'd better
understand basic physics because it was
now becoming directly applicable and
also a technology was beginning to
change very quickly so being trained in
the technology of today may not be of
much help ten years from now with it so
it's best to understand the basic
science that lies behind it you'll be
equipped to deal with the changes but
that's a very recent change that's the
that's a couple of decades ago and this
is in the most advanced disciplines
pretty much the same was true of
medicine and for what level do you think
economics and marketing or at compare to
not even imagine you walk or I mean you
talk about even freaking particle oh
look it's not a criticism the reason why
physics and chemistry make significant
progress is that they're dealing with
artificially simple systems the physics
makes huge progress because it really
isn't dealing with what's going on in
the outside world like physicists don't
take
videotapes of what's happening in the
outside world and try to construct
physics from it it's concerned with
extremely simple systems understood
within the highly abstract context of
sophisticated experiments and doing that
you can make really perform a great
enormous progress tremendous
intellectual achievements but if a
physicist gets to say a molecule that's
too complicated they hand it over to
chemists and it becomes too complicated
for the chemists that they hand it over
to the biologists that is too
complicated to them they hand it over to
the young historians or sociologists as
you move up to and of course as you move
to higher and higher levels of
complexity you quite naturally get less
and less fundamental understanding
that's almost automatic so it's not that
a deep understanding is inconceivable
it's just going to be a lot harder and
when we talk about the those issues of
unification that I was that you were
quoting in connection with the sciences
or the shift from teaching engineering
to teaching basic science remember
that's very recent after literally
thousands of years of intensive study
and progress and you know you mentioned
in that same article and frankly I
really that article grabbed me because
it my first encounter with you was back
in the early 70s as a psychology major
reading about psycho linguist and and so
I think of you not just as an activist
but of course as a science isn't you
mentioned in that article at some point
and I quote at some point in human
evolution and it's apparently pretty
recent given the archaeological record
maybe the last hundred thousand years it
can cook a computational system emerged
which had new properties that other
organisms didn't have it has kind of
Aris medical type properties now you
were talking about language acquisition
skills there I think yeah right
and there are put go ahead sorry just to
wrap up the question others have written
about how each small changes in language
like the bigot instead of writing or the
beginning of the Gutenberg press has had
I've had like people like Leonard Shlain
and Walter on the day this word held
these changes have had major effects on
how people function hours from our
culture I'm just curious where the now
we have the internet and it's massively
changing things I really think that had
a big effect one you Occupy Wall Street
than a phenomenon and I'm asking it you
know so we go from a hundred thousand
years ago the era the computational
system emerges and arithmetic arraign
properties and language and writing and
now we have the internet and where do
you see us all moving with this as human
growth tell ourselves with our
intelligence well I think we have to be
careful not to mix apples and oranges
the emergence of language and with it
apparently other properties of
cognitively modern humans us basically
that's probably within could be maybe
roughly around seventy five thousand
years ago plus or minus some but there
hasn't been a change incident
we're the same humans we were then in
fact we know pretty well with high
confidence that for at least roughly
fifty thousand years there's been no
evolution no detectable evolution of
human cognitive capacities the way we
know this is quite straightforward if
you take a an infant from a tribe in the
Amazon which hasn't had the contact
which has been isolated from other
humans for you know ten thousand years
or whatever and you bring that infant to
say in New York City it'll be just like
kid growing up in New York it'll speak
the same way it'll you know go to MIT
and study quantum theory and so on and
conversely you take an infant from New
York and put them in that tribe in the
Amazon it'll be like the other children
there well that tells us that they have
essentially the same cognitive
capacities now there are individual
differences not very large but some in
cognitive capacities and of course
there's pathology at the extremes but
there really no non group differences
and for that we learned that evolution
of human language and other as far as we
know other cognitive capacities just has
hasn't been hasn't taken place or at
least that most is you know very
marginal for at least 50,000 years since
the humans began to leave Africa maybe
seventy-five thousand years I mean the
numbers are kind of indefinite but
something on that order so yes something
apparently quite sudden happened from an
evolutionary point of view roughly in
the fifty to a hundred thousand year
time window you know you can double the
numbers if you like nothing changes from
an evolutionary point of view that's the
flick of an eye
so something sudden happened it led to
cognitively modern humans and they
really haven't changed since then now
the other things you're talking about
don't involve evolutionary change it was
gang go change in the in the genes you
know no changing of the way our brains
are organized in any significant way the
but they are changes and there are big
ones like the Internet is undoubtedly a
big change but the fact of the matter is
that the invention of the printing press
it was a much bigger change or it takes
a speed of communication
I mean communication is much faster now
than it was eight ten years ago but the
shifts in the last generation are very
slight as compared to the shifts a
century earlier on the shift say from
sailing ships to Telegraph
was dramatically greater than the shift
from you know telephones to iPads or
whatever they are or to the Internet
I mean shift from the sailing-ship to
the Telegraph meant that instead of a
letter to England the waiting maybe two
months for an answer
it could be almost instantaneous they
should the development of the printing
press had a huge effect on human life I
think greater than the current ones so
these changes that are taking place are
significant and you're right about the
Internet and the Occupy movement in fact
our activist movements it constantly is
the internet for organizing these are
all important developments and the same
with the kinds of things that Walter Ong
and others are talking about but they
are not changes in human capacity
they're not evolutionary changes they're
quite different than the whatever was
that took place that led to cognitively
modern humans humans with human language
and other cognitive capacities along the
same lines I've been wrestling with the
idea of civilization itself there are a
couple people who are saying that
civilization is unsustainable the way it
is and I believe that we're
transitioning from a world that is what
civilization created that is
hierarchical and top-down and
centralized to a more bottom-up
decentralized world and it seems to me
that that started with the onset of
Agriculture when humans transitioned
from being hunter-gatherers to becoming
farmers domesticate errs of animals and
then the builders of cities and what
became civilization it seems to me like
the way it's evolved to now where
civilization has become a corporate
estate we don't have a great-looking
future what you have any ideas about
this transition of humans from
hunter-gatherer forager to civilization
and where we are now in civilization
well you know only 95 percent
human history is hunter/gatherer the
Agricultural Revolution was very recent
roughly 10,000 years ago the formation
of city-states came a couple thousand
years later and the corporatization that
you're talking about is last century or
so so almost all of him in history is
hunter-gatherers and those societies
many of which still exist around the
world tend to be a relatively
egalitarian and I mean they're there
plenty of complexity to them but they
don't have the kinds of hierarchies and
authoritarianism and centralization that
took place with the development of
cities wasn't true in those days there's
some debate about this among
anthropologists but I think the weight
of evidence shows that the just war in
the modern sense developed pretty much
with city-states hunter-gather sighs you
know they might have some fighting
there's nothing like war contrary to a
lot of stuff in the literature there's
pretty good evidence and there's the and
now where when you talk about our
corporate society you're talking about
advanced Western societies that's not
most of the world maybe they're moving
that direction maybe not but and and it
it has a self-destructive features in it
some of which we've discussed can they
be overcome and replaced by more
cooperative systems based on a
democratic participation a mutual
support and so on and that's possible in
fact if I agree with you that's what we
should be working for but you just can't
predict how far it will go these are
things these are matters for action not
the first speculation and there are some
out of it yes now in your interview with
Amy Goodman
America in decline you talked about
America being in decline and then you
get into the idea of how one of the main
things America has done is blocked
democracy in developing states and
nations the Vietnam will you say the
Vietnam War was fought primarily to
ensure that an independent Vietnam would
not develop successfully to become a
model for other countries in the kings
of any region and then you talk about
how in the last ten years South American
countries have begun to develop
independence and in a degree of
integration and the Arab Spring is
another such a threat you said that
trends to take that big region out of
the Grand Arena this is a lot more
significant than Southeast Asia or South
America and that so far the Arab who
said so far the Arab Spring has been
pretty well contained and he said this
and I quote we managed to ensure that
the threat of democracy would be smashed
in the most important place in Egypt the
United States followed a standard
operating procedure when one of your
favorite dictators gets into trouble
that's really interesting the US has a
standing operated rating procedure when
one of the dictators gets in trouble
could you describe that all right second
so many times it takes real effort not
to see it so let's take say suppose just
Mauricio Somoza and Nicaragua now in the
car that was a Carter Administration
they support it which is you know maybe
the most human rights or an
administration they supported motive
right to the end after he had killed his
troops were had literally killed maybe
40,000 people u.s. continue to support
him when the business world turned
against him so and it was going to be
impossible to support him any longer the
Carter Administration tried to rescue
the remnants of the regime even rescue
the hated National Guard and moved them
elsewhere and then try to reconstitute
them and then Reagan came along we
you reconstitute was a forced overthrow
the new government that Somoza couple
years later
Duvalier and Haiti another favorite
dictator came under internal threat
again the u.s. supported him was Reagan
out to the bitter end
finally the army turned against him and
then the Reagan administration flew him
out of the country with half the
country's Treasury in his plane on an
Air Force plane to Paris Marcos in the
Philippines about the same time same
story Maputo in the Congo soeharto in
Indonesia and this is just retained if
you have a favorite dictator support him
as long as possible if it becomes
impossible send them off somewhere and
essentially try to reconstruct the old
system that's pretty much what happened
in Egypt the Obama administration
supported Mubarak to the very end
practically the last minute finally even
the army turned against him and they
realized they got a ditch him so they
sent off the normal share and instead
have been trying to reconstruct a regime
that would somehow follow the same
neoliberal policies they don't control
you know don't control everything but
that's certainly what they're trying to
influence and in the countries that
really matter to the West the oil
dictatorships the US has supported that
the dictatorships have very harshly
repressed any significant effort at
reform and the US has backed them all
away France did the same in Tunisia
which was you know it's dependent
dependency they supported the dictator
Ben Ali up to the point where is
becoming a joke you know even after
people were demonstrating wildly
demonstrating in the street but but
that's exactly the way powerful systems
act shouldn't surprise us a no system of
power wants democracy it's a threat to
its interest I mean of course
talk about democracy but you know
everybody talks about democracy Stalin
talked about it
Japanese fascists talk about it you know
everyone says democracy is great the
systems of power are not going to like
it because it erodes their power it's as
simple as that
and the evidence for it is just
overwhelming incidentally this also
scholarly discussion of it by people who
are considered by major scholars who are
considered to regard themselves as
strongly in favor of democracy promotion
like I've written about the scholars who
say about it but the basic conclusion
which shouldn't surprise anyone is that
the United States supports democracy if
and only if it conforms the strategic
and economic objectives we have to be
free naive to expect that easy
difference and the fact that it's
clearly established by the scholarly
work even with scholarly work that
doesn't like the outcome but honest work
that that's good but shouldn't surprises
sorry I'm afraid I've got to take off
I've got another interview online okay
thank you so much you know the one
question I had one left for you is about
Gaza you got a minute for Gaza yeah go
ahead I just came back from there you
know yeah I know so what is your take on
what's happening there I know that
there's a new balance taking place and
that you've got Qatar is now giving
money which is changing the balance with
not Iran funding them where do you see
things happening and going there what
should we be doing well for first of all
the you know the punishment of Gaza has
been going on since 1948
1948 hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians either were expelled or
fled in terror from what's now Israel in
fact Israel was still trucking them
across the border years after the
ceasefire after 1967 there was a new
then Israel conquered Gaza there was a
new expulsion of refugees the goal at
the time we know this from internal
records was just drive them all out of
Gaza
well I couldn't quite do that but they
sent out plenty in violations I wouldn't
let them return in violation of Security
Council resolutions and worse in the
West Bank since then it's been a
constant record of violence and
repression the most recent period of
severe repression by by the US and
Israel they work together since 2006
there was a free election carefully
monitored free election in January 2006
actually the first one in the Arab world
the only one really and the US didn't
like the way we came out nor did Israel
they wanted to come out a different way
so they immediately turned to harsh
punishment of the people of Gaza
Palestine altogether this is a nice
indication of how much they love
democracy it's got to turn out the right
way well the u.s. also turned to another
standard operating procedure when you
don't like a government organized a
military coup to overthrow it okay that
military coup was beaten back a year
later and the elected government took
over Hamas government at that point the
punishment of Gaza got far more extreme
both way Israel in the US with European
Union telling along then came this
hideous Operation Cast Lead which is
mass murder operation and so it
continues this is just the latest
upsurge the last month that's if you
read the you know the cease fire Accords
and brief statement it says that within
24 hours after the cessation of
hostilities the major fundamental issues
like the siege and which is an act of
war of course and you know the barring
of constraints on
entering and leaving and so on but
that'll all be addressed well you know
nothing's being addressed so this is the
main stage the main story the primary
story is that the US and Israel have
been in our continuing to maintain a
harsh regime of punishment and siege in
Gaza while at the same time they're
pretty much taking over what's a value
to them in the West Bank and separating
Gaza and the West Bank from one another
in direct violation of the Oslo Accords
those are the major issues there's a lot
of lighter Jewish I'm Jewish I I hear
from Jewish people I know all the time
Oh Israel treats that people in God's
good they bring them to the border
hospital and what else could Israel do
with all those bomb raining down and
what is your reply to that and what do
you see when you were there in Gaza what
do you have to report from your actual
visit there well I wrote about it so you
can look it up but it's basically a per
day that's a people are in person to the
Israeli policy is to prevent them from
starving to death that would look good
but essentially keep prevent development
so like at the start just give you one
indication at the beginning of this
latest is really a purge of violence
November 14th about half of the
essential medicines required in Gaza
weren't we're not available they weren't
there that's because of the siege yeah
that's you know you go to visit
hospitals you know simple medicines and
surgical equipment there's very little
construction because it won't allow the
real construction to take place except
in limited ways the idea that they let
them in the hospitals is a joke that
actually bar going to hospital
occasionally they'll let somebody in the
question what should you do when you're
under attack by missiles is a fair
question and there are answers very
straightforward answer one answer a
simple one is to accept the truth there
constant first offers right before this
latest upsurge - there was another one
before caste LED and is enduring the
truces we know from Israeli official
sources Hamas observed the truth
completely like pre-cast LED ruse it
wasn't a single Hamas missile fired
until Israel broke the truce so one
simple answer is accepted truce another
simple answer is follow the principles
of international law which are quite
clear read the UN Charter it's very
explicit force is permitted under one
circumstance unless authorized by the
Security Council one circumstance if
somebody think of a country thinks it's
under armed attack it's supposed to
notify the Security Council and it's
allowed to use force in self-defense
until the Security Council act that's
the one exception well Israel of course
didn't do that because it knew that if
it approached the Security Council the
whole array of pretext would fall apart
but that's the second answer and there's
a third answer a much more significant
one actually by interesting coincidence
one of the conservative national
security journals just published an
article about it not referring to Israel
they're referring to China in China in
the Western Province in Jang Province
there wasn't operating the Uighur
population starts slaughtering Chinese
on Chinese well if it had been Israel
the United States we know how they would
have reacted but China reacted
differently the Prime Minister flew
there security officials were removed
policies were introduced to bring up to
deal with the underlying problems of
development the reconstruction and so on
and the violence reduced that's the more
far-reaching approach of the US and
Israel should be paying extensive
reparations to guess for what they've
been doing to them for the last four
backs you want to go so at least 48
well so there are at this fair question
and there are answers to it I'm sorry
I've really gotta leave yeah okay thank
you so much this is a rockfall bottom-up
radio show I've been speaking with
know'm Kamsky a legend in activism in
the left
