what sorts of things Drive you you both
are working so hard you're activists you
never stop reading and writing you're
passionately engaged in the world and I
wonder what's driving you both that's
what's motivating you what's important
to you to make you it's important that's
important looking in the mirror in the
morning and not being appalled at what I
see for me it's looking out the window
and not being opposed so in other words
you're really concerned about feel
feeling that in your life you've done
all you can do to name in year what I
could do which is I often am appalled
when I look in the mirror but looking
out the window and seeing what's there
you feel the responsibility as an
intellectual not as an intellect or just
a human being a human being I mean it's
I think it's a kind of funny question
there's a question that always like a
lot of questions it's the wrong one yeah
the question that a part of a asked is
why doesn't everybody engage themselves
recognize that they're not engaging
themselves and not only because none of
us are even saint in trying to help deal
with the problems of suffering people
but so what is there in our society that
makes empathy into such a short supply
I'm more shocked rather than other
people in every society the inability to
picture what it is like to be somebody
asked on my profession as a novelist I
have to do that I become other people
but I've always had that tendency and
I'm always startled when I start to talk
to you would start going on about how
much they hate the blacks or the Jew
gay people and you suddenly see there is
no ability to identify was integral else
except themselves and I suppose if I had
a motivating thing and I probably would
come out in an overwrought empathy and
irritability and its absence and others
welcome to in conversation I'm J Perini
the idea for this program is simple to
bring together people of real
distinction in a context where
conversation can occur the notion for
such a program came to me several years
ago when I was invited for dinner by my
friend in Vermont neighbor Robert Penn
Warren Warren's other guest that evening
was Saul Bellow the novelist who had
just won his Nobel Prize for Literature
and I remember sitting on the Warrens
screened-in porch in the shadow of Mount
Stratton and thinking that I was really
privileged to be there that night
listening in on some of the best
conversation that I can imagine ever
taking place today in Cambridge we're
bringing together two of America's
leading intellectuals gore Vidal and
Noam Chomsky in conversation gore Vidal
and Noam Chomsky are both in their ways
purists some would even call them
extremists the doll of course is a major
writer the author of 25 novels including
such famous bestsellers as Lincoln Burr
and Myra Breckinridge he ran for
Congress in upper New York State for the
Democrats in 1960 and very nearly won in
1982 he ran for the Senate in California
he is also written nearly 40 movies
including Ben Hur and suddenly last
summer the doll is also well known
because of his many appearances over the
years on such popular TV talk shows as
Larry King and Johnny Carson perhaps his
most memorable TV appearances were in
1968 when he debated lame F Buckley in a
series of encounters staged by ABC
during the presidential campaigns of
that infamous year the last debate in
Chicago ended up in near fisticuffs
Noam Chomsky is a man of many lives his
groundbreaking work in the field of
theoretical linguistics which is the
study of language has been compared to
that of Freud and psychology Marx and
economics he is by any reckoning an
intellectual of world class stature a
philosopher of language a scientist of
the mind his received numeral prizes for
his work in linguistics including most
recently the prestigious Kyoto Prize for
science but Chomsky has also been a
leading political activist an American
dissident Chomsky is also a man of move
professor at MIT he often lectures three
times a week in places other than
Cambridge Massachusetts usually about
politics almost incredibly has written
over two dozen books on the subject of
American foreign policy and his books
each of them a landmark in its way range
in subject from the Vietnam War to
Central America to the Middle East he's
also written brilliantly about the role
of intellectuals in American life now in
conversation
gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky I give you a
little picture I like to do little
pictures two years ago rights of man in
Paris 200th anniversary and I'm there to
talk about it on television and all the
Chiefs estate from all the world are
there and the whole center of Paris is
cordoned off the day after I'm trying to
get out of the hotel suddenly down the
empty streets comes this black limousine
was two American flags and the
presidential seal is George Bush and
Barbara and the Secret Service they go
slowly down the street then I have to
walk a couple blocks still trying to
find a way to get out of there they
comes back up the street their mouths
pay attention to the Emperor of the West
in Paris at this meeting and I said to
myself this is an odd thing to see the
Emperor of the West drifting around the
streets of Paris he's going to have to
think of something to do and he did he
decided to invade a little country Oh as
well as the usual diversion his sons
possibly allegedly going to prison for
his SNL efforts the cost of building out
the S&L was according to that radical
paper in the Wall Street Journal it will
be slightly more than the entire cost of
world war two to the United States and
today's dollars so there's a lot to
divert attention from that to me was the
point to the war they're obviously
subtext but that's the central one in my
mind I agree with you on the diversion I
mean there are many audiences that had
to be addressed by this operation and
one of them is the American population
who had to be diverted not just from the
SNL's but from the whole growing social
and economic catastrophe around them
which has been very much accelerated in
the Reagan Bush years and in fact after
all this is not the first time they've
been periodic episodes of exactly this
sort right through the 1980s there's
been repeated huge propaganda efforts
establishing some awesome Chimaera about
the destroy us and then we're
miraculously rescued at the last minute
you know international terrorists may
bomb Libya and were saved narco
traffickers and you smash up Panem on
worse avian and Grenada you know a
hundred thousand people was set up as a
major threat to our existence with an
airfield
you know interdict the sea traffic in
the Caribbean and so on and then we're
saved and so on and that's that standard
I mean you have to the work you want to
make sure that the population doesn't
think about what's around them and
maybe do something about it obviously
that's one audience but the scene
actually part of it but there's more I
think the imperial element is also
significant the the third wall has to be
taught a lesson now they have to be
taught a lesson that if you step on our
toes you don't just get beaten you get
pulverized and in fact the
administration was kind enough to give
us that story and their own words they
leaked on just as the ground and
so-called ground war it's not a war the
ground operation was beginning they
leaked the section of a national
security review policy security review
from security policy review from the
early days of the Bush administration so
long before this and it was a section on
third-world threats and what it said was
something like this it's that in the
case of a much weaker enemy it is not
enough to defeat them you have to defeat
them decisively and rapidly because
anything else would be too embarrassing
and might undercut political support so
the trick is you find a much weaker
enemy build them up to be a major
monstrous force menacing force the
doubtlessly in some feet the more you
know Noriega we've done just year ago
with Noriega defeat them decisively in
rapidly and that's the only way to keep
political support and that's a lesson to
the third world but it's also a lesson
to the world as a whole I mean the
United States no longer is the the
overwhelmingly dominant economic force
in the world as it was for many years
it's now just one of three but in
military force it ranks supreme and it
has every reason to want confrontations
in the world shifted to the military
arena because the domain of force is
where the United States is dominant and
you play your strong card in any
confrontation u.s. card happens to be
force furthermore it's it's more
intricate because the u.s. no longer has
the economic base to carry out the
traditional role of third world
intervene
that therefore has to become as the
business Brett's has been very frank and
pointing out has to become a mercenary
State others you're gonna have to pay
for these adventures and one source of
payment is petrol dollars one of the
major sources of capital in the world is
the profits from energy production and
the United States wants to make sure as
it has long wanted to make sure that
those profits are fed primarily to
support the US economy and of course the
economy of its lieutenant and these
operations namely written what about
this is way back what about the standard
argument here though gnome the gnome
that um Saddam Hussein really is a bad
guy he did do a terrible thing in
invading his neighboring country Kuwait
that he did subject the Kuwaiti people
to terrible tortures and that probably
and they also was probably building up a
nuclear arsenal so these were all so
many ways there was a justification for
this war well look all those things are
true and they were all true on August
first on August first when the United
when it was true in 1980 in 1980 Saddam
Hussein was basically a Russian client
Reagan and Bush and Thatcher recognised
him as our kind of guy you know and they
worked very hard for several years to
switch him over to the US side on the in
1982 he was taken off the list of
terrorist State so that they could then
get huge US credits to buy US exports
became on the leading trade the u.s.
became one of his leading trading
partners by 1987 Iraq was largely a
Western dependent on the West also for
the build-up of its extensive weapons of
mass destruction and so on when he did
things like say gassing the Kurds in
1988 the Reagan administration
intervened to prevent Congress from
condemning it in any serious way along
to stop sanctions this went right on to
1990 I mean in July
mainly Bush intervened again to try to
prevent the House Foreign Affairs
Committee from condemning Saddam Hussein
or it did impose some sanctions of
interfere with American business in fact
on August 1st
you know while they were getting no
warnings but direct statements from the
CIA saying the invasion was coming on
August 1st the White House authorized
new high technology shipments to Iraq in
the preceding two weeks up to August 1st
that authorized according to what's made
been made public so far and as the real
story but what's been made public so
floor they authorized almost 5 million
dollars worth of high-technology
aid to go to Iraq not just to Iraq it
went to the Ministry of military
industry it went to the nuclear research
plant that was later bombed on the
grounds that it was producing military
bombs and and to a chemical until it
went to another plant that was bombed on
the grounds that it was producing
chemical and biological weapons that was
two weeks before and treated that the
invasion of quake was a crime but you
know his record was so sorted that what
it added to it is very slight and was of
no concern to the United aides so this
makes no sense what's the turning point
why do you point is our step on our toes
I mean by the standards of the United
States and Britain you can guess your
population you can torture you can
murder you can set up one of the most
brutal tyrannies in the world that's all
fine as long as you're Arab folk yes he
did something on August 2nd which is
impermissible he was told we don't care
very much if you rectified we're
problems but he took over quite and
that's not allowed we run the oil
business and when anybody steps on our
toes especially if they're much weaker
then they get not only defeated but
pulverized that's the lesson that has to
be learned lesson toes you speak of the
lesson to the 2nd and 3rd
country's even more important apropos of
my vision of an aimless president
drifting lost in Paris ignored by other
leaders this was a message a lesson to
the first world that not only over the
Soviet Union off the world stage as an
empire but we are doing a wheel we have
no national at all reason in the Middle
East we have no national interest we get
15% of our oil comes from there and we
could just as easily get it from
somewhere else but of course Western
Europe and Japan get most of our oil
from there I think I don't believe is
that American administrations are very
good at planning or indeed thinking and
they don't they're generally rather
ignorant but I suspect that this is not
only a message to Western Europe but to
Japan that we are going to be a
permanent military presence in the
Middle East and that's where the oil
supply is and I can see further down the
road we would absolutely collapse
economically if every quarter the
Japanese didn't come in buy American
Treasury bonds I could just see the Bank
of Japan dragging its feet or the
Bundesbank
and the United States clearing its
throat and starting to talk about oil
prices then suddenly they will start
buying our Treasury bonds
I mean it's blackmail well I think
that's I'd like I don't entirely agree
with that I think there's another factor
it's true that we don't use oil from the
militant very little oil from the Middle
East and you as you say we could get by
it with none on the other hand of the
profits for Middle East oil are a major
fact though the oil companies it's not
just the all-campus the profits made by
the client States they create I mean the
way when
in the United States set up the Imperial
settlement for the region the oil is
that the idea is goes back to Lord
Curzon that you set up with what Lord
Curzon called an Arab facade and that
then Britain but later the United States
would rule would disguise absorption
behind the veil of constitutional
fictions like buffer state and so on
they have this odd facade which is
basically family dictatorships they
manage the oil system for us but they
but we make sure that we do have the
lever assuming there's some leverage
over pricing in production we want that
to be in our hands for exactly the
reasons you mentioned we also want to
make sure that the flow of investments
of capital of profits is largely back to
the British and American economies
actually we have documentary evidence on
this the documentary records been
cleared partially at least through us
through about 1960 and it's very
interesting to look at the Declassified
British and American records after the
Iraqi Revolution in 1958 that was the
first break in the anglo-american
condominium wasn't naturally they were
hysterical about it and Selwyn Lloyd
flew over Washington and talked to
Dulles and so on and so forth and they
decided at that time to grant some kind
of nominal independence to queit to try
to adapt in the threat of another
nationalist revolution there and though
they reserve the right as Selwyn Lloyd
put it ruthlessly to intervene if
anything goes wrong with this settlement
and the reasoning was that at that time
particularly Britain them but they're
very concerned about that kratie
investments had to both clay T oil and
clay D investments had to prop up this
hovering British economy and in fact
crop up sterling all together you know
by the 1970s the u.s. is in the same
position and it's not just the Japanese
who buy Treasury bonds the Saudi
Arabians but you realize what the
average American listener to this
program will think hearing new people
talk about the war in the Gulf you're
essentially saying that this the the
what was seen until
vision was a mirage that essentially the
main arguments for the Gulf War were
perfect really what we're looking at our
underlying economic profit oriented
reasons for pursuing this war in the
Gulf profit and power profit and power
and I would stress again what Gore said
the version of the American public I
mean the ability to look away from their
own problems exactly but but this isn't
the picture that most Americans have why
should it be what was nearly running our
job after all and the intellectuals are
doing their job which is to prevent
people from understanding what's
happening I mean I've just been speaking
at Harvard a pleasant and gentle place
but it it Harvard exists as does CBS ABC
New York Times to give the viewpoint of
the establishment that owns and runs the
country and they have a worldview which
is not coincide at any point with a new
reality that anybody mildly curious can
discover I would say that probably what
the people think on almost any subject
is has been doctored for sanctions were
working against Saddam the problem was
that ninety percent of the people who
when asked to they think sanctions were
working didn't know what the word meant
a few remand Catholics thought that the
sanction was a step toward sainthood
somewhere to have to be attitude than
before the rest them had no idea at all
what about the debate in the US Senate
about should we authorize the war or not
once our real medley of voices points of
view there didn't bring when you say
they say a lot of sudden quite good
speech writers have been called in and I
must say it was eloquence and many
people who could not parse a sentence
we're giving her other nice speeches now
what you saw was the was the total
collapse of our constitutional system of
government in which only Congress may
declare war Bush at one point said what
I've been saying for years I said we've
we've done armed intervention 220 times
and
only five times we ever declared war why
should I be saying this as they've been
denying it now I should was praising
George Bush now because he actually
decided to follow a legal route to
pursuing this warrant and he also
brought into the coalition as so many
other nations he didn't act unilaterally
needs neither of those statements and
when the coalition was the United States
and England in fact up until January
about France up until January 15th
it was a u.s. British command in the
Gulf after it became clear the war was
going to go on France Italy in a couple
of other countries decided they'd like
to get their fingers in the post war
settlements than the you know it was a
u.s. British command then it was a u.s.
British war very isolated in the world
through their famous twenty-eight
countries that were in the coalition
most of them were there to enforce the
sanctions in fact and as far as the
legalities are concerned the u.s. just
once again did what it's been doing for
many years namely undermine the United
Nations the United Nations has
procedures and they were blocked but
didn't we get a UN resolution where we
notice what the resolution said we got a
resolution in which the UN said in
effect we wash our hands of the matter
the why would they do that why would so
many countries just fall back and take a
back seat there's a very frightening
place you don't fool around with it yeah
what's been happening in the UN for
years let's just take the period during
which George Bush has been in national
prominence he was appointed UN
ambassador in February 71 and so they
take that period during that time the
United States has Veta about two-thirds
of the Security Council resolutions that
have been vetoed of a veto by the United
States well about half of the rest of
been vetoed by England United Kingdom
that's between between them that's about
80% way down in third places France and
fourth is a Soviet Union well the United
States is in the General Assembly I mean
you get votes in the General Assembly
like you know
50 to 100 we will say the place to
herself outside the law we made it very
clear over Nicaragua when we were called
before the International Court at The
Hague which we'd helped set up at the
beginning of the century over mining the
Nicaraguan harbors and we said we don't
recognize the court of the egg who
rejected that right now were rejecting
reparations this is a century that's
rejecting reparations meanwhile calling
on Iraq to pay reparations but in this
current case if you look closely at what
happened at the UN yeah I think it was
another case in which the United States
and its English lieutenant succeeded in
subverting the United Nations I mean the
UN response was pursue sanctions and
diplomacy its usual effort after any act
of aggression it usually is blocked
right away by the United States we can
meet those that are undermines it but
look what happened the United States
intervened directly to block diplomacy
mm-hmm I think sanctions already
probably or a had worked I mean we
didn't have to go through in the past
the American presence wouldn't have gone
for UN supported in a case yeah but look
this was it this was a turning point for
the American Empire no it's a big
operation well I mean this is not like
invading Panama we don't ask anybody
what they think we just invade Panama
this is half a man troops in the most
sensitive area of the world which
everybody's concerned about you have to
get at least the pretense of a cover of
support and in fact after a lot of
arm-twisting and pressures and threats
they succeeded in getting the Security
Council to abdicate that's in effect
what happened serious fog in the pan
saying if you put a frog in a pan with
water cold water and sit there you can
heat it up until it becomes boiling in a
fog we'll see or nothing is happening so
gradually the farm adapts to each change
of the water the end of it there's a
dead frog but he has not had any anxiety
about it well I said I think our people
man that things are going very badly
mm-hmm for the economy for the average
person and no one's doing anything about
it and we have the politics of diversion
which are foreign adventures we have a
irresponsible to put it mildly press has
the Empire really run out of gas I mean
are we at the end of empire now or are
we just in a middle phase that we have
another 50 years of diversionary tactics
abroad oh the Empire ended in 1950 when
we were defeated in Korea that was
really the end and the Russians got the
top Tomic weapons there was then parity
wants this parity you're not the world
empire you may be a world empire do you
agree with that well I mean I think it's
impossible to answer one way or another
there's fluctuations in the world system
it was true that the peak of us power
was in the late 1940s I mean then it was
just I mean there had been nothing like
it in human history the extent of
English rule about 80 percent of the
world's wealth 50 50 percent of the
world is about 50 percent of the world's
wealth but also we had all the military
and all our military force and so they
had all the guns and you know total
security and the capacity to order to I
mean the intention was to organize an an
instructor the entire world said
Marshall I'm glad I was about and you
know there was a whole global planning
system with that that was the that was
an unusual peak of power
I'm always obvious attack couldn't
remain for one thing other industrial
areas would recover ultimately and power
would become diffused and as you say the
Russians got atomic weapons well now the
world systems changed again I mean from
the 19th no I mean since the 19 since
1970 it's been clear that the world
system is changing significantly a power
in the u.s. domains power has very much
diffused the so-called trilateral ISM of
the seventies was a reflection of the
fact that there were three major
economic centers how their relations are
shifting the u.s. is relatively
declining the decline
still the most powerful but it's
declining in the Bush Reagan years of
which accelerated that decline
we're very rich but we've borrowed too
much money are you saying that we can't
really sustain the the guns of empire
well I can't believe that we can't which
is why you will read and everything from
the Financial Times to Village Chicago
Tribune that we have to become a
mercenary State others are gonna happy
in fact they say it's like when the
dance floor was a mercenary war well I
mean it's not like that but they're
hoping to make a big profit on it if you
believe the numbers that are given its
success
yes extortion the racket really yeah so
much to the editor the financial later
the Chicago Tribune put it rather nicely
what he said is we have to sell
protection to the world yeah with the
right of protection rackets you know
though we're gonna be the global Matthew
I mean if some country wants a third
world you know if somebody's bothering
you to say some third world countries
pushing or trying to get something from
you you call on us we'll break their
bones for them and you'll pay it that's
the image now you know how long can a
system like that is sustained well you
know that's unpredictable I'd like to
ask you each what you really find most
the most difficult about this country if
you had to isolate something that was
the most painful thing about it living
here for you being in America what would
it be well I'm most disturbed by the
collapse of the educational system
mm-hmm that whenever you start to
describe anything it's what I call
inventing the wheel well you can't count
on anybody having enough information on
any subject unless it's his own work in
which case he's apt to be quite good and
he can tell you but we don't have very
much information in common with one
another which a common public
educational system once gave us would
you make work system then do you think
we should go back to teaching the
classics Oh
with their own education I'd make
history the spine of it I'd start in the
12 years of in the state indoctrination
which is what the public school system
is mm-hmm I start in the first year with
a big bang Garden of Eden give them
everything's for the first graders I
would then teach the history of the
human race east and west north and south
for 12 years then I would bring in the
sciences the arts as they crop up in the
story of our race so they better turn
somebody graduated he would know where
China was he would know who Confucius
was he would have a sense of where the
human race has been other two things
which it's just I'm so amazed by an
educator the two things that everybody's
got to live with all his life one is his
body the other is his money most adults
don't know where their liver is until it
is too late
most don't know where there are many
years until mr. Keating goes to jail
right the schools wouldn't dream of
teaching you anything that you needed to
know so you'd have them teach things
teach the history of our race and at the
end of it you would leave school you'd
be 17 years old you know where where
we've been where we then you might want
to go someplace else but you would have
an idea of the old thing so if you say
what disturbs me the most is I don't
have many people talked to because I
keep finding III just their subjects I
don't even bring out because you'll get
a blank so conversation has become
impossible in any real sense you talk
about not enough points of common
leverage you talk about Madonna I'm
happy to do that for a while but when
Madonna does nothing happens make how
about you know what's what you find most
anguishing about this place well I
should say just on this Vicki yeah sure
all right I sort of agree but on the
other hand I I do find conversation much
easier than 30 years ago they're a very
substantial part I know if I may these
trips that you mentioned around the
country I'm talking to people I mean I
can enter into the kinds of discussions
and give the kinds of
today that I couldn't have dreamt of 30
years ago really yes absolutely because
the level of understanding and awareness
how could that be then this is directly
in contradiction it's not things are
happening many dimensions I mean the
educational system is becoming narrower
impoverished and collapsing the media
are first of all activity or freer than
they were 30 years ago they're still
pretty bad the intellectual classes are
doctrinaire rigid committed to a kind of
kind of cultural to appellate arianism
if you like and the other thing many
other things happen in the world people
you know there's all societies a
complicated place so things like say the
civil rights movement or things like the
Solidarity groups or things that have
happened in the church for example there
all sorts of things create a big ferment
you know presumably they're talking from
a base of knowledge come together but
actually raise to forget knowledge yeah
see you wait I mean if you go down to
say Arizona you know or Iowa where
there's where they take say the Central
American movements which were big things
very important I mean the people got
their information about Central America
did not get it from the media when they
didn't get it from the educational
system they got it in other ways they
got it by some of them by direct content
so you're saying yes God's right that
the educational system that the system
is no other things happening if you go
out searching and you are not speaking
the only Roosevelt line or what you do
quite a good deal of and what I do at
least in a couple of elections of course
you find like-minded people I had to
hold well thing explained to me by
somebody in Eureka when I was running
presented gonna feel business he
understood the entire Middle Eastern
thing for a better than the Wall Street
Journal which I'd been relying on I
don't understand that cut something the
contradiction here then if the country's
got no educational system it's all
falling apart how is it that we've got
so many people who
there are other ways to learn things so
what I mean when you ask what bothers me
most about the country it's not the
educational system it's tortured bodies
and El Salvador and homeless people in
the streets of New York and things like
that
just kidding yeah I mean we're causing
lots of people to suffer badly and we
don't have to suffer a real pain hunger
torture torture mutilation slaughter you
know we go on and on and just the
rotting rotting away in inner cities and
what amount the concentration camps you
want blaming us for that well you're
blaming us for well I don't know who us
is but I you know I think we have the we
collectively right have the resources
and the capacity to mitigate a lot of
this suffering for one thing we're
responsible for a lot of it so we can
obviously mitigate it but we could also
change our own lives and institutions
and interactions so as to improve it we
could do that well you know the actual
defense budget is two-thirds of the
revenues of the federal government hmm
they always say well there's only a
third because they they include Social
Security payments Malir us they are a
part so the and so other disbursements
so they always say whether it's just
one-third for the Pentagon and these
people programs and to see those
headshake sadly over the welfare
mother's living at the Ambassador East
Hotel drinking champagne they just shake
their heads over there take out Social
Security as revenue and take it out as
disbursements and you'll see that
two-thirds the revenues of the country
have gone for war ever since Harry
Truman created the national security
state which replaced the American
Republic and I don't happen to like I
like the Old Republic I have a
reactionary which I think makes me
absolutely politically you say in
America what does that really mean I
know you've called for a new
constitutional convention well that
would be the civilized response but that
will not be allowed that's what Thomas
Jefferson expected and you say you like
the old republic what do you mean well
the old republic jefferson said there
should be a
still convention at least once a
generation about every 30 years he said
you cannot expect a man to wear a boy's
jacket and instead of all these
amendments and so on that you would
eventually try and systematize thing and
change it just we haven't done that and
the result is the in 1949 National
Security Council act number 68 was the
one that could set up a national
security state the United the War
Department the Navy Department the
Defense Department OSS become CIA when
you say I'd like to know who you mean by
they we begin with Harry Truman we begin
with a dollar a year business men who
had come to Washington engine Charlie
Wilson and electric Charlie Wilson and
other like-minded people of both
political parties Vandenberg was working
with my father from the Republican side
and Harry Truman and Dean Acheson or
working on the Democratic side so you
see an oligarchic conspiracy really well
it's busy of the rich to take over the
country and to set up this national
security state as you call it
conspiracies too strong a word it was a
consensus I would say and it was in many
ways it was virtuous they didn't want to
fall back into the depression which we
had not got out of when the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor they thought war was
good for business they should stay
forever on a wartime footing which is
part of this national security council
directive there's I think seven points
to it one of it is interesting that we
will never deal with the Soviet Union
diplomatically we will never make any
peace or any acknowledgement that they
must be permanently outside and
permanently the enemy well we lost
representative government during this
we've lost much of the bill of the
rights has been eroded and when people
wonder why they're people sleeping out
on Melrose Avenue and in Los Angeles and
the schools and the bridges are falling
down well this is what happened all the
money was taken to sustain the national
security state you're saying it wasn't
necessarily such a bad thing no they
thought they thought they were doing
their
really believe the communism was an evil
city I didn't hear about Russia didn't
know they knew that Russia this is where
they were wicked they knew Russia was no
threat to the United States we had the
atom bomb they did it I think most 20
million people they had to use forces to
take their their heavy weapons out of
Central Europe but they had the example
of Stalinist Russia right before them
this is something to be afraid of you
wouldn't want this kind of totalitarian
system in the United States there was no
chance every HL makin is very funny on
it he said he wrote this back in the 30s
Menken said the Russians and the
Americans are very much alike
as peoples they are slightly less
intelligent than the rest of the world
they are deeply religious and rather
easily fooled he said the reason that
communism never took took hold in the
United States despite poverty and so
forth and so on he said because the
Americans instinctively knew what was
going on in Russia to folks just like
themselves and rejected it he said and
he said they he was I think he was the
verb vaccinated that we had been
vaccinated by the likes of Theodore
Roosevelt and William Jennings Bryan
that we weren't going to fall for that
so I think that no one ever worried
about the United States becoming a
communist power and nobody really
worried about the Soviet Union as a
military threat and so but by the
sixties yes of course it was but only
with provocation you know I was trying
to in reading both of your books this
past week again reading through the
various things you've written I've tried
to isolate some differences between you
and one of them seems to be the gore
being a historian essentially a novelist
of by a biographer of America has a deep
interest in the origins of the American
constitutional state and essentially a
certain kind of faith in the political
system whereas know'm you seem to me to
be essentially an anarchist who has very
little belief that the system as it's
been constituted even with our founding
fathers has even the slightest prayer of
ever working and I was going to ask you
the question what if we play a game here
for a minute and gore you were president
and no
was Secretary of State I know that's the
most Americans worst nightmare I see you
as my secretary defense if you were
president you were Secretary of State is
if that were a dream possibility could
you change this country could you make
it more democratic could you make it a
peace-loving nation that would be kind
to its name no because by the time I got
elected president or he got elected
president we would have been bought so
many times by so many people that we
would have to represent the interest
that had had bought us the position he
would also be very different sorts of
people from what we are you're a very
rich man you don't know you can't be
bought by anybody well a lot richer
people than me in politics and they
follow the standard line marry that but
if I mean it's it first of all if you
know on the absurd something like us
would be appointed elected that would be
because there had already been mass
popular movements developing which were
active and participants and so on and
that would have been revitalizing
American democracy wouldn't be the
people on top this country do it in any
military you know in any country but
that's not it but idea the picture you
present is upside down yeah you don't do
it by first electing somebody who's
gonna revitalize democracy if you've
gotten to the point where a person
representing the public interest could
be elected you have already gone a long
way to really get that out of great
disaster I mean there is no change in
any country unless there's a catastrophe
which in our case I suspect will be
economic the hideous inflation more
unemployment then you'll see the
possibilities of a huy law and a figure
I quite admire or if you're a pessimist
you'll see a committee from the Pentagon
and that Committee on Public Safety
which will take over so as no that's
right you're putting it backwards you
just don't elect somebody who turns out
to be a really
I sky and just go to straighten it out
you can't sleep so you think those roots
you know you have to go to the roots of
it and the president is just a flower as
we were in other words according to both
of you it's hopeless the way that the
system isn't lis constituted we're and
that'll be gonna drift into further
financial disarray there are lots of
hopeful things around I just don't I
think you're looking for them in the
wrong place you're not gonna find
hopeful things at the level of the
President and Secretary of State you
want to find hopeful things take a look
at the church based solidarity
organizations in Kansas that's hopeful
things there's a lot of grassroots
public why did the national security
policy review that I quoted say that the
only kind of intervention now possible
is against is rapid decisive victory
without losing public support because
because the country has changed do you
think that somebody has changed
absolutely since the Vietnam War
yeah very great great look really look
we're the classic intervention is not
even considered an option any longer you
don't have marine nobody's thinking of
Marines slogging around Nicaragua
chasing sandy no or US troops marauding
in South Vietnam for years well b-52s
will measure up to make honey they were
pretty happy about half a million troops
going ask for Italy's yeah but making
sure that they don't fight remember the
they thought they did not they do look
what were those tanks doing once we
killed 100,000 hold on a second US
casualties were about the level of
Grenada combat casuals what happened was
there was a mass slaughter of a third
world peasant army sitting in holes and
after that was done they allowed troops
to walk in and pick up the pieces making
sure that then what what fighting there
was was done you know they were they
made very sure that the people we were
killing were killed from a safe distance
now that's not a war and they know they
can't fight a war and they don't pretend
otherwise
now the reason is that you're saying
it's okay to kill people from a distance
hey I'm saying that the options are
better vention have been narrowed the
options for intervention have been now
the classic forms are everyone agrees
are over though even thinks about them
the kinds of intervention you can now
carry out our proxy wars where you use
mercenaries like the Contras or quick
surgical ablation surgical operations
over a much weaker enemy where you first
make sure that you you know you you beat
them to a pulp and then you maybe let
some soldiers and you must have total
control over the media because what's
going on must not be reported I watched
war on CNN well the very fact that there
was 50,000 sorties at the French word
seemed to attract them meant that we
weren't hitting anything
those two bridges across the Tigris
River are still there
now if I were declaring war on than
Baghdad is my target I would knock those
bridges out we did not have accurate
bombing at 37,000 feet you can't hit
anything it was what we called in the
second war carpet bombing and it was to
destroy the civilian population and to
make them give up to it to devastate
them this cannot be told of the American
people's on the one hand we now have
45,000 sorties well if you've knocked
out every they're not 45,000 military
targets of any importance admit we were
missing everything but you know we did
have the consent of the American people
something like 80 to 90 percent of the
American people supported this for a you
know what pollsters have a saying you
can get any answer to a poll you want on
the way you phrase the question if
Saddam Hussein continues he lives in the
country called Iraq your gasoline will
cost $100 a gallon should we get rid of
him yes so you get 90 percent against
him I mean the pollsters have a saying
garbage in garbage out actually some of
the polls are very revealing but I don't
think they show what your concluding
yeah so for example I think they show
something about an earlier point that
you raised about the role of the media
oh really
intellectual culture there were polls
right before the mommy well I think was
January ninth there's the Washington
Post published a national poll which had
following results in it it said it said
if Iraqi withdrawal from quate could be
assured on condition that there would be
an international conference on the arab
israel problem would you then agree now
that question was framed so as to
minimize the possibility of a your trick
they framed they actually put the
question so as to minimize the
probability of a positive response it
started off by saying george bush's
against this you know but many people
that automatically cuts it down because
you don't wanna be against the president
then and said you know would you agree
to this well two-thirds of the
population said yes all right now let's
imagine the following situation remember
that every person whose virtue aliy
every person who said yes must have
thought i must be the only person who
believes this right because they hadn't
seen anyone advocated i mean nobody's
came out and said yeah that's a good
idea so you had people saying i'm the
only one who believes this wrong i say
it anyway right secondly virtually no
one maybe no one who said yes knew that
just a week before that US officials had
released an iraqi proposal to withdraw
it totally from quoit in exactly those
terms right and had regarded it as a
serious proposal indicating iraqi
intention to withdraw and the US had
flatly rejected it no virtually nobody
knew these things suppose that you had
an information system which presented
the world as it is yes okay now then you
would have people saying well yeah
there's an offer like that on the table
it's been debated and discussed and the
merits have been discussed yes
no how many people would have come out
in favor of it well you know probably 98
percent and then they wouldn't go to
work now when you ask about public
opinion
you have to can't just say well what you
got to look at this and these issues i
mean the issue the the the manner was
set up by months of propaganda and
suppression and distortion and so on
which meant that the existence of the
diplomatic settlement had been largely
suppressed the the there had been
virtually no discussion of the obviously
relevant issues yes the possibility of
regional security arrangements and so on
so it's all propaganda really it's
propaganda if you like yeah but you know
all of the kinds of things were saying
will sound to a lot of people like
Russia in the 1950s a situation where
essentially thought control is happening
that the government is actively it's not
the government and consciously trying to
control people's minds sure like the
government of course will try to control
but the point is in this this isn't
Russia yes the government can't tell CBS
or the New York Times or The New York
Review of Books you know you keep these
things quiet all right and there is a
range of opinion on these is their work
so there isn't I mean there's nothing
like Union is so narrow it's virtually
undetectable on the phone last week to a
good friend of mine and said I was doing
an interview with gore Vidal Noam
Chomsky and he said to me those guys
complain all the time that they're
suppressed that their voices are never
heard you never turn on the Johnny
Carson show that you don't see gore of a
doll you never open up a paper that
there was an article by Noam Chomsky
well first of all I'd known Chomsky
speaks
across the country three four nights ago
his voice is ubiquitous gore the doll is
a household word and yet you're saying
you're suppressed
I'm not look I'm not complaining about
him you asked me for a description of
what's happening that's not a complaint
a description is not a complaint on
describing the lacked the facts are that
in the mainstream media in the United
States there's a very narrow spectrum of
opinion that's permitted I mean you'll
get what amounts to statistical error or
sort of noise in the system you know so
you get around like two three percent
disease right or the far left well I
mean you do get the mark it's not the
far left I mean like he said he's a
reactionary I'd say I'm a conservative I
mean I don't think this I didn't do with
left or right you know those terms in
American
much a my wooden to use them but the
issue is that whatever we might think
about social and political issues here
we're talking about something which has
nothing to do with left and right we're
talking about whether the media should
present to the public the fact that
there have been a series of diplomatic
options open from August which State
Department experts regarded as serious
and negotiable that was I have to do
with writing west and that's a question
of whether the inference or is it so
you're saying then that the media are
suppressing just the Mitel information
it's not just the media it's also the
intellectual community so you turn to
the New York Review of Books for example
that a series of articles in fact
calling for sanctions and instead of war
but if you look at them they lift will
look at the way the framed the way
they're framed is well we now have these
wonderful new prospects for peace well
the United Nations can finally function
in its peacekeeping role with the
Russian veto no longer blocking it you
know the third world no longer disrupt
things and shouldn't we move forward to
take this opportunity to create a
wonderful world order based on peace and
justice well that's just gross that's a
gross distortion of reality I mean
believe me you know who wrote that piece
I happened to be George wall George but
all but he's a distinguished look I mean
everybody is the first I mean I didn't
quoted exactly that's roughly the
content of the first paragraph of what
was in fact a rather good article
calling for diplomacy rather than war I
think at some point we should we should
always make the point that you've talked
about this isn't Russia the government
doesn't give orders to the press and so
on no it doesn't mmm-hmm what we have is
a ruling class which we're never
supposed to say exists but it does it's
a very powerful and it's partly money is
partly bright kids who are trained at
places like Harvard to run the place you
don't have to call up the editor of the
New York Times or the president the
United States they have a CBS and give
them the policy on the Middle East they
have these jobs because they think alike
they've been gone to the same conditions
they have the same worldview and we're
odd types like Chomsky and I come along
and I think I don't know what motivates
him but I'm much motivated by I wouldn't
even say anything so Loft is a sense of
justice as I am by incongruity in logic
drives me crazy hmm
I can remember in school the first
amendment was charged freedom of speech
and then you tried to four-letter word
you couldn't say it in class I said all
right now this isn't logical and I was a
real pain as you perceive anyway they
are their shapes the United States is
very distant from the rest of the world
where outside civilization we have our
own thing but we're in a bubble why
would Chomsky be wandering around the
country talking at these little
universities on big ones if he didn't
feel that it was not only worth doing
but then by explaining the prospect you
can illuminate the prospect and you can
help people to make change is that what
you're trying to do I've never saw tried
to do it and through your political
activity of course trying to change
things of course I know comeso a
reactionary that's the only way you can
present yourself to the American people
I want to go back to the old republic
every head starts to nod I said I wanted
to go forward to something every head
starts to shake what do you want to
change to I'd like to ask both of you
this question let's say that we have to
change the situation you've pictured of
America is very dismal we've got a very
docile apathetic population who is feet
who is fearful you've got a small group
of very rich people who are manipulating
the government you've got a government
with a kind of demonic Imperial it
sounds like a nineteenth-century
imperial craze for power for property
for profit it's a very dismal picture
you've got a press that's submissive
what would you what what doesn't look as
dismal today I don't think I'm seeing it
as dismally as you're presenting the way
I'm seeing North it seems well then
you're not trying your uncle
that's not true I think you're passing
out of what I said some strains but
there's another strain and I've said it
here too there's a very cynical
straining you're right but there's also
very optimistic strains otherwise
cynical is the American word for
realistic yeah I'm totally all guys I
agree that's what I think that's what I
did
yes I think I try to be realistic of
course it does
but I think part of realism is to
recognize that there's been substantial
improvements over the past 30 years the
country is a lot more civilized than it
was 30 years ago
so lies in what sense we're still doing
the same evil deeds that's what I keep
repeating myself but we are not the
options of things like say the Vietnam
War a virtually inconceivable today even
things like classical interventions are
virtually inconceivable today there and
the reason is because of changes in the
popular mood and you both have said
scene I think many glimmers of light and
the panorama of the world scene or maybe
your most hopeful well the most hopeful
thing is that there are two great forces
in the world at any given moment they're
very visible now one is centrifugal and
what is centripetal the Soviet Union is
going through a centrifugal phase it's
justice everything's rushing away from
the center Western Europe is centripetal
is coming together in the common market
I think that finally it's getting
through to people's all over the world
that the nation-state is an unnatural
sort of arrangement nobody likes it the
sort of Bismarck Lincoln state I see
that as just instinctively is happening
all around the world and we will perhaps
break up into cantonal systems and we
have a larger organization for a better
environment and a better economy it's
like the common market so in that point
of view I think something is happening
around the world
and if we don't blow ourselves up I
think this centrifugal force is gonna be
extremely good for its allowance for the
centripetal ones now if it gets out of
balance for all in trouble
history's complicated nothing people are
complicated enough so there's a lot of
ways of reading
evidence and a hopeful way of reading
the evidence is that over the centuries
and in fact over recent years there is a
constant struggle in which people try to
confront and overcome Authority and
domination and submissiveness and so on
they struggle against it in a lot of
ways I mean one way to struggle against
it is neurosis or pathology because he
don't recognize it and you just
internalize it that's a kind of a non
constructive way to struggle against it
more constructive ways are to recognize
it understand that find ways of working
with others to change it and there are
plenty of indications of that I mean we
live in a different world than we did
400 years ago or 200 years ago or 20
years ago
and many and the in so far as there have
been improvements and there are some and
some significant ones there because of
the manifestations of these tendencies
of I hope human nature
well that's hopeful I want to personally
thank you both for coming here talking
with us
it's been a good conversation thank you
