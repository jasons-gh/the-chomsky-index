period vowel new liberal is past new
liberal is chia what is neoliberalism
neoliberalism is a an extreme form of
worship of markets
deregulation
privatization removal of state
initiative at deregulation of Finance
and so on a set of views that came into
operation pushed by many economists also
very strongly supported by the corporate
sector began pretty much with the Reagan
Thatcher years took off it's expanded
over the world it's been extremely
harmful almost everywhere
there's been resistance to it the Latin
America which was one of the most
obedient followers of the doctrine was
devastated just as southern Africa was
Latin America began to respond pulled
out of it in the last 10 or 15 years not
completely but significantly in Europe
it's taken the form of imposing
austerity conditions under recession
which is a recipe for disaster as even
the economists of the International
Monetary Fund recognized though not
their political actors they're different
from their own economists in the United
States that's led to about 30 years of
essentially stagnation for or even
decline for the large majority of the
population the poorer part along with
extraordinary wealth for a tiny fraction
of the population now the claim that
they're relying on markets is a total
and complete fraud they're relying
extensively on powerful state
intervention but for the benefit of the
wealthy and the powerful and you can see
that very clearly so one of the leading
phenomena of the neoliberal era is the
vast increase in the scale of financial
institutions if you go back to the 1960s
in the 1970s
banks were banks somebody deposited
money in them they lent them to someone
else to
start a business or buy a car or
whatever beginning in the 1970s and
taking off dramatically in the 1980s and
later they've they're barely banks
anymore they're huge financial
institutions involved in speculation
complex financial instruments which
deceive the public into undertaking
highly risky and costly actions like
subprime mortgages the the deregulation
began in the early 80s there were no
crisis financial crisis before that
legislation had constrained financial
institutions soon as deregulation
started advocated by the economics
profession by the wealthy and so on you
get one financial crisis after another
each one worse than the last we may be
heading into another one right now the
meanwhile the the financial institutions
became almost half of total corporate
profits in the United States huge
phenomenon where they getting their
profit from well actually that was
studied by the International Monetary
Fund technical paper they studied the
six largest US banks the JPMorgan Chase
Citibank the others turns out that
almost all their profits come from the
taxpayer the mechanism is an implicit
government guarantee that they will be
rescued if they get in trouble now that
does lead to the bailouts which people
notice but that's a small part of it it
means they get cheap credit they can get
easy access to money the get incentives
to carry out risky transactions which
are profitable but then when they
collapse their build-out it amounts to a
subsidy of maybe eighty billion dollars
a year according to the business press
and it's the same throughout so it's not
that they're getting that they're
turning to the market they're turning to
a particular form of state capitalism
designed for the benefit of the wealthy
and the powerful and the corporate
sector that's neoliberalism you can't

hi new liberal I of team if the state
you can make the state small if there
are no other predatory destructive
institutions but there are when you have
private enterprise and capital
concentration in the private sector it's
necessary to have the state simply to
defend against their practices so it
there's an image that's used by working
groups in Brazil and elsewhere it's
called
living in a cage you're in a cage
there's a there's a saber-toothed tiger
outside that's the corporate sector the
cage is the government you don't like
the government you'd like to make it
smaller but you need the cage to protect
you against the bigger threat that's
outside so as long as you have private
concentrations of capital the public
needs to be protected deregulation is a
perfectly good example as I said as long
as banks were regulated by the state
there were no financial crises as soon
as deregulation began under the
neoliberal principles you get crisis
after crisis and it's the public that
pays for it the perpetrators the big
banks they do fine though they came out
of the last crisis bigger and richer
than ever they are responsible for it
but they're bailed out by the taxpayer
so they just get bigger and richer and
richer that's the state it makes good
sense in the longer term to eliminate
and reduce state power but only when you
get to the point where it's not needed
to protect the society against a much
greater gain

Berkeley dreamed I would harm units of
vitamin e the authors change
I mean Bush it's it's more or less back
to something more or less normal
the Bush administration went way out to
an extreme of aggressiveness and
violence so the invasion of Iraq for
example on completely manufactured
pretexts it was certainly the worst
crime of this century and a major crime
I'm in it
there the belief of the sort of meat
with the cold the neoconservatives who
ran the Bush administration Cheney and
Rumsfeld was they were simply going to
make history they were going to change
the world by force and violence
they'd overthrow Iraq they'd overthrow
around they'd overthrow Syria they'd run
the world by force
everything would they'd be in charge
what they did was hit a fragile system
with a sledgehammer and caused enormous
damage I mean they killed hundreds of
thousands of people created millions of
refugees ignited a sectarian conflict
which had not existed before and is now
tearing the country apart tearing the
region apart it's and that's happened
over and over actually Obama too so the
attack on Libya was similar there was a
settlement in Libya at the time that's
that that NATO decided to attack
actually France was in the lead in that
case England followed the United States
followed the there could have been a
peaceful settlement which in fact was
initiated by the African Union and it
could very well have worked instead what
they did is decided to become the air
force of the rebels smashed the country
another sledgehammer hitting a complex
society now the country is a total wreck
in the hands of warring militias it's
been a center for the flow of huge flow
of arms and jihadis to the Middle East
Africa in fact the worst terrorist
atrocities in the world right now happen
to be in Africa
most of it flowing out of the Libyan
catastrophe that's what happens when you
when you take complex social social
systems which of course you don't
understand and you simply smash them and
hope that you're going to rule them what
you do is cause enormous damage now
Obama's has moved back to a somewhat
more restrained position which i think
is basically the right direction to
pursue not enough they have to turn to
diplomacy negotiations dealing with the
roots of conflict not just hitting them
with a hammer and then hoping they'll go
away and in that way some of these
terrible problems in the Middle East may
be able to be ameliorated actually the
whole region and is in a horrible state
worse than it's been for a long time but
I think that there are good things that
can come out so it takes a Isis which is
a total monstrosity but one thing
they've done is something that should be
done begin to unravel the effects of the
sykes-picot tree the imperialist treaty
of the arrangements during the end of
the first world war between France and
Britain which carved the region up in
ways that were very harmful to the
populations and paid no attention to
their interests it was just done for the
interests of the imperial powers so for
example Britain wanted the oil fields in
the north of Iraq so that was taken and
put into Iraq area around Mosul and so
on Kuwait was established to prevent the
new State of Iraq from having reasonable
access to the Seas of the under British
control France did the same in Syria and
Lebanon its wreckage and that's now
coming apart in very ugly ways but maybe
something good could come out of it -
wanna die but yeah music character has
the year Iran wa carp Beth unum nazar
show much shared ivory music eh eh
Fatima Khan it
they're better than nothing and I'm glad
that they took place but and in fact the
Europe is very satisfied with them and
is establishing much closer relations
with Iran now there are some real
questions for example the the there have
been there would be very simple ways to
deal with whatever threat Iranian
nuclear weapons are supposed to pose
which is this interesting question in
itself there are ways to deal with it
the obvious way is to establish to move
to establish the nuclear weapons-free
zone in the entire region
now that's strongly advocated by Iran
it's been strongly advocated by the Arab
states it's the whole track of the whole
world is in favor of it there's one
reason why it doesn't take place the US
won't allow it
Israel's opposed because it would mean
inspection of their nuclear system and
the u.s. is blocking it Obama just did
again there was just another meeting a
couple of weeks ago an international
conference where at the General Assembly
were there was strong support for it the
u.s. the u.s. blocked it and there have
been a time in Turkey Brazil and Iran
reached a pretty sensible arrangement
2010 was blocked by the United States
this particularly the US wants to
control the situation but that does
raise a question why is the US so
concerned about the possibility that
Iran might develop nuclear weapons
actually we know the answer the US
intelligence has explained the answer
publicly to Congress they're concerned
that Iran that Iran's nuclear programs
whether or not they lead the nuclear
weapons might be a deterrent and the US
and Israel will not tolerate a deterrent
they want to be free to use force
violence without deterrence that's the
actual issue so yes I'm glad that the
deal went through partially may still be
blocked by Congress but partially went
through it's better than nothing but the
reasons behind it are very it's a very
mixed story when you look into it and
the Republicans the Republican Party is
dedicated to undermining and destroying
it every Republican candidate has said
that if elected they'll end now that
won't end the deal it will isolate the
United States probably Europe and Iran
will continue but it will exclude the
United States which is a big factor
they're taking moves step by step to
undermine the arrangement the couple of
weeks ago legislation was passed on
waiver of visas and they targeted Iran
so if a British or French businessman
has gone through Iran they're going to
have difficulties getting into the
United States on the other hand if they
go to Saudi Arabia there's no problems
at all and it's supposed to be an
anti-terrorist move there haven't been
any terrorists from Iran they're all
coming from Saudi Arabia but this is
these are the kinds of moves that are
being made to try to pick away and
undermine the deal and if a Republican
wins the White House I think it's very
likely that the overs ended and isolate
the United States from the international
community I hope that in that case Iran
and Europe will continue instead of Iran
withdrawing I think that would be the
right thing to do but it could be a very
disturbed and a dangerous situation
unlike in Smallville with me odd
whatever Joby Bassett at him higher and
here in Missouri I would occasionally
Shahrukh added a usually Iran would eat
with the latter Enrico a to Monica did
if I was a
human being I wouldn't trust any state
in the world you should never trust
systems of power and domination
you don't trust States I mean you look
at what they're doing why they're doing
it what the interests are what the power
systems are behind it
and you draw conclusions about the best
way to respond but not trust blocking
from debris arabistan so bad bikuni
mommy didn't care tom coburn moodily to
lani ho Mia arabistan mood a church is
in Hamoui chotu-ji Nocona well if you
ask what the question what justifies it
is not the right question
nothing justifies it the question is
what explains it well what explains it
is pretty straightforward back in the
1930s it was understood that Saudi
Arabia has extraordinary reserves of
fossil fuels and it is what they called
one of the greatest material prizes and
world history as the State Department
described it during the Second World War
there was a kind of a mini war going on
between Britain and the United States as
to who would control Saudi Arabia the
u.s. was of course far more powerful so
it won out
ever since then Saudi Arabia has been a
prime close ally of the United States
both because of its enormous energy
reserves and its geostrategic position
so that's that's an explanation it's not
a justification
now that ashore in NASM hid the key data
based on local data this year checked if
ever there own Jimmy off there my
impression is that they're somewhat
desperate they're acting pretty
irrationally they've they're in serious
trouble they're in economic trouble for
the first time in a long time their
reserves are declining their big
deficits if they don't have a big
surplus they cannot buy off the
population they keep their population
quiet
largely by giving them benefits can't do
that the population may erupt they the
war and Yemen is devastating for Yemen
and it's hopeless for Saudi Arabia Saudi
Arabia can bomb and destroy but then I'm
going to then I'm going to win the war
there they're now under criticism from
the West which is unprecedented even in
the United States and newspaper
editorials commentary and others are
beginning to criticize the extreme
repression internal to Saudi Arabia and
the their sponsoring of jihadi and other
organizations commentators have pointed
out accurately the best commentators
that quote Patrick Coburn the Wahabis
ation of Sunni Islam is one of the most
dangerous developments of the modern era
through X first of all plane funding of
extremist groups then building you know
Quranic schools madrasahs radical
clerics all over the world of radical
mosques it's had a terrible effect in
much of the Sunni world and that's now
becoming recognized and I think with all
of these things happening the suti
leadership is kind of flailing they're
trying to find the way to deal with it
in acting and I think pretty irrational
ways so as it ran the murder of the
Clare of the cleric was a crime of
course but the Iranian reaction was a
bad mistake as I think the government
recognizes they fell into a trap that
was the Saudi trap that's not to fall
into it they're in trouble and I think
the chant they one reason why the West
loves them is they're an enormous source
of armed armament the United States
Britain and France are pouring arms into
Saudi Arabia their arms industries are
making huge profits and as long as the
suit
economy continues to function yes
they'll be support for them but it is
eroding and I think the Saudi leadership
is deeply concerned about them
