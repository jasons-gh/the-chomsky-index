I mean is there evidence real evidence
that private transferring management
from public control to private control
increases efficiency that's a little
tricky because when you begin to look
you find a lot of other things for
example in what you find is that in
places where the society sort of
functions kind of more or less honestly
and well you know say Sweden or Chile
for that matter of public institutions
are pretty efficient so there is no
pressure in Chile to privatize the
biggest exporter because it's very
efficient where there's pressure to
privatize it's usually coming from
private power okay not on grounds of
efficiency and in fact if you look at
the effects it's very unclear what they
are so let me take say the Brazilian
steel industry I mean - oh it was
nationalized always ran at a loss okay
so it looks inefficient by some measure
on the other hand part of the reason it
was running at a loss was because it was
purposely by state policy producing
steel cheaply for the benefit of private
manufacturers in in so it was a public
subsidy to private manufacturers which
made the steel industry look inefficient
right but for the economy it might not
had all been inefficient and when you
proceed that's which fine so like in
England which is you know modern country
they privatized what the water system
recently and by economists measures it's
probably more efficient on the other
hand people aren't getting water poor
people don't get water you know yeah in
fact that's efficient like if you had
only one if you were put in charge of
the night of the distant water
distribution system and your own legal
or not comment on all human feelings are
doing your only interest is maximizing
profit well you know perfectly what
would you do you'd cut out water
altogether for people who you know can't
pay for it or are sort of not densely
not in some dense area which has a lot
of money watch they have water at all
and after they go walks
with a bucket on their back and get
water that's probably better by the
macroeconomic statistics so it's more
efficient and in fact case after case
when you look at privatization you find
an extremely mixed picture what you
usually find is transfer of costs to the
public so takes a privatization of roads
well you know privatization of roads
would mean you'd pay tolls if you're
rich enough and you'd go on nice
highways and if you're not rich enough
to pay the tolls well you know find your
way down and dirt Rutan somewhere know
the total you know the economy might
look much better of course national
product ego of macroeconomic statistics
would look good most of the people would
be terrible
it's forced on them forced on them from
the outside and it might be a good thing
or it might be a bad thing but you have
to look at the cases so for example just
recently Brazil privatized the Valle a
big huge industrial mining conglomerate
they sold it off the private power well
you know that's the large part of the
future of Brazil is there Brazil has
plenty of resources the there was an
analysis of valeted done by there were
two analyses of the left you know the
value of it one was done by Merrill
Lynch that's the one the government was
using Merrill Lynch also happens to be
you know the agent for a lot of the
private purposes and purchases and so on
another was done by the engineering
department at the federal Rio University
in Rio
good serious people know some of down
there about a year ago talking very
serious industrial engineers and those
people they gave an evaluation of Islay
which was far higher taking into account
future needs
you know what would hyoeun and gold and
so on be worth the 20 years from now to
the people of Brazil and so on those
considerations weren't taken into
account by Merrill Lynch of course but
they're real well you know we sold off
and now private power will make the
profit methey take a look at today's
rich countries in today's poor countries
first world and third world
go back a couple hundred years you find
they weren't very different in fact
India was the commercial and
manufacturing center of the world in the
18th century as late as the late 19th
century the British were deeply
concerned by the fact that British
textiles couldn't compete with Chinese
textiles because they were much better
that
and so on the change you know about
Egypt started to undergo an industrial
revolution about the same time the
United States did with proper herbal
prospects you know they had their own
cotton big agricultural area and so on
well you take a look at what happened
since the 18th century two regions have
developed outside of Europe the United
States and Japan they are exactly the
two regions which were able to fend off
European control okay the u.s. separated
itself Japan was able to fend off
European control pads had the highest
growth rate in the world since the Meiji
Restoration 1860 United States grew very
fast how do they do it
same way Europe did by radically
interfering with market principles so
from the very beginning the United
States was super protectionist had
massive you know large-scale state
subsidies and so on and so forth Britain
had done exactly the same that's how it
became the richest country in the world
every other industrial developing
country it's done more or less the same
thing I'm they used somewhat different
measured methods like Japan happened to
be much more liberal and trading than
the United States was but on the other
hand it had you know it's more
authoritarian internal system so they
vary and one way or another but
invariably I think there is no exception
to this they did it by sharp
interference with market principles what
about the third world they had what's
called neoliberalism is not liberalism
and it's not new they've had it rammed
down their throats for hundreds of years
and that turned them into the third
world
well one aspect of that is the kind of
privatization which leaves power in the
hands of usually foreign industry or
their local counterparts we've just seen
it go on in Mexico Mexico's had the
biggest privatization in modern history
and the last you know actually the
biggest privatization in history
probably is the internet and whole
telecommunication system here is a
system developed at public expense which
is being given you know it's not even
sold sign privatization some as they
sell it for something here we just give
it away you know to private power so
that's huge privatization but in
third-world countries I suppose the main
cases Mexico and in fact yachts true the
Mexican telephone company and so on
they're getting privatized and you're
getting a small couple hundred
billionaire's
you know service isn't improving except
for the rich getting small number of
billionaire wages and incomes of
collapsed by pen say a measure but maybe
fifty percent during the liberalisation
period in 1995 right after the collapse
GNP went down by about eight or nine
percent still not recovering yeah that's
a privatization
