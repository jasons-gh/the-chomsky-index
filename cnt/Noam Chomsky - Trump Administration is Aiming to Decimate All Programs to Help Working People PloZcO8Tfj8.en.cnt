seventy-five days ago today Donald Trump
was sworn in as the 45th President of
the United States when the international
front Trump has expanded US military
operations in Iraq Syria Yemen and
Somalia
while resuming arms sales to Bahrain on
Monday he welcomed Egyptian leader
General Abdul Fattah al-sisi at the
White House as thousands of activists
remained locked up in Egypt at the
United Nations a Trump administration
that a boycott of UN talks to ban
nuclear weapons while pushing for the
United States to expand its own nuclear
arsenal trump has also threatened to
unilaterally act against north korea on
the environmental front trumpet climate
deniers to head the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Energy
Department while slashing the EPA's
programs to combat climate change
Trump's budget calls for an
unprecedented 54 billion dollar increase
in military spending while ending dozens
of environmental housing diplomatic and
educational programs Trump's also
requesting a nearly three billion dollar
increase in funding to the Department of
Homeland Security largely to pay for
expanding the border wall and hiring
1,500 new Border Patrol and ice agents
however the Trump agenda has faced some
judicial and legislative setbacks
federal courts have blocked the
implementation of two travel bans
targeting residents from six majority
Muslim nations and in Congress Trump
failed in his attempt to repeal
Obamacare which would have strict up to
24 million people of health insurance
while giving the rich a massive tax
break meanwhile his administration is
facing an FBI probe over its dealings
with Russia before the election this all
comes as a resistance movement is
growing throughout the country to help
make sense of where the country stands
75 days into the Trump administration
we're joined by one of the world's
best-known dissidents the linguist and
activist Noam Chomsky Institute
professor emeritus at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology where he taught
for more than 50 years he's the author
of more than a hundred books his latest
book comes out today it's titled requiem
for the American dream the ten
principles of concentration of
wealth and power Noam Chomsky welcome
back to Democracy Now it's great to have
you with us glad to be with you again so
why don't we start on the 75th day by
your assessment of what has happened in
these first few months well I think it
was captured pretty well by a Los
Angeles Times editorial which simply
called it a train wreck but it's very
consistent very systematic anything that
can be of assistance to ordinary people
working people middle-class people
people on the street any such program
has to be decimated anything that adds
to wealth and power or that increases
the use of force that we carry forward
and it's done with this kind of a
two-tiered system working I presume
consciously so systemic it's hard to
question the Bannen Trump team it wants
to make sure that they dominate the
headlines so whatever they do that's
what people look at and one crazy thing
after another the assumption apparently
being you'll forget the old ones by the
time the new ones come in so no one
talks anymore about the three million
illegal immigrants who voted for Clinton
we forgotten we're on to the next one
then we'll go on to the next one well
this is going on in front the Paul Ryan
style budgetary and planning operations
are going on quietly in the back ripping
to shreds any element of government that
can help people either today or tomorrow
that's the point of the destruction of
the environmental system it's not just
the EPA which was slashed
most of the environmental program
directly in the energy department and
their research and activist programs
were slashed very seriously
