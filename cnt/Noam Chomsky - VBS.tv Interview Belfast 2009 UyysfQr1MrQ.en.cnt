we may say that the achievement of doing
nothing to advance peace places Obama at
a considerably higher moral plane than
some of the earlier recipients his
name's o omit out of politeness thank
you so much for joining us to talk about
activism good to be here how would you
describe this moment in history what do
you think is at stake right now there's
some very major issues at stake which
literally have to do with long-term
species survival one of them is
environmental crisis another is the
persistent threat of nuclear war and
then there are numerous other major
crises how did you first become an
activist what a tree that's too long ago
to talk about when I was actually my
first article was in fourth grade when I
was ten years old about the rise of
fascism in Spain it was just never a
choice it was always there what do you
think the role of music and artists and
social movements it's always at a major
role so in the 60s for example although
what kind of old-fashioned conservative
I had tried to keep away from it but
rock music Dylan this thing's you very
inspiring to love junkie and if you go
passing the same here in Ireland so a
mural art for example was a very
significant part of the activist
movements and that's every popular
movement in history that I know anything
about four years when I'm asked to sign
things after a talk the one that was at
the top of the list was a punk record
which was in ninth must the first Gulf
War 1991 some punk group
the name I couldn't resist it was called
Bad Religion asked me to talk for eight
minutes into a tape that they sent me
just about the war so I talked for eight
minutes and the Senate back to them and
back came a record in with small records
with my boring talk on one side and a a
song on the other side which they
assured me was an anti-war song
I couldn't make head or tail out of it
but I gave it to a friend who had a
fourteen-year-old daughter and she wrote
me a very eloquent account of what it
meant and word fitly punk scene and so
on so I've had some connection so who
inspires you right now is there anybody
who's stepping up to provide these
answers to the truth I could never point
in my lifetime two notable people who
inspired me I so take say the civil
rights movement very important
development and Martin Luther King was a
very admirable person but he didn't
inspire me what inspired me was snick
workers students mostly young students
first from black colleges in the south
joined by others sat in on lunch
counters and Rodan freedom buses and
we're getting beaten and killed and
basically laid the groundwork for a
popular movement where Martin Luther
King could come and be an eloquent
spokesman I'm sure he would have agreed
that the movement was created and led by
the young activists on the ground and
most of them are gone from history as is
usually the case so why is all the
energy on the right as opposed to the
left right now in terms of people
protesting there's an easy answer from
the left from the right the easy answer
is rich liberals on the banks on the
media you know run the government to all
they want to do is give away your money
to illegal immigrants and the shiftless
poor and that's an answer they're
setting up death panels to kill your
grandmother that kind of thing that's an
answer it's totally insane answer but
it's an answer I don't
and what's going on we've got away you
have to realize that our country is just
going down the tubes and I've government
is doing it and people want an answer
they're not getting any other answer
like Liberal Democrats aren't telling
them yeah your problems are because of
the policies we've instituted support
for the last 30 years they're not saying
that so they're basically getting no
other answers and you know we know where
that can lead in fact we've seen it it's
it's got have a whiff of late them are
Germany to it wear something similar
what's happened my feeling is a big
error to ridicule the demonstrators you
know the tea parties I mean what they're
saying doesn't make any sense but
they're the grievances that are leading
them to say it make a lot of sense and
it's our failure if the only answers
they have are the rich Democrats are
giving it away to illegal immigrants and
gays and there are also real prospects
if we follow today's variant of the
famous advice of the anarchist labor
organizer Joe Hill before his execution
he said don't mourn organize and we
should be telling ourselves don't
ridicule organized what's your take on
the Internet its ability to push back on
some of this well the Internet's an
interesting phenomena and then it can
allow people to interact outside the
major largely controlled channels of
information communication if I call just
about all activism or organizing is
organizing the internet a lot of people
as they grow old or become more
conservative but you've stayed pretty
radical how did you do that there are
people who sort of said okay I'll accept
society's it is with its injustice its
oppression its dangers its a threat to
species survival you know it's an easy
path to take it's
usual path it's there yeah but there are
other a moment's gone along when the
latent activism some erupts now I
depreciable don't didn't have to be a
very enthusiastic Obama but his campaign
did energize lots of people which means
they were ready to be energized and they
needed some kind of sparked us at the
most forty years ago or for that matter
ten years ago it would have been
unthinkable for the Democratic Party to
feel two candidates a woman and an
african-american and whatever one thinks
of the Obama administration it's no
small thing for a black family to be in
the White House i joined the obama
campaign in two thousand and he talked
about and there being something out
there that was bigger than he was and he
recognized that and so what do you think
that thing was the thing was profound
concern about the direction in which
society is moving that's not a marginal
concern eighty percent of the population
thought that the country is going to the
wrong direction it's not surprising that
he took as slogans hope and change
anyone who read the polls and was
running for office would take those
slogans one thing that I would ask
people when I was on the campaign was
you know what did they hope for but what
people talked about a lot was if they
were older they would talk about wanting
to have that feeling they had in the 60s
again feeling that the options were
limitless but also a feeling of being
connected to their neighbors if these
were people who were say students in the
60s yes it was felt that options are
limitless well I changed the
mid-seventies a leak sectors and sectors
that have power do not give it up
happily I was being challenged I thought
it was a counter-reaction which showed
up in all kinds of ways I'm in such
simple ways as they raising tuition if
students that come out of college with a
debt burden they're trapped if you go
into college
say law school and be dedicated to
becoming a public interest lawyer or a
civil rights lawyer and you come out you
know fifty thousand dollars of debt
you've got to go into a corporate law
firm you put on a tie and a jacket and
you think i'm going to resist the
corporate culture but that's not so easy
once you put on the tie and a jacket
then you become part of it you
internalize the values the goals the
aspirations and and there are many other
devices that have been imposed to try to
protect the society from what's called
the Time of Troubles 60s are called the
Time of Troubles and there's a reason
for that it's civilized the society
because that's the time when the civil
rights movement brought some recognition
of rights of minorities the feminist
movement the and get developed concern
for rights of women the environmental
movement developed is concerned for the
rights of future generations that's the
Time of Troubles and it's a well-chosen
theorem we talked a little bit about the
movement during the Obama campaign do
you see that movement continuing or has
it lost some of its momentum since the
administration well a lot of people were
energized because Joe and I are
committed to leading a government that
is a carnival not just to the wealthy or
to the well-connected but to you so now
you have what is literally called
Obama's army it's a marketing system in
fact Obama's sure you know one the
advertising industry award for the best
marketing campaign of 2008 the Obama
campaign has been pretty explicit about
what they expect of Obama's army they
expect it to wait for instructions and
then to go out and press forward with
what they call the Obama brand well
that's one option the other option is
they'll say I am NOT an agent of an
advertising campaign and I'm going to do
what's right and
which choice is made is going to make a
big difference actually there's
something similar at the Kennedy period
at kennedy also energize a lot of people
of Camelot the glamour so on and so
forth and when they were disillusioned
as of course they were very quickly they
had a choice they could have pursued the
Kennedy brand or they could have gone
out and become civil rights marchers a
war activists and so on fortunately by
it by my lights at least they chose the
latter leading to the Time of Troubles
and the same choice today fact the same
choice always happens to be striking
today because of the energizing effect
of the mostly illusory campaign
professor Chomsky thank you so much for
talking to us today it was really
illuminating thanks for giving me the
opportunity
