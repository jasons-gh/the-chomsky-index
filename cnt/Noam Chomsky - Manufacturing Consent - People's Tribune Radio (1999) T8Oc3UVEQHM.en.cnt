your host Mike Thornton we get our
orders from the state to focus attention
just on this and to look at it in a
particular way but anyone with an
independent mind is going to refuse
those orders and try to understand
what's going on and there are easy ways
to do it on this edition of people's

for people's Tribune radio I'm Nicole
Trejo people's Tribune radio is produced
by the League of revolutionaries for a
new America who also published a
newspaper people's Tribune to the boro
del pueblo stay tuned for contact and
ordering information at the end of the
program professor Chomsky was
interviewed by Eric seal Jack the host
of global kitchen on kvm our FM radio
professor of linguistics at MIT nom
Chomsky is a world renowned scholar and
political analyst he has written and
lectured extensively on philosophy
international affairs u.s. foreign
policy and the mass media and was the
subject of the award-winning film
manufacturing consent any attempt to
look behind the headlines into complex
history of the region economics or
geopolitics is almost impossible because
any departure from exclusive focus on
genocide makes one almost a supporter of
genocide so in order
for us not to lose half of our audience
we just have no choice but to start with
you know atrocities ethnic cleansing
emotionally charged arguments so let me
start by asking you about this basic
argument that we hear that US military
intervention is necessary to stop
genocide in Kosovo just like 50 years
ago we went to war to stop Hitler first
of all we didn't go to were to stop
Hitler so let's put that side the u.s.
went to war with Hitler when Hitler
attack tea and when Hitler declared war
on the United States through the late
1930s the United States was rather
supportive sitter and very enthusiastic
about Mussolini as for intervention to
stop actions to stop the ethnic
cleansing and humanitarian catastrophes
and so on yeah I think that's really
important and if anyone in the United
States or the US or British the
government's or the European governments
were interested in doing that they could
do it very easily and far more serious
ism this current cases so for example
you're you're actually right that we're
kind of we get our orders from the state
to focus attention just on this and to
look at it in a particular way but
anyone with an independent mind is going
to refuse those orders and try to
understand what's going on and they're
easy ways to do it so for example look
not very far away it's a turkey right
next door in Turkey in the mid 1990s
under the Clinton administration there
were there were the military was
carrying out ethnic cleansing
destruction of villages massacres
torture terror on a scale way beyond
anything that was claimed in Kosovo this
is in the Kurdish areas there were
perhaps several thousand villages
destroyed roughly two or three million
refugees maybe tens of thousands of
people killed right in the mid 90s as
the atrocity that was done with us is
overwhelmingly about eighty percent as
the atrocities increased Clinton
increased the arms float to make sure
that they went on the in fact when human
rights groups like Human Rights Watch
discovered that the u.s. Jets were
used illegally in violation of
congressional restrictions to attack
civilian targets other Clinton
administration found various ways around
them and kept sending you know to act to
prevent those atrocities to be quite
simple oef do is stop participating in
them but then it brings us to the
question which massacres are fit for us
what others say take a look at massacres
okay the terms like massacre and
genocide and zone are used very freely
when people want to use them so let's
take a look at what the United States
and NATO claimed to be the case and I'll
assume that everything they say is true
so let's take us NATO assertions of
Kosovo what they say is up to februari
1999 after marching us 99 until the
bombing started there were about 10,000
people killed on all sides in Kosovo
most of them Albanian probably the large
CRT of the 2,000 the there were a couple
hundred thousand refugees this was
according to the United States largely
this was the violence begins with
attacks on police Yugoslavian police in
Kosovo two provinces Yugoslavia by the
KLA the cause of a liberation army
attacks from across the border based and
supported abroad the Serbian army
reacted and reacted very totally to that
pretty much in a way we're through with
and say Lebanon where Israel reacts to
attacks on its soldiers though with
retaliation against civilians that led
to further retaliation by que la against
Serbian civilians and the cycle of
talents built up through early this well
you know so humanitarian crisis or right
but unfortunately one that's duplicated
in many many parts of the world for
example it's almost identical to what
the State Department describes as being
the case in Colombia approximately the
same number of people killed another
three hundred thousand refugees last
year according to the State Department
added to well over a million of
overwhelming majority of the city's
attributed to the army and its
paramilitary
associates who are funded by the United
States with increasing flow of arms and
we can continue around the world so
that's what's now called genocide in the
very specific case of Kosovo now what
happened on March 23rd 24th well the
United States presented use love
government with an ultimatum from VA
agreements although it wasn't reported
here as far as I can discover via
National Assembly made a counter
rejected it but made a counter proposal
the counter proposal was kind of vague
we don't know exactly what it meant the
State Department representative james
Ruben was asked at a press conference on
March 24th about this Serbian assembly
counteroffer and he said without silver
lining in it so he decided to bomb okay
that's the end of the diplomacy first of
all they very strongly condemned the
withdrawal of the monitors the
International Advisory why do they leave
in the first place they were told to
leave by the US the certain of the
Serbian government strongly opposed that
and in the same resolution that you're
talking about they once again condemn it
they wanted the monitors back and yes
they have a resolution saying what it
says is roughly after autonomy is
negotiated among the various ethnic
communities we will consider the
question of international presence to
guarantee you know the safety and so on
of everyone well okay you know beats
good offer maybe it's not a good for but
there's certainly room for diplomacy the
u.s. simply refused wouldn't
international community be interested
actually in having as much as possible
international presence this monitor is a
no first of all this international
community the term international
community's the term of propaganda us
propaganda there is no involvement of
the international community here zero
you know it's not over what the
international community is the United
Nations the international community is
not NATO the NATO powers with varying
degrees of commitment are following the
u.s. lead on this but they do not
constitute the international community
but that term is used here to refer to
headed States and its allies I mean
India's part of the international
unity China's part of it South Africa's
part of it Latin America's part of it
they're mostly posed seems like liberal
people have replaced analysis of this
geopolitical economics factors with
moral outrage and I want to ask you
about that because this seems to be
totally new situation and I cannot know
liberals means no educated people
essentially we must cated people they
tend to support state atrocities
overwhelmingly the support of the US
with Vietnam for example how many how
many faculty members did you see or
errors and so on in fact the liberal
this was the Vietnam as a liberals war
started it was a the aggression the
attack against South Vietnam which is
what was was launched by John F Kennedy
he's the one who sent the US Air Force
planes to bomb South Vietnamese
civilians authorized the use of napalm
initiated craft destruction started
driving millions of people into
concentration camps it was supported by
the liberal community educated community
right through until the time when
business turned against corporate
America turned against it on pragmatic
grounds was coming to costly in fact if
you want to see what the attitude of
liberals was just have a look at
yesterday's lead editorial in the New
York whitman's to capture it quite
accurately they say that we shouldn't be
hobbled by the Vietnam analogy in
bombing Kosovo and maybe invading it and
their reasons are that in the case of
Vietnam the sacrifices of the United
States were too high and the games were
uncertain well you know there are people
on the German General Staff said the
same thing about Hitler after Stalingrad
that's not opposition to the war if the
issue here is humanitarian with very
simple ways to stop much worse
humanitarian crises in fact right in
that region and notice that the u.s.
bombing the NATO u.s. NATO bombing
radically escalated the atrocities
exactly as it was expected I mean when
you bomb people react and the way they
reacted is exactly as any rational
person expected namely where they're
strong not where you're strong which
happens to be on the ground so up until
the bombing
the level of the there were certainly
atrocities but they were at the level
that you find all over the world for
example the kind that the u.s. supports
in Colombia way below what the u.s.
supports and turkey after the bombing
it's beginning to be comparable to other
cases so for example there was a Israeli
press as a the major journal their arts
which is kind of like the new york times
they had an article by one of their
major correspondents pointing pointing
out in effect that the Kosovo is
becoming like Palestine Israel and
Palestine in 1947-48 except with TV
cameras how can we explain this
enthusiastic support for this bombing of
the former upon some other American
interventions notice in this case us
propaganda has succeeded in presenting
it as a humanitarian endeavor and a lot
of people who are in favor of
humanitarian endeavors are just caught
up in the propaganda we know that the
u.s. government does not care about
humanitarian catastrophes nor do the
people who are getting excited about
this you can see that verily I mean for
example by looking right next door in
Turkey where they have been supporting
massively supporting even worse
atrocities and it takes nothing to stop
that support that's not you know if the
bomb Ankara to stop the support just
stop sending the jet planes and napalm
any personnel weapons and so on that's
all it takes there was a moral demand
for justice why wouldn't there be a
moral demand that the United States stop
contributing too much worse atrocities
in Turkey don't people many Americans
and we see this interviews or even in
this three days they stopped the Mazda
know everybody's already angry we have
to make a distinction between the
majority of the American population and
the elite educated sectors that are
involved in planning and management
they're completely different so let's
take a look back any we have a ton of
evidence on this I take the Vietnam War
again I mentioned the you know the the
way is analyzed by the New York Times
which is a typical of educated sectors
the war was wrong because it became too
costly for us that's the general view
you take a look at the American
population the review has been
completely different radically different
I'm at least this
been asked on poles early since the late
1960s the most recent one was just a few
months ago people are asked what they
think about the war in Vietnam and it's
an open question you don't expect high
numbers but roughly seventy percent
since around 90 late 60s about seventy
percent have said I'm quoting the war
was fundamentally wrong in imphal not a
mistake among educated people that's
never almost if that's statistically
insignificant you know maybe one percent
the standard view is it was a mistake
well that's a dramatic difference
between the general population and
educated sector and that is found out a
lot of issues as far as look as far as
the population is concerned you're quite
right about moral outrage but remember
that people have no way to feel muckle
outrage about the turkey which is far
more important because here we're
directly contributing to it massively
the atrocities but people can't feel
moral outrage about that because never
heard of it if you look back at coverage
of Indochina on the part of what are
called the liberal media you know the
New York Times The Washington Post and
so on their criticism was it wasn't
working but that's like Edison that's
like the criticism of made by the german
general staff after Stalingrad but what
I hear that you know okay maybe bombing
is not the best method but some other
means will be more effective but the
goal is not in any question you know the
ice right sometimes is the nature of
being well educated it is to accept the
framework of power and not question how
can then this non-negotiable assumption
of you know good goals intentions of
yours government be explained how can it
be explained yeah the manner I've just
described but how well educated people
understand that you that that is the
position you must assume so for example
again let's take yesterday's New York
Times I have a major article by one of
the real actual house intellectuals
Judith Miller on sovereignty and human
rights asserts as a fact that the United
States has been an aggressive leader in
the struggle for human rights I know any
who even pays attention to the most
elementary data knows that's not true
and look at Amnesty International
reports so like George Orwell
everybody's heard of or will write in
fact when his read animal for him just
about but asked her listeners how many
people read the introduction the animal
form well the answer will be I can say
right now very few if any and as a
reason for that it wasn't published why
wasn't it published well because here's
what said animal farm was of course a
satire about the totalitarian enemies
Oviatt Union big brothers yeah and so of
course I was wonderful everybody had to
praise that but in the introduction or
well said look he's writing in England
he said we shouldn't feel so
self-righteous about it because England
is not all that different and his
introduction was called literary
censorship in England censorship and he
derived how in free England unpopular
ideas are suppressed and marginalized
and never heard not by the same means
they use in Russia but he said the
result comes out not very different and
then he even gave some reasons and one
of the reasons was pretty much what i've
just been repeating and he said that
well educated people come to understand
that there are certain things it simply
wouldn't do to say or even to think and
that's part of the process of educating
so yes you end up with the result that
we've been talking about for a properly
educated person the idea that the United
States might not have honorable
motivations is just unthinkable I mean
you can have that idea about every other
country in the in past history or the
present world in fact you do have it but
not about the holy state we just support
with a dedication of a kind that the
commissars would be impressed with so
why are we there well here I have to
speculate so far it's been fact but my
speculation is roughly this turbulence
in the Balkans no matter of what kind it
is is a threat for the interests of rich
and powerful people it poses a kind of a
danger to Europe and hence to the United
States which is heavily
often European economy and investment
and so on so that means any kind of
turbulence in the Balkans becomes what
is called a humanitarian crisis as a
technical term it means it might
threaten the interests of rich and
powerful people in contrast if people
slaughter each other in Sierra Leone or
southeastern Turkey or Colombia or
whatever it's not a humanitarian crisis
because it doesn't threaten the
interests of rich and powerful people in
fact we're very often involved in the
USS has been and continues to be quite
willing to support dictators as long as
they follow orders take the less of it I
mean at 1995 at eight the Dayton
Agreement was an agreement with
Milosevic which sold out the Kosovar
Albanians as one of the reasons that
there are none very powerful and
impressive nonviolent movement than
Kosovo turned to balance they recognized
that the United States understands
nothing with violence we preferred
malevich to the rig over the Albanians
movement even nothing how about que la
which we are actually that's the only
poly Bannion movement that we do support
no that is not so clear you know up
until it's very recently the last few
days in fact the US was condemning the
KLA as a very dangerous force something
like the Taliban made up of Islamic
fundamentalists you know Albanian
Stalinists drug runners and so on there
were major stories about that from US
government sources remember that they
keep changing their story but their
picture of the K the picture they were
giving the press on the country of the
KLA up until a very few days ago is that
it's extremely dangerous Stalinist
Islamic narco-trafficking type
organization so how can they overnight
then become a guy can't become anything
I mean maybe that was false then and
peaceful now but now both stories can't
be true the goal is to place to ensure
that the NATO meaning the United States
dominates the region and a specific
proposal was made which would involve
NATO ground forces inside you get lucky
and yeah it's probably their goal they
know they're not going to achieve that
goal now by
bombing and they therefore turning
toward the question of ground forces and
the obvious thing is okay let's arm this
group that we called a terrorist army
just recently after all the United
States has often done that I did in
Nicaragua it armed murderous brutal
terrorist army and sent it in to attack
civilian targets in the garage with the
u.s. opposed when Croatia move out a
couple hundred thousand serbs from
Krajina Oh done with us arms and us
support there isn't much disagreement
about where power lies there are seven
rich countries g7 they're called those
are overwhelmingly dominated internally
just as including the United States by
corporate and financial sector so
there's a highly concentrated corporate
sector by now most a lot of it
multinational international financial
sector is a small grouping them with
tight connections internationally and
they form the private power sector which
is closely integrated with governments
the rich government's relies on them and
largely dominates them you know it's not
like it's not like the Communist Party
with a leadership but it's a pretty
closely interconnected array of highly
concentrated power center first thing to
do is not believe propaganda whether it
comes from the loss of itch or Clinton
or John Rutter or anywhere else we're
professor Chomsky thank you so very much
for being with us
this is people's Tribune radio and now
our feature commentary from Laura Garcia
of the people's Tribune tribunal de
pueblo a warning from Colorado on April
twenty-eighth of Hitler's birthday at
least two students went on a search and
kill mission through columbine high
school in littleton colorado they
massacred 12 of their classmates and a
teacher before ending their own lives
Denver's Chief of Police sadly commented
we live in a sick society yes something
is wrong in America but what is it and
how are we going to save our children
from future massacres people the world
over are asking why the usual suspects
have been churned up parents school
officials access to guns and the youth
themselves no one out of a so specialist
psychiatrist public officials and police
officials has given an answer that
didn't blame someone for this massacre
the youth are becoming more and more
disfranchised alienated from society for
years they have been sending a cry for
help suicide drive-by shootings violent
apps etc this Christ have fallen on deaf
ears what's happening to our youth is a
reflection of the destruction of society
going on all around us good pain
blue-collar jobs have disappeared and
been replaced with low-paying jobs
temporary jobs or seasonal work the
institutions that provided some kind of
stability during hard times including
welfare programs public housing
financial aid programs to pursue higher
education are being obliterated layoffs
downsizing and dog eat dog competition
have been the hallmarks of 1990s America
along with fabulous wealth for a few and
are spreading poverty for the many that
is reaching even middle class America is
that any wonder many youths feel
isolated and hopeless are you to see
what the future holds for
them they know that a society based on a
market economy holds them valueless what
other conclusion can they draw when in
America one out of four children go to
bed hungry when children are the fastest
growing sector of the homeless
population when 11 children under the
age of twenty are murder each day the
value of life is being cheapen or you'll
see that when someone loses their job
they're evicted from their homes because
this society refuses to guarantee anyone
the necessities of life or you'll see
that the unemployed are destined for
homelessness eating from garbage cans
and dying in the streets of America the
slaughter at Columbine High School one
of a number of such incidents in recent
years is another warning that something
has to be done the ruling class has no
solution President Clinton's words ring
hollow when he says we must teach our
children to settle their differences
through words not weapons while he
continues the daily slaughter of human
beings in Yugoslavia we share the sorrow
as Littleton moans its children but we
must turn our grief into a commitment to
change the world you don't offer our
youth a new ideology and morality many
of them will turn to the fascist
ideology that motivated the young men
who killed their classmates in Colorado
the people must build a real democratic
movement to eradicate all that is wrong
in America we need to fight for another
set of values not the free market values
that say you're only worth what you can
produce but values that engender a
society based on community and
cooperation where every child is
everyone's responsibility to take care
of to nurture and guide
