responsibility means you got to cut
services for the population you got to
cut benefits that help people you keep
the benefits to the rich that's what the
federal spend that you know and a tax
cutter about well during the Reagan
years that's exactly what was done and
it was harmful it was it was harmful
even to economic growth although it was
some but it was very harmful to the
general population that was 10 years of
either stagnation or declined for most
people us working hours went to the
highest in the industrial world for
incomes either stagnated or declined the
working conditions decline this was
called a welcome development of
transcendent importance by the wall
street journal which tells you exactly
what was going on well it was highly
unpopular as you can imagine there's a
lot of Mythology about Reagan's
popularity simply untrue in fact at the
end when 1992 he was ranked as the most
unpopular living ex-president right next
to Richard Nixon well below Carter and
the fort well you know how'd they stay
in power pressing the panic button every
year just what they're doing now so they
started right off with it was recognized
right away that Libya is a very
convenient punching bag it's completely
defenseless everybody hates it you can
do what you want so they started
attacking Libya right away and
presenting Libya's a threat 1981 Reagan
was hiding in the White House because he
had to be protected from Libyan hit men
who were wandering around the streets of
Washington nobody do anything about him
they're going to kill our leader well
somehow he escaped Libya was going to
was trying to expel us from the world he
said nothing less than
that two years later came that airbase
in Grenada which the Russians were going
to use to bomb us then there was
Nicaragua two days driving time from
Harling in Texas remember that really
close on waving copies of mind conf
according to the Secretary of State real
threat a Reagan called a national
emergency in 1985 to defend the country
from the threat to the security of the
United States posed by the government of
Nicaragua the Martian would be dying of
laughter I guess but people here didn't
laugh the in fact if you look at that
that was renewed annually right through
the 80s they take a look at it it's
almost the same wording as the
congressional resolution in October 19
2002 about the threat of Saddam Hussein
imminent threat to the security United
States you've got to do something in the
1980s it meant a terrorist war against
Nicaragua ended up with a the US had to
defy the World Court the Security
Council continued destroyed the country
practically the other countries even
worse in 1988 George Bush was able to
get elected George Bush number one but
only by invoking the threat of black
criminal rapists Willie Horton remember
that that's how he got elected terrified
everyone there were crime frenzies drug
frenzies just on and on the
international policies then were the
same as now the Reagan administration
came into office 1981 declaring that a
war on terror would be the focus of u.s.
foreign policy a war against depraved
opponents of civilization itself in
return the barbarism and eric
on and on and it ended up it very
quickly turned into a terrorist war the
devastated Central America the Middle
East was all over the world u.s.
supported South Africa right through the
1980's the Reagan administration had to
find ways to get around congressional
legislation calling sanctions they were
able to increase trade and support for
South Africa right to the end just in
the Reagan years alone South African
depredations in the surrounding
countries and Angola and Mozambique
killed about a million and a half people
it's not small that's when ends up with
Colin Powell the moderate this national
security adviser in 1988 the US declared
Nelson Mandela's African National
Congress to be one of the more notorious
terrorist organizations in the world as
part of the reason for supporting the
South African apartheid regime in 1987
December 1987 the u.s. blocked voted
against that means essentially vetoed a
general the strongest UN resolution
General Assembly resolution condemning
terror in all its forms strongest
resolution the UN has passed us voted
against it u.s. in Israel alone voted
against it the reason was it had a
paragraph in it which said that though
they can them terrorism and have to do
everything to stop it nothing in this
resolution prevents the people from
struggling against racist and
colonialist regimes or foreign military
occupation and the US doesn't accept
that we don't think people have a right
to struggle against racist and
colonialist regimes and foreign military
occupation racist and colonialist
regimes referred to South Africa
military occupation referred to Israel
the US alone voted against it Israel
reflexively accordingly it's not
reported
and it's not part of history except that
it is part of history and it tells you a
lot about what's going on it's December
1987 well it continues like that at that
time they were constrained there was a
deterrent there's a limit on what you
can do the deterrents gone you go on to
the national security strategy uses
September 11th as a pretext the pretext
is used by States all over the world the
Russians immediately used it as a
pretext for stepping up their really
vicious terrorist atrocities in Chechnya
assuming correctly they get us
endorsement for it China did the same
Israel that the same in the occupied
territories it's all over also States
all over the world from the Central
Asian terrorist dictatorships that wish
backs to the more democratic countries
all over the world it was used as a
pretext to discipline their own
populations we know what happened here
the Bush administration has made
extraordinary claims and they've been
upheld by the courts to a large extent
they've claimed the right to imprison
people including US citizens without
charge without access to lawyers or
family and to do so indefinitely until
the president declares that an emergency
is over which means executive authority
that's an astonishing claim the George
Bush is supposed to have a bust of
Winston Churchill on his desk that was
given to him by his friend Tony Blair
Churchill had some things to say about
this might listen to them he said the
power of the executive to cast a man
into prison without formulating any
charge known to the law and to deny him
the judgment of his peers is in the
highest degree odious and the foundation
of all totalitarian government whether
nazi or communist that that was that's
what is being claimed and implemented by
the United States Churchill said this in
1943 Britain was in very serious straits
at that time they were under attack by
the most murderous military force in
history and came close to being
destroyed that's the moment at which
Churchill declared that whatever you
think about the threats to the United
States and nothing like that and he's
right it is in the highest degree odious
and the foundation of all totalitarian
government whether or not see or
communist or Washington right now but
those are just plain facts you know take
a look and it's getting worse there's a
new Justice Department proposal which is
being called Patriot to it was secret
but it was leaked it was leaked but
somebody didn't like it there have been
a couple of reports about it in the
press you can actually read it it's
posted on the Internet nyu law professor
jack balkin wrote about it sittin says
the following there is no civil right
not even the precious right of
citizenship that this administration
will not abuse to secure ever greater
control over American life and if you
read the proposal he's exactly right it
even grants the Justice Department the
right to take away citizenship just by
inference what they call inference not
any actual actions they somehow infer
from something they don't like that you
don't they don't like you they can take
away your citizenship nothing's ever
been claimed like that that goes far
beyond what Churchill described as in
the highest degree Odie's well you know
whether that's implemented or not as up
to us Alan Gilbert here has a recent
book which he opens
by quoting James Madison who warned
about those who seized upon dangers
abroad to blind your eyes to dangers at
home that rings pretty true we're
thinking about well September 11th was
the pretext National Security Council a
security strategy was announced election
campaign came along the doctrine was
announced the doctrine of war against
anybody you don't like preventive war
the purpose is to establish that as a
norm of behavior what international
legal scholars will call a new norm in
international law but to establish a
norm you have to do more than declare it
you have to illustrate it you have to
carry it out you got to show that you're
going to do it then it becomes a norm if
you're a rich and powerful country not
if you're somebody else well how do you
do it you got to pick a target target
has to meet several conditions one
condition is it has to be defenseless
you got to make sure that you're going
to have an overwhelming victory so you
can rejoice over the destruction of
people from a safe distance secondly
it's got to be important so like there's
no point going after you know burundi or
someplace like that it's got to be a
place that matters okay what state
satisfies those two conditions
completely defenseless and very
important well that's Iraq it's been
utterly devastated by a decade of
sanctions it's the weakest country in
the region which is why it's not feared
no matter how much it's hated even in
queit and Iran which Saddam invaded not
feared in fact for the last five years
they've been trying to reintegrate it
into the regional system / strong us
objectives that's the United States that
fears it alone just like it feared
Nicaragua and Grenada and other demons
and that's extremely important as the
second largest oil reserves in the world
back as far back as 1945 the State
Department described Persian Gulf oil
resources as in their words is
stupendous source of strategic power the
greatest one of the greatest material
prizes in world history ever since then
the US has been determined to control it
it's a leading principle of foreign
policy actually goes back before but it
was the British before and it's
understandable you don't give away a
stupendous source of strategic power and
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history it's important to
recognize that that means control not
access us didn't need the u.s. effects
barely needs it today look at
intelligence projections they're
expecting to rely on more secure
Atlantic Basin resources western Africa
West West Western Hemisphere but they
want to control it just as they did
after the Second World War and there's a
reason for that if you control uh
stupendous source of strategic power you
control the world it's a lever of world
control you have what planners at the
time called veto power over other
countries you can also set prices and
production levels within the range that
you want and you can make sure that the
profits flow back into the right pockets
it's isn't enormous to a step to Maine
to gain control over this resource and
that have probably military bases there
is a tremendous achievement for world
control that's what you're aiming at you
hear you read counter arguments to this
and they're worth looking at so it's
argued that the can't be true because
the costs of reconstruction are going to
be greater than the profits that will be
made well you know maybe that's true
maybe it isn't but it's totally
irrelevant and the reason is because the
costs of reconstruction are going to be
paid by the taxpayer but you
and the profits from the are going to go
right into the pockets of the energy
corporations so yeah the men are how
they balance out it's just another
taxpayer subsidy to the rich the matter
what the numbers are so all the
discussions are completely irrelevant
the construction the profits will go to
you know bechtel corporation or Dick
Cheney's Halliburton Empire or one thing
or another which will be chosen to will
be called rebuild Iraq at taxpayer
expense and that's part of the way in
which you transfer wealth and power from
the population to the rich many ways and
that's one is there another way to
proceed at this point yet there sure is
the United States could pay reparations
to Iraq that's that's that would be
proper and remember what it is I mean
you know you're not reading about it in
the newspapers but you all know it's
reparations from 20 years of devastation
of Iraq first ten years of support for
Saddam Hussein right through his worst
atrocities the guys now in office and
care about the atrocities continued to
support and provide him with means to
develop weapons of mass destruction they
even said where they were doing it I
didn't have to do with the war with Iran
continued after I ran the reason was
because of us George Bush number one
explained his administration our duty to
support American exporters that's why we
had the support Saddam Hussein after the
gassing of the Kurds and everything else
and then they added the usual
boilerplate about the Saddam Hussein
being a source of stability and you know
we can help improve the human rights
situation and so on I went right up to
the day of the invasion of Quade first
first mistake didn't follow orders the
other crimes were fine then comes the
war and ten and a decade of sanctions
which is
stated the population civilian
population and strengthened Saddam
Hussein and furthermore made the
population more dependent on him that
means a murderous tyrant but a very
efficient one and a very efficient food
distribution system which people were
dependent on stay alive the world food
organization says the best the most
efficient food district distribution
system they know if they say they can't
duplicate it even by half you know
monster but an efficient monster not the
first one in history so it forced the
population to be dependent on them it
devastated the civilian society
strengthened Saddam Hussein that's one
reason why he's still there otherwise
he'd probably have been overthrown by
now remember that Saddam Hussein was not
the only monster who was supported by
the guys now in Washington they had
quite a quite a strain and entourage
that they collected they were supporting
among others Marcos and the valet and so
heart though and Mobutu who was the
first foreign leader invited to the Bush
White House they loved them so much HHS
coup it's easily comparable to Saddam
Hussein saying vicious murderous tyrant
supported up until the day he was
overthrown by the people now in office
every single one of those guys was
overthrown from within why didn't it
happen to said even though they were
being supported by the United States why
didn't it happen to Saddam Hussein well
I know the people who the Westerners who
know Iraq best have been talking about
this for years they don't enter you
don't read about them in the American
media can't find the names in the New
York Times Index you can read them in
Canada over sin England or elsewhere
namely the administrators of the UN what
so-called oil for food programs Dennis
Halliday and Huntsman spawning both of
them resigned in protest against what
they call the genocide Allah fective the
of the program the sanctions and the
fact that they were destroying the
civilian society and strengthening
Saddam's
in and they've been pointing out for
years that the way to overthrow Saddam
Hussein is from within just like every
other gangster that was supported by the
people now in Washington can't happen if
you destroy the civilian society and
your strength and the dictator and you
make people dependent on the main effect
of the sanctions as in harms that on the
same and strengthen them but it's kept
them from being overthrown otherwise
chances re would have been gone the way
of Ceausescu and the rest of them a long
time ago but an internal revolt is
unacceptable to the United States just
as Saddam's leaving your act is
unacceptable as they announced that the
summit meeting the reason is very simple
it doesn't leave the United States in
charge leaves the Iraqi people in charge
and that's no good at the azores summit
bush and layer announced it explicitly
that even if Saddam Hussein goes we're
going bait anyway because we have to
impose the regime of our choice not the
choice of the Iraqis or whatever that
might be that's critical well give you
some tasks for people here one is to
ensure the least harmful outcomes
whatever can be done another is to try
to get to the point where we can provide
reparations to Iraqis and if we can't
get to that level of honesty at least to
provide aid that they can use to rebuild
the society the way they want to and not
the way somebody in Crawford cells into
the next task after that and Karl Rove
just told you this morning what it is as
if you didn't know was to face the next
challenge as the new norm and
international relations is put into
effect somewhere else and now that it's
been established by this action you want
to know what it is a couple of days ago
james Woolsey who was former head of the
CIA under Clinton and apparently is
going to get a position in the new
administration he gave a speech and
where I'm going to be tomorrow los
angeles where he informed the crowd
cheerfully that we're now in the midst
of world war four there's World War One
World War two Cold War was World War
three now in world war four and we got
to go over the countries that have been
attacking us he named to said he ran in
Syria fascist regimes of Iran and Syria
have been attacking us and we finally
realized it so now we have to go after
them so maybe there will be the next
ones or another possibility is the
Andean region which is now surrounded by
US military bases plenty of soldiers
there and it's a big energy producing
another resource producing region and
it's kind of out of control so that's a
possible target and you can think of
others but you can be pretty confident
of one or another is going to come along
there's no other way to continue with
the strategy that's announced then they
intend to implement remember these are
people who barely hold political power
by a hair you know and the only way they
can hold on to it is by terrifying the
population that means they're things
that can be done you know people don't
have to be terrified by imaginary demons
that's an educational and organizational
task one that's not easy but certainly
within the means of people are concerned
well let's go back to last September
what right after it comes October
Congress declares that Saddam Hussein as
a threat to our existence like Nicaragua
and authorized the government to use
force something else happened in October
something extremely important there was
a meeting retrospective meeting in
Havana 40th anniversary of the cuban
missile crisis at the people who
attended were key participants in the
October 1962 missile crisis from Russia
the United States and Cuba and there was
there was a discovery that actually
shattered them there it turned out that
the world was they knew it was a very
dangerous moment Arthur Schlesinger
described it as the most dangerous
moment in history which isn't an
exaggeration but they found out last
October just how dangerous it was it
turned out that the world was literally
one word away from probably terminal
nuclear war that turns out that Russian
submarines were under attack by us
destroyers they had nuclear-armed
missiles two of the commander's assumed
that there was a global war going on and
called for the missiles to be sent off
if that had happened there would have
been a massive response by the United
States what that half a Russia they
would have responded out and wiped out
the rest of us and we wouldn't be here
to talk about it but why didn't it
happen a one submarine commander
countermanded the order the Russian
rules have required three commanders to
authorize nuclear weapons to agreed one
refused that's why we're here that's how
close it was this is after a campaign of
international terrorism that led to the
crisis aimed at regime change for the
kind of reasons I mentioned all very
much in the news last October very
imminent barely reported and
how many of you know about it was barely
mentioned who cares if the world was one
word away from nuclear war after a u.s.
campaign of international terrorism what
followed was an increase in the
terrorism and B Nash's ins explanation
which already read to you well there are
more important things than survival like
profits and power that's what we learn
from this immediately after this
discovery barely reported week later
October 23rd there was a meeting of the
United Nations a disarmament Commission
that's essentially the General Assembly
they passed two extremely important
resolutions one of them reaffirm the
1925 treaty that bans biological weapons
the second was a resolution that
extended a 1967 treaty banning the use
of banning the militarization of space
preserving space for peace of peaceful
uses well why those weren't reported
those resolutions had a friend to a
database check weren't reported why the
United States voted against him alone
the United States and reflexively Israel
voted against reaffirming a 1925 ban on
biological weapons and a 1967 treaty now
extended to ban militarization of space
well you know that's really dangerous
both of them and very urgent shortly
after not reported right after that the
US the Bush administration killed a bio
weapons treaty that was under
negotiation stunning the Europeans last
minute the u.s. stepped in and says no
we're not going to allow any discussion
of enforcement mechanisms for years a
reason got to protect the secrets of us
pharmacy
love corporations it's much more
important than banning biological
weapons probably is another reason it's
very likely that the United States is
carrying out illegal tests of
development of biological weapons
problem a lot of scientists guess that
that's the reason why they haven't been
able they claim that they haven't been
able to find the source of the anthrax
attack it was traced back to a US
federal laboratory remember it's not
like disarming Iraq it's a US federal
laboratory they can't they claim not to
be able to find the source it's kind of
hard to believe but it may be and it's
been speculated by the Federation of
American scientists and others that
probable reason is that they're
concealing some kind of weapons
development program that they won't
expose well maybe maybe not we go to
find out about it right after that the
u.s. went on to infuriate even its
closest allies in the World Trade
Organization first of all by taking a
very extreme stand violating trade rules
notice that that's another reiteration
that's still following the script of the
Reagan years a lot of talk about free
trade but they were the strongest
opponents of free trade in the
industrial world in fact the Reagan
administration was the most
protectionists government in post-war US
history they virtually doubled the
protection protectionists barriers in
the United States the gap which is the
predecessor of the World Trade
Organization their current their
analysis Reaganite protectionist
measures were three times as high as
other industrial countries very damaging
the world trade but no most powerful
state in the world does what it wants
and they're doing it right again the
Bush administration has broken some new
barriers and protectionist measures but
much worse than that and this really did
amazed and infuriate your
and others is just a couple of weeks ago
the u.s. intervene to prevent efforts
which had been agreed to by the other
industrial powers efforts to provide
inexpensive drugs to people who are
dying of treatable diseases AIDS malaria
tuberculosis and others that's tens of
millions of people who are dying from
these diseases in the u.s. intervened to
prevent access to inexpensive drugs
again because huge profits for heavily
subsidized us pharmaceutical
corporations are a much higher priority
now well you know doesn't make you
popular the u.s. also continued under
many is continuing to undermine
international efforts to reduce threats
to the environment which are by now
universally recognized to be severe and
may be a threat to survival the pretext
for this barely concealed service to
pretty narrow sectors of private power
take a look at the journal science the
main the Journal of the American
Association for advancement of science
that lead editorial about a week ago
with a bitter condemnation of the Bush
administration the climate change
science plan which does absolutely
nothing in doesn't even does nothing to
stop what just about every scientist and
pays attention recognizes to be a very
severe threat well again profits are
more important all of this engenders
fear and hatred of the leadership that
may be ultimately hatred of the society
which was regarded as just too dangerous
that's going to lead to efforts at
deterrence how do you deter a country
which is overwhelming military power
well you know every international
affairs specialist and tell you and does
tell you by proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and proliferation of
terror that's what
the Bush administration is going to
achieve as I say Osama bin Laden must be
cheering somewhere well go back to that
intelligent Martian if he has some
concern for the human species he might
be watching all of this with some
amazement and asking how long it can be
that people who live in a free country
are going to allow it to go on
I am told that there are a couple of
mics around so if you'd like to go to
them and we can turn this into a
discussion you start okay I know I
wanted to ask about if we accept as I
think we should have sort of call to
action as privileged instead of citizens
where your estimation would be of two
possible actions we can work for within
the kind of narrow political spectrum
you've talked tonight about the work was
done by this administration and by the
some of the same people during Reagan
Bush and you've also criticized Clinton
but not so much tonight and I'm
wondering how much how important it
would be to try to work for the change
from the Republicans to the Democrats
the next election which is you know it's
a measurable change versus other
possible put of activities like you know
campaign finance reform and that kind of
thing well depends on what the Democrats
are so I didn't talk much I actually did
talk about Clinton so the sanctions that
have destroyed Iraq and strengthened
Saddam Hussein and made the population
dependent on them and prevent it an
internal revolt that's Clinton right
okay and there's plenty more take
another example which is often another
domain take a look at Brazil it's very
interesting what's its informative
what's happening there very informative
and Brazil has a matte huge popular
movements left popular movement nothing
like here they succeed and they're very
effective that landless workers movement
the Workers Party and others the biggest
popular movements in the world and the
most effective they manage to elect
their own president pretty impressive
sky
just but just take a look at what's
happening and think a little about
history this good reason why nobody
studies history just teaches you too
much but take a look at recent history
recent 40 years ago Brazil had a
populist president during the Kennedy
administration not like Lula but you
know mildly populist President Kennedy
administration didn't like him they
organized a military coup to overthrow
it happened that take place shortly
after the assassination but already been
prepared by the Kennedy administration
it was hailed by Kennedy's ambassador as
the greatest victory for freedom in the
mid 20th century while the generals were
torturing and murdering it imposed the
first kind of neo-nazi national security
state in Latin America that's the
beginning of a plague that spread right
through the hemisphere ended up in
Central America in the 80s pretty awful
the we ought to know all about it this
time they're not calling for a military
coup although Lula is a much more
threatening leader for them and has a
mass popular support we're going to
support that goulart back in those days
didn't have how come well there's two
basic reasons for one thing the activism
of the last 40 years has changed this
country as well as Brazil people here
wouldn't accept it anymore then nobody
cared you know and that we knew pay
attention but a lot has been done in the
last 40 years it's much more civilized
country be very hard to carry that off
now there's a second reason here comes
Clinton they don't need it back in the
1960s the only way you could prevent a
populist movement was a military coup
now you can do it by the mechanisms of
what the world calls neoliberalism
financial markets the the international
financial markets can strangle capital
can flow out of the country what's
called by economists virtual parlor
of investors and lenders can make the
actual decisions over what happens in a
country its own voters are irrelevant
the virtual Parliament does it now
that's thanks to the what's called
globalization the measures that have
been introduced in the last 30 years
primarily on many of it under much of it
under Clinton which means that so like
when Lula went to Davos at the World
Economic Forum and made a good speech
about how we have to you know work on
overcoming poverty and all kind of nice
things they cheered them they throw out
that nice you know because they know he
can't do a damn thing because the minute
he makes a move the virtual Parliament
will strangle them okay a lot of that is
thanks to Clinton those are other ways
of controlling people I mean you know
they might have alternatives but they'd
have to be almost revolutionary by now
that's what the global justice movements
are about trying to prevent the virtual
Parliament from destroying what's left
of democracy by transferring power into
the hands of the virtual Parliament okay
we had to know about those things too
and plenty of people do that's why
there's a big global justice movement
that's Clinton too and there's more
going back your question it's really
hard to say you know it depends what the
alternatives actually are that's why I
was quoting Dean Acheson Kennedy
administration and Franklin Delano
Roosevelt the Planning Commission's in
1940 okay the spectrum is pretty narrow
it's not to say that it doesn't exist
and sometimes choices within it or
important but far more important than
that is changing the spectrum and the
way you do that is by the kinds of
activism that have changed the country
that changes the spectrum with within
which choices are going to be made
ultimately you want to go beyond that
but for the short term that's I think
what has to be done given that
our government is the most powerful
government in the world right now how
could we best utilize that power
