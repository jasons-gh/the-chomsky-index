for those who are interested in the real
world look at the actual history suggest
an adjustment a modification of
free-market theory to what we might call
really existing free-market theory that
is the one that's actually applied not
talked about and the principle of really
existing free-market theory is free
markets are fine for you but not for me
that's again near a universal so you
whoever you may be you have to learn
responsibility and be subjected to
market discipline that's good for your
character it's stuff love and so on and
so forth but me I need that a nice state
to protect me from market discipline so
that I'll be able to rant and rave about
the marvels of the free market well I'm
getting properly subsidized and defended
by everyone else through the nanny state
and also this has to be risk free so I'm
perfectly willing to make profits but I
don't want to take risks if anything
goes wrong you bail me out okay so if
third-world debt gets out of control you
socialize it it's not the problem the
banks that made the money when the SNL's
collapse no same thing public bells
amount when American investment firms
get into trouble because the Mexican
bubble bursts you bail out and Goldman
Sachs and the Malays Mexico bail out and
on and on I'm in this case after case of
this in fact of the leading top 100
leading transnationals in the fortune
list of transnationals there was a
recent study of how they have they
related to the states in which they're
they're all somewhere you know so
they're all mostly here in some national
state turns out that all hundred of them
had benefited from industrial policies
meaning state intervention and their
behalf all hundred had been if
from the state in which they're based
and 20 of the hundred had been saved
from total disaster that is collapsed by
just state bailout when people talk
about globalization of the economy
remember that the nanny state has to be
very powerful in order to bail out the
rich and nothing is changing in that
regard 20 out of a hundred again we're
saved from collapse by this including a
number here well that's really existing
free-market theory there are many
examples of it quite close to home so we
could start with their own governor
governor weld is described by the Boston
Globe as a libertarian with a religious
belief in free markets and then a couple
of days later they reported that through
various scams
he had his administration was able to
sharply increase federal subsidies to
Massachusetts so that way beyond what
they were before so that he could parade
as a fiscal conservative and that's
pretty common just a year before you may
recall if you have long memories they
had to close George's bank the richest
fishing area in the world because it was
over being overfished thanks to a
combination of deregulation and
subsidies to the fishing industry which
have that odd consequence that you tend
to get overfishing so it looked as if
the ground fish were wiped out man to
close it off didn't take long for the
religious conservative libertarian
fanatic William well to take the next
jet plane down to Washington hat in hand
asking for a federal bailout they wanted
the National federal government to
declare it a natural disaster and the
reason was as he explained with
presumably some scientists in tow that
there was some strange kind of predatory
fish which no one had yet found but they
would find it don't worry so some kind
of predatory fish had come and sort of
wiped out all these you know the cod
haddock and all those things so it was a
natural disaster and therefore the
general public had this sort of payoff
the results of deregulation and
subsidizing the fishing industry well
that's the way to be a libertarian with
religious fervor another one is the
leader of the conservative revolution
Newt Gingrich nobody's more passionate
about the market then he is particular
about what his own district which he
calls a Norman Rockwell world of jet
planes and fiber optics as indeed it is
except if you asked where jet planes and
fiber optics came from you discover that
the public paid for them and still pays
for them and in fact he manages to get
more federal subsidies for his district
than any suburban county in the country
outside the federal system so you can
have conservatism and flowering among
the malls and so on or you go back to
the Reaganites were also very passionate
about free markets for everyone else
meanwhile they boasted the American
business community
correctly that they had done more that
they hadn't stood more protection than
any post-war American administration in
fact more than all of them combined they
had doubled import restrictions blocking
and recap helped and poured public funds
into major industries to enable them to
recapitalize
to protect in fact reconstruct the steel
industry and the automotive industry and
the semiconductors and so on which would
have disappeared if they'd opened the
markets now the Thatcherite in England
were about the same government
expenditure is relative to GNP stayed
pretty constant although anything that
went to the general population collapsed
meanwhile military industry shot up arm
sales are booming think that's all
publicly subsidized stuff arm sales to
nice guys like Saddam Hussein and
General Suharto and others well that's a
really existing
free-market theory what are the core
policies well the Washington Consensus
which is basically designed for the
third world to make it that way and keep
it that way it's now being applied not
just to the third world countries but to
were the rich industrial societies with
the United States and Britain in the
lead however it's with a twist
since it's being applied at home
this is really existing free-market
theory that's being applied at home
meaning nuanced you know so powerful
government to protect the rich and
market discipline and tough love for
everyone else and you see that very
clearly go through the various elements
of the Washington Consensus the first
one is two about reducing government
well that's false we're not reducing
government we're switching shifting it
around so social spending is indeed way
down since the 1970s when this stuff
started accelerated after 1980 but
starting in the mid 70s the kind of a
benchmark example was AFDC the main
support system that was cut up virtually
in half from about 1970 to 1990 with
obvious effects on where families and
children and so on it was part of a
general war against women and children
that was conducted by the Conservatives
under the name of Family Values it's
interesting that they really get away
with that that tells you something about
the intellectual culture well one part
was the reduction of AFDC from by
roughly half from about 1970 to about
1990s now essentially gone
that's a purpose of that as you know is
that 7 million a couple of million I
think 5 or 6 million kids average 7
years old can learn responsibility
that's part of tough love meanwhile
another part of the government has been
very stable and in fact is going up
namely the Pentagon system which remains
at approximately cold-war levels fact
higher now than it was under Nixon
although you know the big enemy is
disappeared which tells you exactly how
much tells a rational person at least
exactly how much they were worried about
the Russian threat at not as it remained
at Cold War levels but it's going up
under the initiative of the fiscal
conservatives the Heritage Foundation
which you know sort of the right-wing
nation that designs the budget for the
Gingrich army are calling for an
increase in the Pentagon system as is
Gingrich as indeed most Clinton so that
goes up and I should say the cutting of
Social special spending is being cut
very sharply very much over public
opposition at the time of the 1994
congressional election you know the big
landslide over 60% of the public wanted
and social spending to increase okay
went very sharply down what about
Pentagon spending going up well that's
the public is six to one opposed to that
which gives you some one it's one aspect
of a big picture about what's happening
to American democracy and somewhat of a
change not a huge change the so one part
of the system is going up Pentagon
spending in other parts going down
social spending and the same is true in
other domains like for example legal aid
for the poor is being slashed and
virtually destroyed on the other hand
the security system States the
government security system state and
federal that's going up so prisons are
going way up the prison population crime
hasn't really hasn't changed for about
20 years but and instantly us crime
rates are not off the spectrum contrary
to what a lot of people believe crime
rates are sort of it toward the high end
of the industrial world but not off the
spectrum with one exception namely
murder with guns but that's a special
feature of American society which do not
do with crime rate
apart from that crime rates are kind of
toward the high end not going up the
prison population tripled during the
Reagan years is going up even faster now
and I think the reason is another aspect
of the third world model namely the
superfluous population there is a big
superfluous population they don't
contribute the wealth protection well
we're civilized folks we're not like the
people we fund in Colombia go out and
murder them so we throw them into jail
and that's going way up in even more and
there's also with Congress
I'd benefit to this the putting more and
more people in jail and in fact under
harsher and harsher conditions has an is
a technique of social control for
everybody else I mean when you're if
you're you know when someday down the
road you decide to run a dictatorship
and you want to really harm people it's
kinda like Hitler Germany or something
you know you know that you're gonna
carry out policies are gonna cause
people a lot of harm you got to control
them somehow and there aren't many ways
to do it everyone hits on the same ways
what you do is engender fear and hatred
and you know make them hate the guy who
looks a little different or whatever it
may be and then you punish those bad
guys because they're really awful and
you punish them really hard and so on
and that makes people even more
frightened you can just see that
happening right around you and building
up the perception of crime crime has oh
like a what they call in literary theory
a subtext you're supposed to understand
criminal has the word a little word
black in front of it just like welfare
mother you know black rich black and the
and criminal means you know that black
guy is coming at you so what you want to
do is this has the dual effect of
getting rid of a superfluous populations
basically unskilled workers close race
class correlation and also demonizing
them so everybody else is scared and
frightened and they'll be willing to
accept what's happening to them too and
not look at where the source is so that
part of the drug wars basically for this
has almost nothing to do with drugs but
it has plenty to do with criminalizing
and unwanted population and scaring
everybody else and so does the harsh
inning of prison conditions which is
really it's the United States off the
map on this one in violation of
international conventions constantly
condemns in human rights forums and
getting much worse the reinstitution of
chain gangs was of course bitterly
condemned but you know that's that bad
South Alabama well it's now in Illinois
the state Senate of Illinois ago
legislated chain gangs not for violent
criminals incidentally for people who
are found with drugs or you know robbing
the store or something like that
the Chicago Press pointed out that this
carries this kind of reminiscent of
slavery but the legislature and the
senator state senator who put it through
said that this is just another aspect of
what he called tough love and then he
explained that some people work better
under humiliation so it's really good to
restore elements of slavery and again
the subtext is everybody else gets
scared you know if those guys have to
walk around like slaves in Chains we
must be in real danger
so therefore we'll accept what's
happening to us that's the logic so
prisons are going up and it's and that
has a lot of side benefits apart from
just getting rid of perf lewis
population it is a source of cheap labor
so prison labor is going way up cheap
labor ought to worry about unions no
benefits they don't get out of line and
that also naturally undercuts wages
elsewhere so when just like forcing
welfare mothers to work you know raising
children isn't work as anybody knows
who's had children so you have to drive
them the work kind of like people would
go to you know fidelity investment to
figure out scams but I deal with
security market really want these people
to work but since there's no jobs for
them they're gonna work at low paid or
so publicly subsidized wages which will
undercut other wages and the same with
prison labor also in fact the scale of
prison construction which is a kind of
Keynesian stimulus to the economy anyway
but its scale has become so enormous
that even high-tech industry you know
the guys who are usually just ripping
off the Pentagon system they're
beginning to look at it figuring out the
correct recognizing that high-tech
surveillance devices and so on may be
another way to sort of get the transfer
of public funds to make sure that
high-tech industry keeps moving it's
reached it's not the scale of the
Pentagon but it's going up well that's
one aspect of what's called reducing
government modifying government
to be more precise another aspect of it
is what's called devolution you know
reducing moving governmental power from
the federal to the state level and that
has a kind of a rationale which you hear
all over the time a place for example
there was an op-ed a couple of weeks ago
in the New York Times by John Cogan
those who were instituted Stanford whose
pointed out what he called a
philosophical issue that divides the
Democrats and the Republicans the
philosophical issue is that the
Democrats believe in big government and
entitlement and the Republicans believe
in getting power down closer to the
people to the states because they're
kind of populist types well it takes
about maybe three seconds thought to
recognize to realize that moving power
down to the states in funding and so on
is just moving it away from the people
for perfectly elementary reason there's
a hidden part of the system of the power
system that you're not supposed to know
about or think about and that's private
power and now it takes a big corporation
like say General Electric or Microsoft
to sort of pressure the federal
government but even middle sized guys
have no problems with state governments
they can control them quite easily and
in case anyone was too dull to figure
this out by themselves the same day is
Kogan's op-ed in The New York Times
which is a typical one that there was a
story in The Wall Street Journal about
Massachusetts which had a headline that
read what fidelity investment wants it
usually gets okay and then the story
went on to say that fidelity investment
the biggest investment firm in
Massachusetts wanted even more subsidy
and support from the state government
that it already gets and it was
threatening if it didn't it would move
over the border to Rhode Island where it
just owns the place
so therefore the passionately
libertarian governor quickly rearranged
you know tax subsidies and one thing or
another so that fidelity got what it
wanted
well fidelity couldn't have done that
with the federal government
that said you know you give us even more
we're going to move to Switzerland or
something I mean other guys can do it
maybe but not fidelity Raytheon it's as
big as manufacturing producer did the
same thing Raytheon instantly filled
fidelity it's not it's not that fidelity
is poor they just announced record
record profits couple days ago same with
Raytheon just announced record profits
but you know having big problems so they
wanted even a bigger tax subsidy and
direct subsidy and tax write-offs which
just means transfer of taxes through
from the state of Massachusetts and they
threatened if they didn't get them they
were going to go to Tennessee so of
course they got them the Legislature
passed a special law giving what they
call defense industry special extra
subsidies notice that Raytheon is
publicly subsidized in the first place
that's where it's money comes from but
now it has to be and additionally
subsidized so that its profits will be
even higher than the record profits it
just made same with fidelity and that's
the kind of game anybody can you know
even even weigh down that much smaller
businesses can play with states the
consequences of devolution are quite
straightforward it means that any
funding that goes to say block grants
that go to the states you can be
reasonably confident that they'll end up
in the deep pockets of rich people not
you know in the in the hands of hungry
children or we're mothers or anything
like that that's how you get power down
to the people okay that's a devolution
in fact quite generally when you look at
it what's called government cutting is
is more or less cost transfer it's
almost never reduction sometimes it's
increase so let's take what's big health
reform reform is a word you always ought
to watch out for you know like when now
called started the Cultural Revolution
it wasn't called a reform you know
reform is a change that you're supposed
to like okay and what so as soon as you
hear the word reform you can reach for
your wallet and see who's lifting it
anyhow there are things called health
reforms and the health reforms are
supposed to you know cut government
costs
well they do cut one kind of cost but of
course they raise another kind of cause
there's a very respectable outfit called
the National bipartisan leadership
council headed by two ex presidents Ford
and Carter and it just did a study of
the cost transfer effects of the planned
health reforms it concluded that they
would add about ten billion dollars a
year extra costs but those extra costs
will come from wages and higher premiums
okay which means it's a highly
regressive tax on the poor highly
regressive tax you know if it comes from
wages and premiums of course and that's
ten billion dollars a year they also
estimated that it'll increase the number
of uninsured by fifteen to twenty
percent up by this is by the year 2002
so up to about fifty four million by the
year 2002 well that's a cost and big
cost an unmeasurable cost and and so you
find all the way across the board and
furthermore it's no big secret
so like the Wall Street Journal had a
headline which pointed out that when the
reforms were you know moving through
Congress it's a rich gain poor lose
trade-offs for the middle class okay
which is right that's exactly what the
reforms are intended to do you have to
remember my middle class they mean the
people right below the very rich so they
don't mean the median you know they're
not talking about people with 30,000 a
year income they mean every you know so
what it really means is great for the
rich super-rich trade-offs for those the
near rich tough business tough love for
everybody else which is most every when
you close public hospitals and that sort
of thing you know exactly who's gonna
suffer well let's go to what are called
take say New York which it has to a
conservative governor and conservative
mayor and they're carrying out very
extensive conservative tax cuts because
their fiscal conservatives the tax cuts
the New York Times pointed out in a
small item all benefit business so by
accident all the tax cuts benefit
business well there are also tax
increases which are compensating for the
tax cuts but don't call them tax
increases what they call them is the
phrase is reduction of subsidies for
public transportation and for tuition
and public universities
well subsidy itself is another
interesting word kind of like reform
it's a subsidy if public funds are used
for public purposes that's called a
subsidy it's not called a subsidy when
they go to private wealth that's reform
or something so the so they're cutting
down subsidies for public transportation
well that's just a tax you know if you
pay twenty percent more for getting on
the subway that's tax the same if you
pay higher tuition at City College and
that's a highly regressive tax
so who rides the subways and who goes to
City College so what the doing is shift
is cutting taxes for business for the
rich and increasing taxes for the poor
which are gonna compensate for that and
and that's called fiscal conservatism
and cutting government well so it is
across the board you take other examples
but if you think about it all the same
take a look a close look at the things
that are called cutting government
you'll notice they quite
characteristically have this property
the next element of the Washington
Consensus is making the taxes the more
regressive okay we don't talk about that
it's stated openly the thing that isn't
stated openly is the reason this is
supposed to be in order to increase
investment and give or give everyone
jobs but it's a really weird way to do
that I mean the country is already a
washing capital the people whose taxes
are being cut don't know what to do with
their money if you want to increase
growth there's another approach that
might be used in stimulate weak demand
by progressive taxes that has put more
money into the hand
the hands of people who can spend it
that increases growth that would
increase growth but that's not the right
way to do it the right way to do it is
by cutting financial gains so that you
can have more speculation against
currencies the so that's the second part
make the tax system more regressive what
about deregulation well same effect
deregulation is a cost shifting measure
so for example if you deregulate if you
allow industries to as they've done
already to deposit toxic wastes without
costs because you have deregulation it
increases their profits but it also
increases water and sewage rates which
is a regressive tax on everybody else
who's got to pay that also it has
further costs some of them you can't
estimate for example the costs in say
health and quality of life and so on no
way to give numbers to those and there's
also going to be the eventual cost of
clean up but that's going to be a public
cost remember incidentally a good one
because when you clean up the wastes
that increases the gross national
product and we all like to see that
gillip but the public I'll pay those
costs so what it is is it just another
form of radical cost shifting increase
wealth for the rich and decrease it for
everyone else so it fits the experiments
design and in general it's kinda like a
short-term profit game for some very
small sum and a big cost for everyone
else
what about deregulating the labor market
well same process actually that was done
by simply criminal behavior the best
review of this I know is in Business
Week the Reagan administration ascent as
they point out essentially informed the
corporate world that they were not going
to enforce the laws there are laws you
know much hated laws like the Wagner Act
on that gives you the right to organize
and the Reagan administration simply
informed business they were none force
them so the number of illegal firings
went up by about a factor of six and
similarly across the board they also
informed business that were not going to
enforce the OSHA regulations
safety regulations so the number of days
lost to injury and the number of
injuries and so on also shot up and in
fact that was a great way to undermine
the unions and the right to organize
whole pile of policies like that which
was part of deregulating labor markets
another part of deregulation of labor
markets is to make them work what's
called more flexible meaning you don't
have any security and no guarantees
number of temporary workers goes right
up way up no benefits you never know if
you don't have a job tomorrow that's
really good for the economy that's good
for having jobs some of the most
profitable corporations the ones whose
way up on the fortune 500 list and
looming are the ones that what they call
cell manpower
you know like manpower incorporated
selling temps which is terrific for
making labor markets flexible happens to
destroy everybody's life but that
doesn't really matter it's again the
similarity the third world is very close
back in nineteen this is what's called
economic health and when you witness
carry those happens you call it an
economic miracle another technical term
so for example Brazil was a terrific
economic miracle under the neo-nazi
generals that we installed with great
self adulation back in the 60s and by
1971 it had become the Latin American
darling of the business community and
the President General ran place pointed
out that the economy is doing fine it's
just that the people aren't well we just
we have a Nobel Prize winner who just
won the Nobel Prize last years last time
Robert Lucas of Chicago and he was
interviewed by The Wall Street Journal
and said we've been doing great and have
been for a long time he didn't even
bother had what the Brazilian general
did it's only the people who aren't
doing well what he means by we is the
top 5%
maybe top 10% and that's right we've
been doing great we're doing fine the
economy is fine by now we don't even
worry about the fact that the people
aren't doing so well like bother
repeating the statistics which you know
and he knows perfectly well
okay that's economic miracles we're now
beginning to get one ourselves what
about privatization
well again the effects that are obvious
so say in the latest economic miracle in
Mexico privatization meant as usual
handing over public assets to friends of
the President or you know other rich
people or international investors at a
fraction of their cost and in fact in
Mexico the number of billionaires during
the economic miracle went up even faster
than the percentage of people on the
poverty line as some were doing well and
the people didn't happen to be doing so
well and in fact it was a catastrophe
for them even before the collapse
so that's privatization what about
property rights increase of property
rights that's very important in fact
it's a critical aspect of the what are
called misleadingly the free trade
agreements which actually have strong
protectionist elements in them Uruguay
round and NAFTA and so on and one of
them is increase of intellectual
property rights go into the details but
what it amounts to is guaranteeing that
major corporations have a monopoly on
the technology and knowledge of the
future and they extended those to the
various devices so that it's about 50
years before you can interfere with
owned property which comes from public
subsidy usually through research and
then is handed over to some private
corporation and there's a lot of
touching so increasing property rights
has a big effect highly protectionist
measure which is central to the new
trade agreement and has a long-lasting
effect way down the road on organizing
the International economy and who gains
and who loses a last element of the
Washington Consensus is reducing trade
barriers and here there's another scam
that you ought to keep your eyes on the
what's called trade and economic
is a very odd notion so for example if
Ford Motor Company moves parts from
Indiana at the Illinois for assembly and
then moves them back to Indiana that's
not called trade but if Ford Motor
Company takes parts in made in Indiana
and moves them across the border to
Mexico we can get much cheaper labor and
you have to worry about the you know
pollution and so on and they get
reassembled in Mexico and then sent back
to say Illinois for value-added
that's called exports and imports never
I didn't do with Mexican economy or in
fact any economy it was all internal to
the Ford Motor Company but its exports
and imports so how big an element is
that well about 50% of US trade so about
50% of what's called US trade is
actually internal to individual
corporations meaning controlled by a
very visible hand with all sorts of
methods around for distortion of markets
and you know robbery and so on and so
forth it's about the same for Japan and
for the world you know it's hard to get
numbers but what's estimated for the
world is around 40% of trade agreements
like say the Uruguay Round know yet if
that increases what's called trade what
it actually does is increase investor
rights that is it increases the power of
transnational corporations we have to
really look pretty closely to figure out
what the effect is on trade in any
meaningful sentence for example it may
it may increase cross-border operations
but decreased rate and a meaningful
sense of trade meaning something that's
not under the control of kind of
corporate mercantilism going on with
this it's perhaps worth noticing that
the very concept of capitalism and
markets has virtually disappeared so for
example if you take the current issue of
Foreign Affairs there's an article by
Joseph Nye of the Kennedy School and
maybe it's Dean at the Kennedy School
who explains that there's a big new
weapon in the hand
American diplomat American diplomats he
says has a diplomacy has a force
multiplier and the reason is because of
the attraction of democracy and free
market enthusiasms of the United States
that's given those things have given the
u.s. a real force multiplier then he
spells it out it comes from Cold War
investments in high technology
electronics aviation telecommunications
and so on
that's our free market enthusiasms and
democracy well where did electronics and
aviation and telecommunications come
from well from public funds didn't have
any do it free market they came from
public funds which were transferred to
high technology industry under the
conscious guys deceit of security and it
was conscious so Truman's first
secretary of the Air Force back in 1948
pointed out to Congress that the word to
use is not subsidy the word to use is
security and in fact the whole system
was designed that way and stays that way
so that's the tribute to democracy and
the free markets tributes of democracy
and free markets is you robbed the
public by deceit to pay but to enrich
the rich that's free markets and
democracy and it's published without
comment another article in and probably
nobody notices you know because the
because the concept of capitalism just
like the concept of democracy is just
gone knows what is democracy means
deceive people into doing what their
rich people want and markets means
making sure that make sure the public
subsidize the rich or to take another
example take say The Wall Street Journal
which think the last holdout remembers
what capitalism is well they had a front
lead article a couple of weeks ago on
various strategies that states meaning
like states of the union we're using to
try to be more business friendly and the
they pick two examples Virginia and
Maryland who are sort of competing and
to see hookans most sponsor
entrepreneurial
would be most business-friendly and so
on and they said well for a while it
looked like they have somewhat different
strategies that's why they were
describing turned that for a while
Maryland was doing better than it turned
out Virginia is doing better now and
Virginia is doing better they're more
business-friendly more gung-ho about
business and so on
all right you read the article turns out
it's not Virginia and Maryland what it
is is the suburbs of Washington some of
which are in Virginia and the others of
which are in Maryland and what are the
two business strategies entrepreneurial
strategies well the suburbs of
Washington figured they could rip off by
the National Institute of Health and the
others develop biology based industries
they were looking for biotechnology and
so on they figure that's going to be the
big cash cow and Virginia which is more
business-friendly decided that the old
cash cow the Pentagon would probably be
the best way to rip off public funds so
they were concentrating on electronics
and telecommunications and so on and it
turned out that Virginia had the better
strategy the better business strategy
they made a better guess about which
public funds to rob and that's what it
means to have entrepreneurial values and
it's again reported without comment this
just continues virtually without a break
no the New York I'll give you one last
example the New Yorker had a rather good
article actually you know they by now
the story about what's happening to the
economy into the population which used
to be what crazies on the Left talked
about it's now sort of hit the public
you know so you can read it in the
newspapers New Yorker had an article in
which they reviewed the figures on
decline of real wages and you know
increase in profits and the story you're
familiar with by a guy named Thomas
Cassidy wasn't a bad article actually
sort of repeated the familiar facts and
then he ended up by saying look no one's
to blame for this it's just the market
in its infinite and mysterious wisdom
just has these effects and there's
nothing you can do about it
they gave three examples exactly three
examples in the
the market in its infinite and
mysterious wisdom namely Grumman
McDonnell Douglas and Hughes Aircraft
you know maybe this is some kind of
subtle irony that I'm missing but these
are three prototypes of publicly
subsidized corporations Grumman Hughes
McDonnell Douglas they would exist for
two minutes if it wasn't for a huge
public subsidy so that's the market and
it's infinite and mysterious wisdom when
Clinton was announcing his grand vision
of the free market future at the APEC
conference in Seattle II did the same
thing it was in the Boeing terminal
that's where he announced it and he gave
Boeing Boeing as the example of the
grand vision of the free market future
and there were big headlines in all the
newspapers a lot of applause about our
love of the free market and so on it's
unnecessary to comment but it is kind of
interesting what it means is that the
concept of capitalism and markets has
disappeared as fully as the concept of
democracy which is an interesting fact
about the modern period and a kind of a
natural effect of you know of applying
the Washington Consensus at home because
you really have to drive out any
understanding of what's going on namely
that it's really existing free markets
that are being imposed well all of these
current measures share one fundamental
principle and I think it's really part
of it
firk well two two related fundamental
principles one is they transfer wealth
to the wealthy and the second is they
transfer a decision-making power to the
wealthy so all of them have the effect
just think of through what all every one
of them has the effect of putting more
power to make decisions into the hands
of unaccountable private tyrannies what
we call corporations basically
totalitarian institutions but they're on
it mostly unaccountable and that's the
effect I think through the examples
every case of the Washington Consensus
applied at home has exactly this effect
and a good part of the propaganda system
has the same goal in this case surely
conscious so the propaganda system is
design has been for years to demonize
unions which makes a lot of sense unions
are a democratizing force in which the
mass one of the few ways in which the
large mass of the population can pool
pool limited resources and work together
for some common good so that's that bad
thing democracy so naturally you want to
demonize and destroy unions and that's
been going on forever and the other
leading propaganda theme and I don't
mean by that you know like just would
hear in the newspaper reading the
newspaper and so on like the
entertainment industry and television
and everything else
the is anti politics meaning setting up
a picture it's called any politics the
picture is a very specific kind of anti
politics you have to establish the image
you know get into people's heads that
the government is the enemy federal
government state governments are okay
because they can be sort of controlled
by business anyway so it doesn't matter
but the federal government sometimes a
little too big to be pushed around so
it's the enemy and it cannot be nobody
can dream of the possibility that the
government is of By and For the People
that's impossible it's an enemy to be
hated and feared not there are a lot
things wrong with it but that's not
what's wrong with it from their point of
view is it has a big defect it's
potentially influenceable by the
population and big enough to stand up
against private power and that's the
detail so you have to regard it as the
enemy
it cannot be of by and for the people
it's kind of a them versus us business
this is them is the government which is
the enemy us is all of us nice people no
server working man loyal wife maybe
that's your job these days that
hard-working executive toiling 20 hours
a day for the benefit of all the
friendly bankers out there trying to
find give you money that's us and then
there's them them is the Outsiders the
unamerican you know the agitators union
organizers big government and so on and
so of us versus them that's the picture
that has been rammed into people's head
for at least 50 or 60 years by intensive
propaganda everywhere
movies television textbooks just
constant and not by accident this is
this part is all extremely conscious we
have a huge public relations industry
which spends billions of dollars a year
on exactly the sort of thing
unconsciously they can tell you that
well why is it happening now not say 30
years ago one proposal is it's the
market and it's mysterious wisdom we can
put that aside this is perfectly
conscious social policy and also hints
under social control second is we live
in lean and mean times we got it tighten
their belts complete nonsense so my view
is look at the business press they're
just ecstatic no one have been for years
Businessweek just came out a couple of
days ago with the annual issue on the
top 1000 corporations the headline is
1995 was one for the books
America's most NASA America's most
valuable companies grew even more
valuable by a record 35 percent that's
these lean and mean times were in
another headline in Business Week reads
the problem now what to do with all that
cash as the coffers of corporate America
are overflowing with surging profits
another one talks about the government
really great government it says the
Gingrich Congress represents a milestone
for business never before have so many
goodies been showered so
enthusiastically on America's
entrepreneurs the headline of that one
incidentally is return to the trenches
you know like we got a ask more feeding
frenzy has to go on from the nanny state
fortune magazine you know they're their
big business journal I mean they can't
even find the adjectives in the last
couple of years to describe what's going
on one year it's dazzling you know the
next year is stupendous I mean I'm
waiting for the fortune 500 issue see
what adjectives they come out with next
week what they've been double digit
profit growth for unheralded four years
with pretty stagnant sales and
fortunately wages going down CEO
salaries are going through the roof and
it's uncorrelated with performance it's
another interesting aspect of it now
studies of it so just some other thing
there's nothing to it the markets or
anything else the I mean while wages
continue to decline as does family
income and so on well you know nobody
who even looks at the business press can
believe that there are lean and mean
times as I said the country is just
awash with capital their problem is in
order to do with it so therefore get
more another theme that's around now is
you have to have what's called
downsizing in order to be competitive
well the Bureau of Labor Statistics came
out with its figures up to last year
they have him forward 1993 from 80 from
1983 to 1993 the category of executives
managers and administrative personnel
grew 30% okay
that's downsizing the fastest-growing
white-collar population happens to be
security guard well yeah that's
connected with turning it into a third
world country you take a walk down San
Salvador you know you'll see plenty of
security good you know rich people
actually protected and furthermore all
these prisons you're throwing people
into they need security guards so yeah
there's their administrative personnel
and that's increasing but so our name in
corporations there's no downsizing going
on except for working people that's
quite different why is it happening now
anyway those are let's go back to why
it's happening now well the fact is it's
always going on just depending on the
weapons at hand business American
business particularly is highly class
conscious and very open about it
incidentally and it's always fighting a
bitter class war you go back a century
ago into what were called the gay 90's
when incidentally the international
economy was about as interesting the
International economy was pretty much as
like it is now in terms of capital flows
and so on hasn't become more globalized
in terms of trade and capital flow and
so on
was then even be less so the about a
century ago it looked as if the game was
over you know they were talking about
the end of history perfection had been
reached in the devil take the hindmost
society where everybody's for themselves
enriched yourselves and so on it was
monstrous for working people very brutal
in fact here that was a century ago
well yeah didn't and no in Europe
particularly the social contract was
slowly imposed not easily it didn't
happen here by the Roaring Twenties as
they were called labor had no voice this
is the you know the age of mass
production Mabuse and so on labor was
out of it it was a business run society
almost completely and it looked
permanent again you know utopia the
masters and of history all this talk the
1930s it proved to be wrong there was a
lot of popular organizing popular
protest it rammed through elements of
the social contract that had been
achieved in Europe decades earlier and
that just caused hysteria in the
business community you read the business
press it was talking about you know the
hazard facing manufacturers and the
rising political power of the masses and
how we're gonna face disaster unless we
figure out some way to reverse this and
control their minds and control them and
so on a huge propaganda campaign began
right after the Wagner Act was packed
passed 1935 in in those in the next two
years the National Association of
Manufacturers its public relations
budget multiplied by a factor of twenty
no as they recognize the force alone is
not going to be enough u.s. has a very
violent labor history and plenty of the
workers were getting killed but it was
clear that this wasn't going to be
enough they had to have huge propaganda
it was sort of put on BET's when all
this harmony business that I was talking
about guttin designed you know it was a
specific design as to how to carry out
what they called scientific methods of
strikebreaking by controlling
communities and so on well I was put on
hold during the war and then it picked
up right after the Second World War was
over
with an enormous propaganda campaign I
mean you can't believe the scale until
you look at it and the purpose was very
explicit the purpose was to win the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
which have to be indoctrinated with the
capitalist story as we sell our
preferred way of life and on and on
these are others quotes from mainstream
PR literature and it was very
substantial and aimed precisely at what
I described I mean they described what
they're doing and you can see it in the
propaganda schools entertainment
industry everything else well what
happened in the 1970s but what happened
is there were some changes in the
International economy and in technology
and so on which just put new weapons
into the hands of the Masters one
crucial factor which everyone points to
is an enormous growth in financial
capital financial transactions it just
boomed short-range financial
transactions that came about partly
because of the dismantling of the
post-war Bretton Woods system of
regulated currencies which kind of made
currencies free-floating the Nixon
administration just dismantled it partly
it came about for technical reasons I
mean the telecommunications revolution
which was of course publicly subsidized
at that point made it possible to
transfer funds very rapidly also like
you can about it by now it's estimated
around trillion dollars a day just shift
up and back from one market to another
very short term transactions all in a
heap and aimed it's something they're
all aimed at low growth and high profits
and low wages and that's a that is a
factor that's driving policy in that
direction I don't think it's many means
an uncontrollable factor but it is a
it's definitely a factor and let's just
put a lot and the changes are in the in
the composition of capital transactions
are very striking around from about
maybe the time when you have data like
late 19th century up till about 1970
rough estimate was that about 90 percent
of capital
first had to do with the real economy
you know with investment and trade 10%
speculation by 1990 the figures had
reversed by 1995 the latest I'm dead you
know UN Economic Commission estimate was
about five percent real economy 95
percent speculation short-term
speculation like against currencies
which is essentially aimed at driving
down growth and increasing profits and
lowering wages this was understood very
quickly by the late 70s and there were
proposals made for example by James
Tobin Yale economist Nobel Prize winner
at an American Economic Association
presidential address 1978 simply
suggested a simple reform low tax very
low tax on short-term financial
transactions just to slow it down you
know throw a little sand in the gears
probably work it's been called the Tobin
tax but it's not getting anywhere
because the weapon is a very important
one that weapon has been used very
efficiently for all the purposes
they've been described and there are
other things I is it out of control is
there nothing we can do well there's no
reason to believe that I mean elementary
reforms like say the Tobin tax could
have maybe a big effect furthermore more
globally all of these interchanges as I
mentioned the International economy is
not more integrated by most measures
than it was a hundred years ago in fact
less in many respect and the
transactions that are going on are
mostly within the big three regions
United States Japan and Europe now
that's under political control you know
that's not out of political control
democratic societies in the these three
areas could control this the idea that
it's somehow you know kind of impossible
to control over the world that's just
not true you look at the flows they're
internal to the highly developed rich
societies where theoretically there are
democratic governments and could impose
all sorts of restrictions for them were
all talk about corporate greed and
everything is
crucially beside the point in my point
of view I think and should be recognized
as a very big regression from what
working people and a lot of others
understood very well a century ago talk
about corporate greed is nonsense
corporations are greedy by their nature
there's no such you know nothing nothing
else there are instruments for
interfering with markets to maximize
profit and wealth and give market
control you can't make them more or less
greedy I mean maybe you can sort of
force them it's like taking a
totalitarian state I'm saying be less
brutal well yeah maybe you can get a
totalitarian state to be less brutal but
that's not the point the point is not to
get a tyranny to be less brutal but to
get rid of it now like 150 years ago
that was understood I mean if you read
the labor press there was a very lively
labor press right around here you know
Lowell Lawrence in places like that
around the mid 19th century run by
artisans and what they call factory
girls young women from the farms who
were working there and they weren't
asking the autocracy to be less brutal
they were saying get rid of it you know
the and in fact that makes perfect sense
these are not these are human
institutions you know there's nothing
graven in stone about them they're
created early in this century with their
present powers they come from the same
intellectual roots as the other modern
forms of totalitarianism namely
Stalinism and fascism and they have no
more legitimacy than they do so it's not
a I mean yeah let's try and make them
make the autocracy less brutal if that's
the short term possibility but we should
have the sophistication of say factory
girls in Lowell 150 years ago and
recognize that this is just degrading
and intolerable and that as they put it
those who work in the mills girona and
on everything else and that's democracy
you don't know that you don't have the
money
you
