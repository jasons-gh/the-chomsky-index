Donald Davidson in a paper called a nice
derangement of epitaphs epitaphs said or
basically argued that there's no such
thing as language and I've always sort
of thought that you probably you may not
want to admit it but on some level or
other you probably agree with that right
no in fact I think he ended up
contradicting him so I think there's
some discussion of it in here or
somewhere if you look at the end of the
paper
turns out he's proposing that there is a
notion of language in the technical
sense technical sets of an internal
generative procedure that relates sounds
and meanings and so on he says there's
no notion of language in another sense
the sense of some community property or
whatever well okay first of all I don't
think that's true it's just it's not a
scientifically usable sense but I think
the paper is just rife with confusions
I've written about so you think there
are such things as languages yeah
there's such an informal like there's
such things as the meaning of life you
know I understand it when people ask
what's the meaning of life so yeah
there's such a thing as the meaning of
life there's such a thing as the
financial crisis in Argentina
you know there are all kind of things in
the world but if you want to proceed to
understand what you and I are doing
those notions just don't help you've got
to look at it differently the way we
look at primates other primates and say
well let me read a quote from something
you wrote recently okay we say I doubt
that people think that among the
constituents of the world are entities
that are simultaneously abstract and
concrete like books and banks or that
have the amalgam of properties we
discover when we explore the meanings of
even the simplest words like river
person city etc you think the average
person take leave and that's a technical
question okay it's a question if you try
to figure out what a person's folk
science is you know how people think the
world is actually constituted of
entities which is not do I talk about
books of course we talk about books we
talk about the meaning of life and so on
but if you ask people well you know how
do you think the world really works
that's probably that's no science right
like you go to some other community and
you try to figure out what what's their
idea about how the world works like
maybe the classical Greeks thought
Apollo who pulls the Sun through the sky
or something that's their folk
scientific picture of how the world
works
that's a hard topic you can't just do
armchair philosophy about it that's why
ethno scientists have to work you know
and when they work what they find
if I think if they worked on people like
us instead of just talking about it in a
you know in the common room they would
discover that our folk science yours and
mine does not include entities that are
simultaneously abstract and concrete and
does not include entities like the
meaning of life that doesn't mean we
can't talk about I'm sure we talk about
them all the time but we don't least I
don't and I presume other people don't
think of them as constituents of the way
the world operates these are we don't do
that when we're talking to each other
informally now that sounds a little bit
more moderate than than what you've said
elsewhere here's a passage from I
believe this is from new horizons we say
in the domain where questions of realism
arise in a serious way in the context of
the search for laws of nature objects
are not conceived from the peculiar
perspectives provided by the concepts
accounts absolutely right see but
there's several different enterprises
you have to distinguish your and I don't
I don't think it's more or less moderate
it's about a different topic when you're
trying to understand something about the
nature of the world you and I anybody
you start with some kind of what's
called folk science almost every society
we know has some picture of the way the
world works which is more or less
commonly shared if you try to do this
more reflectively and carefully and you
know bringing in other criteria and
probably being bringing in other
cognitive faculties we don't know that
for sure but I suspect it then it
becomes the enterprise of science which
is a different
press and a peculiar one that's not folk
science it's science that works in other
ways this comment has to do with our
culture in which the enterprise of
science is understood right our you know
intellectual culture and in that when we
try to find out how the world works we
discard the concepts of common sense
very quickly but it sounds to me here
like what you're saying is that the only
things that are real right are the
things that science tells us are real so
that sounds like what you're saying here
is that well this table isn't real but
maybe you know who are real is in the
honorific term okay you use anyway like
I mean to say that if I say something is
true and then I add well it's the real
truth I'm not saying there are two
different kinds of truth the truth and
the real truth I'm just emphasizing what
I said and the term real is basically
used honorific ly so yeah you can use it
on terrifically in various ways if we're
trying to find out the way the world
works and that really understand it in
the manner of the sciences we very
quickly give up common sense notions if
we're carrying out folk science you know
less reflectively probably using
different cognitive faculties we also
give up common sense notions but in
different ways well you can sail a lot
of them in claims about something being
honorific like real being honorific I
mean Alan Gibbard for example has argued
that terms like a rational are honorific
or moral or honorific no I don't agree
with it I think real is quite do what's
the difference in these cases there
because I think rationality is something
that we can understand and morality is
something real and it's part of us and
we can try to figure out what it is we
can try to figure out what our moral
faculties are we understand something
about what rational action is but about
reality we have to ask what we're
talking about right and if we're talking
about reality in the enterprise of
trying to discover the way the world
works in a
physics department or a linguistics
department or whatever common sense
notions are irrelevant if we're trying
to explore our intuitive understanding
of the way the world works common the
common sense notions are relevant but we
discard them if you have if you're using
it in a more informal way like is the
meaning of life really as your okay well
look there's there's a sort of space
between ethno science and science right
and common sense and all of those and
it's been explored by philosophers for
for 2,500 years and it's called
metaphysics right no it's different okay
so yeah that is a question about
whatever science is a branch of science
right ethno science is the branch of
science that tries to figure out what
people's beliefs are about the way the
world works right metaphysics is not I
understand that but do you think that
metaphysics is impossible science is
metaphysics ok good let's talk about
what the world is made of all right so
but then the question is why do you
think that science gets to claim what's
real now let me give you an example so
in a scientific image Basilan frozen is
a scientific anti-realist so he says the
things posited by science
quarks etcetera are not real but
midsized earthbound objects they're real
now you've got the flip side of that
right I don't have any side because I
don't think the word real is sensible
enough to use on they're all real in
different senses if you're trying to
understand the way the world actually
works whether you're a bus and frozen or
you or me we're going to go to the
scientists because they tell us how the
world really works if we're interested
in exploring people's common-sense
beliefs we'll go to the ethno scientist
so let's see what they discovered we're
interested in something like whether
there are events or whether there are
properties or whether there are
neurological sums or something well
let's take events which plays a
prominent role in modern semantics right
so here you can ask a lot of different
questions for one thing you can ask
whether in say David Sounion cymatics
where there's a lot of or anything that
developed from an event based semantics
whether the things whether what are
called events are internal to the mind
or out
hit right but I think they're internal
to the mind can't they be both well they
could but then were asking another
question if we're asking well how do
these things that are internal to the
mind relate to something the outside
world will say okay let's take a look at
what you mean by an event so for example
is the American Revolution an event
yeah it was a important event in history
does that event include the fact that
the man who the indigenous population
called the town destroyer took off a
little time in the middle of the
revolution to destroy the Iroquois
civilization is that part of the event
called the American Revolution well not
when you study in school you know you
want to find out about that event you go
to probably the Iroquois remember but
the ones that were left or you've got to
look it's a serious scholarly history
then you find out that one part of what
was going on in the event that we call
the American Revolution was a side
operation in 1979 to wipe out the
Iroquois civilization so that the
colonies could expand if they got rid of
the British well as that part of the
event or isn't it well you know here
come hard questions about you what we're
really going to call events in the
outside world and those questions don't
have answers because they are you know
they're highly dependent on our
interests our perspective our goals you
know all kinds of factors so I don't
think we're going to find external
events in any sense worth pursuing like
for investigation will those external
events just be complicated object the
anything you like but it is is what is
the town destroyers exploit part of the
American Revolution or isn't it well
that event it's not you choice but
there's no answer yeah but now it sounds
like you're saying that well I have
representations of events right the
representations you have representations
I have representation I guess there's
some which we formally call events right
but now one might ask what on earth is a
representation it's not a representation
of well see that's a mistake that uh
comes from a philosophical tradition the
way the term represent is used in the
philosophical tradition
it's a relation between an internal
object and an external object it's not
the way it's used either in ordinary
speech or in the sciences so when when a
perceptual psychologists say that talks
about an internal representation of you
know a cube or something they don't have
being a cube there they're talking about
something that's going on in the head in
fact what they may be studying and
usually our study is a relation between
things like Kista scopic presentations
and the internal events there's no queue
but nevertheless they talk about it in
the internal representation I mean the
concept internal representation is that
in here the concept internal
representation is used in the sciences
and I think that's ordinary speech too
in ways which don't involve a relation
between an internal thing and an
external thing I mean that derives from
a particular interpretation the theory
of ideas you know which said though
ideas represent something else yeah I
should interjections anyway I should say
that that's not the interpretation of
the theory ideas that were given by the
people who used it so let say Hume for
example I quote him in their wedding
breath he raises a serious empirical
question he says a it's about the nature
of the terms uses the identity that we
ascribe to things meaning how do we
individuate things right and he asks the
question well is this a peculiar nature
common to the thing or is it what he
calls fictitious a construction of the
mind right and he says fictitious there
is no entity there is no common nature
there's no nature common the thing there
is a construction of the mind which we
used to talk about the world but he's
not real things I mean he was not an
ideal he was not an ideal and I'm not
here he's saying we interact he believes
there's an external world up here
there's a coffee cup on the table and so
on but he says that the he's talking
about the individuation of things how we
organize things how we construct their
picture of the world right and that
involves the way our minds work and that
doesn't mean the world in there
no it's just what his predecessors call
their cognitive powers which use the
data of sense to construct an account of
the world and he's saying well you want
to look at the identity of thing the
identity that we ascribe to things like
what makes us call something a bullet or
an event and so on he's saying was
fictitious in the sense that it's a
construction of the mind based on the
data of sense that's not an idealist
position in fact that's the position of
modern science because people will call
you a crypto idealist then they're
misunderstanding what ideal is okay let
me there's an issue that I wanted I
wanted to get to here and this involves
the thing we mentioned about
representations and whether
representation requires there being
something that it is a representation of
now in a very important and somewhat
influential book by saul kripke there's
a revival of the sort of vidcon's dhania
argument but about rule-following let me
just read the relevant passage here so
in that book cookie says if statements
attributing rule-following or neither to
be regarded as stating facts nor to be
thought of explaining our behavior would
seem that the use of the idea of rules
and competence in linguistics need
serious reconsideration even if these
notions are not rendered meaningless I
know you've written written I mean
village' fine crucial words if right
okay and beyond and the fact is that in
the way in the sense in which the term
rule is used in for thousands of years
in fact in the study of language it's
not the kind of really had in mind so if
somebody if you read a book you know you
study Latin let's say or you studied it
a thousand years ago they would have a
rule that tells you you know when D is
the ablative case or something right
that's not a rule in vidiians nonsense
it's a description of a part of the
language right so the questions about
rule following just don't arrive but we
don't need to get hung up on the rules
and so I just would east or not I
understand that but in a certain sense
he's talking about any sort of
computational state but there so take
take just a computer alright forget
about human beings for a second see
computers are different story okay let
me just let me get into it yeah okay
yeah so what what why aren't these
questions asked about insect right I
mean insect when you study into
so you attribute to them computational
stage right is that a problem
I'm is it not real like if you say that
an insect is doing you know is
determining the position of the Sun as a
function of the time of year and time of
day and here's the computation it's
using isn't that why isn't that science
that would be but the argument would be
that the reason you can get away with
that is because you're talking about
what its contagions that you're
attributing to the insect our external
istic glean anger and that is you
couldn't do it in less do you see where
you had an investment true you could do
it in an experimental situation in which
you have a light and in fact if you knew
how to do it you could do it by
stimulating the external sensory organs
of the insect it would all be interior
there isn't there's not be a Sun there
no it's just that yeah you're talking
about it the way it happens actually in
the real world but the same thing that
you would say the same thing in an
experimental setting where you don't
have an external world well because
you're talking about the internal
construct computations of the insect on
the occasion right of since notice
doesn't matter what's out there other
seating not as the shift there though
because you went from saying I you went
from saying you don't need the Sun in
the experimental setting to say and you
don't say there you could run the
experiment in in a world that didn't
have the Sun and that's a different
story
right that's not a different story the
point is if you look at what insect
scientists are studying they're studying
what 17th century philosophers used to
call the constructions of the mind on
the occasion of sense right now it
happens that in the world that they're
looking at the occasions of sense happen
to be related the fact that there's
something 93 million miles away but the
study could go on as if it's what
Hillary called a brain and of that and
the studies are internalist i because we
know anything else does study but this
is disputed right i mean there is this
dispute about David Marr right I mean
there's two stories on this - Tyler
Burge and Martin Davis for example argue
that maras sort of fraught with
externalist sort of yeah but they're
just miss reading him okay I mean in
fact the have to know more personally
but I'm not sure if he was here he would
say the
if you look at the informal exposition
in mar in mars vision let's a book
vision look at the informal exposition
in order to motivate what he's doing he
says well you know imagine you know an
elephant or some of their anything like
a stick figure and you're trying to and
you we want to know how that thing out
there is interpreted by the visual
system as you know some
three-dimensional object however if you
look at the experiment experimental
procedures of more that in have
elephants out there in fact what they
were using was to guess the scopes and
if they saw where they were having you
know dots on screens and if they had
known how to stimulate the optic nerve
that would then that when you go from
the informal exposition to the actual
science you see that like everything
else it's a study of the internal nature
of the beast and in fact you know in
they would have loved to get to the
point where they could tell you
something about how you identify a you
know an elephant but they never going to
write near that however even if they did
it wouldn't matter whether the elephant
is there or not it would matter what
sensory what's the occasion of sense
again the 17th century formulation of
this was I think quite appropriate on
the occasion of sense the cognitive that
sounds archaic but the cognitive powers
of the mind construct complicated
internal structures which have all sorts
of properties and Gestalt properties
what Hume later called the identity that
we ascribe to things and so on and that
looks correct and that's the way modern
science looks at it the fact that the
informal expositions taught you know to
sort of motivate what you're doing talk
about identifying objects on the outside
that's fine but you have to know how to
distinguish in formal expositions from
the actual scientific program and if you
look the actual program then ever looked
at things outside aside from tickets to
scopic images because they're as close
as you can get to the occasion of sins
