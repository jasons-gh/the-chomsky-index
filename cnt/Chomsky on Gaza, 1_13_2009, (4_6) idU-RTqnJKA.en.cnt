so for example I doubt that there are
many people here who think that Nazi
Germany had a right to defend itself
against the terrorism of the partisans
which was quite real Kristen often 1938
was not justified by the fact that
Hershel Greenspun assassinated a German
embassy official in Paris the British
were not justified in terrorizing Irish
Catholics in response to Ira terror and
incidentally when they finally sensibly
turned to the sensible policy of
addressing legitimate grievances in the
territory they occupied the terror ended
it's not a matter of proportionality
that widely used word it's a matter of
choice of action in the first place
proportional or not is there a more
justified response than violence
forgetting proportionality well any
resort the force always carries a heavy
burden of proof and in every case
including the present case we have to
ask whether it can be met can it be met
in the case of Israel's effort to quell
any resistance to its criminal actions
both in Gaza and in the West Bank where
the criminal actions continue
relentlessly perhaps I may quote myself
if you don't mind in an interview in the
Israeli press a couple of years ago on
all martes announced convergence plans
for the West Bank what I said is that
the US and Israel do not tolerate any
resistance to these plans preferring to
pretend falsely of course that there is
no partner as they proceed with programs
that go back a long way we may recall
that Gaza and the West Bank are
recognized to be a unit so if resistance
to the us-israeli annexation Canton
ization programs is legitimate in the
West Bank than it is in Gaza too I think
that's correct
the respected a separate question is
whether the modality of resistance is
legitimate the totally separate question
we may agree that Hershel Greene spend
committed a criminal act and that the
partisans committed terror but there's
nothing to do with the question whether
Germany had a right to respond with
force same in the British case so those
are just two questions that should be
separated well dr. Mustafa Barghouti is
highly respected Palestinian
parliamentarian and official he reported
that since George Bush's Annapolis
extravaganza in november two thousand
seven may recall much impressive
rhetoric about dedication to peace and
justice he reports that since november
two thousand seven Israeli attacks on
Palestinians escalated sharply with an
almost fifty percent increase in the
West Bank along with a sharp increase in
settlements and Israeli checkpoints
quite obviously these criminal actions
are not a response to rockets from Gaza
although the converse may will be the
case as he in fact suggests Israel has a
straightforward means to defend itself
easy put an end to the criminal actions
and they occupied territories that means
except the long-standing international
consensus on a two-state settlement on
the international border with perhaps
minor mutual modifications that's has
been a overwhelming international
consensus for over 30 years blocked by
the united states and by israel that
began officially in 1976 washington's
first veto of a Security Council
resolution calling for a two-state
settlement I'm not going to run through
the rest of the record there's no time
but it's very clear today us-israeli
rejection ism is
even more blatant than it has been in
the past in part because of the Arab
League's formal proposal for a
settlement that goes beyond the
international consensus calling for a
normalization of relations ation of
relations with Israel every time you see
the word Hamas in the newspapers it's
accompanied by Iranian supplied Hamas
not us supplied Israel and Hamas which
is committed to the destruction of
Israel which you don't read is Hamas
which long ago joined the international
consensus on a two-state settlement that
the US and Israel bar that would be
excluded in the Free Press biased but
it's a fact so the Arab League calling
for normalization Hamas is calling for a
two-state settlement Iran and Hezbollah
have made it clear explicitly that they
will not they will abide by any
agreement the Palestinians accept that
leaves the United States and Israel in
splendid isolation both in Word and also
of course in actions they're acting to
undermine it and make it impossible day
by day now there is one exception
crucial exception to the persistent
rejection ISM of the United States and
Israel you'll recall that in two
thousand year 2000 there were
negotiations in Camp David which
collapsed contrary to the standard story
that President Clinton recognized that
the us-israeli proposals at Camp David
were quite unacceptable and in december
two thousand he presented what he called
his parameters they were kind of vague
but they were more forthcoming you could
at least imagine a settlement in those
terms clinton also pointed out in a
speech in which he pointed out that both
sides had accepted the parameters and at
both sides had reservations they then
met
in Taba Egypt in january two thousand
one to resolve the differences and they
came very close to a settlement in fact
in their final press conference they
said if they had a few more days they
could have reached a settlement the
negotiations were cancelled at that
point by Prime Minister Barack of Israel
that's the one break in 30 years of us
Israeli rejection ISM and I should say
that it's not that many years ago
there's no reason why that one break
can't be resumed if an American
president decides to allow it to be
resumed in which case there will be
those shrieks from the famed Israeli
Lobby just as there were none at that
time and it could easily be implemented
well it's up to us to determine well
that I've just reported the facts it can
easily firm the I'd urge that you verify
them it's not that hard give you the
sources if you like but there's a
preferred version which as usual is
quite different from the facts the
preferred virgin quote ethan bronner the
New York Times correspondent in Israel a
preferred version is that many abroad
recall mr. Baracus the prime minister
who in two thousand went further than
any other Israeli leader in peace offers
to the Palestinian only to see the deal
fail and explode in a violent
Palestinian uprising that drove him from
power well he's partly right it's true
that many abroad believe these fairy
tales thanks to it Brunner and all too
many of his colleagues called journalism
there's also a narrower question than
the one I've just been discussing let's
the narrower question puts aside
resistance to Israel's ongoing West Bank
crimes and again when I say Israel I
mean us Israel crime
because can't be done without us
authorization and material and
diplomatic and in fact ideological
support so put a put aside all that and
just consider Gaza alone does Israel
have peaceful alternatives to the use of
force in response to attacks on its
territory just keeping to Gaza alone
well the answer is it surely does it
could accept the ceasefire sometimes in
fact it has accept the deceased fire
while instantly violating it the most
recent case crucial case is jun 2008
there was a ceasefire that was
instituted it called for opening the
border crossings quoting to allow the
transfer of all goods that were banned
and restricted to go into Gaza Israel
agreed but immediately announced that it
would not open the borders until Hamas
released gilad shalit an Israeli soldier
who was captured by Hamas in June 2006
and that ceasefire well that's another
mantra incidentally everybody's heard
about you lot shall eat than the
terrible crime of capturing him and how
till he's released you know how can you
move towards peace but that's just more
hypocrisy
