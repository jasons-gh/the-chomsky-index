since the 1970s post-modernism has had a
great deal of influence on at least part
of the left in this country and it has
been characterized by among other things
as being quite critical of science and
of the Enlightenment tradition I wonder
if you could talk about your view of
post-modernism and whether you think
that its influence is waning that says a
lot of postmodern work I just don't
understand so I can't comment on it
seems to me some exercise by
intellectuals who were talking to each
other in very obscure ways and I can't
follow it then I don't know if anybody
else can post moderate views of science
by and large have been pre embarrassing
I think there's some interesting work on
this miss a book by two physicists genre
Klaw and Allen socal both of them have
to be political radicals just running
through it's mostly Paris post-modernism
what postmodern commentators have said
about science and it is really
embarrassing I mean to the extent you
can understand it I mean on the other
hand there is a point
I mean insofar as they say that
everything that people do is some kind
of social construction depends on the
historical context the cultural context
you know that part's true I don't know
if you need to hold postmodern baggage
to say those things
my feeling is not at least personally I
haven't seen anything that it doesn't
seem to me it has to be said in anything
with mono Souls it looks as far as I
understand that it's pretty
straightforward and I get the feeling
that it's kind of there isn't a drive
among intellectuals to make things look
difficult it's a kind of self-protection
I mean
what I'm doing can be done by you know
the guy who is repairing my furnace okay
then Who am I and then there's those
physicists over there who took
complicated things and have to I don't
understand so I'd like to be like them
you know that drive is clearly there and
I think it should be resisted I wouldn't
say think simply so that people can
understand and we should
