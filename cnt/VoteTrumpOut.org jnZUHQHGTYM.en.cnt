another four years of trump
may literally lead us to the stage where
the survival of organized human society
is deeply imperiled
the most important issue that humans
have faced in their
history is the impending
catastrophic climate disaster
according to a new report experts say
that we have until 2030
to avoid catastrophe trump is the worst
person in the world on this issue
all of this with the global warming and
that and a lot of it's a hoax it's a
hoax
so we have a choice between trying to
find a way to survive
or ensuring disaster that's just the
beginning
the traditional left position is you
don't vote for you vote against
it doesn't matter how i feel
it doesn't matter whether you like biden
or not that's your personal feelings are
relevant nobody cares about that
what they care about is what happens to
the world
have to get rid of trump keep pressure
on biden
just as sanders and associates have been
doing
politics is activism not taking five
minutes to push a button
look what's happening in the streets of
the country the greatest
social movement that has ever developed
led by black lives matter take sunrise
movement
managed to put the green new deal on the
legislative agenda
this generation is going to decide
whether
organized human society can survive
and the crucial part of this decision
is to get rid of the major
barrier to survival which happens to be
in the white house
get rid of trump then we have
opportunities
