thank you
well I don't have to tell you that
Columbia is a tragic country and also a
wonderful country with amazing promise
unfulfilled promise unfortunately very
rich in resources enormous biological
diversity no nearby external enemies has
every possibility to become flourishing
and flourishing and productive society
but it has been plagued with
extraordinary violence and terror at
last there do seem to be some signs of
possible internal reconciliation
thinking about the negotiations underway
in Havana and one can only hope that the
prospects will not be sacrificed that
bitter hatreds and fears which are
understandable enough it can be brought
under control and that an atmosphere of
tolerance and mutual respect can be
cultivated despite the shocking history
recent history of depravity and
destruction my own first visit to
Colombia was 15 years ago I was part of
an amnesty international delegation that
year and this international selected as
its task for the year protection of
human rights defenders and the first
country they went to understandably was
Colombia which had absolutely the worst
record by far and
to protect human rights defenders we as
we landed the News reported attempted
assassination of a legislator by a
bazooka
in in Bogota she survived her her
bodyguards were killed as we left a law
student an American law student who had
been with us went into hiding because he
had gone to visit a village with some
human rights activists to talk to a
victim of government our military
repression and he had witnessed an
assassination which made him a marked
man so he had to go into hiding and by
various means we managed to sneak him
out of the country I met some remarkable
people among them father
Javier Geraldo who you know he's an
astonishing record and discovering
revealing and forcing investigation of
major human rights atrocities his book
Colombia a genocidal democracy is
indispensable and I met other priests
human rights activists engaged in
various activities like trying to carve
out zones of peace free of terror our
military military terror overwhelming
the majority of the terror at the time
have also managed to meet the president
of the Colombian permanent Committee on
human rights the distinguished diplomat
Alfredo Vasquez Terry Sousa we visited
him in his heavily guarded home
bodyguards all over high-security often
threatened with death returned to his
account of the roots of the
in terror last fifty years I've taken a
couple of other trips mostly to Kalka la
Vega and Kalka on with human rights
activists from Colombia in the United
States on one trip we wanted to talk to
peasants but we couldn't go outside of
Papa Yan the local town because there's
too much violence outside so people came
in from the countryside were brought in
with horrible stories people had been
victimized by what's called here a
fumigation means chemical warfare which
is designed to essentially destroy
everything maybe it killed some coca
plants but it kills everything else too
they some of them had kind of carved out
a niche for the coffee farming is very
difficult profession because the United
States has blocked efforts to establish
a coffee cartel which could stabilize
prices it's done for commodities that
the US is interested in but we wouldn't
allow it for them and if prices
fluctuate small farmers can't survive of
course agribusiness can but a farmer
can't tell his children don't bother
eating this year maybe we'll have food
next year but they had managed some of
them had managed to carve out a niche in
Europe for high-quality coffee that was
destroyed by the chemical warfare of
course those lands can never be used
again in the near future the idea is
based on you see people with horrible
sores children dying and so on awful
tales the another and another visit
which was having to be perfect
personally quite meaningful to me just a
couple years ago and went to a small
village called something eat dough it's
a couple of miles off the pan-american
highway through a virtually impassable
Road as you get near the village
there's a little clearing with a row of
crosses where a couple dozen people were
murdered by our militaries a few years
earlier the first visit to something
Rita had to be cancelled because there
was too much violence in the area but
then a couple months later they said it
was safe so I went father Corrado again
and us human rights activists and they
were the reason for going was partly
personal but partly what they were doing
it was they were trying to protect their
lands from mining operations which would
destroy everything of course there's a
mountain above the village which they
won which they needed for for water
supplies and other resources the mining
companies and the government wanted to
destroy it the personal part was that
they were dedicating the mountain to my
late wife she had never been there but
I'd been there a couple of times so we
had a ceremony and the compassion and
kindness of these simple compass Eno's
and indigenous people was something
pretty hard to forget the people and
I've been there a couple other times
similar visits the I should say that we
were helped enormous ly by the Kaka
Ombudsman who arranged the trip and you
know gave us those heavy cars that can
go through these impassable roads and
got us there and so on I'm pretty
impressive people well the population is
plagued with multiple curses
paramilitary military terror major one
development projects that destroy their
lives what's called the drug war which
is essentially nothing to do with drugs
that may has no effect on the price and
availability of drugs that's been known
for decades it continues one expert
commentator on it
Charles Bergquist a noted scholar
pointed out that a good case that can be
can be made that the u.s. drug war is
designed for two purposes to control a
what are called the dangerous classes in
the United States might have mostly
black males long history of this and to
to lay the basis for counter insurgency
operations abroad that's a pretty
plausible argument and it's very hard
otherwise to explain why the same
policies are carried out for forty years
when they are known to be ineffective
and when their policies that are much
cheaper and are known to be effective
which aren't used like prevent
prevention and treatment the United
States is now as you know probably
almost isolated in the hemisphere and
its insistence on maintaining the drug
war which had a devastating effect in
Latin America Mexico in recent years
Colombia and here is basically a used
for incarceration of mostly black males
incarceration rate has skyrocketed since
the drug war was designed it's designed
on very racist grounds quite explicitly
but it continues and the the drug war in
Colombia so-called
as I said it clears the land destroys
crops drives people off the land
Colombia now has the largest by far the
largest displaced persons population in
the hemisphere one of the world leaders
for four to five million the destroys
water supplies and so on it and it frees
the land for exploitation by
multinationals mining energy projects
for the tiny Colombian elite the rich
ranchers and things like that and the
people are destroyed
the plan Colombia had Clinton's plan
Colombia had just been instituted
shortly before my first visit and it has
had some achievements one of its main
achievements is to convert FARC the main
guerrilla group from a peasant based
guerrilla movement which had some kinds
of social policies and a fair amount of
appeal and peasantry converted them from
that to just another terrorist army
preying on the population so now the
casinos indigenous Africa Lumbee ins
fear all of them equally they're all
terrorist armies that's a great
achievement of Clinton's militarization
of the conflict the Colombia's very
violent history goes back a long time
you know all about that but a new era
important new year did open in the early
1960s and it was part of a much broader
phenomenon John F Kennedy in 1962 and
changed the mission of the Latin
American military from hemispheric
defense to internal security the
hemispheric defense was a meaningless
holdover from World War Two but internal
security is not meaningless that's a
term that means war against the
population that's and the effects of
that were immediate they're described by
Charles meach thing he was the
counterinsurgency he led us
counterinsurgency and internal defense
planning under Kennedy and Johnson and
what he says is Kennedy's 1962 decision
shifted u.s. policy from toleration of
the rapacity and cruelty of the Latin
American military to direct complicity
in their crimes to us support for the
methods of Heinrich Himmler's
extermination squads
that's the chief of counterinsurgency
and internal defense plan
the effects in Colombia were immediate
in 1962 the same year the Kennedy sent a
counterinsurgency Special Forces mission
to Colombia led by general yarrow
William yorbo who studied the situation
and gave their advice to the Colombian
government the advice was that they
should I'm quoting it they should turn
to paramilitary sabotage and other
terrorist activities against known
communists proponents to be employed as
soon as we have an appropriate apparatus
in place but notice this is an internal
document so no pretenses are necessary
its we will have the apparatus in place
and then we can turn to paramilitary
terror sabotage not to be employed
against known communists proponents well
communist proponents is a technical term
which has very broad application in the
u.s. counterinsurgency doctrine its
meaning actually was spelled out but in
the Busby Scotties orsa echoing made
sling he said that the I'll quote him
the Kennedy administration took great
pains to transform our regular armies
into counterinsurgency brigades
accepting the new strategy of the death
squads assuring in what is known in
Latin America as the national security
doctrine not defense against an external
enemy but a way to make the military
establishment the masters of the game
with the right to combat the internal
enemy it's the right to fight and
exterminate social workers trade
unionists men and women who are not
supportive of the establishment and who
are assumed to be communist extremists
and this could mean anyone including
human rights activists such as myself
which is of course why he's under heavy
guard and when we visited
you may have noticed earlier I said
Columbia has no nearby external enemies
it has a more remote external enemy
namely the country that is regarded in
the world by a long lead as the greatest
threat to world peace namely us and
nobody's even close
Americans are protected from this
information which comes from us running
polls by the Free Press which is careful
not to report it but it doesn't Colombia
Colombians know what it means well the
events that followed were very much the
way mates Lincoln Busby Scotties also
described the naturally first major step
was the military coup in Brazil
obviously the most important country
1964 immediately after the Kennedy
assassination Kennedy brothers a more or
less laid the basis for it this
established the first so-called national
security state kind of neo-nazi terror
torture state soon followed by many
others Uruguay Chile Argentina which was
maybe the worst of them and was the
major favorite of Henry Kissinger and
Ronald Reagan they really were delighted
in Argentina neo-nazis the plague
reached Central America in the 1980s in
the Reagan years the basic problem that
the United States faced throughout this
horrendous period was accurately
described by Henry Kissinger when he was
discussing the need to overthrow the
parliamentary government of chile and to
install the energetic tater ship know
about that without comment what he said
is that Chile again this Chile he said
is a virus that might spread contagion
elsewhere that's a leading theme of
foreign policy kind of a mafia doctor
you cannot accept disobedience because
it couldn't spread
and that's over and over again it's the
main theme of post-war history over and
over Chile was in fact such a virus the
parliamentary regime how was it going to
spread contagion by 6by success if it
succeeded in showing what parliamentary
means could carry forward social
democratic programs that could have an
effect in other places
Kissinger pointed out it could have an
effect all the way to southern Europe
though they were much concerned then
about what was called euro communism was
basically social democracy and certainly
Kissinger was joined by Brezhnev and
this concern they were both worried
about it for different reasons similar
but different reasons and Kissinger
didn't think that Chilean armies were
gonna land and Madrid that he just
thought that the model might spread and
that would be dangerous what do you do
when you have a virus that might spread
contagion you destroy the virus
and you've been oculi to the potential
victims how do you do that by installing
murderous terror states like national
security states that story is repeated
over and over again throughout the world
we make and we should bear that in mind
the the destruction of democracy in
Brazil which was welcomed
enthusiastically by the United States
these are the liberal administration's
the it was called a democratic rebellion
a great victory for the free world which
prevented a total loss to the west of
all South American Republic's by the
virus contagion effect sometimes called
the domino effect it was it should they
also added it should incidentally create
a greatly improved climate for private
investments not a small point it was the
single most decisive victory of freedom
in the mid 20th century that's the US
ambassador to Brazil Lincoln Gordon
called it one of the main main
points in world history in this period
he would not have become the president
of Johns Hopkins University as an aside
it's worth mentioning that Gordon is
quite right in referring to a turning
point in world history we make a serious
analytic error if we concentrate on one
region we become experts on Chile or on
Cuba or Vietnam and so on that overlooks
the fact that this the problem is right
here ever the same thing is happening
everywhere but the problems here and we
deflect attention away from possible
understanding when we adopt the line of
the doctrinal system which is look over
there but don't look here and this is a
perfect example of it what was happening
in Latin America was happening very much
the same way in Southeast Asia time
early sixties Vietnam was regarded as a
virus that might spread contagion and
what'd he do with the virus you destroy
it you defend potential victims by
installing murderous military
dictatorships which is exactly what was
done in Southeast Asia at the same time
it was done in Latin America and for the
same reasons in the most important of
them in if you look at u.s. planning was
Indonesia it's rich resources they were
threatened it was threatened by
democracy at the time there was a
democratic some democratic openings the
US was worried about it this was taken
care of in 1965 when there was a
military coup
so Hart Doku backed supported by the
United States which killed the virus in
Indonesia it killed hundreds thousands
of people mostly landless peasants
opened the country up to exploitation
just as in Latin America
at the great Victor's the greatly
improved climate for private investments
Indonesia of the same as Latin America
the was it was what happened at that
time was well understood it was
described pretty accurately such take
say the New York Times it described it
as a staggering mass slaughter which was
a gleam of light in Asia
why was a gleam of light in Asia well
killed off call hundred thousand
peasants destroyed the only political
party party the poor killed the threated
democracy opened up the country for
Western exploitation made it very clear
that the that there would be no
contagion effect from Vietnam and in
fact by that time Vietnam had been
frankly destroyed in retrospect a couple
years later the National Security
Adviser for Kennedy and Johnson McGeorge
Bundy reflected that it might have been
a good idea to stop the war in Vietnam
in 1965 he didn't use these words but
the reason was the virus was destroyed
the potential victims were protected
from contagion by the staggering mass
slaughter monstrous atrocities so it was
kind of useless to continue with the war
it's commonly said here that NL
everywhere that the United States lost
the war in Vietnam that's a mistake if
you look at the it's a very open society
we have internal documents we know what
the planning was you go back to the
early fifties the when the war really
began the concern was the virus
contagion effect and that was overcome
it's true that the u.s. didn't achieve
its maximal objectives like they didn't
earn Vietnam into the Philippines but
it's changed its major objectives great
powers great power usually does rarely
suffers a defeat well that's
the this I should go on to say that this
gleam of light in Asia namely the mass
slaughter and destruction of democracy
in Indonesia eliminated one of the
pillars of the non-aligned movement the
hated non-aligned movement was regarded
by US policymakers is practically the
same as Nazis Indonesia was one pillar
of it that was eliminated in 1965
another pillar was Egypt that was
eliminated in 1967 with Israel's
destruction of massive army and in fact
us-israeli relations which are unique in
world affairs were established in their
current form right at that time Israel
performed a major service to the United
States and its Saudi Arabian Ally and
there was of world historical
significance eliminating another major
part of the non-aligned movement the
non-aligned movement still exists it's
large majority of the world population
but it's essentially disregarded well as
I mentioned the plague reached Central
America in the 1980s that was Ronald
Reagan's war on terror Reagan came into
office declaring that a war on terror
would be the centerpiece of US policy
terror he said is the plague of the
modern age returned to barbers have been
our time all sorts of inflated rhetoric
the war on terror characteristically
instantly turned into a major terrorist
war the main victim was Central America
but went on to southern Africa the least
and elsewhere in Central America
hundreds of thousands of people were
slaughtered every imaginable form of
torture and horror the worst atrocities
were in Guatemala
a lot of all of course had been hard
chamber ever since the u.s. overthrew
its democratic government in 1954 but it
escalated quite sharply in the early 80s
with a virtually genocidal attack on the
Mayan highlands population the Reagan to
his dismay was inhibited from
participating directly in that it was
carried out by Rios Montt a man he
greatly admired said firm lover of
democracy and so on but Congress had
passed restrictions on a direct US
involvement so Reagan had the Reagan
administration had to turn to a
terrorist network Taiwan Argentine
neo-nazis but mainly Israel which was
eager to willing to provide its services
in training counterinsurgency work
arming the army and so on
and that became particularly important
after Argentina had a unfortunate return
to democracy and the military was no
longer available for that other other
others sometimes use terrorists but the
United States of powerful state it uses
terrorist States and that's a much more
effective terror network that's what
happened in Guatemala well as a result
that the United States was not providing
direct military aid to Guatemala that
was being done indirectly we arm Israel
they provide the arms to Guatemala but
the the because of this el salvador was
the leading recipient of US military aid
and one of the main centers of major
atrocities about 70,000 people killed
almost all by the US armed and trained
security forces horrible story in itself
well the what was going on in this
period is well understood by American
scholarship so the leading
non-academic specialists on human rights
in Latin America of art strokes North
Carolina
he found I'll quote him that USA wrote
in 1981 just when reagan's terror war
was taking off he said US aid has tended
to flow disproportionately to Latin
American governments which torture their
citizens to the hemispheres relatively
egregious violators of fundamental human
rights that includes military aid it's
independent of need and runs through the
quarter period there are other studies
which confirm it times short so I won't
review them but basically academic
studies draw the same conclusion and
it's entirely understandable that's the
way the Mafia operates the international
mafia now the basic principles of state
terror are explained by large strokes
and his standard scholarly work on the
main on the u.s. foreign policy and
human rights in Latin America what he's
referring here to the national security
states established from the early 1960s
after the Kennedy initiatives he says
the goal of these national security
states backed by the United States is to
destroy permanently a perceived threat
to the existing structure of
socio-economic privilege by eliminating
the political participation of the
numerical majority of the popular
classes that's pretty accurate and it's
not only in Latin America and
understandable well the pattern has been
followed since a long run through the
details there were peace accords in El
Salvador in 1992 which sharply reduced
state crimes and
therefore the country was dropped from
its leading role in the hemisphere as a
recipient of US military aid it was
replaced by Colombia which had an awful
record and moved into first place at
that time not because Colombian
atrocities increased that because
Salvadoran ones decreased so Colombia
became the leading recipient in the
hemisphere of military aid in 1999
Colombia achieved a greater made a
greater achievement it became the
leading recipient worldwide of US
military aid this incidentally excludes
Israel and Egypt which are separate
category but apart from them Colombia in
1999 became the world leader now again
it wasn't because Colombian atrocities
increased they were just continuing at
the regular level but what happened is
that the previous champion Turkey its
atrocities decline through the 1990s
some of the worst atrocities in the
world were carrying out by turkey within
NATO that was carrying out a massive
attack against its Kurdish population
tens of thousands of people murdered the
thousands of towns and villages
destroyed the probably millions of
refugees again every imaginable form of
torture and it was armed by the United
States 80% of the arms came from the
Clinton administration as trusted
atrocities peak aid peak 1997 the
Clinton administration actually sent
more arms to Turkey than in the entire
Cold War period up to the onset combined
up to the onset of the insurgency
sokka again the press was kind enough to
spare Americans the story if he worked
he can figure it out plenty of evidence
in human rights reports and elsewhere
1999 the the Turkish counter insurgency
operations had basically succeeded so
he gave over its leadership role to
Columbia where the atrocities were still
continuing well it has long been known
that Columbia is the world champion in
murder of human a human rights activists
union activists of the state crimes of
some of the years ten years ago roughly
that period Columbia actually killed
more union activists and the rest of the
world combined it's quite significant
the earlier estimates of civilians are
killed by the paramilitaries and the
paramilitaries means the military
they're very close interaction the
earlier estimates were about thirty
thousand a couple of years ago that
estimate was changed Colombia's
prosecutor general revealed that it's
investigating a hundred and fifty
thousand extradition of extrajudicial
killings by paramilitary groups from the
late 80s to the present that places
Colombia well beyond even the Argentine
neo-nazi Quinto which had the record
before that and well beyond the Pinochet
dictatorship now this is very close
collaboration has been well-documented
between the government the
paramilitaries and the major narco
traffickers large part of the Congress
in Colombia is now under criminal
investigation for paramilitary ties and
dozens have been arrested as I mentioned
Colombia also has the hemispheric
championship for displaced persons
substantially the u.s. chemical warfare
fumigation one of the world leaders and
as US aid increases Colombia descends
deeper into poverty so here's a 2010
report in The Washington Post pointed
out that Colombia is Washington's
closest ally in the continent of course
by far the leading aid recipient it
found that 43% of
the population live in poverty 23% in
extreme poverty and that Columbia is the
only major country in Latin America in
which the gap between rich and poor has
increased in recent years that's citing
the UN Economic Commission on Latin
America and remember this is happening
in a very rich country enormous
resources no nearby external threats
there's a study by the very courageous
Colombian journalist claudia lopez team
of colombian scholars which revealed
these facts that's what led to the
investigations and they went well beyond
in showing persuasively that the
criminal conspiracy of government
paramilitaries narco traffickers has a
very ambitious plan what they call to
refound the nation that's the title of
their study to legalize the enormous
wealth and power that they've amassed
during these years of paramilitary
government expansion and terror and to
create a new and even more grotesque
Colombia well it's turned to the free
trade question Obama negotiated a
so-called free trade agreement to
solidify the relationship with its
Colombia Colombian Ally now one of the
very few US allies in the hemisphere as
a result of the quite remarkable changes
that have taken place in the past 10 or
15 years the agreement was strongly
opposed by US unions and supporters of
labor rights considering Colombia's
awful record now that was supposed to be
addressed by labor rights conditions
added to the agreement but they appear
to have been completely ignored it was a
study recent study by the escuela
nacionales Indy column
is National Union school it showed that
almost nothing has changed the afl-cio
reported the summary in which they
observe that the report categorically
assigns a failing grade in almost every
measure included in the agreement that's
incidentally normal in so-called free
trade agreements notice I say so-called
I'll come back to that in a moment
they're not free trade agreements now
there's actually a pretty dramatic
illustration that was given by a Human
Rights Watch report last year on a port
town a twin event Ora which was supposed
to be it was called a model City for the
wonders of free trade it it's what
concluded is the Human Rights Watch
report that in quoting an entire
neighborhoods were dominated by powerful
paramilitary successor groups who
restrict residents movements recruit
their children export businesses and
routinely engage in horrific acts of
violence against anyone who defies their
will that these include hundreds maybe
more of disappearances and dismembering
victims and dumping their body parts
there are so-called chopped up houses
where the groups slaughter and chop up
their victims and toss them away many
times while they're still alive
according to Human Rights Watch the
large majority are afro-colombians the
police and military do nothing even
cooperate with the paramilitary
successors virtually no one is
prosecuted that tens of thousands have
been forcibly deflate displaced from
this single region more than any other
municipality in Colombia incidentally we
profess great horror when Isis beheaded
someone but we don't notice it when we
do much worse
like this for example and it's not the
only case den Kavala it's a very close
careful observer of Colombia adds that
the violence in Buenaventura is largely
being spurred on by paramilitary groups
fighting over control of the lucrative
ports which were built to accommodate
the increased trade brought about by the
free trade agreement that's one of the
consequences of the agreement and that
raises a question about one of the
topics I was asked to talk about impact
of free market policies I assume what
was meant is the free trade agreements
like NAFTA and others or the massive TPP
which is now being negotiated by Obama
dozen other countries but it's called
it's claimed that its negotiated in
secret it's not quite accurate it's not
secret from the hundreds of corporate
lawyers and lobbyists who were writing
the detailed of the details of it it's
only secret from the population who's
not supposed to understand about things
like this
that's why has to be kept on the fast
track that's considered a great
desiderata and these are pretty curious
creatures these free trade agreements so
take say NAFTA which is the model for
others a North American Free Trade
Agreement the only accurate terms in the
title are North American it is it does
concern North America Mexico Canada and
the United States but beyond that has
nothing to do with free trade it's
certainly not an agreement but at least
if populations are part of their
countries it's not an agreement because
the populations were opposed that we
know that in the US and Canada from
extensive polling probably was the same
in Mexico it's certainly not free trade
in fact it has a very extensive
protectionist elements very high an
unprecedented
the patent regime called intellectual
property nothing like it in history
which is designed to ensure massive
pharmaceutical company products brought
the profits by extreme degree of
protectionism much of it is investor
rights considerate agreements nothing to
do with trade in fact even the part that
is called trade has very little to do
with great
so it's pointed out you know a great
enthusiasm that trade between Mexico and
the United States increased economists
call it trade but is it trade
I mean suppose in the old Soviet Union
that parts were made in Leningrad and
sent to Warsaw for assembly and then
sold and Moscow we wouldn't call that
trade across borders but it's within a
single command economy and exactly the
same is true when General Motors has
parts made in Indiana sends him to
Mexico to be assembled and sells the
cars in Los Angeles
that's transactions internal to a
command economy and it's not small the
corporations are tyrannies they don't
tell us what they're doing but there are
studies and it's estimated maybe 50
percent of so-called and trade between
Mexico and the United States is internal
to command economies so there's almost
nothing about free trade and these
agreements even about trade
these are investor rights agreements and
they have effect NAFTA is probably one
of the few treaties which has succeeded
in harming the populations in all three
countries involved that's a not a bad
record actually of course there are
plenty who gain from it lots but not the
population one of the effects is on the
front pages the flow of undocumented
immigrants from Mexico it used to be in
the past the kind of a regular
interchange
would come for to pick fruit under
horrible conditions in California and
then go back home and so on there was a
long-standing immigration immigration
issue
partly regulated but now there's an
increasing flow of campesinos coming
from corn producing areas farther south
why pretty obvious Mexican campesinos
going to be highly efficient but they
can't compete with us agribusiness which
is furthermore highly subsidized in what
we call a free market economy so it has
the natural effect flow of immigrants
than we worry about this others coming
from say the highlands in Guatemala we
worry about that they're fleeing from
what's left in the destruction
well this continues studies undertaken
under national rules incidentally show
that NAFTA has been very effective in
undermining labor organizing in the
United States the number of illegal
employer actions to breakup strikes
apparently increased by about 50% with
things like if there's an organizing
effort in some plant that employers can
put up a sign saying transfer operation
to Mexico and of course people don't
want to lose their jobs so the
organizing effort stops that's illegal
but when there's a criminal state it
makes no difference
the laws just aren't applied I'm they're
applied to poor kids in downtown Boston
a black kid with a jointness pocket but
not applied to a corporation which is
breaking up a union union efforts and so
on I won't go to the through the details
but just finished by adding that there
are many allusions about so-called free
trade and free markets and they have to
be carefully analyzed and dismantled
before you discuss the impact of
policies that claim to be based on these
principles if you look at those prints
was over the last centuries you discover
some great striking regularities they
have typically been reshaped to protect
the rich and powerful from the ravages
of markets while leaving the more
vulnerable free to suffer from their
harmful effects that's a staple of
economic history and it plays out in the
current agreements
