israeli soldier gilad chelate returned
home today after
five years in captivity in gaza in
exchange for 477 palestinian prisoners
another 550 are slated to be released in
two months
forty of the palestinian prisoners will
be deported to syria qatar turkey
and jordan in his first interview gilad
shalit expressed support for the freeing
of all palestinian prisoners
while palestinians are holding a massive
celebration in gaza today
palestinian prison support groups note
over 4 000 palestinians remain locked up
in israel
we turn now to mit professor noam
chomsky the world-renowned linguist and
political dissident
he spoke monday night here in new york
at barnard college about the
israel-palestine conflict the prisoner
exchange in the middle east overall
about a week ago the new york times had
a headline
saying the west celebrates a cleric's
death
the cleric was lucky
killed by a drone it wasn't just death
it was assassination
and another step forward in obama's
global assassination campaign which
actually breaks some new
records in international terrorism well
it's not true that everyone in the west
celebrated
there were some critics almost all of
the critics of whom there weren't many
criticized the action or qualified it
because of the fact that
awlaki was an american citizen that is
he was a person
unlike suspects who are intentionally
murdered or collateral damage meaning
we treat them kind of like the ants we
step on when we
walk down the street they're
not american citizens so they are
unpeople
and therefore they can be freely
murdered
that's it's some may remember if you
have good memories
that there used to be a concept in
anglo-american law
called a presumption of innocence
innocent until proven guilty in a court
of law
and that's so deep in history that
there's
no point even bringing it up but it did
once exist some of the critics
brought up the fifth amendment of the
constitution which says
that no person each person noticed shall
be deprived of life
liberty or property without due process
of law
well of course that was never intended
to apply to persons
so it wasn't intended to apply to un
people
and on people fall into several
categories
there's first of all the indigenous
population
either in the territories already held
or those that
were expected to be uh conquered soon
that didn't apply to them and of course
it didn't apply to those who the
constitution
declared to be three-fifths human so
therefore
un-people that latter
category was transferred into
theoretically into the category of
people
by the 14th amendment that
essentially the same wording is the
fifth amendment in this respect but now
a person was intended to hold of the
freed slaves
that was in theory in practice
it barely happened after about 10 years
the category of three-fifths human were
returned
to uh on category one people by the
divisive
uh criminalization of black life which
essentially restored
slavery maybe something even worse than
slavery actually went on to the second
world war
and it's being reinstituted now past 30
years of
severe moral and social regression in
the united states
well the fourth amendment 14th amendment
was recognized right away to be
problematic
the concept of person was both too
narrow
and too broad and the courts
went to work to overcome both of those
flaws
the concept of person was expanded
to include
legal fictions
sustained created and sustained by the
state what's called
corporations and it was also narrowed
over the years to exclude undocumented
aliens
that goes right up to the present recent
supreme court cases
which make it clear that the
corporations not only are persons but
they're persons with rights far beyond
those of
persons of flesh and blood so kind of
super persons
the mislabeled free trade agreements
give them astonishing rights and of
course the court has added more
but the crucial need to
make sure that the category of young
people includes those who
escaped from the horrors we've created
in
central america and mexico try to get
here those are
not persons they are un-people the
and of course it includes any foreigners
especially those accused of terror
which is a concept that has taken quite
an interesting
uh conceptual change an interesting one
since 1981 when ronald reagan
came into office and declared the
global war on terror what's called the g
what and current fancy terminology
i won't go into that here except with a
comment to note
on how the term is now used without
any raising even any notice
so take for example omar khadr he's a 15
year old
child canadian he was accused of a very
severe crime
namely trying to defend his village in
afghanistan
from u.s invaders obviously that's
severe crime serious terrorist
so he was sent first to secret prison in
bagram then off to guantanamo
for eight years uh after eight years he
pleaded guilty to some charges we all
know what that means if you want few
pick up a few of the details even in
wikipedia
more and other sources so he pleaded
guilty and was given eight more years
uh a sentence could have gotten 30 more
years
we hadn't pleaded guilty after all it is
a severe crime
defending your village from american
aggressors
he's canadian so canada could have him
extradited
but with the courage
they refused uh they don't want to
defend the master
understandably well the crime of
resisting aggression it's not a new
category of terrorism there may be
some of you old enough to remember the
slogan
terror against terror which was used by
the gestapo
in which we've taken over
the none of this arouses any interest
because all of these
the victims believe belong to the
category of unpeople
well that coming back to our topic now
the concept of young people
is central to tonight's topic
israeli jews are people palestinians are
un-people and a lot follows from that
there's clear illustrations constantly
so
here's a clipping if i remember to bring
it from the new york times
front page story wednesday
october 12th the lead story
is deal with hamas will free
israeli held since 2006.
and right next to it is a running right
across the
top of the front page is a picture of
four women kind of agonized over
the fate of gilad shalit
friends and supporters of the family of
staff sergeant gilad chalit
received word of the deal at the
family's protest tent in jerusalem
well that's understandable actually i
think he should have been released a
long time ago
but there's something missing from this
whole story so like there's no pictures
of palestinian women
no discussion in fact in the story of
what about the palestinian prisoners
being
released where they come from and
there's a lot to say about that so for
example we don't know at least i don't
read it in the times
whether the release includes the
palestinian
the elected palestinian officials who
were
kidnapped and imprisoned by israel in
2007
when the united states the european
union
and israel decided decided to dissolve
the only freely elected legislature in
the
arab world that's called democracy
promotion
technically in case you're not familiar
with the term
uh the uh so i don't know what happened
to them
there are also other people who've been
in prison
exactly as long as gilad in fact
one day longer the day before
gila chalet was captured at the border
israeli troops entered gaza kidnapped
two brothers the muammar brothers
spirited them across the border and
violation of the geneva conventions of
course
and they've disappeared into israel's
prison system
i'm a clue what happened to them i've
never seen a word about it
and as far as i know nobody cares which
makes sense
after all on people whatever you think
about
capturing the soldier a soldier from an
attacking army
plainly kidnapping civilians is a far
more severe crime but that's only if
they're people
in this case really doesn't magic matter
it's not that it's unknown so if you
look back at the price
at the press the day after the my
brothers were captured there's a couple
of lines here and there
but it's just insignificant of course
which makes some sense because there are
lots of others in prison
thousands of them many in without
charges
there's also in addition to this the
secret prison system
like uh facility 1391 if you want to
look it up on the internet
uh secret prison which means of course
the torture chamber
in israel which uh actually was reported
pretty well
in israel when it was discovered also
reported in england
and in europe but i haven't seen a word
about it here and
at least anywhere that anybody is likely
to look
i've written about it and a couple of
others
all of this is that these are all
un-people
so naturally nobody cares in fact the
racism is so profound that it's kind of
like the air we breathe we're
unaware of it you know just
pervades everything uh coming to the
title of this talk it could mislead
and and it could
be interpreted misinterpreted as
supporting a kind of conventional
picture of the
negotiations such as they are uh
united states on over here and
then these two uh recalcitrant
forces over there the united states is
an honest broker
trying to bring together the
the two militant difficult
groups that don't seem to be able to get
along with one another
that's it is the standard version
but it's totally false i mean if there
were serious negotiations
they would be organized by some neutral
party
maybe brazil and on one side you'd have
the us and israel
on the other side you'd have the world
that's literally true
but that's one of those things that's
unspeakable mit professor noam chomsky
