suppose that the United States and
Britain actually had some interest in
reducing terrorism it's a false
assumption but let's suppose it how
would they have reacted to 9/11 well at
right after 9/11 that was a sharp split
in the jihadi movement Osama bin Laden
was very harshly criticized and
condemned for carrying out the act of
terror there were fellows coming from
the most radical clerics and al-azhar
university and so on well here
interested interested in reducing
terrorism what you would do is exploit
that's split that is approach try to
bring the jihadi movement to and of
course the rest of the Muslim world that
it's hope hoping to appeal to ultimately
because they retain a minority bring
them towards a joining in a condemnation
of terrorist attacks and working against
it well that's not what was done what
was done was to try to weld them
together to carry out exactly the kind
of actions that Osama bin Laden was
praying for you know fulfill his claim
that the West is attacking the Muslim
world so he can bring you know more
people to his cause that's exactly
what's done that's why people like say
michael Scheuer who's very hawkish see
he was CIA analyst in charge of tracking
osama bin laden for many years he says
the united states is hummus at bin
Laden's best ally because we do
everything he wants instead of trying to
isolate and eliminate him you know bring
him to justice and so on what we do is
rally people to his cause and you can
continue with this the furthermore in
britain at least it all gonna be
understood
now after all Britain has a history of
combating terrorism ir8 terrorism as
long as which was no joke as long as the
as Britain responded by
violence it s called it increased and
heightened the cycle of violence since
Britain began to take seriously some of
the grievances that lay behind it and
they were real it pretty much settled
the question you know it's not a utopia
in Northern Ireland but it's not what it
was 15 years ago
