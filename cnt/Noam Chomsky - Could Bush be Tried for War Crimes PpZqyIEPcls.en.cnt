last summer Congress passed a law that
would allow the President to invade the
Netherlands with military force that's
true if the International Criminal Court
even hears a case against an American
it's true in Europe it's called the
Netherlands invasion act here it's not
reported but yeah it's true and it was
it was signed by the executive so it's
law Democrats and Republicans voted for
that so kind of my question for you is
is there any way that you could foresee
that that George could be prosecuted I
understand that in this in this country
he has to be not in this country he has
to go outside of this country and since
we haven't ratified the ICC but if he
were somewhere else why couldn't someone
just say these are questions of power
not law you know there's the the u.s.
can do it because it's overwhelmingly
powerful and nobody can do anything
about it except people inside the United
States you want to change things you got
to change them here nobody else can do
it I mean I don't really think and you
know in Europe they describe the
Netherlands invasion act as a kind of a
joke
you know a sign of how crazy everybody
is across the Atlantic they don't really
expect the Hague to be invaded but they
know that they can't touch an American
or even threaten one because the threats
are just too great the extrema the
fanaticism of this is really remarkable
so take the latest country to be
admitted into the United Nations East
Timor I mean barely exists couple
hundred thousand people are the ones
that survived the us-backed Indonesian
assault when they got independence
first communication from Colin Powell
the moderate from the State Department
first communication was that if they
wanted any aid from the United States
they were going to have to guarantee
that they would never be involved with
the International Criminal Court
indicated in any case involving an
American I'm the chance of some of each
team were you know sending some American
to the International Criminal Court is
approximately at the level of our being
hit by an asteroid tomorrow but they're
not take that you know you gotta show
the fanaticism is so extreme that they
had to sign that and Europe knows you
don't fiddle around with a 800-pound
gorilla you know they can only be
stopped from within
