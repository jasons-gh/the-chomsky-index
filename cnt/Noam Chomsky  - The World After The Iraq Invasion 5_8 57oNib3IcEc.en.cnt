a couple of days ago james Woolsey who
was former head of the CIA under Clinton
and apparently is going to get a
position in the new administration he
gave a speech and where I'm going to be
tomorrow los angeles where he informed
the crowd cheerfully that we're now in
the midst of world war four there's
World War One World War two Cold War was
World War three now we're in world war
four and we got to go over the countries
that have been attacking us he named to
said he ran in Syria fascist regimes of
Iran and Syria have been attacking us
and we finally realized it so now we
have to go after them so maybe there
will be the next ones or another
possibility is the Andean region which
is now surrounded by US military bases
plenty of soldiers there and it's a big
energy producing another resource
producing region and it's kind of out of
control so that's a possible target and
you can think of others but you can be
pretty confident of one or another is
going to come along there's no other way
to continue with the strategy that's
announced then they intend to implement
remember these are people who barely
hold political power by a hair you know
the only way they can hold on to it is
by terrifying the population that means
they're things that can be done you know
people don't have to be terrified by
imaginary demons that's an educational
and organizational task one that's not
easy but certainly within the means of
people are concerned well let's go back
to last September what right after it
comes October Congress declares that
Saddam Hussein as a threat to our
existence like Nicaragua and authorized
the government to use force something
else happened in October something
extremely important there was a meeting
retrospective meeting in Havana 40th
anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis
at the people who attended were key
participants in the October 1962 Missile
Crisis from Russia the United States and
Cuba and there was there was a discovery
that actually shattered them there it
turned out that the world was they knew
it was a very dangerous moment Arthur
Schlesinger described it as the most
dangerous moment in history which isn't
an exaggeration but they found out last
October just how dangerous it was it
turned out that the world was literally
one word away from probably terminal
nuclear war it turns out that Russian
submarines were under attack by us
destroyers they had nuclear on missiles
two of the commander's assumed that
there was a global war going on and
called for the missiles to be sent off
if that had happened there would have
been a massive response by the United
States what that half a Russia they
would have responded out and wiped out
the rest of us and we wouldn't be here
to talk about it but why didn't it
happen one submarine commander
countermanded the order the Russian
rules have required three commanders to
authorize nuclear weapons to agreed when
refused that's why we're here that's how
close it was this is after a campaign of
international terrorism that led to the
crisis aimed at regime change for the
kind of reasons I mentioned all very
much in the news last October very
eminent barely reported I don't know how
many of you know about it was barely
mentioned who cares if the world was one
word away from nuclear war after her us
campaign of international terrorism what
followed was an increase in the
terrorism and Dean Acheson explanation
which already read
well there are more important things
than survival like profits and power
that's what we learn from this
immediately after this discovery barely
reported week later October 23rd there
was a meeting of the United Nations a
disarmament Commission that's
essentially the General Assembly they
passed two extremely important
resolutions one of them reaffirm the
1925 treaty that bans biological weapons
the second was a resolution that
extended 1967 treaty banning the use of
banning the militarization of space
preserving space for peace of peaceful
uses well why those weren't reported
those resolutions had a friend to a
database check weren't recorded why the
united states voted against him alone
the United States and reflexively Israel
voted against reaffirming a 1925 ban on
biological weapons and a 1967 treaty now
extended to ban militarization of space
well you know that's really dangerous
both of them and very urgent shortly
after not reported right after that the
US the Bush administration killed by a
weapons treaty that was under
negotiation stunning the Europeans last
minute the u.s. stepped in and says no
we're not going to allow any discussion
of enforcement mechanisms for years the
reason got to protect the secrets of us
pharmaceutical corporations it's much
more important than banning biological
weapons probably there's another reason
it's very likely that the United States
is carrying out illegal tests of
development of biological weapons a lot
of scientists guess that that's the
reason why they haven't been able they
claim that they haven't been able
find the source of the anthrax attack it
was traced back to a US federal
laboratory remember it's not like
disarming Iraq it's a US federal
laboratory they can't they claim not to
be able to find the source it's kind of
hard to believe but it may be and it's
been speculated by the Federation of
American scientists and others that
probable reason is that they're
concealing some kind of weapons
development program that they won't
expose well maybe maybe not we're going
to find out about it right after that
the u.s. went on to infuriate even its
closest allies in the World Trade
Organization first of all by taking a
very extreme stand violating trade rules
and notice that that's another
reiteration that's still following the
script of the Reagan years a lot of talk
about free trade but they were the
strongest opponents of free trade in the
industrial world in fact the Reagan
administration was the most
protectionist government in post-war US
history they virtually doubled
protection protectionists barriers in
the United States the gap which is the
predecessor of the World Trade
Organization their current their
analysis Reaganite protectionist
measures were three times as high as
other industrial countries very damaging
the world trade but no most powerful
state and world does what it wants and
they're doing it right again the Bush
administration has broken some new
barriers and protectionist measures but
much worse than that and this really did
amazed and infuriate Europe and others
is just a couple of weeks ago the u.s.
intervene to prevent efforts which had
been agreed to by the other industrial
powers efforts to provide inexpensive
drugs to people who are dying of
treatable diseases a
malaria tuberculosis and others that's
tens of millions of people who are dying
from these diseases in the u.s.
intervened to prevent access to
inexpensive drugs again because huge
profits for heavily subsidized us
pharmaceutical corporations are a much
higher priority now well you know
doesn't make you popular the u.s. also
continued under many is continuing to
undermine international efforts to
reduce threats to the environment which
are by now universally recognized to be
severe and may be a threat to survival
the pretext for this barely conceal
service to pretty narrow sectors of
private power take a look at the journal
science the main the Journal of the
American Association for advancement of
science that lead editorial about a week
ago with a bitter condemnation of the
Bush administration the climate change
science plan which does absolutely
nothing in both even does nothing to
stop what just about every scientist and
pays attention recognizes to be a very
severe threat well again profits are
more important all of this engenders
fear and hatred of the leadership that
may be ultimately hatred of the society
which wills regard it as just too
dangerous that's going to lead to
efforts at deterrence how do you deter a
country which has overwhelming military
power well you know every international
affairs specialist and tell you and does
tell you by proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction and proliferation of
terror that's what the Bush
administration is going to achieve as I
say of some bin Laden must be cheering
somewhere well go back to that
intelligent Martian if he has some
concern for the human species he might
be watching all of this with some
amazement and asking
how long it can be that people who live
in a free country are going to allow it
to go on
I am told that there are a couple of
mics around so if you'd like to go to
them and we can turn this into a
discussion you start okay I know I
wanted to ask about if we accept as I
think we should a sort of call to action
as privileged instead of citizens where
your estimation would be of two possible
actions we can work for within the kind
of narrow political spectrum you've
talked tonight about the work was done
by this administration and by the some
of the same people during Reagan Bush
and you've also criticized Clinton but
not so much tonight and I'm wondering
how much how important it would be to
try to work for the change from the
Republicans to the Democrats the next
election which is you know it's a
measurable change versus other possible
put all activities like you know
campaign finance reform and that kind of
thing well depends what the Democrats
are so I didn't talk much I actually did
talk about Clinton so the sanctions that
have destroyed Iraq and strengthen
Saddam Hussein and made the population
dependent on them and prevented an
internal revolt that's Clinton right
okay and there's plenty more take
another example which is often another
domain take a look at Brazil it's very
interesting what's its informative
what's happening there very informative
and Brazil has a matte huge popular
movements left popular movement nothing
like here they succeed and they're very
effective that landless workers movement
the Workers Party and others the biggest
popular movements in the world and the
most effective they manage to like their
own president pretty impressive guy
just but just take a look at what's
happening and think a little about
history there's good reason why nobody
studies history just teaches you too
much but take a look at recent history
recent 40 years ago Brazil had a
populist president as during the Kennedy
administration not like Lula but you
know mildly populist President Kennedy
administration didn't like him they
organized a military coup to overthrow
it happened that take place shortly
after the assassination but it already
been prepared by the Kennedy
administration it was hailed by
Kennedy's ambassador as the greatest
victory for freedom in the mid 20th
century while the generals were
torturing and murdering it imposed the
first kind of neo-nazi national security
state in Latin America that's the
beginning of a plague that spread right
through the hemisphere ended up in
Central America in the 80s pretty awful
the we ought to know all about it this
time they're not calling for a military
coup although Lula is a much more
threatening leader for them and has a
mass popular support we're going to
support that goulart back in those days
didn't have how come well there's two
basic reasons for one thing the activism
of the last 40 years has changed this
country as well as Brazil people here
wouldn't accept it anymore then nobody
cared you know then that we knew pay
attention but a lot has been done in the
last 40 years it's much more civilized
country be very hard to carry that off
now there's a second reason here comes
Clinton they don't need it back in the
1960s the only way you could prevent a
populist movement was a military coup
now you can do it by
