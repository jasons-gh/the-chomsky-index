significance but it's a little bit like
the human energy that's put out I'm
trying to figure out who killed John F
Kennedy yeah who knows who cares I mean
plenty of people get killed all the time
why does it matter that one of them had
to be John F Kennedy if there was some
reason to believe that there was a
high-level conspiracy might be
interesting
no but the evidence against that is it's
over well and after that it's just a man
you know it happened to be a jealous
husband or the Mafia or someone else
no what difference does it make it's
just taking energy away from serious
issues of the ones that don't matter and
I think the same is true of your
personal
