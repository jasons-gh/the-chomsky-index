professor Chomsky so thank you for being
here and for so generously giving us
your time for giving yourself
I know a guest lecture it's been a real
honor for us and I just want to seek
your opinion on an issue that is going
to be very important for us in the in
the year to come as I mentioned to you
earlier you and you will be chairing the
global migration group at a time in 2017
when the UN system has already begun
work towards to global compacts one on
responsibility sharing for Refugees and
another on safe orderly and regular
migration and at the same time the UN
has launched a global campaign against
xenophobia so I have a couple of
questions that I'd like to put to you
and they specifically touch on the
question of xenophobia and I think the
the search is also for ways of
addressing it and in order to do so I
wondered if you could perhaps comment on
what might be some of the root causes
what might be the triggers for
xenophobia what makes us is in a phobic
as human beings partly trying to
maintain familiarity and homogeneity of
the communities which are part of our
lives that's an understandable and
respectable position partly it's
concerned for maintaining privilege
which takes many many forms
you know phobia patriarchy racism lots
of possibilities is not so attractive
and that there are specific forms input
in particular places like in the United
States say one significant fact is that
the white population which of course has
always been totally dominant that's us
the rest are others is becoming a
minority and within about maybe a decade
or 15 years it'll be literally a
minority the workforce was it a couple
of decades minority the population now
this is combined with an attack on
cultural values which have offered a
kind of sense of a sense of place a
sense of superiority a sense of having
some significance in the world which is
being challenged in many ways by the
feminist movement but gay movement by
immigrants by anything and the United
States have to be very religious
communities the sense that others have
contempt for our religious values our
churches the center of our lives that
all combines and it's easy to blame
those out there who we don't know anyway
and what are they doing here on that
kinderman to xenophobia and other places
like
say Denmark where the society has been
traditionally quite homogeneous the just
the beginning of some indication of some
change and a threat to the uniformity
and what we're used to and what we
expected tends to raise feelings of
hostility and barriers to protect what
we think is being challenged sometimes
it could take really extreme forms I
mean there states in the United States
where literally there are there's
legislation proposed to bar Sharia law
which is about as likely as happening as
and you know a comet hitting the earth
or something but you have to protect
yourself against it and this often takes
very strange forms even at in elite
circles so for example if you read the
top planning documents secret documents
of the government written by the most
sophisticated they lead liberal
intellectuals at Dean Acheson for MIT
see others the paranoia is almost
indescribable the the Russians are
taking over the world we can barely
defend ourselves we have to armed to the
teeth because of this onslaught against
the slave state the rhetoric is
hair-raising you know and this is a late
intellectual cultivated people talking
to each other you find the same thing if
you read something like famous Powell
memorandum which was written by
corporate lawyer became a Supreme Court
justice justice Powell it was about the
takeover of the whole country by the
Marxist left the students on rampaging
the
medial taken over by the Marxist left on
and on with crazed paranoia because
something was changing total control was
disappeared another form of this is a
novo BIA it has many manifestations and
it's these are part of human nature but
not an attractive part but they can have
many sources and they're hard to deal
with I come from Britain and you know
we've just had the the brexit vote that
is affecting the whole social and
political landscape of Britain
very deeply in a very profound way and
in ways that many of the people who were
voting were not aware and and indeed
there are some who would say that many
voted to leave based on information
received from the tabloid press so that
leads me to to sort of ask you about the
role of the media and understanding you
know how can we address the ways in
which the media represents migration and
how can we read ress that imbalance as
well when it's happening unfortunately
parts of the media are committed to
force fostering these values and even
magnifying them the only way to address
the media and I think is to address the
general culture of which the media is
some kind of reflection and necessary to
begin with instilling values of
tolerance understanding sympathy support
for others recognition of how others
have supported us again take say in the
immigrant community like take say in the
United States where everyone is an
immigrant so everyone's grandfather or
great-grandfather
was fleeing from persecution somewhere
and they were brought in oppressed
discriminated against the finally
integrated somehow the sense that we're
all part of this no this is part of
being human it's being accepted and
communities where maybe you seem strange
so we have to be understanding others in
our midst
every country has some story like that
the the UN system has been talking and
thinking quite a bit around migration
and one of the repeated phrases that
I've been hearing is that of we need to
change the narrative we meaning
policymakers so I was wondering if you
had any thoughts any recommendations
around policymaking on migration that
you know would would help us change the
narrative or how can we change this
narrative in other words my feeling is
I've tried into getting these talks is
that a crucial thing that privileged
Westerners should understand is that
they are the beneficiaries of the
repression and persecution from which
people are fleeing they're fleeing in
certain directions not others from
Africa to Europe not from Europe to
Africa those reasons from that from Iraq
to the West and not from the West to
Iraq and it's not just a matter of
things that we our predecessors have
done but what created the wealth and
privilege that we now enjoy it wasn't
just won by sweat of the brow it was won
by exploiting and repressing others
sometimes in hideous ways one thing
that's not too well-known in the West is
that
the Western Industrial Revolution the
economic development that brought us
wealth and privilege was based on the
most vicious system of slavery and that
ever existed slavery existed for a long
time but it reached its peak of
viciousness and hair-raising brutality
and the plantation economies of the
southern United States which created the
cotton exports cotton was the gun like
the oil of the 19th century that are the
basis for the manufacturing finance
Commerce trade retail industries and
we're rich and privileged thanks to that
plus of course extermination of the
indigenous population and there are
similar things elsewhere France is a
rich country in part because of its
monstrous behavior in Haiti which began
with the Spanish wiping out the
population and the French bringing in
slaves horrible story right almost to
the president these are the same is true
of what the way in West Africa probably
could have developed the way Japan did
if it had not been calling on this Japan
was wasn't what developed West Africa
was couldn't develop that this runs all
through the world I'm an agent in the
United States believe it or not we're in
pretty similar situations around the
early 19th century
they both had rich agriculture producing
both caught major cotton producers they
each had a kind of a government
different kinds of governments but both
committed to industrial policy
development that Muhammad Ali and in
Egypt the Hamiltonian system the United
dates the fundamental difference is that
the US was free to reject the colonial
Imperial policies of the then master of
the world England not England and France
simply committed themselves openly to
prevent any industrial development in
that region Egypt is a Jew United States
is the United States this it's not
simply a matter of recording the crimes
of the past but recognizing that our
privileged power right now depends on a
long history of creating conditions from
which people are dolefully this is going
to become quite extreme in the coming
years the effects of global warming
which is basis of our privilege is the
result of the Industrial Revolution
which made us Richard powerful that's
now threatening the lives it's a at a
severe level at the level of tens of
hundreds of millions of people who were
the victims of these processes and were
repressed and often destroyed in the
course of creating that privilege so
when the Minister environmental minister
of Bangladesh says that you the rich
countries created the conditions from
which tens of millions of Bengalis are
going to have to flee because of rising
sea levels you at least have the
responsibility of welcoming the men you
can't do anything about what you did but
at least face the consequences of what
you've done and what you benefit from
the reason you're rich it able to
accommodate them is the reason why their
fleet I think that sensibility and
understanding has to be brought to the
population of the Richard wealthy
countries
it's not a matter of well I didn't do it
my grandfather did so why should I be
blamed but you benefit from it that's
why you're rich and powerful that's why
they are fleeing thank you thank you
it's been a privilege and a great
pleasure to listen to you to learn from
you thank you for being here
