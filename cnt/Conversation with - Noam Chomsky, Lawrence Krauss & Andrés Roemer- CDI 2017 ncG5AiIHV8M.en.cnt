phonology senior es conocido Lawrence we
have a great honor
because he's a great donor it's a very
great honor as always is it's amazing to
be able to share the stage with the
following gentlemen we are inviting to
the stage norm Chomsky welcome
I have an idea if you if you're loud I
will divide this brief and great honor
to be with you in three different stages
the first one will want just to know
little bit about you but my friend
Lawrence told me that he is a very good
friend of yours and that he knows you
pretty well so in the first part I will
ask Lawrence questions about Chomsky
professor Chomsky and if he is not
correcting the answer please a peep if
you don't like my question say I pass
okay the second part Lawrence I invite
you that we have a dialogue of of course
in relation with you thinking of which
are the greatest risks that were going
to face as humanity what should we do in
relation with United States and Donald
Trump now there questions about about
your ideas of where is going in
linguistics and things that you have
been working on that you have make
actually history on those topics and
that at the end in the third stage if
you don't mind and you allowed me
because I have to be very honest with
you we have cut here many people but
it's very easy to to make an interview
of a specific topic but you are in so
many topics and I want to cover so much
and discover more than cover with you so
much that if you allowed us at the end
in the first stage we could ask him just
like one word and if you could answer
with one word what comes to your mind if
you want to if not you could say deep
right pass or whatever okay so we'll be
like an association game do you agree
okay okay
estos con el fin de conocer a
profundidad invent a minutos Sandman
primero como lo conozco na gente desde
fuera despues como vamos a profundas r
en algunos temuz y despues que es lo
primero que le viene a la mente con
determine ABBA's palabras de association
tamos de acuerdo my friend ah
aqui esta here is it oh this is my
whiskey' these because Lawrence told me
that the only condition is that I bring
whiskey to the table to start selling
whiskey whiskey actually it's ok ok we
will start just I needed it after the
debate ok anyway he's professor Chomsky
he prefers to read fiction or nonfiction
nonfiction he prefers art he prefers
actual music art well both arts or music
I say I mean plastic art
am i right ok he likes to make sports to
do sports he's an athlete babe and
that's the other thing about noam
chomsky he's honest
[Laughter]
professor Chomsky is much more
interested in political issues or in
linguistic issues path he hates more do
not form or who who would you think oh
my god
gee I don't know why don't you answer
that one I don't think you know what I
think norm doesn't hate people he's just
disappointed by them I'm not
disappointed because I don't expect much
excellent but I don't hate it I hate
what he does not him in fact no one once
said to me something very important I
think that really influenced me which
was what people think isn't as important
as what they do
I countered it by saying that what they
think affects what they do but I think
it's very important it affected me
because actions I think are really the
key and I learned that one of many
things I've learned from know well
Lawrence you're a very Atheist person
actually you are one of the leaders of
the movement of the New Atheism I'd like
to not think of it as a movement more
common you know of Chomsky related to
New Atheism and does he believe in God
ah I think not norm and I are in
agreement that the notion of God is kind
of the standard notion of God is
ridiculous but I think no I hate to
speak for you but um it's better to say
if I would say that there are there's so
many more important things to worry
about than God right now that we should
be talking about other things would you
agree to agree yes okay so you know he
pretty will he prefers to sleep early
and wake up early or he's much more like
a night person let me see if I can see
how honest he is he loves to wake up
early yeah okay now I don't know I wrote
three of them but okay sure I think
people want to hear from norm especially
more than yes this is for you
what are the largest for you what are
the largest existential risks we face
now yes and how do these reflect ongoing
socio-political issues a new perspective
well we face several very severe crisis
in fact this generation has to answer
questions that have never risen in human
history will the species survive in any
recognizable form and there are a number
of these one is a shadow that's been
hanging over us for over 70 years and
that is can we survive the threat of
nuclear war I remember very well August
6 1945 won't go into the details but my
feeling at once that was right away
human beings have fun the human
intelligence has finally achieved the
capacity to destroy ourselves and ever
since then it's come very close several
times much too close for comfort
can I be personal because I know this
story I think it's your personal story
is a good one you thought your reaction
at the time I think is remarkable and
reflects remarkably on your thinking so
I think people would like to hear the
personal story well I was I was a
counselor at a summer camp in August and
in the morning there was an announcement
everyone that the United States had used
an atom dropped an atom bomb on
Hiroshima and everybody listened and
then they all went off to their normal
activities you know baseball game
swimming whatever it might be and I was
kind of doubly appalled first of all
that the
enormity of what it just happened and
its implications which are pretty
obvious you knew as soon as you heard it
that soon it's going to escalate into a
capacity to destroy which will be
essentially unlimited so first that but
secondly at the lack of reaction and
nobody seemed to care and it was so
appalling that I just couldn't handle it
I took off and walked into the woods and
sat there alone for a couple hours
thinking about it and then came back and
ever since then it's of course never
been out of my mind and I've followed it
pretty closely and the record is really
astonishing first of all just the record
of near accidents but then also the
record of extremely reckless behavior by
political leaders including those who
are honored often honored for the
actions that they took in this
connection when you look closely it's
it's almost a miracle that we survived
it really is and I think young people
don't who are sort of complacent because
1945 seems so far back in their memory
don't don't realize how every day were
on the brink in many ways that no
there's still thousands of weapons on I
alert well actually William Perry who
you know very well yeah
spent a career in nuclear strategy
control over nuclear weapons former
defense secretary a very reserved quiet
non alarmist person plays down the
dangers he now says that he's doubly
terrified terrified at the threat that
we face which he says is more extreme
even than during the Cold War and even
more terrified by the fact that nobody
seems to care yeah it's very much like
August 6 I was with him last week at the
bulletin and yeah he told me that that's
amazing
in the cold height of the Cold War we
had 70,000 nuclear weapon
we've now got maybe 10,000 he says more
dangerous now than men without that
debate climate change and the second
comparable threat and this one is
inexorable it's coming maybe we had in
the case of nuclear weapons at least we
know in principle how to solve the
problem just get rid of them and that
can be done in the case of climate
changes several lobbies that we know the
answer but it's coming it's dangerous
the signs are already obvious the
scientific basis is very convincing it's
very serious just to take one example
happen to be mentioned by Steven Chu
Nobel laureate in physics a former
Energy Secretary recently gave a talk in
which he pointed out that the last time
that the earth was just a little warmer
than it is today was about a hundred
thousand hundred twenty thousand years
ago and at that point the sea level was
six to nine meters higher than it is
today the National Commission on climate
change US National Commission that just
came out with the report a couple of
weeks ago the Trump administration of
course dismissed it in which they
predicted that in this within this
century there's a fair of possibility
that the sea level might rise about two
meters if we continue on our current
course I don't have to you don't have to
have much of an imagination to imagine
what kind of a world it would be if the
sea level were say even a meter higher
than it is
today what would happen for example in a
country like Bangladesh a coastal plan
with hundreds of millions of people and
if you think there's a refugee problem
today just imagine what will be then or
what it would be like if New York City
were half under water and so on the
social and economic and personal
consequences consequence to agriculture
a probable huge drought in Mexico on and
on the consequences are immense and just
take a look at this morning's paper you
read the reports from the meetings in
Bonn
this is the that was the word there was
a major conference in Paris as most of
you know in 2015 it aimed to reach a
treaty verifiable treaty but it could
not do so for one reason the Republican
party at the United States which is in
my view the most dangerous organization
in human history it's an outrage is
common but I think it's accurate there's
never been an organization in human
history which was dedicated to making it
impossible for human life to continue in
organized form and that's what we face
so Paris had just a voluntary meetings
the next conference following Paris was
in Morocco was taking place in last
November the conference came to a stop
on November 8th because of the news from
the United States and then the question
was can the world even continue with the
most powerful state in human history
refusing to participate in the effort to
deal with the problem and works
dedicated to escalating the problem
which is fact last meeting is right now
just finished and the basic conclusion
from the meeting is
to most countries are not meeting their
promises and even to the extent that
they are we seem to be moving towards a
future where optimistically there will
be 3 degrees centigrade and rise over
the industrial period which is a
catastrophe
and it could be higher because this
Lawrence can explain better than I can
they're very likely possible nonlinear
consequences coming things that will
suddenly explode like as the permafrost
melts as it's doing is huge amounts vast
amounts of carbon are going to be
released mostly methane that's very
lethal and this could start an
escalating cycle it could rapidly
escalate the nation with the melting of
the glacier ice caps in Antarctic ice
and this could just explode we're right
on the cusp of possible catastrophes and
we're not taking it anywhere near
seriously enough that's the second a
third major crisis is a pandemic and in
fact the permafrost melting may lead to
an uncontrollable pandemic nobody knows
for sure but buried in there are
bacteria that humans have never had any
contact with in fact they go back to
yawns when they become released nobody
knows what happens these are the
experiments that we're carrying out as
lawrence pointed out this morning we're
carrying out an experiment with thee and
with the environment that is necessary
for survival and the results of this
experiment could be not too bad we're
not too sure but it could be utterly
disastrous and in that respect it's
rather like nuclear weapons so yes we're
facing these things right now I mean let
me elaborate because I know we've had a
discussion recently onstage about this
but but when you talk about Bangladesh
in the same newspaper articles
as you probably know the Seychelles and
Fiji are already experiencing problems
we're already asking for aid because
right now it's hard to get fresh water
because the salt water is intruding
because the sea level is already
increased and and and and the real one
of the real tragedies of climate change
is that that the countries that created
it are not the ones that are going to
suffer as much as that as the other
countries went on my parents owned a
little store when I was a kid and they
used to the sign above all the pottery
saying if you break it it's yours we've
broken it but these people are asking
for help and I know you've talked about
in some sense the moral issue the fact
that this is a this is an example of
people who really effortless when when
the scientist who's the head of
environmental issues in Bangladesh
recently pointed out that we're facing a
situation in which tens of millions of
people at Bangladesh maybe hundreds of
millions that will have to flee and he
says it's the responsibility of the
people who created this problem the rich
developed societies did basically create
the problem that is now being already
having a devastating effect on poor
people who had nothing to do with the
problem and that does oppose an immense
moral problem for the rich it's very
much like the so called refugee crisis
it's actually a moral crisis for the
West people are fleeing from Africa to
Europe dying in the Mediterranean
thousands dying in the Mediterranean the
Europeans are trying to keep them away
from our shores
just like the country to the north keep
them away why are people fleeing from
Africa to Europe there's a couple of
centuries of
answers to that which go right up to the
present it's not ancient history take
the Congo which ought to be one of the
richest countries in the world
it was devastated by the Belgians tens
of millions of people killed it goes
right to the president 1960 Congo did
decolonized
Belgians technically pulled out the
Congo had a charismatic young highly
capable highly respected political
leader Patrice Lumumba the CIA was
instructed to murder and they didn't
manage to do it because the Belgians got
there first
killed him tortured him the United
States and the Western countries then
supported a murderous kleptomaniac
Mobutu who devastated the country
afterwards and right at this moment
every one of you who has said iPhone or
any of these devices is benefitting from
the contemporary genocide in the eastern
Congo and multiple national corporations
are hovering around the eastern Congo
while militias are murdering
slaughtering people billions have been
killed in the last couple of years so
that minerals can be extracted which
goes straight into your iPhone these
things are happening right now now
people are fleeing from Africa French
Africa Belgium Africa British Africa to
the to Europe and the Europeans are
trying to arrange for them to die in the
Mediterranean and say they're facing a
refugee crisis this is exactly
duplicated in the United States and
Central America and Mexico the same
story it's a serious moral crisis and
should be viewed that way not a refugee
crisis and the same is true of the
environmental crisis it's a moral crisis
for those who
perpetrated this situation and in fact
have done so not so much because they
wanted to destroy the environment but
because they're following principles
which guarantee destruction of the
environment I mean this very simple
property familiar property of market
systems very well known to economists or
anyone who thinks for a minute in a
market system if you make a transaction
say I sell Lawrence a car if we're
paying attention we make a good deal for
ourselves but we don't pay any attention
to what economists call externalities
the effect that this transaction has on
you and it has an effect there's more
pollution there's more traffic jams
there's more accidents it may seem like
a small effect for each person but it
multiplies when Goldman Sachs makes a
risky transaction they if they're paying
attention take into account the
potential risk for themselves but they
do not take into account what's called
the systemic risk the probability if
they go may have a loss the whole system
may crash which in fact came very close
to happening in 2008 required a huge
government bailout of a big insurance
company and others to make sure just as
we're doing that with the environment
we're tossing garbage and the other guys
back long that's a necessary property of
market systems what the effect on the
environment is not a cost that one takes
into account in market behavior
these are deep-seated problems of modern
Western society
I mean even the best economists like
Gary Becker or Milton Friedman or
whoever understand that markets have
failures and that their externalities
but they also understand that the market
system could solve those problems so for
example you mentioned that the cost of
part of the climate change issue and
it's very well developed by Harden is
the tragedy of the Commons
and here the market failure that what it
is of everyone is from is of no one and
you create externalities when you don't
take into account the cost that you
provoked all but how about if this
problem that we know what it is as you
explain it and how happened which George
Planet for a market failure is not being
solved also through a market solution
that's all good for us or etc to that
group the corporation the person or the
country that are creating the
externality and that's part of the
market system is a not perfect system
and we know it I believe probably very
different value that it's the best
system that we have but it also got its
own solution we cannot solve this
externality through a market system that
eternalize the cost pressures that
quickly well first of all we should
recognize that we have a very partial
market system yeah it's not simply the
case that fossil fuel companies try to
maximize their profit they are also very
heavily subsidized there's hundreds of
billions of thought four hundred billion
dollars the most recent estimate for
substances fossil fuels is a huge amount
of public taxpayer subsidy to the fossil
fuel corporations we're essentially
paying
to destroy the Commons the same is true
of financial institutions huge public
subsidies so it's a very mixed market
system it's the kind of system you'd
expect when you ask who designs it it's
a system that's designed that doesn't
just grow naturally and it's naturally
designed in the interests of the
designers that should be a big surprise
so if you look at the so-called trade
agreements what the media what the
commentators call free trade agreements
they're not free trade agreements there
are agreements designed by the corporate
executives but lobbyists by investors
for their interests their investor
rights agreements what happens to the
population is a kind of a side
consideration it's another externality
and this the semi market systems we have
are highly distorted systems obviously
it right in Mexico takes a NAFTA one
element of NAFTA was that US
agribusiness should have free access to
Mexican markets well US agribusiness
doesn't work on a market system it gets
huge subsidies from the taxpayer and
it's perfectly obvious that no matter
how efficient Mexican company loans can
be they're not going to compete with
highly subsidized corporate agribusiness
so it naturally drives them off the land
and so on now when you get to these
solution to this problem when there are
semi market systems yes they can be
adapted to be in the interests of people
not corporations actually what you see
happening right now is pretty dramatic
in the United States solar energy by now
affects mainly to China is becoming very
by market principles alone of a very an
appropriate technology even for those
who make profit
Koch Industries uses solar power but
there is an effort maybe underway by
corporate backed organizations to try to
get the states to prevent the use of
solar power by introducing legislation
which will make it more expensive so for
example if you put solar panels and your
house in the United States up until now
you've been able when there's excess
power you were able to send it back to
the grid and get credits for it they're
trying to cut that off which will make
it harder and where we live in Arizona
the sun is shining all the time in every
house ought to have solar panels but the
the corporate system is trying to impose
legislation which will prevent people
from doing it that's not markets that's
concentrated power trying to shape and
manipulate markets and their interest
and it can be done differently
there's also another point that we
should bear in mind up until the the
modern state capitalist system was
revolutionary in many ways one of the
ways in which it was revolutionary is
that it changed it's slowly over time
and over enormous resistance changed
people's attitudes towards labor towards
each other and towards the Commons the
traditional Commons in England elsewhere
were nurtured by the population if
you've read the Robin Hood novel these
stories there are bet defense of the
Commons against the Predators and that
was the normal way in which societies
existed you took care of the common
possessions on which you on which your
existence was space they were the source
of food of fuel of welfare and so on the
enclosure movements in England we
drove people off the Commons and
privatized them was the beginning of the
policies of institution of capitalist
institutions and morality which means
forget about the Commons and it's pretty
striking that today it's traditional
societies that are still dedicated to
trying to beat back this attempt to
destroy the environment yeah sure
I mean you know the point is that I I
know we're running short of time but I
was a when I first got to know no when I
was in MIT and I the great thing with
the physics departments they don't make
you take classes so I took nomes class
on for American foreign policy instead
and I learned something which is just so
obvious and in the context of what
you're saying said that the
four-year-old would know would expect
that foreign policy is not carried out
for altruistic reasons that each country
does what's in the benefit of the people
who are most powerful in that country
and and and I think this is I mean it's
if you asked anyone who hadn't been
schooled and all the all the propaganda
that's given out it would be obvious and
I think the context of what you're
saying is exactly that right I mean it's
what I learned from you is that just ask
who's benefiting and it's not surprising
that that's what happens well just well
everybody who's interested in this topic
he wrote an amazing book who runs the
world and many other books about media
and how they create propaganda you could
shared his values or not I think it's a
big debate yeah the other great part of
Noam Chomsky and which is the one that I
like the most is what he really makes a
landmark before him we thought that all
the long languages that we learn as kids
was not actually because we have like up
algorithmic genetical
system in our brain but that were born
with a kind of an innate software that
allow us to learn languages my question
now in relation from shifting from
politics to which is the topic that I
love that you have put on on the arena
is about linguistics and and up up and
interruption e no way it has a lot to do
with evolution and admire my question
astonishment in your theories explain
okay we have political part we arrived
to the system because the powerful
people and interest and whatever but now
I got to go to psychology and
evolutionary linguistics how did our
genes
arrived with that soft word my question
is is this because for an evolutionary
evil an evolutionary way that that's why
we have the software to acquire
languages or Estonia a genetic mutation
from no world with no purpose I have
always got that question for you I don't
want to miss it
well since it's happened it's evolution
because that's the way things happen and
evolution has many possible factors that
enter into it one of them is which
everybody's familiar with is adaptation
and survival another one is the creation
of the options that enter into the
struggle for survival that's mutations
so things happen for all kind of
accidental reasons and cosmic-ray
whatever it might be they're slight
changes in genes they change the nature
of the organism some of them or
successful adaptations and many are not
many of the successful adaptations died
out because you have to spread over a
population but over time organisms
changed that's evolution Homo sapiens as
far as we know is about people we you
know we humans we're about two hundred
thousand years old that's the origin of
rough origin of anatomically modern
humans there's no evidence of any
symbolic behavior prior to the
appearance of
we now know by genomic analysis that
human populations which were originally
very small populations in Africa began
to split roughly a hundred and
twenty-five thousand years ago and the
splits the different groups have
essentially the same cognitive faculties
including linguistic faculties so we
therefore know that that the appearance
of these capacities in the genomic
structure are prior to the separation
and probably after the creation of the
emergence of modern humans which is a
flick of an eye an evolutionary time
that's no time at all so what appears to
be the case is that our cognitive
capacities which include linguistic
capacity appeared along with modern
humans and what was it well that gets
into a question of what's going on in
the brain that provides the specific
mechanisms many of which we are coming
to understand that yield this unique
capacity as somebody before you may
recall said we're entering into a
digital world
well actually humans entered into a
digital world about two hundred thousand
years ago the human language is one of
the very rare digital systems in the
mock India in the biological world above
the level of DNA you really don't find
any others but something happened along
with modern humans that created a
digital system this incidentally a
system which allows us to construct an
infinite array of thoughts and transmit
them to others who can penetrate into
our minds and find out what we're
thinking
say that this capacity amazed the
founders of early modern science
Galileo regarded it as the greatest he
said invention we would now say
development in all of human history the
capacity to create an infinite array of
structured expressions digitally
infinite which is critical its digitally
infinite and forms thoughts articulates
them expresses them others in the words
of Galileo can penetrate into the
workings of our soul this is a most
amazing fact and it's the core of human
nature it's nothing like nothing
remotely like it in the animal world and
there's the bare beginnings and the
neurosciences of trying to make some
guesses about what might be involved
I just wanted to add to that because you
when we've talked before one thing you
said which i think is mark well first of
all what's fascinating is how modern
early modern humans were they're very
similar to us but the fact that language
as you said what we've discussed which I
think really amazed me was not primarily
to communicate but to internalise it's
false and I think that maybe that's
worth emphasizing maybe you could speak
on that for a minute if you just any of
you just think about it
you can't go five seconds without
thinking internally in language your
cunny
you're constantly doing something which
we regard as basically talking to
yourself a tiny percentage of that gets
externalized so and some of that is used
for a communicator and actually if you
look more closely that's no time to go
into it here what you are thinking in
your mind is a kind of externalization
of what's going on internally we now
have very good evidence that there's a
lot of mental computation forming the
expressions that you that reach
awareness
that's happening before awareness and
it's impenetrable to introspection but
it's happening constantly that's just an
intrinsic part of your nature
we just got four minutes early 33
minutes to make you very quickly
questions and answers this is a just no
question okay as we have this innate
cognitive quality to learn languages to
wake up the same innate attribute for
moral for moral values as humans yes or
no well that's an interesting question
which is just coming under investigation
there's actually very interesting work
by a man named John me fail he's now a
professor of law at Georgetown he's I
was one of the supervisors of his
dissertation he did a brilliant
dissertation in which he was trying to
show that there's a common moral kind of
grammar since then there's other work by
mark Hauser and others who've done
experimental comparative work work with
children to see if there are deep moral
principles which are just part of our
common nature and all of this is just at
the edge of research and a very live
topic ok good well I think that as I was
thinking you were talking about word
word association let me just say Adam
Smith Adam Smith well my dream of going
back and time travel would be to be in
Edinburgh talking to Adam Smith and
David you Skinner
Skinner I can't give a word because it's
too complicated Skinner devised a very
useful experimental technique called
operant conditioning it's very good for
training pigeons
things like that it's used in
pharmaceutical corporations to tell
whether a pigeon is being affected by a
drug and so on he tried to expend
expanded way beyond this and that failed
completely okay
physics physics is something I wish I
were smart enough to understand one word
Mexico Mexico mixing your mind what
comes to my mind is too far from God and
too close to the United States the next
question is sorry I couldn't hear when
one word to come to your mind one we're
not from Trump again I can't give one
word he's a very successful con man you
shouldn't take seriously his
pronouncements I don't think they mean
anything there they have two purposes
one to keep him the focus of attention
which means they have to be more
outrageous everyday second to ensure
that his popular base remains loyal and
the popular base which is maybe a third
of the population has really
totalitarian attitudes they have faith
in their God
Trump beyond anything else and he has to
keep them under control if he's going to
maintain his position of power now what
is he using it for he's using it to
direct attention to him well the really
savage wing of the Republican Party the
Paul Ryan wing are busy carefully
dismantling every element of the federal
government that works for the benefit of
people of workers of consumers and
concentrating meanwhile concentrating
power and wealth and their true
constituency
which is ultra wealth and corporate
power that's what we see happening the
world can suffer from it and will suffer
from it my dear friend Lawrence one word
Chomsky hero hero
