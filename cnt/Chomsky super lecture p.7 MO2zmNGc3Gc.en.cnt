well you know Adam Smith once you're
supposed to worship him but not read him
you know what's worth reading he wants
remarked somewhere that if you find two
businessmen talking to each other
they're involved in a conspiracy against
the public you know something like that
and yeah there's something to that but
you know it's not as though I mean there
you can read descriptions like what
you're saying incidentally in the
business press so for example in the
Financial Times in London which is like
the main you know the most important
business newspaper in the world a couple
of years ago they had an article by the
economics correspondent of the BBC you
know it's all very establishment stuff
in which he said that something like
this that what's evolving is what he
called a de facto world government in a
new Imperial age and the de facto world
government is a set of shadowy
institutions under the areas or another
their original what they're doing which
basically served the interests of
transnational capital and financial
institutions and he said for example the
g7 you know the seven big rich countries
meaning just their executives and their
leadership nobody else knows what
they're doing the IMF the World Bank you
know big then the GATT council now would
be the World Trade Organization and yeah
they get together and they're running in
the fact the world government I think
that's kind of a you know it's kind of a
metaphor I mean Lex not that they get
together somewhere and say okay here's
what we're going to do they do get
together but it's usually extremely
boring like if you were unfortunate
enough to have gone to this Davos
conference the other day I'm sure you
would have been bored out of your mind I
mean I can go and I didn't see the
document but but having read things like
I did i do a lot of reading of this
stuff like the trilateral commission is
one of them and they publish regular
documents so boring i mean after after a
couple years i stop describing you know
it's so predictable and boring and
pablum and so on and so forth and
besides you can read it in foreign
affairs or the
you know in the air tonight business
page where ever you want any day but yes
they do get together and sometimes when
things get scary they really do things
so they take the trilateral commission
the one publication of theirs which
really is interesting and worth reading
this is the Commissioner was put
together by David Rockefeller around
1973 and it's one of the ones that
people refer to when they talk about
this you know secret nexus of rulers and
so on all those essays mostly abor but
in 1975 the first publication was very
interesting and I urge you to read it if
you haven't done it it's called the the
crisis of democracy and it's very much
in line with the kind of stuff I was
talking about before remember this is
after this is first getting together
after the 60s okay all this ferment went
on in the 60s which you know women and
minorities and all kind of people are
supposed to be kept in their place where
suddenly trying to get into the public
arena and doing something about their
interests and that again drove people
crazy just as as did the working class
struggles in the 30s so here you have a
gathering of a leech trilateral means
United States Europe and Japan so these
are elite elements mostly liberal on the
liberal side incidentally like if you
look at the composition it's around
roughly speaking around Carter Democrats
fact the whole carter administration
including Carter himself was drawn from
this group that's roughly the complexion
both in all in all three of the
countries and they were concerned about
what they called the crisis of democracy
and it's interesting to read what they
said because at that point they were
concerned the crisis of democracy is the
fact that normally passive and
marginalized parts of the population the
overwhelming majority are suddenly
coming trying to get into the public
arena to press their demand well you
know like if you believe the stuff they
teach you in civics classes that's
supposed to be democracy but if you're
smart enough to have made it to Harvard
you know that that's the crisis of
democracy we got to stop it and in fact
the the the American reporter you know
the guy who wrote the u.s. part of it is
a professor at Harvard
after he got one of my favorite titles
he was called professor of the science
of Government at Harvard I've always
liked that one uh Sam Huntington yeah he
I think he's now a university professor
or something but his he was he wrote the
American side of this trilateral thing
but the others are more or less the same
I don't mean it suggests he's different
I think he's a kind of like a new deal
Democrat or something probably isn't he
something like that you know he's like
this is what I'm talking about Jesse
Helms ok this is the there in fact he
gave his ideal described the good old
days sort of let his hair down a little
is that in the in the good old days he
said before the crisis of democracy he
said Truman had been this is almost a
quote Truman had been able to run the
country with the help of a few Wall
Street lawyers and thin and Sears okay
that's that alleged conspiracy you're
talking about of course he's
exaggerating you know it wasn't just
Truman and a bunch of Wall Street
lawyers infinite Sears but that's the
image that would be perfect we had that
there'd be no crisis of democracy but
when you have women and blacks and young
people and old people and farmers and
all these scum trying to get into the
public arena yeah that's a problem
exactly the problem that Madison worried
about in fact so you got to somehow
marginalize them all right in this case
they were public I mean it is public in
a way I mean that is you can read it you
got to work a little to find it but it's
worth reading but most of the stuff is
it's very boring it's like it's like the
literature of social science hard hard
work I mean you got to do it if you feel
a duty you know
