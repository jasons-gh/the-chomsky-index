for the benefit of the translators I'll
try to break out of customary pattern
and keep pretty much to a prepared text
our thoughts are naturally focused on
the present moment and on what may lie
ahead but we can easily mislead
ourselves if we do not attend carefully
to long-standing continuities and their
roots and institutions that have been
stable for a long time so I hope you'll
bear with me if I go back into history a
little bit not out of a just an interest
in history but because I think that what
we discover is that if by understanding
it enables us to overcome illusions
about the present and the future the
inter-american system of which the OAS
is a part goes back to the early 19th
century in varying ways the system has
always been dominated by the enormous
disparity between the one and the rest
for the United States the first and most
fundamental of our foreign policies is
the Monroe Doctrine quoting Secretary of
State John Foster Dulles as the as
Washington prepared to overthrow the
government of Guatemala in 1954 with
consequences that we need not review
what is the Monroe Doctrine well its
meaning was explained by president
woodrow wilson in his secretary of state
they agreed i'm quoting that in its
advocacy of the monroe doctrine the
United States considers its own
interests the integrity of other
American nations is an incident not an
end while this may seem based on
selfishness alone the author of the
doctrine had no higher or more generous
motive in its declaration although it
would be in politic to state these fact
openly the president advised so this is
for internal discussion not for public
presentation history demonstrates very
well the accuracy of this perception and
it is understood well enough so one
enduring theme of the inter-american
system has been the effort to make
non-intervention the cornerstone of the
system and the system itself an
instrument of restraint upon its
powerful neighbor I'm quoting the major
scholarly history intervention includes
economic coercion that's stressed in the
charter of the Organization of American
States and by many observers who warned
that a people economically enslaved but
politically free will end by losing all
freedom it's an observation of Jose
marty's that extends to the rich
societies as well well what about the
powerful neighbor the powerful neighbor
has been guided by a different principle
one that was articulated by the
distinguished statesman Dean Acheson in
justifying the embargo against Cuba in
1963 he informed the Association for
international law that the propriety of
a response to a challenge to the power
position and prestige of the United
States is not a legal issue although he
said international law is sometimes
useful to gild our positions with a esos
derived from very general moral
principles updating traditional doctrine
President Clinton informed the 1993 that
the United States will act
multilaterally when possible but
unilaterally when necessary that
position was reiterated by ambassador
Madeleine Albright and a year later and
in 1999 by Secretary of Defense William
Cohen he declared that the United States
is committed to unilateral use of
military power to defend vital interests
which include ensuring
access to key markets energy supplies
and strategic resources earlier the
State Department had explained
Washington's rejection of world court
jurisdiction on the grounds that I'm
quoting again most of the world cannot
be counted on to share our view and the
mid and the majority often opposes the
United States on important international
questions hence we must reserve to
ourselves the power to determine how we
will act and which matters fall
essentially within the domestic
jurisdiction of the United States as
determined by the United States in this
case these were the actions that the
court condemned as the unlawful use of
force against Nicaragua on the side i
would say that in any country that
valued its freedom the united states or
canada all of these things would be
taught in elementary school these are
the sort of core truisms of
International Affairs these truisms for
and again that's what they are are
regularly illustrated in practice and
they're also clearly articulated
particularly in the internal record and
they're understood we witnessed that
just a few weeks ago when the political
leaders of the South roughly eighty
percent of the population of the world
met first in Colombia than in Havana and
issued declaration the declaration of
the South Summit the declaration
condemned the form of globalization
that's been instituted by the West
designed to serve the needs of
concentrated private power with the
needs of others considered an incident
not an end in wilsonian terms the
declaration called for a new global
order in which the highest priority will
be the right to independent development
in suddenly a right that the United
States officially rejects
strong terms and a rate that is
virtually barred by the rules of the
World Trade Organization which
systematically banned the devices that
were used by England the United States
and other rich countries to win their
place in the Sun and they also the it
also imposes a highly protectionist set
of rules including a patent regime which
again the rich country is never accepted
while they were developing which is
designed to ensure huge profits and
control of the technology of the future
for the corporate entities that rely on
state power the South Summit rejects
this form of globalization forcefully
and insists on quoting it insists on the
right of developing countries to choose
the path of development in accordance
with their national priorities and
objectives and to determine their own
fiscal policies without any interference
in their internal affairs that's echoing
the OAS charter the summit also firmly
rejects all forms of coercive economic
measures including unilateral sanctions
actually about half the population of
the world right now is subject the
unilateral US sanctions in one case Cuba
so severe as the bar even food and
medicine these sanctions have been
declared illegal by just about every
appropriate body including the OS but
irrelevantly on the smithsonian echa
Sounion principal the summit also
rejected quoting the so-called right of
humanitarian intervention which much of
the world regards as a new guys for
Western imperialism under the familiar
cloak of righteous moralism well these
positions are conventional as is the
fact that they are unheard so the
Declaration of the countries that
account for eighty percent of the
world's population receive no mention at
all in the United States press also
removed from the
the guy are the motives for the
persistent military and economic
coercion which goes back a long time the
motives precede the Cold War and they
hold with little change after it ended
in the interim the Cold War provided a
convenient pretext but it was rarely a
leading element the internal record
makes that very clear case by case and
it's worth understanding so take for
example the case of Cuba the Cuban
threat was explained in secret but it's
been declassified for some years the
Cuban threat was out was explained by
was outlined by historian Arthur
Schlesinger he was reporting the
conclusions of john f kennedy's Latin
American mission to the incoming
president back in 1961 the Cuban threat
he said is the spread of the castro idea
of taking matters into one's own hands
which might stimulate the poor and
underprivileged elsewhere in Latin
America who are now demanding
opportunities for a decent living
there's a name for that it's called the
virus effect the virus that might infect
others or the rotten apple effect the
rotten apple that might spoil the barrel
there was a Cold War connection and here
it is total in toto the Soviet Union
hovers in the wings flourishing large
development loans and presenting itself
as the model for achieving modernization
in a single generation so that's the
Soviet thread if you look at the
overthrow of Guatemalan democracy it was
similarly motivated for the public it
was the Russians are coming in
internally intelligence US intelligence
warned fording visceral quotes that the
social and economic programs of the
elected government met the aspirations
of labor in the peasantry and inspired
the loyalty and conformed to the
self-interest of most politically
conscious Guatemalans the government was
preparing to mobilize the hitherto inert
peasantry introducing unwell
forms of democracy still worse Guatemala
was becoming a virus its agrarian reform
is a powerful propaganda weapon its
broad social program of aiding the
workers and the peasants in a victorious
struggle against the upper classes and
large foreign enterprises has a strong
appeal to the populations of Central
American neighbors where similar
conditions prevail the result you know
it was an end to the years of spring in
the country of eternal tyranny in the
words of a Guatemalan poet or in the
words of the Eisenhower administration
it was the addition of a new and
glorious chapter to the already great
tradition of the American States it can
take your choice similar concerns are
illustrated throughout the internal doc
I'm pre-record in fact out of the world
and East Asia and elsewhere they
constitute the rational core of what's
called the domino theory and the reason
why the domino theory consistently
guides policy very rationally different
imagery is preferred for public
consumption but that's the guiding
thinking and it makes sense in an ugly
way the same principles guide attitudes
toward democracy the issues are very
well explained and one one of the
leading scholarly studies of the current
version of democratization spite Thomas
Carruthers and Latin American scholar
who writes with what he calls an
insider's perspective since he took part
in the democracy and Hannah program and
Reagan State Department he thinks that
these programs were sincere but he
describes them as a failure because but
anything it was shanked and sought to
maintain the basic order of quite
undemocratic societies and to avoid
populist base change inevitably seeking
only limited top-down forms of
Democratic Change did not risk upsetting
the traditional structures of power with
which the United States has long been a
long
which is correct that's the that's what
democracy is supposed to mean and case
after illustrates an to take a postal
post-cold work well Cold War example
takes a haiti poorest country in the
hemisphere and the one that has had the
benefit of the longest tutelage by the
united states the case of haiti is
another illustration of continuity of
policy from before the Cold War the
present with very little change a haiti
was invaded and occupied by woodrow
wilson before the revolution that was in
defense against the Huns the russian
hadn't arrived yet that left a bitter
legacy in the 1980's haiti was turned
into an experimental subject for
neoliberal programs that were going to
turn it into the taiwan of the pacific
USA denounced didn't state haiti not
taiwan the program sent the country
deeper into ruin for example virtually
wiped the rice production by requiring
unrestricted import of subsidized us
rice which in fact was granted even
higher public subsidies under the
radically aunty market doctrines of the
reagan administration somehow in a truly
inspiring achievement license carried
out an amazing democratic election they
elected their first democratic
government in 1990 and people who want
to learn something about what democracy
really is should look at that election
it was quite a lesson for the rest of
the continent including North America
the election upset the traditional
structures of power with which the
United States has long been allied and
for others words and that's a violation
of the rules of the game Washington
moved instantly to undermine and destroy
the government a few months later it was
removed by a military coup the OAS
declared an umber
go but that was undermined at once I by
the US government by exempting US firms
President Bush and Clinton went even
further Clinton particularly they even
authorized illegal shipments of oil to
the military junta and its wealthy
supporters so in fact it was an embargo
but only directed against the poor not a
wealthy in the military government after
the population was subjected the three
years of terror the United States agreed
to as they put it restored democracy but
on condition that the government except
the harsh neoliberal programs of the US
candidate in the nineteen ninety
election who had received fourteen
percent of the vote so we have democracy
the country now continues on its
downward spiral thanks in no small
measure to its treatment by the powerful
neighbor through the past century from
the early 1990s the worst human rights
violator in the hemisphere by far has
been Kalam it's also been the leading
recipient of us arms and military
training that correlation incidentally
is very well established from way back
in nineteen ninety nine Colombia became
the world's leading recipient of us arms
displacing turkey there to others Israel
in Egypt but there in a separate
category turkey and the transition is an
interesting one it explains a lot about
what's going on a turkey had received a
huge flow of us arms since 1984 that
peaked in 1997 the arms flow in 1997
alone exceeded the entire period prior
to nineteen eighty four well what's
going on there was no Cold War
connection rather in 1984 turkey
launched a vicious campaign of ethnic
cleansing and atrocities against its
miserably oppressed Kurdish population
the worst
were under Clinton and they were quite
extreme Clinton provided eighty percent
of turkeys arms however by 1999 the
terror had largely largely succeeded so
the arms flow could reduce but Columbia
had not yet suppressed its internal
insurgencies these are rooted in
socio-economic conditions that are
shameful even by Latin American
standards which is saying a lot they
terror became much worse under the
initiatives of the Kennedy
administration which provided the arms
and military training for internal
repression throughout the hemisphere
there was a mission to Columbia headed
by a special forces general that mission
Kennedy mission recommended that the
security forces as necessary execute
paramilitary sabotage and or terrorist
activities against known communist
proponents that's a phrase which has
very broad coverage the 1990s the annual
poll of atrocities has been about 3,000
killed and three hundred thousand
refugees the overwhelming majority are
attributed to the military and its
paramilitary associates the close
linkage between them has been documented
once again in the past few months by a
long report of Human Rights Watch in a
United Nations report in 1999 atrocities
increased sharply almost eighty percent
of them attributed to the paramilitary
military events and again conforming to
traditional patterns a u.s. arms flow
increased in fact tripled in 1999 and
it's now scheduled to rise even more
stably under the pretext of a drug war
the Russians not being around as a
pretext well the pretext can't be taken
seriously but the problems of drug use
are indeed seriously the most severe of
these by a large factor involves tobacco
use
that's the worst public health problem
in the United States the Supreme Court
recently declared it the worst public
health hazard in the United States it
causes about 25 times as many deaths as
all illegal drugs to mind now tobacco
use has been declining in the United
States and producers have therefore
returned to Edwards there's a five-fold
increase from nineteen seventy five to
nineteen eighty-five notice that other
countries must accept us produce lethal
substances on pain of trade sanctions
and they must even accept advertising
vulnerable populations or else they get
hit by super 301 the Colombian cartels
in contrast are not permitted in
advertising campaigns extolling the
wonders of cocaine quote leading public
health researcher as they write the
effects of aggressive marketing and
advertising by American firms is in good
measure responsible for a sizable
increase in smoking rates for women and
youth in Asian countries where doors
were forced open by threat of severe US
trade sanctions that's cigarettes and
advertising the death toll is
incalculable one Oxford University of
ademi ologist estimated that in China
alone among children under D today 50
million will die of cigarette related
diseases a substantial number because of
highly selective us free trade doctrine
that example illustrates some of the
welfare outcomes of the fanatic
political theology that elevates trade
to the highest ranked among human values
trade should be thought of in quotes
because of the elastic and highly
ideological construction of that concept
well for all harmful substances it is
well known that treatment and prevent
Shin are the most effective measures the
most widely cited study is by the RAND
Corporation sponsored by the u.s. army
in the Office of National Drug Control
Policy they found that funds spent on
domestic drug treatment were 23 times as
effective that's called first country
controlled and Clinton's Colombia plan
11 times as effective as interdiction
and seven times as effective as domestic
law enforcement there were efforts to
introduce some limited funding for
treatment and prevention in the current
Colombia plan also for alternative crop
programs that peasants and the Colombian
guerrillas have been requesting but
that's all in vain the inexpensive and
effective path will not be followed
rather the drug war is crafted to target
poor peasants abroad and poor people at
home by the use of force not give
measures to alleviate the problems that
allegedly motivate it at a fraction of
the cost the drug war is described on
all sides as a failure and then the
failed methods are pursued more
vigorously of alternatives are rejected
so a rational person will therefore
conclude that the drug war is achieving
its actual goals it's pretty clear what
those are it's providing a pretext to
maintain traditional structures of power
and free access to markets and resources
abroad and at home it's a device to
control the superfluous population what
are called the DISA shabb basin
Colombian jargon the ones you throw away
they're removed to the rapidly expanding
prison system meanwhile the rest of the
population is frightened which is not an
unimportant task in a period in a
domestic form of structural adjustment
is being imposed which is imposing a
significant cost on the majority of the
population and one last comment about
that the form of globalization
that is by Western Power has been
accompanied by a significant
deterioration of macroeconomic statists
growth rates have slowed considerably
worldwide along with productivity and
capital investment interest rates have
been much higher which slowed growth
financial markets have been highly
volatile that requires regulated public
bailout of banks and investors and
subjects populations to severe crises in
the United States wage levels for the
majority have stagnated or declined for
over 20 years that's an unprecedented
failure of the economy and the workload
has sharply increased to the highest
level in the industrial world social
indicators have declined from their peak
in the mid 70s at the onset of
globalization back to the level of about
1960 the situation elsewhere is similar
mostly worse in fact the World Bank
recently reported that Latin America is
no better off than it was more than two
decades ago despite far-reaching
economic reforms which raises some
obvious questions about the reforms
financial liberalisation which is a core
part of Western instituted globalization
a financial liberalisation undermines
popular sovereignty it's intended to do
that socio economic policy falls into
the hands of what is sometimes called a
virtual Parliament of investors and
lenders who have veto power over policy
they can block irrational policies that
merely help people not profit simply by
sending capital out of the country
that's one of the reasons why post World
War two Bretton Woods system which has
been dismantled since the 1970s one of
the reasons why it was founded on
capital controls and relatively fixed
exchange rates that many kannamma
scribed the pre neoliberal period as a
golden age
that has been supplanted by a leaden age
it is however a golden age for a few for
the owners the managers the investors
and the authors of the fairy tales about
fairy tale economies but it should
hardly be a great surprise that one
hears different voices in the streets
and the villages throughout the world
and outside these doors as well
