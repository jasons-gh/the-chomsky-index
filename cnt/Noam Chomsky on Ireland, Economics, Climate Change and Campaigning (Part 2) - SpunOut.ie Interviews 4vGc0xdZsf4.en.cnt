terms of obviously that the previous
model of development has failed looking
in your own experience in the US and
overseas what do you see as alternative
models for social and economic
development and perhaps where do you see
signs of hope in the instance of hope
today I think are probably in South
America in South America for the first
time in 500 years essentially European
conquests has begun to confront its
fundamental internal problems these are
the traditional
Latin American society has been sharply
split between wealthy European eyes
often white elite which is quite wealthy
oriented towards us so of the
responsibilities for their own society
separated from the other societies of
the region while living in a real mass
of misery and oppression
the and the Latin America does have
substantial resources internal but this
has been a plaything for its wealthy
elite sons of the imperial powers united
states and recent years and those
problems are beginning to be addressed
other countries are beginning to
integrate with one another for the first
time which is a prerequisite for
independence and they've also begun to
in various ways face some of their
internal problems some of the examples
are very striking like bolivia where
it's the poorest countries South America
but the majority of the population is
indigenous about a decade ago they began
to become sufficiently organized so that
they were able to take significant steps
towards controlling their own society
and economy and by 2005 even elect the
wrong someone for their own ranks as
President Evo Morales it has just been
reelected with even higher vote partly
because of the remarkably successful
economic policies quite an impressive
growth
and for the first time the rights of the
indigenous which already are being are
gaining serious attention the policies
of the government involve control over
resources problems of cultural rights
which are very significant and Multi
multi cultural society indigenous rights
problems of justice and there being the
initiative for dealing with them is
coming from a substantial popular
movement that's these are democratic
achievements we should heart the magical
swear there's plenty wrong with it and
of course the traditional elite is
bitter and angry and backed by the
United States of course so is plenty of
conflict for example the Obama
administration has one of the forces
that goes on in the world as well the
drove the work and it is a with drugs
but they have on the administration
recently decertified the two Latin
American countries claiming that they
don't cooperate sufficiently of the drug
war that Bolivia and Venezuela clearly
political of nineteen
around and that's illustration of the
hostility of the traditional elites and
their traditional Thakur the United
States in the face of popular movements
that are really making substantial gains
similar things are happening in Ecuador
in different ways in Brazil Argentina
these these are important moves I'm sure
there will be plenty of setbacks the
problems are enormous but it's it's
substantial progress I mean the Latin
American was one of the most rigorous
adherence to the neoliberal programs
dictated by the United States the IMF in
the World Bank and suffered tremendously
from them
but it has pretty much overthrown that
this moving towards
could be successful no that's not a
radical the model by any means that's a
very moderate model and I think there
are things that can go much farther
I'm sceptic say the United States
richest country in the world in
comparable advantages it's been through
30 years of from some points of view of
the worst economic period in its history
there's plenty of wealth but it's
concentrated in the very few pockets for
the majority of the population ever
since the Reagan years for the majority
of the population real wages have
stagnated pretty much recent years of
decline the benefits have declined the
working hours of increase
infrastructures collapsing
these are meanwhile the economy is being
fashion-wise around 1970 maybe three
percent of the gross domestic product
was produced by the financial industries
and now it's over third the corollary to
that is the productive manufacturing is
called it out sent abroad
just which means which means decent jobs
decent work opportunities reasonable
life for families and communities this
has led to tremendous the first of us
with the tremendous economic crisis
we're right in the middle of and also
real anger populist anger which is very
understandable while the population is
suffering you know not suffering by
third-world stand it's suffering
relative to what I have an enrichment
the financial industries are just
ballooning profits are bigger than ever
after a huge public bail they're giving
away huge bonuses to their executives
and of course that creates that
justified anger and it could be very
dangerous there's a sentence there's a
similar anger in Ireland
I'd say and I'm just curious as to when
you look at that anger in the situation
in the US and situation in Ireland on
reference to the experience in Latin
America what do you think that ordinary
people in both our countries can learn
from those experiences and how can we
organize and think differently was
strange to say but I think we could
learn a lot from the poorest and most
repressed population in the hemisphere
namely the indigenous population of the
first countries South America Bolivia
they took their fate into their own
hands and have succeeded
you know we're not Bolivia obviously
some more things will be done here so
take for example the manufacturing
industry well that's the basis for as a
functioning manufacturing industry is
going to be the basis for any successful
society advanced society people think of
manufacturing it's kind of you know
old-fashioned not a tech that's not true
manufacture it's very high-tech
industries
but it does offer employment it develops
wealth creates the basis for communities
to survive and flourish as manufactured
but does it have to be displaced abroad
in the interests of bankers it's not a
law of nature that's a law of special
form of the illiberal capitalism
