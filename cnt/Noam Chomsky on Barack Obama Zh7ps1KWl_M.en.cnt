what team make of this well branded
phenomenon of Hope which is obviously
part marketing but is it not also part
something else
well that's Barack Obama he has his way
presents himself or his party management
handlers presented him as basically the
kind of a blank slate I wish you didn't
write what it'd be like and there are a
few slogans hope unity change change you
know hope unity change now right then
whatever you like there and it does
arouse enthusiasm and you can understand
why I mean again about actually like 80%
of the population thinks the country is
going the wrong way it's been a for most
people in the United States the last
thirty years have been pretty grim on
this rich country so you know it's not
like the living in southern Africa
Africa but wait for the majority of the
population real wages have stagnated or
declined for about thirty years it's
been growth but it's going the wealth is
going in the very few pockets benefits
which were never very great have
declined work hours have greatly
increased and there isn't much to show
for it other than kind of you know maybe
staying kind of staying afloat you know
and there is tremendous dissatisfaction
with institutions I mean there's a lot
of talk about Bush's very low poll
ratings which is correct but people
sometimes overlook the fact that
Congress's poll ratings are even lower
in fact all institutions are almost all
all are just are not trusted and dislike
there's a sense everything's going wrong
so when somebody says hope change unity
and kind of talks eloquently
nice little guy and so on yeah
