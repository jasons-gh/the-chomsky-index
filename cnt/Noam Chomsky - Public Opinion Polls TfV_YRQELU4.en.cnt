public opinions and the results of votes
often turn out to be radically different
and some of the reasons are given by the
fate of referendum so for example take
where I live Massachusetts for years you
know every year there was a referendum
on progressive income tax for the state
now that would benefit you know
overwhelming benefit for the general
population you take a look at the public
opinion polls at the beginning very
strong support for it and then it slowly
declines by Election Day it's a minority
why did decline well huge propaganda
campaigns warning people that if you do
this all the business is going to flee
out of Massachusetts you won't have a
job your children will starve and so on
yeah that's just what the guys who own
the information system want you to
believe
so public opinion look at public opinion
polls for the same reason that they are
taken well why do we have so many public
opinion polls in the United States and
they're mostly business or initiated the
propaganda institutions like the PR
industry they want to keep their finger
on the public pulse they've got to know
how to design the propaganda so they
want to know what people are thinking so
in fact if you want to find out you can
find out too and you can find out how
these opinions are changed sometimes
sometimes they're very resilient
strikingly resilient so say take the
Vietnam War there was huge propaganda
justifying the war I mean among
articulate people there was virtually no
opposition to it contrary to what you're
told
there was pragmatic opposition you know
it's not working or something like that
but you know there's that kind of
opposition and Hitler's General Staff
after Stalingrad principled opposition
was almost non-existent this has been
studied incidentally literally almost
non-existent on the other hand if you
look at public opinion polls they're
quite different so public opinion
studies were taken regularly by the
Gallup poll is one of the questions
every you know regular questions in the
Gallup polls from around 1970 to the
early 90s last one I saw was what do you
think of the war in Vietnam given an
open set of choices you know
and options where you usually get low
numbers but it was a steady 70 percent
roughly you know plus or minus a little
that chose fundamentally wrong and
immoral not a mistake
there's nobody in educated opinion
articulate opinion whoever said that I
mean everybody who answered the question
that way was making it up for themselves
uh well you know that's it's striking
indication of the divergence between
public opinion and policy actually
another one is the multilateral
agreement on investments which is just
mentioned as soon as it became public
you know the whole thing collapsed
because for exactly the reason that the
negotiator said it looks like an end to
an era when we can make deals behind
closed doors and have them rubber
stamped by Parliament
there's rabble's getting involved in
things those are some of the major
reasons for for the kind of thing that
Orwell was talking about for you know
what controlled and free societies in
fact the more you you know the less
force as people win more freedom as we
people have you know meaning that the
power to coerce by violence has declined
the importance of propaganda has
increased and that's well understood I
mean you can you know you read it in
manuals of the public relations industry
and the productions of academic
intellectuals you know the founders of
modern political science public
intellectuals and so on you have to
control the public mind because we can't
control people in any other way well
under those conditions public opinion
polls are important and interesting but
voting is something different because
people are giving highly structured
choices structured by an information
system which is dedicated to maintaining
the power of those who owned and run it
and that power is enormous I'm in the
corporate control of the media's like a
small part of it corporate control of
the economy and social life is a far
stronger part the virtual Senate that I
mentioned
another part I mean unless we think
about those institutions worrying I mean
you know concern about things like
proportional representation or you know
voting by computer and so on may be of
some interest but it's like 10:30 effect
