there are two huge shadows that are
beyond everyone's mind in the background
at least whatever the immediate issues
are for the first time in the history of
the human species we're facing the
possibility and the likelihood of
destroying the possibilities for decent
human life one of these shadows has been
there since 1945 its nuclear war and
that's it's kind of a miracle that's
never happened if there's another one
which we don't know what can be done
about it or if anything can be done and
that's environmental crisis the groups
that are in the forefront of trying to
do something about it are the what we
call the uncivilized societies the
aboriginal societies First Nations
tribal societies their way in front I
remember one of my earliest childhood
memories is riding in a trolley car with
my mother somewhere and we passed a
textile plant where there were women on
strike outside police brutally beating
them which was standard US has a very
violent labor history my workers being
murdered on the job into the late 30s
and it's all of these are childhood
memories and also just discussions about
everything you know a lot of these my
own family
uncles aunts and so on and many of them
barely went to school a couple years of
elementary school a very educated
population and incidentally that's
traditional if you go back to the
British and American working classes in
the 19th century they were quite they
were self educated but highly educated
and take the main issue on the front
pages every day now that what to do
about the deficit okay just drove in
this morning listen to the liberal
public radio station and BR the
discussion about what to do all take for
granted we just got to do something
about the deficit that's actually the
public doesn't think so the public
regards the deficit a minor problem they
regard the main problem as joblessness
and in fact the deficit contributes to
getting jobs it's good for jobs and read
that in the business press it creates
demand businesses and investing because
you know more bothered for only the
government spending great command so the
public thinks yeah let's get after the
job now they're not alone like the
businessperson trees with them but not
policy so right now there's a new
project by as an organization called
alec american legislative the chain
exchange council of one of their new
projects is to introduce to get states
to introduce into the educational
programs children's educational programs
what they call balanced teaching about
the climate that's a code word for
climate change denial
the other groups the religious group try
to do the same thing with creationism we
have to balance teaching you know
evolutions ions and creation science and
there's a whole rubric of critical
thinking it's total nonsense but the
idea is to try to really make it a
stupid country right that's very
important for business because they want
to make sure term profits they don't
care what happens 20 years ago about
seventy percent of the population has
absolutely no influence on policy
they're disenfranchised totally the
lowest seventy percent on the income
wealth skill they might as well not
bother voting and most of them don't as
you move up the wealth income scale you
get a little more influence when you get
to the very top which is a tiny group
essentially get what they want that's
very remote from democracy I'm pretty
conservative like I was very involved
with the activist groups in the 60s and
since and young young kids you know so I
had to listen to plenty of rock music
and you know smell funny smells which I
didn't recognize anything and I kind of
endured it but it wasn't part of
unfortunately for us my wife and I my
own our own kids I'd like to listen to
John Bay is Joni Mitchell ones alone
that was fine you're okay with your
influencing the music you don't have to
listen to it as long as I don't have to
listen but I can listen up till about
you know late Stravinsky and then I kind
of tail off yeah fair enough
