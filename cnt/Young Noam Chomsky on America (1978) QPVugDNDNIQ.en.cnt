Thanks
several months ago arthur schlesinger
had a column in the wash and the Wall
Street Journal which was widely
reprinted in other newspapers in which
he evaluated the new Human Rights
orientation in American foreign policy
and he said in effect human rights is
replacing self-determination as the
guiding value in American foreign policy
and concluded that Carter's promotion of
human rights is a considerable and very
serious success I'd like to comment on
these remarks as a point of departure in
the first place I think Schlesinger is
quite right in saying that human rights
in a sort of perverse sense that human
rights is replacing self-determination
as the guiding value in American foreign
policy although I'd like to rephrase it
slightly it seems to me it would be more
accurate to say that to exactly the
extent to which self-determination was
the guiding value in American foreign
policy in the era of Guatemala and the
Dominican Republic in Chile and Vietnam
and Cuba and Iran and so on to precisely
that extent human rights will be the
guiding value in the coming period and
in this respect I think his assessment
is quite accurate he's also quite
accurate in saying that the human rights
orientation in American foreign policy
that is the replacement of our
long-standing commitment to
self-determination by a an equally
effective commitment to human rights has
been a considerable success serious
success at least in the places where it
was intended to be a success that is in
the United States and in some of the
more servile Western European colonies
of the United States however in other
parts of the world the reaction has been
a little more mixed that is not everyone
as an entire agreement a good indication
there are many indications one of them
appeared in The Washington Post shortly
after his article appeared there's a
front-page article in the post which
looks like this I have it in front of me
there are two articles side by side one
of them is their headline US aid to
Nicaragua and one of them the top one is
headlined garbled rights message and the
second one is headlined peasants expect
little help and by looking at them at
their content pair by pair you can line
by line sort of I won't do it that
detailed you can see just where the
human rights emphasis and foreign policy
has been effective and where it has been
ineffective first comes the garbled
rights message story which goes like
this it talks about the situation in
Nicaragua and it says that Nicaragua has
become a proving ground where the Carter
Administration is undergoing a
trial-and-error test of its ability to
translate a concern for human rights
into an effective instrument of United
States foreign policy but it says that
the decisions that have been made
concerning Nicaragua seem outwardly
confusing and contradictory so much so
that they seem to border on the bizarre
and then describes what happened first
the administration decided to move ahead
with the approval of a military
assistance program whose practical
effects would be to strengthen the
forces holding the reins of dictatorship
in Nicaragua then it turned around and
withheld a sizeable chunk of
non-military aid whose purpose was to
help ease the poverty in Nicaragua and
then comes the following assessment two
diplomats and human rights activists
such decisions are clues to Washington's
foreign policy direction in this
instance though even the most astute
State Department Watchers were left
bewildered about what had happened well
you can make up a theory about what had
happened that doesn't seem too difficult
to understand but even though it eluded
the most astute political analysts and
the second article that's paired with
this describes the people
who lacking the advantages of a higher
education and so on drew an assessment
from such events as these now let me
turn to the second article peasants
expect little help this starts with a
long and horrendous description of the
kind that you're familiar with if you
follow these things at all carefully
about some people who are living in a
hideous camp with mass offering from
malnutrition and disease and children
dying and you know all these usual
things and it goes on to describe how
five months ago the Nicaraguan National
Guard evicted them along with dozens of
other peasant families from their
seaside village today they live in huts
made of rubbish in an empty railroad
yard the peasants and their sympathizers
have protested their treatment to the
Nicaraguan government and to US
officials who have expressed an interest
in human rights but they expect little
assistance from either and then comes a
background information which explains
why they expect little assistance the
pleasant the peasants bein blamed their
eviction on the desire of Nicaragua's
large land holders to acquire still more
acreage in which to grow the high price
long fiber cotton that's the country's
chief export crop and it goes on to
describe how there had been a land
reform scheme but it was abortive and
it's been reversed on how soldiers came
to their village loaded the peasants on
trucks dump them in the rail yard left
behind all their possessions such as
they were they've received no assistance
according to this article except the
menacing nighttime presence of armed
National Guard's troops who occasionally
prowl the outskirts of their encampment
they have no source of support thousands
of peasants have been uprooted from
their homes by the National Guard and it
goes on to interview peasants who say
that they can't fight what the United
States gives the dictatorship in weapons
and aid and describes how the u.s.
donated weapons were used last week to
put down a brief revolt left left
led by leftist guerrillas in which 35
people were killed on and on like that
then comes the conclusion the in Nick
where the US presence has continued to
dominate the Nicaraguan view of politics
not the reality it says here just the
view of politics American economic aid
is a major factor here the National
Guard continues to be supplied as it has
been since it was formed in 1933 with US
weapons its officers are trained
exclusively at US bases further
description of how the Nicaraguans take
for granted that what happens in that
country depends on American whims and
finally the last paragraph so far the
peasants campaign has not involved much
beyond nighttime meetings at which they
quietly strum guitars and sing songs
they have written to the beat of protest
the songs like those of a hundred such
struggles that have come and gone in
Latin America speak of unity of throwing
off the landlords and of an end to
suffering in other words it hasn't yet
reached the level of what will be called
in the American press indiscriminate
left-wing terror and so on well
comparing these accounts one can see
just where and how the human rights
offensive is effective it's very
effective among American foreign policy
analysts and in the press and art
impress and so on who can't seem to draw
from that garbled rights message any
conclusion other than just bewilderment
that is how could we possibly give an
hour given the fact of our commitment to
human rights how can it be that we're
increasing arms aid while reducing the
kind of aid that might alleviate poverty
as I say the peasant seemed to have no
particular difficulty drawing some
conclusions from that from that
conjunction of fact well let me come
back now to Arthur Schlesinger as I said
there is a sense in which his comment is
quite correct about human rights
replacing self-determination as our
guiding value and there he's correct in
another sense though again not an
intended sense in suggesting that
there's a kind of a correlation of sorts
between human rights in some country and
American policy towards that country I
don't know that the issue has ever been
seriously studied and
it's not the kind of question that I
would expect American political
scientists to study just as for example
I wouldn't expect Russian political
scientists to study the relationship
between Russian policy in Eastern Europe
and the state of human rights in Eastern
Europe and for the same reasons to my
knowledge there is only one effort to
investigate a possible correlation
between the human rights situation and
u.s. foreign policy maybe there are
others but there's the only one I know
namely it's one that I was involved in
together with Edie Edie Hermann who's an
economist at the University of
Pennsylvania and what we did as a sort
of a pilot study of this question was to
take a number of countries a dozen or so
countries with which the United States
has close relations and in which it has
a very heavy influence those are
obviously the cases that you would test
and then we took for each of those
countries a date at which something
significant happened some significant
change took place in the nature of that
country so for example in Brazil 1964
when the again reformist government was
overthrown in a military coup with the
u.s. fleet standing offshore in case
anything went wrong that is in case the
military coup didn't work and so on and
in the case of Thailand we also took a
point at which a military government was
introduced replacing a mild reformist
government and so on for a series of in
Korea we took the year of the
institution of the park dictatorship of
the Marcos dictatorship in the
Philippines and so on I mean that's it
took each of these cases and asked the
following question how do how what was
the situated the human rights situation
change before and after this event
studying things such as torture murders
death squads a destruction of unions
that sort of thing you know there's this
set of measures as far as we'd get
evidence and you often can so that's one
question and second we asked the
question what happened to American aid
had an American aid to these countries
military and economic aid relate to
these events
and we discovered that in fact human
rights and American foreign policy are
very tightly correlated that is there
was an astonishingly close correlation
of the kind that one rarely finds in the
social sciences between an increase in
human rights violations and an increase
in US aid which is a very close
correlation now superficially one would
say well I mean presumably apparently
American aid is conditioned by a decline
and the the human rights situation that
is if country wants to get foreign aid
what they ought to do is start sending
out death squads to murder peasants and
carry out torture and so on and so forth
at least that's what the rough
correlation would state however as you
know the social scientists among you are
very well aware one has to be very
cautious about correlations it could
just be that each of these things is
correlated with some third thing and in
fact that's the case here we also asked
the question how did the what is
generally called the investment climate
change with these events and it turned
out that the investment climate changed
favorably that is favorably from the
point of view of the outside investors
as the human rights situation
deteriorated and also that American aid
increased American support diplomatic
military economic support increased as
the investment climate improved in fact
the few so what we really ought to
conclude I suppose is that the United
States really has no policy with regard
to human rights that is human rights in
itself as an independent factor is just
not an issue in American foreign policy
or in the policy of any other state I
don't think that's terribly surprising
the rhetoric what's surprising about the
United States is the fact that the silly
rhetoric that's produced is actually
believed by people but as far as the
government is concerned human rights is
no more an issue than it is in every any
other country but there are factors that
do relate to American foreign policy for
example improvements of the investment
climate in a general sense you know
there's lots of factors entering into
that and that is surely a very
significant factor in how American part
foreign policy is designed that is it
will support countries that
throw open their society their resources
their land and so on in fact their
workforce to the intervention of
us-based corporations no doubt American
foreign policy is strongly conditioned
by that factor there's and in fact
improvement of the investment climate is
itself correlated with the deterioration
of the climate with regard to human
rights and for very obvious reasons I
mean if you want to turn it say the
Dominican Republic into a place which is
as described in the ads you know a sort
of an economic miracle a paradise for
investors and so on and so forth then
one of the things you have to do is make
sure you do break up peasant unions and
destroy labor unions and get rid of
annoying leftists and so on and so forth
and the best way to do that that's ever
been discovered is by introducing a
murderous terrorist regime which carries
out the kind of violence and destruction
that I've described when that is done
then the country is available to let the
forces of the free market operate and
allow the penetration of foreign capital
and in fact we do find that that's
precisely what happens after the
successful American interventions either
direct military interventions as in the
case of Dominican Republic which was
simply invaded or in direct military
interventions such as in the case of the
Brazilian or Dominica or Guatemalan coos
I'm not so indirect in the latter case
since American planes were actually
bombing Guatemala but still not an
outright invasion so what we can if this
pilot study turns out to be accurate and
I frankly have little doubt that it will
if it's ever conducted if there is you
know if anybody conducts a serious
investigation of this I don't advise you
to apply to your nearest foundation
incidentally but if a serious
investigation were conducted of this
topic I have no doubt that it would find
that there is a dramatically close
correlation between the deterioration in
the human rights climate and the
increase in u.s. support well so much
for the facts concerning the correlation
between human rights and American
policy what I would like to do is to
discuss some of the backgrounds of
really two things one the evolution of
American foreign policy since the Second
World War and secondly the evolution of
ideology that is the set of beliefs that
are created by the intelligentsia what
one might call the state religion that
is developed in order to disguise and
present the actuality in a form which
will help indoctrinate the public into
accepting it so I want to describe these
two developments during the this period
briefly and then return at the end of
this these brief remarks to a question
of how the human rights emphasis arose
why it arose in the particular moment
that it did and what its significance is
well briefly let me just start with
World War two of course one can go back
further
recall that in World War two it was
obvious by the you know by the early 40s
that most of the industrial world was
going to be destroyed and that the
United States would emerge from the
ruins essentially unscathed and in fact
with its economic situation vastly
improved while most of the other in fact
virtually every other industrial country
was being either heavily battered or
literally totally destroyed the United
States tripled or quadrupled its its
industrial production and in fact even
before the war had started the United
States was far and away the most the
largest industrial society in the world
with massive scale and enormous internal
resources and so on there is very
revealing and intriguing documentary
evidence on the planning that took place
during the early 1940s as this situation
became you know emerged that was
developing as the war proceeded the best
the best evidence that I know about it
and it really is quite remarkable is the
series of studies conducted by a group
called the war Peace Studies group of
the Council on Foreign Relations
beginning in 1939 and continuing until
1945 this wasn't involved the the kind
of people you'd expect in a high-level
planning group the bankers and you know
and investment firms and lawyers from
the few corporate law firm the law firms
that deal with corporate interests and a
couple of professors thrown in and
representatives of the State Department
Planning Group and high-level diplomats
in fact virtually everybody in the state
department except Cordell Hull the
Secretary of State himself was involved
in one form or another and they produced
a long series of memoranda describing
the kind of world that ought to grow out
of the chaos that was being created
worldwide at that time I'll read you a
few excerpts to give you the flavor
these memoranda deal I'm quoting now
with the requirements of the United
States in a world in which it proposes
to hold unquestioned power in the early
years that is 1939 1940 when it was
still thought that the Germans might be
able to hold on you know that there
might in other words be a German
controlled world at the end of the world
at the end of the war part of the world
so in those years the task was to
develop an integrated policy to achieve
military and economic supremacy for the
United States within the non German
world including plans to secure the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by foreign nations that
constitutes a threat to the world area
essential for the security and economic
prosperity of the United States and the
Western Hemisphere our touching concern
for the economic prosperity of the rest
of the Western Hemisphere is there's
plenty of evidence for that in the years
since we can dismiss that as rhetoric
but the rest is by no means rhetoric and
given those commitments the planners
began to develop the structure and
institutions of a of a world system
which would in fact be essential for the
economic prosperity of the United States
and within which the United States might
maintain military and economic supremacy
they called this area the grand area and
they concluded that in order to that an
area of the world
ficient to meet the needs of the
American economy would have to include
the entire Western Hemisphere the Far
East and the British Empire the British
Empire of course would have to be
dismantled that as the United States was
certainly anti-colonial in the sense of
being opposed to the efforts of other
countries to create closed areas in
which American US penetration of US
capital would be limited so they pointed
out that the British Empire will never
reappear and the u.s. may have to take
its place
continuing the United States must
cultivate a mental view toward world
settlement after this war which will
enable us to impose our own terms
amounting perhaps to a Pax Americana the
United States must dominate area
strategically necessary for world
control namely the areas that I
described this is necessary the world
must be organized in order to offer the
American economy the elbow room needed
in order to survive without major
readjustment that's a line that runs
through consistently and it's sort of a
code word for referring to internal
changes that might make it unnecessary
for the United States to dominate a
grand area of this sort for example
changes in distribution of income or
rational use of resources and all sorts
of other things of this terrible nature
which have to be prevented so we have to
in order to prevent major any kind of
adjustments in the distribution of power
and wealth within the society it is
necessary to create this grand area in
which the United States proposes to be
the hegemonic power now they went on to
say that this grand area is not an
entirely satisfactory substitute for a
world economy that is to say the optimal
system would be a grand area which
includes the entire world in other words
a world in which the United States
proposes to achieve military and
economic supremacy and a world which is
organized in which we impose our own
terms
maintaining a mental view towards world
settlement
a world organized so as to to give us
the elbow room to survive without major
adjustments and it goes on and on like
this and describes in some detail the
institutions that would have to be
developed for such a grand area in fact
institutions which later were
constructed now all of this stuff reads
rather crude you know rather harshly say
and although it's not secret it wasn't
exactly put on the front pages and the
planners themselves the writers of the
memoranda were aware that the
description of what they were doing you
know is really free internal use they
had the following to say formulation of
a statement of war aims for propaganda
purposes is very different from
formulation of one defining the true
national interest we're of course true
national interest means as conceived by
this group of planners with their
particular conception of the natural
national interest and then they go on to
say the following if war aims are stated
which seemed to be concerned solely with
anglo-american imperialism they will
offer little to people in the rest of
the world and will be vulnerable to Nazi
counter promises the interests of other
people's should be stressed not only
those of Europe but also of Asia Africa
and Latin America this would have a
better propaganda effect and shortly
after the Atlantic Charter was produced
which was suitably vague and idealistic
and which of course has ever since then
been described by academic scholarship
as the real war aims of the United
States
so the propagandists understood what
they were doing they recognized that it
was very unlikely that the group that
has sometimes been called the secular
priesthood I think that's Isaiah
Berlin's term in the first place applied
in that case to the so-called
revolutionary intelligentsia who run the
state socialist countries but it can
just as well be applied to the
intelligence he and the Democratic
so-called society it was understood that
the secular priesthood would heed the
message and would produce only would
reproduce only that statement of work
war aims which was meant for propaganda
purposes dismissing quite completely the
actual statement of war aims the
formulation that defines the true
national interest and in fact if you
look at your analyses of the Cold War
and post-war history since that time you
will find that this conviction on the
part of the planners that they wouldn't
be exposed by journalism or academic
scholarship or whatever is quite was
quite accurate in fact the materials
that I have just described are virtually
never discussed in any analysis of
American foreign policy although they do
constitute probably the primary document
documentary source least the primary one
that I know of as to how top-level
planners conceived the world that they
were going to construct as the war
continued and although those plans were
carried out with significant though not
a hundred percent effectiveness
nevertheless the actual plans themselves
might just as well not exist as far as
scholarship is concerned to my knowledge
the first study that even deals with
this just appeared a year or two ago it
appeared in a journal which called the
insurgent sociologist to a massive
reading audience as you can imagine and
shortly after a book appeared which
received equal ovations in the press by
two graduate students who had done
doctoral dissertations on the subject
and I'm sure that it will be returned to
the Oblivion that is necessary in order
to preserve the appropriate version of
the state religion for domestic
consumption if people if scholars are
supposed to be able to say the things
like the one that I mentioned in my
first remarks that self-determination
has been the guiding value in American
foreign policy then it's very well to
keep material of this sort repressed and
silent well this discussion it fits
precisely into the framework of the
grand area planning that we find in
other high-level planning documents such
as those that I've mentioned and in fact
it was really simply an application
simply an application to a special case
of the general program of grand area
planning that is developing an
international system
tremendous if possible Universal
international system that would be
dominated by the United States and
whatever one thinks about the ethics of
it
I think there's little doubt of its
rationality didn't turn out very well
but then many rational decisions don't
turn out very well we just don't know
all the facts but this is a record of
very explicit rational planning and a
rational Imperial planning there's no
concern whatsoever for
self-determination not what there was
what was concerned for is just what
you'd expect in a hegemonic power that's
trying to organize the world in a way
which will be necessary for world
control to use the terminology the
planners well perfectly plainly no
material of this sort can be permitted
to enter the textbooks and academic
studies and journals and so on because
if it does people may actually get an
insight into reality and what could be
more dangerous than that
so therefore this kind of material has
to be completely excluded from
scholarship and journalism and take a
look I think you'll find that that
achievement has been realized quite
effectively in contrast when you look at
the material from the middle 60s that's
pretty safe by that time all the basic
decisions had long been made the whole
framework of planning had already been
laid down nobody either questioned that
are discussed that or probably even
remembered it and all that was left was
the problem of how to conduct make
particular tactical decisions tiny
tactical decisions within a framework of
principles and understanding that had
been set long before therefore it's
perfectly one can feel quite free to
refer to the documentary material
dealing with that period confident that
nothing will be exposed about how policy
is actually designed and in fact you
discover that that's the that's how the
Pentagon Papers have entered academic
studies and our conception of the world
as presented by them quite generally I
should say that if you look at the
debate over American foreign policy in
these years you find that it has some
very interesting properties until the
late 60s when the pressure of the
student movement sort of compelled the
universities and the journals and so on
to
at least pay a little bit of attention
to some critical scholarship until that
time it's quite fair to say I think that
American scholarship with regard to
Foreign Affairs oscillated you know fell
somewhere on a spectrum that was defined
between two extremes at the one extreme
you have what is sometimes called the
Orthodox version as presented by people
like Herbert Feist or well essentially
Arthur Schlesinger and others like that
which essentially gives you might say
the government version of events
presents the state religion at the other
extreme you had the critics who were
often called the realists critics people
like George Cannon and Hans Morgenthau
and if you look at the debate that took
place between the Orthodox theorists and
the can and the critics you discover
something rather interesting about the
way in which a system of propaganda and
indoctrination functions the Orthodox
critics held very much as Schlesinger in
that comment that I mentioned that the
United States is unique among the
nations of of the mater of the world and
modern history in there maybe any
history in that it it has it really has
no foreign policy it's sort of blunders
about in the world you know reacting to
what other people do
guided by kind of an abstract moralism I
mean benevolence concern for Wilsonian
principles of freedom and
self-determination and so on but these
are for some reason the United States
does is too naive and simplistic to
really have any concept of material
interests that we just kind of you know
basically react or defend ourselves or
something of that kind
that's the Orthodox view now the
critical view the view of the critics of
this is very revealing and interesting
it's always much more interesting and
studying a propaganda system to look at
the critics that is the ones who are
tolerated the tolerated critics what the
critics say is yes it is true that the
United States is unique among the
nations of history in this lack of
policy and commitment to abstract moral
principles but this is bad because what
we ought to do is have a more committed
understanding of the national interests
and pursue that and so the debate rages
between these two polarized extremes all
of whom of course accept the same tacit
and fundamental premise that the United
States
is unique among the nations of past and
present history etc etc now as I said
the work of the realist critics is the
work that certainly gives you the
deepest insight into how the system
functions and to take a to get an idea
what I'd suggest is those are interested
to take a look for example at some of
the work that was coming out in the
early 60s that's an interesting period
because that's a moment when the
intelligentsia got what they thought was
their shot at power Kennedy seemed to be
inclined to bring some of the you know
the eastern liberal intellectuals into
at least rubbing shoulders with people
who made big decisions and so on and
that led to a feeling of euphoria on the
campuses and in intellectual circles and
a interesting outpouring of literature
which is worth looking at and again well
I think maybe the most interesting work
is say perhaps that of Hans Morgenthau
who's a very interesting figure for one
thing because he is a very serious
political analyst and furthermore
because only a few years after this he
in fact he was so close to the limits of
what is tolerated as you know legitimate
and critical analysis and therefore he's
an interesting figure to look at when
you and he's also sort of you know the
grand figure of American political
science and hard-headed political
analysis and so on he has a book that
came out I think in 1961 or 62 about
then called the purpose of America and
that's very interesting reading he
describes in there what he calls the
transcendent purpose of the United
States and he says the United States is
different from other countries in that
other nations other states developed
their purpose after they came into
existence but in the case of the United
States its purpose actually preceded its
existence that is the United States came
into existence to realize an already
existing purpose that's why he calls it
a transcendent purpose and that purpose
was the search for equality and freedom
for ourselves and for the world and he
says that American policy since that
time has been guided by this
transcendent purpose what he calls the
national purpose well he's a historian
and he then goes on to look at the
history of historical record and he says
well you know you look at the historical
record you find some funny things I mean
slavery for instance for a century and
you know degradation of ethnic
minorities since you find intervention
in Central America but he says these
were just isolated forays of no
significance and then the intervention
in the Philippines but again that was
just a sort of a random event we forget
about that statistical error and so on
and then then he goes on to describe
these these things and he says well he
says many critics who have looked at
this historical record have concluded
that all of this talk about national
purpose and our commitment to wilsonian
ideals and so on is just rhetoric
intended to disguise what's really going
on he says well you know those critics
you can sort of understand them but he
says they're committing a fundamental
error of logic and the error of logic is
this I'm quoting they're confusing
reality with the abuse of reality now
reality you have to get this reality is
what is the national purpose as it was
intended the abuse of reality is what
actually happened and then he says this
is really there I'm not making it up if
you don't believe me look at it
he then goes on to say that they're
committing what he calls the error of
atheism which has criticized religion on
similar grounds and that's a very astute
comment in fact we should also draw the
further conclusion that in fact the what
what he and most of a good deal of
academic scholarship is presenting is a
kind of religion the state religion that
we might call it that is a set of
beliefs that you're just supposed to
have if you want to be a civilized and
you know well behaved person with a good
shot at a job and that sort of thing
and in fact it is committing the error
of atheism to raise you know to to mix
up what really happened with the
religious doctrine to which we are about
what we are to about that to which we
are actually committed well enough of
that and let me go on to talk about
grand area planning and how it developed
too long so let me keep an eye on the
clock how did it the first thing that
had to happen in the early 40s was that
we the United States
had to make sure that it did in fact
control the non German world that it for
example succeeded in breaking up the
British Empire and this was there was a
sort of a mini war a sort of a conflict
going on between the United States and
Great Britain in the background of the
Second World War it rather interesting
to follow that I don't have the time to
talk about it now but it was a very
interesting one and it led the result of
it was that the United States using its
both its safety and its enormous
preponderant power was able to exploit
Britain's travail to dismantle the
empire and to take over for example
traditional British markets in Latin
America and most crucially to
Gravett moderate with great success
displace Britain from some strongholds
in the Mideast which was always regarded
as extremely important because of the
tremendous significance of Saudi Arabian
and in fact well the oil of Saudi Arabia
and the Arabian Peninsula in some way
nobody had any doubts at that time in
fact years before about the nature of
those resources in the early 40s a State
Department memorandum described Saudi
Arabia as a stupendous source of
strategic power one of the greatest
material prizes in world history and the
United States was going to make
absolutely certain that that stupendous
strategic resource remained totally
under American control and in fact
scarce Lindley Dade lease aid was
diverted to Saudi Arabia I think a
hundred million dollars or so to prevent
the British from as the Under Secretary
of the Navy once put it to prevent the
British from diddling us out of our
concession there by you know giving some
of their own aid to him so the French
also had to be kicked out of that region
and that was done by an interesting
legalistic device there was a 1928
agreement which divided up the spoils
among the French the British and the
Americans I just told you how you know
the British were pretty well pushed out
how about the French well the legal
Bureau of the State Department decided
that France was an enemy power well it
was under German occupation and being an
enemy power it no longer had the could
no longer claim the rights that it had
to the 1928 agreement so the French were
properly pushed out and in fact the
American share in Middle Eastern oil
increased very sharply during this
period in there was one country left was
important namely er in several but there
was one particularly important namely
Iran and you remember that in the early
50s rather as in Latin America the
situation's developed side by side Iran
had a moderate reformist leadership
which made the curious move of trying to
take over its own oil resources well
that ended with a successful CIA coup
probably the success of that coup is
what emboldened the CIA to carry out the
Guatemala coup shortly afterwards and
the Shah was reintroduced and you know
the human rights situation since that
time it's worth remembering that in the
United States these successful coos
which reinstalled murderous and brutal
dictatorships were very highly lauded by
the liberal moderate press when they
took place for example here's the
reaction in the New York Times to the
reinstitution of the Shah by the CIA
backed coup of 1953 underdeveloped
countries with rich resources now have
an object lesson in the heavy cost that
must be paid by one of their number
which goes berserk with fanatical
nationalism that's a reference to the
effort by the Iranians to take over
their own oil it is perhaps too much to
hope that Iran's experience will prevent
the rise of Mossad X the leader of Iran
and other countries but that experience
may at least strengthen the hands of
more reasonable and more far-seeing
leaders in short if we intervene by
force we send an army to invade another
country and throw at its regime that's
not intervention in the internal affairs
of that country because communism is an
international or not an internal affair
okay and so what we have to do is see
that that country is communist well the
State Department the Senate soon did
that in a Senate resolution of June 1954
the Senate found strong evidence of
intervention by the International
communist movement in the state of
Guatemala whereby government
institutions have been infiltrated by
communist age
weapons of war have been secretly
shipped into that country and the
pattern of communist conquest has become
manifest the term conquest is
particularly interesting because there
was a flee nothing going on there except
the development of a quite mild
reformist government which was for
example trying to take over unused lands
owned by United Fruit and give them over
to peasants and so on but it was enough
for the Senate to find strong evidence
of communism and a pattern of communist
conquest and therefore by the Braeden
document doctrine intervention there
wasn't really interference not at all
this is what Adlai Stevenson was later
to call defense against internal
aggression in May 1964 he pointed out
that the point is the same in Vietnam
today as it was in Greece in 1947 that
is the United States is defending a free
people from internal aggression that's
one of the nice additions to the
political lexicon that was made by the
Liberals of that period and that's true
we have defended countries against
internal aggression around the world
quite a number of times since the 1940s
well I won't bother to say any more
about the unrolling of this history it
had sometimes it sometimes the American
attempts to construct the grand the area
have succeeded in fact dramatically
succeeded Latin America is a case in
point as I said the chamber of horrors
that's been constructed in Latin America
is not at all unrelated to Grand the
area planning in fact it's very closely
correlated with it not just
statistically but for very good reasons
and that has to be counted as a dramatic
success of American policy whatever the
priests of the state religion may say
about it sometimes however it failed the
grand area planning and in fact one case
of quite dramatic failure was Vietnam
the Vietnam War though it was a
short-term reverse in American grand
area planning nevertheless in no sense
changed the institutions of American
society they emerged totally unchanged
which is to say that the basic factors
that lay behind the interventionist
policies of the last 30 years are going
to persist that is to say that the
policies also will persist
and that means that the passive and
obedient citizenry that must support
these policies has to be beaten back
into the appropriate degree of
submission so therefore there is a kind
of an ideological crisis and something
has to be done about it well that's the
task of the intellectuals naturally and
they got to do a number of things first
of all they have to completely rewrite
the history of the war in Vietnam and
that is that wasn't very difficult
actually because in fact the journals
and most of the academic profession and
so on had always adhered to the required
mythical conception of what happened
there that is the description of the
United States as intervening out of
benevolent motives in order to preserve
freedom and democracy in the face of
internal aggression and so on so not
much rewriting had to be done but it is
being done and another thing that had to
be done is of course to deny any kind of
American guilt that is to show that we
didn't do anything that was at all
unjustified as a local professor of here
at umass pointed out recently anything
we did there was just a matter of
military necessity which covers quite a
range and next we have to show that it's
really the victims of what we did on the
basis of military necessity who bare the
onus of all of this this is really their
fault that all this happened to them
this looks like a kind of a nun
promising propaganda exercise kind of
like say the Germans blaming the Jews
for the Crematory or something but it's
proceeding apace things have actually
reached the point where an American
president can appear on national
television and in the course of in in at
a press conference that is and in the
course of a discourse on human rights
can say as President Carter did that we
owe no debt to the Vietnamese because
the destruction was mutual
and when he made that statement which is
a statement in my opinion of true
Hitlerian or Stalinist proportions
literally I don't use the word loosely
there was no response whatsoever in the
American national press though there
were a lot of eyebrows raised elsewhere
about that mutual destruction that's the
stage at which things have gotten in
this regard
it is also necessary to restrict the
so-called lessons of the war to the
narrowest possible ones and that's
proceeding effectively in the scholarly
journals for example someone like say
Edwin Reischauer the leading Asian
scholar at Harvard can explain that the
real lesson of the Vietnam War is the
tremendous cost incurred by an attempt
to control a small Southeast Asian
nationalist movement against the wishes
of its population that's the lesson that
it's too costly to conduct exercises of
that kind so next time we got to make
sure that we do our cost benefits
analysis properly one can conceive for
example of the German General Staff as
giving the same kind of analysis of the
lessons of the Second World War in 1944
I suppose and certainly since and a
final at part of this whole system of
reconstruction of ideology is to restore
the belief in our transcendent purpose
and here things have proceeded with an
almost mythic quality I think it's
really fantastic to watch it develop I
don't mean to say that the propagandists
actually planned every step but rather
that they rose quite magnificently to
the opportunity presented to them
commenting looking if one could try to
get enough perspective to look at this
as if from the outside I think it all
gives a very remarkable insight into and
I'll finish with this into the way in
which Democratic propaganda systems
operated and in fact it gives some
insight I think it's a sharp contrasts
between totalitarian and democratic
systems of thought control what happens
in a totalitarian system in a standardly
is the following the state has a
position you know there's official
doctrine comes out of the center of
power and there is a group which we can
for which we can use Isaiah Berlin's
term let's say this gets secular
priesthood who pronounce and produce the
doctrines of the state religion they're
very clear they're very precise
everybody understands them everybody
knows where they're coming from in to
you and you know internally you know
privately you can not only easily
identify them but you can also refuse to
believe them if you want as long as
you're quiet about it whether you voice
that opposition or not well and the cost
that you may pay by voicing it that
depends on just how violent and
totalitarian the state actually is but
in general the doctrines of the state
religion are very easily identified the
people who promulgate them are easily
identified and everybody else are just
supposed to parrot them that's though
believing whatever they want internally
nobody cares much about that that's
roughly the way a totalitarian system of
propaganda works a democratic system of
thought control works quite differently
what happens here and I've given a
couple of examples already is that the
secular priesthood wants to not only
present the official doctrine but in
fact to capture the entire spectrum of
possible thinking that is it wants to
include both those who put forth the
official doctrine and those who
vigorously attack it as long as that
entire spectrum of opinion meets one
condition namely there's a tacit
presupposition running across the whole
spectrum which is in effect the doctrine
of the state religion now that's what we
saw precise that's what you see
precisely in the case of this tremendous
debate over foreign policy between the
Orthodox and the realism on the one hand
you have the Orthodox scholars on the
other hand you have their realist
opponents if you look carefully you
discover that throughout the whole
debate the same premise is presupposed
namely the unique benevolence of the
United States it's lack of the lack of
concern of planners for material
interests of any social group and so on
now that's very effective because in
order to see what's going on in a
democratic system of thought control you
not only have to sort of dismantle the
easy job dismantle the system of the
government and it's propagandists but
you have to take apart the whole
spectrum of debate and see what
underlies that that is you have to see
what's what lies behind the critical
rejection of the official position as
well as the official position itself and
I'm sure that any propagandist would
readily concede that it's much more
effective to insinuate doctrines by
tacit presupposition than it is to beat
people over the head with a bludgeon you
know it's much more effective way
of getting the doctrines to permeate
ones thought and in fact the more the
battle rages between these polarized
extremes the better the propaganda
system is served because the more
effectively those tacit presuppositions
are introduced and and become just part
of one's general way of thinking about
events and it's really amazing when you
look at the American propaganda system
at the American ideological institutions
I mean the universities and the press
and the journals and so on to see how
this happens in case after case the
debate over foreign policy is one
example involving academic scholarship
let me give just one single but really
quite typical example from the junk from
journalism when the war came to an end
the Vietnam War in April 75 every
newspaper had its assessment you know
it's considered assessment of what it
was all about and so on and they were
very interesting I wrote an article in
fact last issue of ramparts I guess it
killed it finally which surveyed this
and what you found that only the liberal
press all I looked at if you found in
case after case was the following well
I'll exemplify it from the New York
Times which is quite typical The Times
described the decade of fierce polemics
that had raged over the war and talked
about how this had torn the country
apart and so on and so forth and it said
well it's too early to tell who has won
in this decade of fierce polemics we
have to leave the judgment to Cleo who
was cool and measured in her ways and so
on this is a time for silence and
humility and prayer they said but we
must remember this decade of fierce
polemics now what was the decade of
fierce polemics well if you look you
find it was the following it was a
decade of Peirce fierce polemics which
pitted the Hawks that is those who
thought we could win if we kept trying
at one extreme and the doves that is
those who thought we probably weren't
going to get away with it
no matter how hard we tried at the other
extreme okay though that was the decade
of fierce polemics notice again a
typical example of the productions of a
Democratic propaganda system that is
insinuated throughout and tacit in the
discussion between these two polar
extremes is that the United States has a
perfect right to win
right the only question is can we get
away with it that's what the decade of
fierce polemics is about now of course
excluded from this debate was for
example the entire peace movement which
said that the United States has no right
to win that aggression is wrong even if
it succeeds the kind of movement that
took the same view towards American
aggression in Vietnam that it took
towards Russian aggression in
Czechoslovakia where in fact they did
get away with it and got away with the
very bloodlessly but that didn't make it
right so taking the same view towards
American aggression in Vietnam which was
far more severe by any measure and far
less justified by any measure I might
add that taking that same view towards
American aggression in Vietnam simply
excluded you from the spectrum of debate
as far as the time sought they didn't
have to refute this position in order
they even have to mention this position
it simply outside the polemics now in
fact so committed was the times to
doctrinal purity on this issue that they
threw open their editorial page two
letters practically full-page letters a
couple of days later and the letter has
covered a whole range of stuff I mean
you know including somebody who called
for nuclear bombardment in Vietnam but
there was one position which was
dramatically unrepresented namely there
wasn't a single letter pointing out that
the time spectrum was rather narrow and
happened to exclude a certain opinion
now I know that letters were sent I know
at least that one letter was sent on
that topic and I'm sure that plenty of
others were but there have to be limits
in a civilized Journal obviously can't
go too far now this kind of thing is
quite characteristic and in fact there's
a lot of talk now about how the press
has become a new source of national
power opposed to the state and that's
very dangerous it has to be beaten back
and so on what you find out what you see
if you really look carefully is that the
press was a almost completely servile
Institute of state propaganda it
submissiveness to the framework of state
propaganda over the years these years is
quite fantastic and phenomenal but there
was an impression of criticism there was
an impression of debate just as in the
academic community the impression was
and the debate was in fact a debate over
tactics there's debate over costs it was
a debate over
between the people who with pride call
themselves pragmatists that is can we
get away with it or can't we get away
with it that was the debate and the as I
said the fear sir that debate the better
the propaganda system is served because
the premise that we have a right to get
away with it is insinuated that's what
you discover if you actually look at the
record now just recently the trilateral
commission which you've heard of had a
put out it's you know this Commission
made up of major elites and the three
major capitalist centers of power Japan
Western Europe in the United States in
fact a commission which is one of
several that are picking up what was
left by the war police peace planning
studies of twenty five years ago they
published a major publication in which
they dealt with this issue in a very
interesting way it's called the crisis
of democracy now out of print they're
careful not to reprint it I think they
didn't expect to be able to read it but
it's very well worth reading if the
library has a copy in it they talk about
the dangers the great dangers that
democracy suffered during the 1960s
these dangers arose from the fact that
there was popular mass mobilization that
various parts of the population began to
press for their demands and try to
participate in the political process all
of which led to a crisis of democracy it
led to a decline in that very
comfortable system which as one as the
American commentator Samuel Huntington
says existed in earlier years when
Truman could just call upon a few Wall
Street lawyers and financiers to work at
his policy for him that was the good
days of democracy before the crisis but
in the 1960s this began to change
because of the various popular movements
that were developing as various people
became politicized and so on the report
points out that democracy can only
survive if a substantial part of the
population is apathetic and passive that
is leaves leadership to their betters
and in fact the whole description for
anyone in those any history reads very
much like some of the meeting evil
discussions of the commoners and the
nobility that is the commoners have to
be retained in their low estate you know
and leave to the nobility the decisions
the important decisions here they put a
little differently if the commoners move
out of what used to be called the lowest
state of frenchmen by medieval
chroniclers and try to reassert
themselves then democracy suffers right
because after all we can't have a
democracy with all of this popular
participation and so on so therefore
something has to be done to restore to
overcome this crisis that is to restore
the commoners to commoners to their
appropriate passivity and in the course
of this they discuss what they call this
is their term the institutions that are
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young this one for example and they
talk about the difficulty that those
institutions face during the 60s because
of the pressure of of these rising
groups and they say that that has to be
restored as well and in fact we are now
in a situation where the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young and for that matter they're
not so young are being reconstructed and
strengthened so that the doctrines of
the state religion will be more forcibly
implanted and that this crisis of
ideology will be overcome and it's
within this context I'm have no doubt
that one should understand the rhetoric
which so impressive Arthur Schlesinger
and others about human rights and the
American commitment to it
you
