and I believe I have a solution to the
question that you asked do we have any
problem in a solution for Syria yes I
think we do how do I fix ya but as long
as in this country we have 94 Senators
219 congressman that received money from
agency that was recognized in 1963 as a
tool of the Israeli government I had we
are not going anywhere we have
surrendered or foreign-policy empire
second minyan view in the United States
convenient because it directs attention
away from the centers of power the
United States anything that directs the
attention away from the centers of power
is almost guaranteed to be popular this
is a common view with some it's
understandable their leading scholars
have advocated at bernstein wall for the
beta ones it just doesn't make any sense
he is really on your right that many of
the people in Congress get benefits from
a bed but practically a hundred percent
of them are in the pockets of the
thunders the corporate sector that's how
they got laid there's a very close
correlation between campaign
an electoral victory very close in fact
in the house representatives also
straight line it's here they're like
Bernie Sanders but it's it's almost
uniform and these are this is big money
it's not paid back apex of ethnic lobby
you know it's of something significant
but it doesn't begin to compare with the
major lobbies I mean the military lobby
itself could put eight back out of
business two minutes if they wanted way
more powerful why don't they do it they
don't want to they support vignettes
policies but they benefit from it it
takes a Lockheed Martin when the United
States is three billion dollars of aid
to Israel it's called aid for purchase
of military equipment one of that goes
right back Lockheed Martin in two ways
first of all they get paid for
developing you know the f135 and so on
they get paid by the US taxpayer via
Israel secondly when we get a couple of
billion dollars of military aid Israel
Saudi Arabia comes along and says we
want 10 times as much for ourselves and
Lockheed Martin isn't very happy to
provide Saudi Arabia with 2nd grade
equipment which they don't know how to
operate anyhow there's a
fifty-million-dollar aid grant that's
compared with Israel's the 30 billion 33
million dollars all terrific for the
military directly for the
for military industry furthermore there
are much they're extremely close
interactions some of you may have seen
one of the most important links from
WikiLeaks didn't get much publicity was
quite important it was a list of a
Pentagon list of strategic sites hi
super I've at in strategic sites around
the world that have to be protected of
allah wills that one of them was Raphael
military industries right outside 50
major military conflicts closely
integrated with the US military it's one
of the places we're drunk technology was
developed for example it's so closely
integrated food Raphael transferred its
management offices to watch some Israeli
industries offices are in Washington
with us where the money is that's just
symptomatic of extremely close relations
high-tech industry in the United States
what say I am so another increasing
their investments in Israel that not
push they love Jews it's just a good
place for them with this as you Warren
Buffett just been picking up some
industry there said it's the best place
to invest outside the United States and
it's closed intelligence connections and
so on so why doesn't the military lobby
stand against apex they support the
policy of it the same is true of other
sectors and in fact when the u.s.
opposes Israeli policy which happens
regularly well a pact disappears facts
happening right now in front of our eyes
apex leading goal was to try to get the
Senate to pass legislation that would
essentially bought the Iran
u.s. negotiations 40 that who created to
proxy war as long as be far for to proxy
war war that is a benefit to the
military industrial complex that is only
filling the pockets of the rich that's
the benefit krupa does nothing to them
nothing I mean answer this particular
case it back back door but it's happened
over and over I mean even George W Bush
very Pro his room there was one point at
which there was a real conflict with
Israel that Israel the military based
economy high-tech military production
they want export markets the big export
market forces China so they've been
dying to get into the China market us
won't let the most recent occasion was
2005 of the bush when Israel was trying
to upgrade the missiles for china the
u.s. Bush administration he can't do it
they said they were going to do it
anyway at which point the US came down
like a ton of bricks it insisted block
visits from high-level Israeli officials
that were not eleven visit the United
States they were compelled to issue a
formal apology for having tried to do
this and to pass legislation blocking it
really humiliation you didn't hear a
peep from
the reason is they're not idiots they
know they cannot confront us power and
when there is a conflict they back down
this happens the time after time like
for tonic give you along with so there's
good reasons for but I think we should
be cautious about them initially about
any proposal that directs attention away
from the centers of American power it's
always going to be convenient to accept
a proposal like that doesn't prove that
is wrong what it's an initial reason for
skepticism
