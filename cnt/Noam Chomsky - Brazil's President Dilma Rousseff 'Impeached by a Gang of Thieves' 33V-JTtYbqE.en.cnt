what about what's happening right now in
Brazil work protests are continuing over
the Legislature's vote to suspend
President Dilma Rousseff and put her on
trial now El Salvador has refused to
recognize the new Brazilian government
and the Brazilian prep the Salvadoran
president said and said Rousseff's
ouster had quote the appearance of a
coup d'etat what's happening there and
what about the difference between it
look like perhaps Bush saved Latin
America simply by not focusing on it
totally wrapped up in Iraq and
Afghanistan
it looks like the Obama administration
is paying a bit more attention I don't
think it's just a matter of not paying
attention Latin America has to a
significant extent liberated itself from
foreign meaning mostly US domination in
the past 10 or 15 years that's a
dramatic development in world affairs
it's the first time in 500 years it's a
big change so the life that so-called
lack of attention is partly the fact
that the u.s. kind of being driven out
of the hemisphere less that it can do
used to be able to overthrow governments
carry out coos at will and so on it
tries there have been three maybe and
say accountant who's who attempts this
century the one in Venezuela in 2002
succeeded for a couple of days backed by
the u.s. overthrown by popular reaction
a second in Haiti 2004 succeeded the US
and France Canada helped kidnapped the
president sent him off to Central Africa
it won't permit his party to run in
elections that was a successful coup
Honduras under Obama there was a
military coup overthrew a reformist
president
the United States was almost alone and
pretty much legitimizing the coup
you know claiming that the elections
under the kurashima were legitimate
Honduras always a very poor repressed
Society became a total horror chamber
huge flow of refugees we throw them back
in the border back to the violence which
we helped create Paraguay there was a
kind of a semi coup what's happening
also to get rid of a progressive priest
who was running the country briefly
what's happening in Brazil now is is
extremely unfortunate in many ways first
of all there has been a massive level of
corruption unforgettably the Workers
Party
Lula's party which had a real
opportunity to achieve something
extremely significant and did make some
considerable positive changes
nevertheless joined the rest the
traditional elite and just wholesale
robbery and that should its that should
be punished on the other hand what's
happening now what you quoted from also
the or I think is pretty accurate it's a
kind of a soft coup of the elite
detested the Workers Party and is using
this opportunity to get rid of the party
that won the elections they're not
waiting for the elections which they
probably lose but they want to get rid
of it
exploiting an economic recession which
is serious and the massive corruption
that's been exposed
but as even the New York Times pointed
out Dilma Rousseff is maybe the one
politician who hasn't leading politician
who hasn't stolen in order to benefit
herself as she's being charged with
manipulations in the budget which are
pretty standard in many countries taken
from one pocket and putting into another
maybe it's a misdeed of some kind but
certainly doesn't justify impeachment in
fact she's we have the one leading
politician who hasn't stolen to enrich
herself who's being impeached by a gang
of thieves who have done so that does
count as a kind of soft coup I think
that's correct
