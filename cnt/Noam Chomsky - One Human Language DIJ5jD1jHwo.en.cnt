I really enjoyed your comment about when
you said that there was one human
language and he also indicated that if
we were Martian and we came to the earth
we would sort of hear one sound in a
sense so I was wondering with all of the
diversity that we have in the world
today and historically with Asia being
one way linguistically and Africa and
other Europe another and with
inflectional languages that we've
developed from indo-european influences
and the agglutinin to languages that
come from Africa and the Creoles from
the Caribbean area in in the future say
100 years from now could you comment on
which tendency would you feel that we
would more likely be to go in that of
one human language for the earth or
diversity with me when I say there's one
language I don't mean that we should try
to sort of all speak Esperanto or
something what I'm claiming is the
actual diversity even the possible
diversity you know there's a lot of
possible languages around us just having
come along for historical accident but
if you can consider the possible
diversity what I'm saying is a rational
Martian scientist who looks at us the
way we look at frogs would say well is
only one of them it's true like if we
look at frogs they they're all frogs you
know I mean if a frog looks at frogs
they're all wildly different from one
another in fact a frog would just take
for granted that every reasonable thing
is a frog and wouldn't even ask any
question about what it's like to be a
fraud a frog would presumably be
precisely different interested in
whatever minuscule difference there may
be among frogs that tells them you know
you act this way or that way to them
they don't worry about the fact that
they're all frogs that's taken for
granted or if you're doing a genetics
experiment let's say you pretend that
all the fruit flies are identical I mean
if somebody really asks you'll say yeah
this one's they're a little bit
different here and there but they're
basically identical for a like here and
whatever is different about them I
forget about and again some point of
view the fruit flies the world may look
quite
right now we're no different from any
other organism I presume I think we're
part of the natural world so we take for
granted that anything around as a human
being
I mean if other people use the word
house with this weird collection of
properties that we use we don't even
notice it that's just like breathing
because that's just the way any
reasonable creature is on the other hand
if a Martian works and this you go over
and you hear somebody speak Swahili or
something that looks wildly different on
the other hand I'm suggesting that if a
Martian were to look at us or we were
capable of looking of looking at
ourselves as we can you know you sort of
abstract yourself away from being human
being and you try to become a science
you can't get out of your own skin
completely but you try now look at us
the way we would look at frogs or flute
fruit flies and I think what you
discover is we're remarkably alike that
all of this diversity is really pretty
superficial it goes back to very similar
structures in fact so similar that this
diverse range of languages may very well
have only one computational procedure
and only slight variations among it in
the set of concepts with all their
richness and intricacy most of which is
undreamed-of now even those what it is
that probably is going to turn out to be
alike now of course there will be
differences and in our lives as human
beings will be very much interested in
the differences but in our lives the
scientists will say they're all the same
that's what I mean
see what you mean in other words were
you saying that at you made example of
the container the container nouns and
yeah I believe you said if we look upon
it from the exterior well we have a very
weird way of looking at containers in a
way which is extremely complex so
complex in fact that there couldn't be a
physical object that has any of the
properties that we I mean that has the
collection of properties that we assume
when we talk about them well it doesn't
mean we're confused or anything like
that it just means that the language
resources we have for compel us to look
at the world from a very strange
perspective and we all do it that way
because we're human frogs do it their
way cuz they're frogs now there are also
slight differences among us like English
and Swahili but
they look slight now about the diversity
of languages chances are it's going to
move towards uniformity but that's four
completely other reasons that's cuz a
lot of people get murdered and you know
how are spread that sort of thing so
languages are in fact disappearing but
that's like the way biological diversity
is being reduced thank you that's the
question I want to ask you about the
future of language I talk to people from
other countries and I asked them what
they listen to on the radio in terms of
music and it's all English based pop
music the publishing industry seems to
be going in the direction of English
language universal throughout the world
there are countries that have set up
organizations to protect their languages
I know the French government has such an
organization particularly when what was
the pinball machines and France became
little affair are we going toward a
future where English will be the
universal language well you know that's
the question of a different convention
altogether that has to do with that's
question of power you know and that's a
different set of issues arise my guess
is not I mean in some respects the
world's becoming more diverse for
example I don't have any statistics
maybe somebody knows but I wouldn't be
at all surprised if the number of say
scientific papers being written in
German and Japanese is increasing not
decreasing you go back to say nineteen
early fifties they're probably reading
it writing in English because the u.s.
is so overwhelmingly dominant it's not
writing in English you don't exist but
that's probably I'm sure some of you
know maybe still knows or something but
I suspect it's more diverse now and if
real development takes place in other
places I would expect to continue to be
diverse in that respect also you know
while there is a tendency to attack say
the European community or a take Europe
all together while Europe is in a way at
one level unifying it's also splitting
all over the place not we read about it
in Eastern Europe where
you know it was a different country
emerging every village by now but it's
happening in Western Europe too I mean
Scotland is moving towards you know the
big pressure towards independence
actually it's even happening in the
United States like was getting some
talks in Alaska a couple of weeks ago
and I discovered to my amazement that
the governor of Alaska was elected on an
independence ticket
apparently everybody thinks he's a total
crook but they've voted learned because
he was calling for Alaskan independence
and that's what they want they want to
get away from this business down here so
I think one also finds you know very
disintegrating factors in the world
system towards people trying to identify
communities that they can belong to you
don't feel part of or something like
that and that leads to there's been a
lot of revival of languages that have
that word dying
I think it's awfully hard to predict it
depends on complicated economic and
social and political processes that we
don't have any least I don't as much
understanding it
