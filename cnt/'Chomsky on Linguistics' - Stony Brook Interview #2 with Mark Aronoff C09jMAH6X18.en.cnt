no I'm Chomsky is a dominant
intellectual figure in our world he's
also a professor of linguistics a field
about which few people know very much
today we'll try to rectify that
imbalance a little bit
professor Chomsky can you describe in a
few words what modern linguistics is
well it has it's very diverse as many
different aspects but the parts that
I've personally been involved with for
the last half century or so study
language as part of the biological
equipment of a person so some some
component of mostly the brain which is
specialized for particular tasks
including computational tasks and tasks
of action that seem to distinguish us
rather radically from other species and
apparently are pretty recent
evolutionary innovation and the attempt
is to find out first of all what a
particular instantiation of this
capacity is so say the one that you and
I more or less share not exactly but
closely find out what are the rules and
principles and so on that allow us to do
what we're doing now and more generally
to find out what is the range of
possible diversity of such
instantiations possible languages
something that's determined by our
genetic endowment and allows a limited
variety of systems each of which is
extremely rich in expressive power and
then there are further questions like
asking how you know what happened in the
history of these systems how did they
change from one one to another
how do people use them to talk about the
world
make plans and so on what are the how
does it connect to an articulatory and
perceptual apparatus what's going on in
the brain while all this is happening
someday how did the system evolve hard
question this whole range of topics
falls within what's sometimes called bio
linguistics the study of language as a
biological capacity and most other
aspects of the study of language
language in societies like was to change
and so on basically presuppose similar
assumptions more or less sometimes
explicitly sometimes tacitly your most
famous sentence is colorless green ideas
sleep furiously can you tell us a bit
about the significance of that sentence
and actually it had almost no
significant so I don't know why it was
just picked as one of if you look at
it's actually in a text book it was a
book called syntactic structures which
actually was course no it wasn't written
for a publication it was course notes
for an undergraduate MIT course back in
the mid-1950s which some publisher
picked up stuck in a couple of footnotes
and published but the point of the
example was just to illustrate a few
elementary points which were
inconsistent with common assumptions the
question is what makes a sentence and
intelligible grammatical English
sentence or any other language one
assumption was well has to be meaningful
and some independent since well that one
isn't meaningful another was it has to
have the proper form formal elements
like ly ly less and so on have to give a
frame and then you just put words in
them okay well this has the same form as
completely crazy sentences
I gave another example so that can't be
it
another was that its statistical
properties are close to those of English
texts so if you look at the probability
of every pair of words in it that'll be
like the probability of those words in
English texts okay it doesn't have that
property and in fact of the familiar
proposals about the nature of English
sentences this was a short example that
happened to be inconsistent with all of
them so it was one of a series of such
cases and for some reason that one
became famous I don't know why
to me at least it's also always
demonstrated something more positive
about language or was it didn't simply
disprove other people's ideas but I to
me I think it's also an example of of a
particular computational property of
language well it raises the quit I mean
I don't think really answers anything
but it raises the question what's going
on that makes that sentence so different
from say the same sentence backwards or
other sentences that look as if they're
the same form but are perfectly fine
like revolutionary new ideas appear
infrequently say it's more or less the
same form why is that one perfectly
normal in this one somehow the law and
so it doesn't really answer questions it
poses the question how are we able to
understand these things in fact the
other sentence is in the list which are
this is an introductory lecture and
there's a series of examples there the
other ones raised much harder questions
the questions about where WH phrases
question words
and how they fit what we know about them
and so on those are hard questions still
lively questions it's often said that
you rev a lot revolutionised not only
linguistics but also how we study humans
in general what do you feel is the most
important aspect of that revolution
whether this is in the 1950s and there
was a shift in perspective that was
taking place for many points of view at
about that time at that time a second
study of humans psychology was called
behavioral science and it was a study of
behavior here's what people do and we
got a mint somehow figure out a way to
more or less mimic what they do you know
I have a predictive apparatus that'll
say here's what they do and in
linguistics the similar this
structuralist tendencies which were
dominant so to identify some pretty
superficial structural properties that
you could find in language and that you
know that maybe you could find some
generalizations across languages but it
was all very phenomenon oriented and the
shift that was going on was a gradual
shift led to it's now cognitive science
was to search really a different
question
not what are the phenomenon and how do
we sort of
mimic them but what are the inner
mechanisms that are determining the
phenomenon so the behavior instead of
being the topic of investigation is just
dated and it's useful data if it helps
you understand something about the inner
mechanisms it doesn't help you it's not
the other data would be fine to and so
on it actually I think should be looked
at as a shift of the study of psychology
from a descriptive taxonomic
investigation to it's something in
principle part of the sciences may
become part of the sciences as the
results become deep enough I mean the
sciences if you study physics for
example you're not interested in
describing the phenomena outside the
window what you study is the data by now
you know centuries comes from carefully
controlled designed experiments intended
to illuminate what you take to be
underlying principles of nature which
you know may tell you something about
what's going on outside the window but
that's not the topic of investigation
the topic is the principles of nature
that determine what's happening and any
phenomena are useful for this if they
contribute to it otherwise they're
uninteresting but the phenomenon
themselves are not the topic of study so
a physicist or a chemist or biologists
do not take videotapes of what's
happening and say ok I'll try to find
the statistical patterns in this or
something of that sort that shift led to
some people call it the cognitive
revolution I don't like the phrase
myself particularly but this shift in
the study of language was part of that
and also in a many ways an impetus to it
many other things modeled themselves on
it although other things were happening
in the same kind of intellectual media
many of them going on in the same place
Cambridge Massachusetts something you're
describing an intellectual shift
and to those of us who who didn't
experience that it also it often seems
peculiar the people in a sense refused
to think about the mechanism it almost
seems to have been a religious belief on
the part of the the earlier
practitioners it's still true I mean if
you counted noses of people who
investigate the field it remains very
substantially a descriptive taxonomic
field that's often even a theoretical
drive um you can read technical
professional articles now let's say all
this search for inner mechanisms is
pointless what we ought to be doing is
model I think modeling the actual
phenomenon so we our goal is to try to
develop some quasi predictive apparatus
which will yield something approximating
the actual data of sentence production
which would be as if a physicist were to
say well my goal was to model a
videotape of what's happening outside
the window it's a it's an attitude which
is quite divorced from that of the
science of the modern scientific
revolution but it's very prevalent and
in fields that have to do with human
capacity and behavior actually people
who study insects don't do that
somebody's interested in insect
navigation they're they don't take video
today they're trying to compile
videotapes of ants running around the
ground they're trying to figure out what
it is about an ant that enables it to do
some rather phenomenal things which you
and I can't do like you and I can't
carry out what's called dead reckoning
you have to do it with instruments if
you're a sailor but in this means sort
of traveling around on some random path
and when you get where you want to let's
say a piece of food heading straight
back to the nest in a straight line you
and I can't do that but a Desert Inn can
and an insect scientist will as possess
a not be taking videotapes of ants but
trying to figure out what are the
computational mechanisms in an ant B or
something that enable it to carry out
extremely complex navigational tasks
well that science taxonomy or a
description would be trying to model the
phenomena so when you talk about bio
linguistics what you're saying then is
that we need to approach language in the
way that scientists approach insects
insects or any other form of animal
behavior or any anything you know
whatever you happen to be studying
chemical compound I'm in the the thrust
of modern science for centuries has been
to try to discover the in turn the
principles in our mechanisms and so on
that interact in some fashion to yield
some part of the phenomena that we
observe and the more advanced the
science the less they are interested in
the phenomena that you find all over the
place
so for really advanced science the
striking phenomena are those that are
often created in the laboratory under in
order to test theoretical assumptions
that aren't settled yet and it's the
same with linguistics I mean you know
why do people study things like you know
parasitic gaps which always never here
in speech and are pretty hard for people
to understand well the point is
precisely because they are exotic
meaning nobody's any experience with
them but you do people do have sharp and
consistent judgments about them and they
answer questions about hard questions
about internal mechanisms that you would
never even know exist if you just looked
at the phenomena around you
maybe we can switch to talking about
languages rather than language languages
are disappearing at a rapid pace due
largely to globalization and economic
factors a century ago we had about 5000
languages
give or take and some predict that a
century from now we'll have only
one-tenth of that number
how should linguist respond to those
developments well first of all I think
we would have had a corrective which
professional linguist no but isn't in
the common discussion I mean the
languages are disappearing just as fast
in places like Europe
I mean Europe had a huge variety of
languages a century a couple of
centuries ago in fact even in you know
our lifetimes and they're disappearing
very fast so one of the main as you know
one of the main linguistic projects in
the world is the European Union project
done what they call dialects but they're
really languages like you know Italian
dialects or German dialect which are
just disappearing
I mean people can't talk to their
grandmothers you know because they talk
different languages and that happened
through not so much through
globalization as just through imposition
of Nach national states and national
cultures so you know go back generation
or two and the Italian was a second
language for almost everybody in Italy
German was the second language you
studied it in school
you spoke whatever language it was and
they were often mutually unintelligible
and quite different and there they've
been leveled there's been kind of a
leveling through state formation
television common educational systems
and so on so in Europe alone there's
rapid disappearance of language and the
kind that you know we're concerned with
that you're you bring up and is of great
concern is that it's happening all over
the world what linguists of course this
is losing cultural wealth and cultural
variety and the richness of human
creativity and contributions at a very
rapid rate it's kind of like destroying
you know the museum the the library in
Alexandria or something or what just
happened in Iraq destroying the record
of civilization and a lot of this
happens to be a non writing civilization
so there's no written record left and
the linguists are of course trying to
capture as much of it as they can and
try to revivify it try to revitalize the
languages so can al and her former
colleague died recently a large part of
his life what life's work was trying to
invigorate communities to revive and
study and teach and spread their own
language and he brought people to MIT to
get graduate degrees in linguistics
people who often had not much formal
education it ended up being very good
professional linguists went back to
their own communities started
educational programs took part in not
only maintaining the language but expand
the reviving knowledge of it trying to
make it a living language again that's
happened in some places it's failed in
other places Europe as well so say in
Wales without any national effort the
language kind of revived a few here kids
and the streets of Cardiff talking Welsh
in Ireland where there wasn't national
it's apparently mostly failed you know
when these things work when they don't
work is hard to say but reviving the
communities the cultures the languages
and where that's not possible at least
salvaging the record of them is a very
significant test would it be harder to
do linguistics with fewer languages sure
just losing evidence all the time I mean
if we had only you know English let's
say we wouldn't have a clue about the
principles of English because you learn
about them when you study other
languages I mean when say Jim Wong did
the first serious modern studies of
Chinese that immediately led to
discoveries about English but nobody's
ever son you didn't learn the phenomena
of English but he suddenly realized that
these are strange phenomena and I have
to be explained and that led on to other
things and the same is true of any range
of languages you look at I'm just as if
if you didn't have a lot of chemical
comical elements you might be highly
misled about the nature of element there
really a reverse question here a century
ago there was great interest in
universal languages like Esperanto in
fact many of the founding members of the
linguistic Society of America were
interested in in questions of universal
language and some of the earliest
support financial support for
linguistics came from people and
organizations that were interested in
universal languages and in part where a
large impetus for that was big the
feeling that people had difficulty
understanding one across one another
across cultures there's much less
interest in international languages
today in part because people say that
English is now the universal language
is that a good development this
ascendance of English other separate
issues here I mean the interest of
linguists as linguists in universal
languages was based on an illusion which
linguists had but no longer have that
was the illusion that Esperanto is a
language and it isn't Esperanto is a
couple of hints that people who know
language can use based on their own
linguistic knowledge to make a language
out of it but nobody can tell you what
the rules of Esperanto are if they could
tell you that they could tell you what
the rules of Spanish are and that turns
out to be an extremely hard problem a
hard problem of the sciences to find out
what's really in the head of a Spanish
speaker that enables them to speak and
understand and think the way they do
that's a problem at the edge of science
I mean we sort of a Spanish speaker
knows it intuitively but that doesn't
help I'm in a desert ant knows how to
navigate but it doesn't help the insect
scientists gotta figure out what the
ants doing and it's now understood that
that's an extremely hard problem you go
back a generation or two it was
considered a trivial problem because of
lack of understanding of the nature of
language I mean to take it kind of a
analog if you go back to pre Galilean
times there was no problem about if Y
you know if I let me let this go it's
gonna fall to the ground it's going to
its natural place what else is there to
say well you know turned out there was a
lot to say to be puzzled by simple
questions is a very hard step and it's
the first step in science really and the
same is true about the nature of
Esperanto or Spanish or Yvonne which is
largely based and so on we don't know
the answers to the questions of what the
rules and the principles of Esperanto do
because if we did we'd know the answer
to how language works and that's much
harder than knowing how a
desert ant navigates which is hard
enough so now it's understood that
Esperanto isn't a language it's just
parasitic on other languages then comes
a question which is not a linguistic
question but a question of practical
utility I mean is it worth is it more
efficient to teach people a system which
is parasitic on actual languages and
somewhat simplified so it doesn't have
some of the details of actual historical
languages or is it more efficient they
just have them no a lot of languages and
I think it's pretty now but now pretty
widely accepted that the latter is
better and not hard I mean it's a little
misleading in the United States the
United States is unusually monolingual
as compared with say Europe a generation
or two ago and the reason is not
linguistic it's that the people who
conquered the United States essentially
exterminated everybody if you
exterminate the native population yeah
then ends up monolinguals but you know
Southern California alone probably had
hundreds thousands of languages and
they're all gone mostly gone so this in
the United States people tend to think
tend to know one well actually it's miss
the languages that are spoken in the
United States which we call English are
sometimes mutually incomprehensible I
mean I remember giving talks and Eastern
Kentucky where I could understand the
students and the colleges because they
were taught standard English as a Second
Language like students in Italy we
thought what Italian as a second
language but when I walked through the
streets I could barely understand what
people were saying or where I grew up
and having to grow up in a in
Philadelphia just urban Philadelphia I
mean I could I would sometimes take the
trolley car
we're somewhere and there'd be a kid
kids sitting behind me in the next row
and I couldn't stand the word they were
saying they were talking what's now
called
you know Black English which is just
another language similar to my English
but not the same so there is a variety
of languages in the United States but
much less than in areas of comparable
scope largely because of the nature of
the conquest of the continent but in
many parts of the world it's completely
normal for a child to grow up speaking a
number of languages I mean West Africa
say you know maybe the mother speaks one
language and father speaks a different
language and your aunt speaks another
language and the kid just grows up
knowing all of them so it's perfectly
possible for children to grow up without
effort knowing plenty of languages and
even not living in that cultural milieu
can be done and the question is whether
that's a more efficient mode of
organizing the world and teaching a an
extra language which is modeled on the
existing ones but somewhat leveled so
that becomes easier for you know say
romantic speakers linguists talk about
language as consisting of a grammar and
a lexicon of the words of the language
and I think one of the themes of today's
discussion has been the extent to which
people ask questions that they hadn't
thought about before and non-league was
when they look at language the questions
that they ask tend to be questions about
words and not about the grammar or the
structure of the language the grammar
for them is not even worth discussing
it's so natural I mean do you just do it
like if ants could talk they would think
there's no problem at all and doing dead
reckoning you know
all the time what's the big problem and
we speak all the time and understand
what we hear and produce novel
utterances and if linguists decide to
use us as subjects they'll give us
sentences sometimes which we know are
gibberish sure make no sense just don't
conform to the language and others which
we have to think about and try to figure
out what they mean but we do it instinct
it feels instinctive so what could be
the problem but that's like things
falling to their natural place there's a
huge problem or the end navigating how
is it done and in fact the same kinds of
questions arise about words as soon as
you start thinking about the meaning of
a word it becomes incredibly intricate
actually this goes back as far as
Aristotle Aristotle raised the question
what's the meaning of the word house
actually he didn't put it that way he
said what's the nature of the house the
way we would say it is what's the
meaning of the word house and he pointed
out it can't be just a collection of
bricks and wood it also must be
something that has a specific design and
function so a particular arrangement of
pieces of you know wooden bricks could
be a house or it could be a garage or it
could be he didn't weaken the water in
play with it could be a paperweight for
a giant you know it could be all kinds
of things what it is depends on the
design in the mind of the creator the
use the widgets put the function it
serves and so on and if we look at the
word more carefully than Aristotle did
we find many more varieties of
complexity so for example if I tell you
that I painted my house Brown you know
that it means I painted the exterior
surface brown if I want to tell you I
painted the interior surface brown I
have to say I painted my house brown on
the inside
markedness it's called like if I tell
you I climbed the hill you know I went
up but if I can't say I climb down the
hill I have to add something to tell you
I was going down well house is the same
it has its has a it's it's basically a
surface an exterior surface although we
can complicate our description of it and
focus attention on the interior surface
and it's much more complicated than that
it's not just a surface if it was a
surface only a surface then you could be
near the house if you're inside it if
you're inside a mathematical cube you're
near the cube because the cube is just a
surface we can't think about it like
that the way we use the word near or in
or something it's not just the surface
it's a closed surface and it doesn't
mean have to be closed like if you take
a you know a lean-to the thing which
this looks like like upside down ill
there's an insight in an outside if you
take a mountain it's the same thing it
doesn't have to be an invented artifact
and as without proceeding as you go on
you find the simplest word you can think
of you know book a tree person anything
you like has immense layers of
complexity which are barely understood I
mean investigating them is also a
scientific problem you know barely the
surface has been done so the word seemed
just natural to us but that's like
navigating seeming natural to an N say
it doesn't mean it simple it just means
it's the kind of thing we're built to do
and if you want to look at it from the
out if you want to discover what it's
about you have to look at it from the
outside looking from the inside doesn't
help and you have to look at it the way
Galileo looked at the fact that
you drop something it falls up and falls
down instead of I've been at a
particular rate and there's a particular
function of time so on and so forth and
those don't have to be extremely hard
problems and the beginnings of modern
science some of what you're talking
about raises the issue of the connection
between language and perception and
there have been a variety of views on
that relation probably the best-known
and the one that that linguists have the
least use for is the notion that your
language affects your perception I'd say
at the opposite end would be the notion
that there's nothing special about
language it's just part of that
perceptual or based in that perceptual
apparatus you really seem to occupy a
middle ground well the first point of
view famous is the wharf hypothesis it's
gold is that the nature of your language
determines the way is you see and
understand the world which it's been
extremely hard to put any meat on that
hypothesis I mean worse who was a major
linguist not a happens that he was
insurance salesman ability was a made
extremely important contributions to
linguistics this hypothesis is the least
of his contributions and his actual
proposals while they kind of seemed
persuasive when I was a college student
back in the 40s as soon as you think
about them they're not very persuasive
so one of his main examples was that one
of the languages he was studying was
Hopi and he argued that Hopi has a
different way of dealing with time than
what he called standard average European
which would include English so you and I
think of time we do as a kind of a line
with yourself standing on the line
looking forward toward the future and
over your shoulder or the
passed and he argued well that's because
European languages have past present and
future tense but hope he doesn't have
that system they have some other system
he said they don't think of time that
way well a couple of problems with that
one problem is that English doesn't have
past present of the future tense so if
you looked at English the way he was
looking at Hopi what you would say is
that the way think of we think of time
is past and non past and then there's a
bunch of modalities like necessity and
optionality and among them is Futurity
just one of the modalities because
that's the way English syntax works but
we don't think of it that way so how do
we know that the hope you don't think of
it that way it's not in their language
either and most of the examples kind of
collapsed from that kind of analysis
there has been an effort to try to find
something and there's been a revival of
it in the last couple of years and some
suggestive work but if there's an effect
it's extremely hard to tease out on
perception there may be but not it's not
gonna be easy to find on the other hand
the other extreme the idea is well
language is just part of perception I
mean that now we're back to things
falling because it's their natural place
I mean as soon as you look at perception
turns out to be extremely complex affair
with none of the properties you
superficially imagined and those
properties just don't look like the
properties of language which is a
different kind of system I mean it's
just you know prima facie it would be
very surprising if language were a
reflection of perceptual capacities that
one obvious reason is that we share to a
very substantial extent we share our
perceptual capacities with other
primates but they don't have language so
something's different and the question
is what it is turn to have to be
radically different isn't it
look into it perception leads me to
think about production I'm gonna ask a
somewhat selfish question because it
relates to my own particular research
interests in the last few years I've
been doing a lot of work on sign
languages and at first they seem to be
quite radically different from spoken
languages because you're not speaking
and I think to my mind at least one of
the great contributions of modern
linguistics was to to legitimize the
notion of sign language that's very
modern and after the days when you were
a student in fact this you know it's
really the last 20 years or so that it's
been discovered that sign language is a
human language with very much the
properties of the kind we're familiar
with and that came as a big surprise and
now sign language is by linguists at
least studied as a language just among
other languages like you know we as you
know at MIT there's one graduate course
every year which is called you know
unfamiliar languages or something you
know it could be a language of Africa or
something like that but a couple of
years ago the language chosen was
American sign language it's just another
language let's try to figure out how
that one works and the similarities
between sign there are many different
sign languages of course and they're
mutually incomprehensible but the the
properties of these languages turn out
to be remarkably like those of spoken
language I mean even their neural
representation terms have to be similar
so you know it was originally assumed
that sign language would be mostly right
hemisphere specialized visual well it
turns out the left hemisphere
specialized in very much the way spoken
languages and if you look at that work
by telling you things you know better
than I do so I feel funny to think it's
but if you don't mind not laughing the
work you know by people like say our
salucci and
Kleeman their lab has led to some
discoveries about the neural
representation of spoken language which
are surprising - turns out the left
hemisphere specialization is kind of
local rather than global so like for
discourse construction
it seems that right hemisphere dominance
is significant whereas for word or
sentence construction its left
hemisphere specialized and something
similar seems to be true of sign
language discourse looks right
hemisphere specialized but a sentence
construction or no particular sign
construction looks pretty much the same
as the spoken language which is a
surprise because the spoken
specialization is near the motor areas
and they're just totally different motor
areas for sign so lots of things are
coming out but you're pretty surprising
and they're shedding new light on spoken
language but this just looks like
another normal language actually
acquisition of sign follows the same
free as far as is known essentially the
same course as acquisition of spoken
language at the same times of the same
maturational process and so on so it has
been extremely illuminating also there
there apparently invented sign languages
so as far as anyone knows the one that
Judy Kegel others are studying in
Nicaragua it looks as if it was invented
not borrowed or by somebody who did it
but just invented by the community the
signing community so it's a case of a
fairly very recent apparently invention
of the language which looks like pretty
much every other language we know it
seems to happen when you simply bring
their community together yeah actually
there's some cases on record a few many
of children who have invented their own
sign language and there's one famous
case the one studied by susan
goldin-meadow of and they found a couple
of children husbands of who were non
hearing but whose parents were spoke
were hearing you know and the parents at
that time we're indoctrinated not to
teach the children sign they're so
deeply indoctrinated they were taught
not to make gestures you know kind of
walk around with their hands behind your
back well it turned out that these kids
on their own just playing together
invented a language a sign language they
were found that I think was about ages
three and four and what they were doing
without the parents knowledge just
something they didn't ever ask the
parents so I didn't know what was going
on you know some language that they had
created it was at the level of the
character of spoken three or
four-year-old language well of course as
soon as the kids were found they were
put in an environment where they learn
American Sign Language so experiment
ended but it looked as though it was a
spontaneously invented normal human
language by a couple of kids in a single
generation the legitimation of sign
language does that rates raise issues
about the connection between language
and speech at least when I grew up
academically we thought of speech as as
essential to language certainly
challenge I mean at night it's a
devastating challenge to it
it seems to indicate that whatever is
special about language maybe modality
independent I mean how independent we
don't know but at least sign and spoken
language seemed to share deep
characteristics to develop in pretty
much the same way and as to the little
that's understood they have the same
kind of neural basis so yeah that does
dissociate language from speech pretty
sharp or at least a large part of
language
I mean it indicates that whatever the
sensory the sensory motor apparatus
which is you know they're independently
of language and it's not all that
different and other primates and even
mammal it's certainly imposing
constraints on what language is but it
looks like those constraints are much
weaker than one would have assumed to
say twenty years ago and that whatever
else is going that the nature of the
computational systems is somehow much
less dependent on the specific form of
externalization than one would have
taken for granted in the past I mean
that doesn't mean that the study of
sound structure of language or
production is any less interesting that
ever was it just seems that it's less
essential to the nature of language your
most recent work is quite novel can you
give us a bit of a flavor of some of
this new work the so called minimalist
work well it's you know it's known to
any biologist do anyone thinks about it
that if you look at the nature of an
organism there are a number of different
factors that enter into what the nature
is like say the visual system of a cat I
mean one factor that enters into it is
the you know the genome
what's the genetic basis for the
development of a cat's visual system so
that's one factor another factor is
what's the actual visual experience that
the cat the particular cat had and it's
known experimentally it's been known for
about 40 years that you can modify the
early of this very early first couple of
weeks first the visual experience which
in a way which will change the structure
of the visual system it'll even change
the you know the neural structure of the
system if you'd present say horizontal
lines versus vertical lines in the first
couple of weeks of life so one one
factor is the genetic endowment another
factor is the experience
if you take human language there's a
very rich genetic endowment that says
we're gonna have a language of a
particular type I mean a Martian looking
at us the way we look at say no bees
would say we're all talking the same
language just even less very than these
different a lot of different species of
bees so I one species of humans and they
seem to have almost the same language
from the point of view of an outside
scientist looking in so there's a rich
genetic endowment that says got to be
one of these things but there's also an
effective experience like you know we're
talking English not Swahili so that some
effective experience but then it's also
known that there's another there are
other factors just the way the world
works like chemical and physical laws or
for language probably the way
computational systems work what
efficient computation is and so on and
that's another factor that enters into
what the outcome is that's an extremely
hard problem in biology it's you know
just sort of study it but it's out on
the periphery it's a hard problem and
the work that you're referring doing
language the reason work is an effort to
study how those factors enter into the
nature of language so how do principles
of efficient computation for example
enter into the properties of the
language systems that we see and its
controversial this is very recent work
but at least my own opinion is that
turns out to be a major effect and a lot
of things that we thought were specific
principles of language may in fact just
reduced to the way
efficient computational systems operate
I mean at this point it wouldn't come as
an enormous surprise I mean I'm not
suggesting it but it would not come as
an enormous surprise to discover that
some of the crucial factors in say in
sake navigation are also showing up in
human language and contributing to its
nature but that's
you know research topics underway and
properly very controversial thank you
know I hope we've learned a little bit
today about linguistics we have some
time for questions if you would yeah my
question is you you often expressed
doubts or question the notion of a
publicly shared language but couldn't we
think of say standard English or the
Latin of the Middle Ages academic Latin
as something like a invented shared
language actually these it's odd that
these are called my doubts those are the
doubts of every linguist in fact one of
the first things you study in the first
freshman course usually it's done you're
taught a joke that was attributed to max
vine right that a language is a dialect
with an army and a navy but there's no
such thing you know the things are
called languages because of colors on
maps and you know continuity of empires
and all sorts of things but it's
certainly true that you know within like
a mark and I on you to some extent share
language a language world talking to
each other without too much trouble
if a linguist we're looking at the three
of us they say well there's three
different languages there which are kind
of very similar so they can get by and
over some range you can decide the call
there's the more or less similar
languages a shared language if you want
it's not a linguistic observation it's a
you know it's a practical discussion
sometimes things are invented you know
like if the two linked professional
linguists are talking we're going to
talk our own language which nobody else
is going to understand because there's a
kind of special concepts in it and all
sorts of other things and yeah that's
this your shared language I mean this if
I talk to I mean there are things I can
talk about monolingual Japanese you know
which I can't talk about to my
children let's say because we just share
some sub language that's invented
purposely invented when you talk about
standard Latin it was kind of something
like that you know
partly ossified partly created but these
are not linguistic notions that you can
draw the lines where you feel like
professor Chomsky the expression the
lexicon came up in the discussion as
you've no colleagues of yours at MIT
tell us there is no lexicon and in fact
here we are he's one of the people who's
done the major work showing it was an
electric fact there are no lexical
categories adjectives verb nouns any
personal views on elects the existence
of lexical categories or categories no
that's not lexicon but yes always like
noun verb adjective
yes exactly yeah well there is a view
which i think is compelling and suspect
is probably right that that the atoms of
from which bigger constructions are
formed what I'm loosely calling the
lexicon though it turns out to be pretty
complex again I defer to mark who's been
working on the complexity of it but
abstracting away from that there are
some kind of atoms out of which
expressions are formed question is do
they have categories like are they in
the categories now and for adjectives
and prepositions and so on and there is
a view which I think to which you're
referring which seems to me plausible is
that no there are but there are really
our roots and the roots are category
independent and then there are particles
which in some languages you actually see
like they have a morphological
realization but in English you
overwhelmingly don't and it's the
connection of those particles which are
in the head you know small elements
which are in the head but only come out
of the mouth and some languages not
others
that determines whether the thing is
going to function as what we call a noun
or a verb or an adjective and that has
things going and there are languages
where this is almost obvious on the
surface like the Semitic languages I
mean you know it's not a hundred percent
but the basic structure of the Semitic
languages just has roots and then you
know ways of putting them into vocalic
patterns which turns into what we would
call
one of you a noun or an adjective or
something but the claim that you're
referring to is that that's basically
the way it works cross-linguistically
which could well turn out to be true I
mean what looks obvious to us on the
surface is usually wrong
excuse me there's a debate among some
cognitive scientists and philosophers
about whether we think in or with our
natural language English say or if
there's something else going on often
called mental ease
I was wondering first of all if you
think that question has actually been
posed in any coherent manner and if so
what your opinions about the answer
might be well the one of the problems
with the proposed I mean I think it's
probably something to it but one of the
problems with the proposals is it comes
out as soon as you ask yourself what do
we know about mental ease okay so people
talk about the language of thought my
friend Jerry Fodor for example and you
know maybe he's right but what do we
know about the language of thought
turns out it's English you know or
whatever else the person who's writing
about it says so we really don't know
anything much independent about what the
language of thought mentally is supposed
to be now that doesn't mean it's not
there you know it just means we don't
know there's some reasons for thinking
there must be something there
I mean there are non speaking organisms
like monkeys and apes and the infant's
who seemed to do things very much like
what we call thinking but don't have the
language to express it so it looks as if
there's thought going on but somehow
without language and furthermore I mean
unfortunately there's almost no science
here so you really have to deal with
intuition and introspection if you
introspect it's almost obvious that this
thought without language I mean a very
common experience which we all have all
the time is to say something
and to realize no that's not what I
meant you know and then to try to say it
some other way which maybe gets closer
to what you meant and then you try maybe
somebody else says it you say oh yeah
yeah that's exactly what I meant well
all of this seems to presuppose that
there's something that you meant and
whatever it is that you meant it's
apparently not what you said otherwise
the problem wouldn't arise and to try to
figure out what it is that you meant
that well that's problem what the
thought is about unfortunately are very
few ways of studying what thought is
like other than through the meaning of
language and that's why it's really hard
I mean there is work on infants and
other organisms which sheds a lot of
light on it so if you read a book like
say Mark Hauser's but wild Minds he's a
primatologist or a recent book by Anand
David Premack called I think original
intelligence which is mostly about
non-human primates they have plenty of
and other organisms not just like dogs
and so on they have plenty of evidence
of what looks it's hard to describe it
without calling and thinking it looks
like what we would call thinking but
plainly without anything like what we
would call a language and maybe out of
that will come and there there's work on
young children and so on - which seems
to bear on that but you know so if you
ask my opinion my guess is yeah there's
some kind of system of thought in there
which we can only get very limited
access to at the moment from the outside
and from the inside of course we all
have it thank you
we've learned a lot today thank you very
much
