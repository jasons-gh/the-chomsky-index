so I'd like to welcome everyone to the
last session of our webinar series which
you're holding with internationally
well-known scholars and experts so today
we're hosting Professor Noam Chomsky and
we're going to have a lecture from him
on how to resolve the
israeli-palestinian conflict so I'm
really happy to be here and it's an
honor to have no purpose for Noam
Chomsky with us the session will be 40
minutes and after his presentation it's
going to be a short presentation we are
going to have the cat a session so I
think we can start if you're else ex
will'd
you want to get started with me talking
about the topic or should we just move
into discussion which is typically more
interesting I'm happy either way so if
you would like to point to things that
you think we should talk about be happy
to pursue it or also I can talk about
what's on my mind
the former is more useful so maybe you'd
like to if you'd like to say some things
in your mind like a short presentation
we also have some questions that were
sent from the participants so whenever
you're done we can just transition to
the okones session and our participants
in here can also write their questions
from the chat section so we all choose
the questions from there and direct them
to the professor Chomsky so feel free to
write down your questions well I think
what's on all of our minds is is there
any what is the way to try to achieve
some limited at least form of justice
and peace in the long-standing
israel-palestine conflict the latest
intervention and this is the what
President Trump in has associated school
the greater steal of the century it's
worth as soon as they announced it was
universally accepted that this is the
framework in which we have to proceed
can we make it work
is it wrong in this respect and much
discussion and debate worth bearing in
mind that if anyone else had sent this
prepared proposed this it either would
have been ignored or dismissed with
ridicule if it had come from China or
France or any other country and no one
else paid the slightest attention
because it's so obvious and ridiculous
its Prime Minister Netanyahu's plan I
handed over to Jared Kushner to read to
the public but when the United States
produces it it's law that tells you
something very important about
international affairs International
Affairs is very much like the Mafia
there's a that's super dawn The
Godfather and everyone else is afraid of
him no it doesn't work entirely like
that but it's very close in this case
the Godfather happens to be in
Washington not Europe is of course a
powerful force but it's unwilling to
risk angering The Godfather
so when the Godfather destroys the
chances for peace in the Middle East
with the Iran agreement Europe doesn't
like it but they go along with it when
the US imposes sanctions outrageous
sanctions the Europe says we don't like
them but we'll accept them and it's the
same with almost everything else
including the beast plan also if we look
at it it's
it's a plan for consummating what Israel
has been working on for 50 years with
consonant us support not connecting the
West Bank they don't want to do that if
they annexed the West Bank they get the
population and they don't want the
population they have the population that
gives rise to what's called the
demographic problem too many non-jews in
a Jewish state we don't want that so the
plan from about 1970 has been through
slowly systematically take over the
ports of the West Bank formerly Gaza
formerly the Sinai they gave a fund that
take over the parts of the West Bank but
they are of any value and interest to us
includes Jordan Valley not a third in
the West Bank the major towns that are
being developed to like model domain REO
mostly during the Clinton years the
passages to them that other areas that
are useful and valuable probably about
60% of the West Bank but to avoid the
population centers so they don't want to
take over noblesse what they wanna do is
isolated and make it unlivable but maybe
people who leave but isolate as in any
traditional neo colony there has to be
something from the Palestinian elites so
if you get a the chorus country in
Central Africa you'll find a center
where elites have the fancy restaurants
lovely hotels theaters and so on that's
Ramallah so we'll leave Ramallah for the
Palestinian it needs to enjoy themselves
the rest of the country will divide into
literally hundreds of isolated Canton's
where poor villages
are separated from their olive groves
they're pastoring fields and so long
enough to pass through checkpoints where
they may be allowed through maybe not
meanwhile settlers around Paige do what
they like and maybe they'll all leave
sooner or later but we'll take over
pretty much what we want currently there
is a government plan to annex the
regions that they've incorporated in to
integrate an integrator of Israel
there's opposition to them the
opposition is coming from the settlers
because they want everything they are
afraid that if they accept the
annexation plan that will leave
something to the Palestinians which they
hope ultimately to take over so there is
opposition to the annexation not from
the US administration which I could give
them anything they want not from Israel
proper that's the plan they've been
working on for years but there's some
opposition it might not take place well
is there anything that can be done about
this in principle there's a lot Europe
for example could take significant
action it could determine determined to
simply boycott everything that comes
from the occupied territories flatly
they have some talk about that but
they're not implementing it now this
could lead to a confrontation but it's
could be very effective but what about
the United States what happens in the
long term there depends on the United
States overwhelmingly now right now it
looks as though the United States is
overwhelmingly in support of Israel but
that's misleading opinion in the United
States has shifted
significantly in recent years it used to
be the case that support for Israel
passionate support from Israel came from
the liberal sectors of American life
Democratic Party Nia liberal
intellectuals and liberal forces
generally that's totally changed now
support from Israel for Israel come from
the most reactionary sectors of American
life ultra-nationalists evangelical
Christians who look forward to a war
between Jews and Arabs in which that
Armageddon in which everyone will be
destroyed and the Second Coming arrives
and they will go to heaven and so on
that's the main source of support
liberal Americans have shifted so polls
among liberal Democrats show that
there's more support for Palestinian
rights than for Israel
this is particularly true among young
people including the young Jewish
population which is much of which is a
pole play Israeli action is drifting
away from Nora support from Israel but
even from Jordan
now these tendencies can be could be
used to develop a serious authentic
solidarity movement in the United States
which unfortunately does not exist in
quit the velum could influence US policy
of us support for Israel is very fragile
it's based it's actually in violation of
US law no this is not well known in the
orange states nobody talks about it but
there is a law in the United States
Symington which walks any aid to
countries that have developed nuclear
weapons outside the framework of the
non-proliferation treaty
Israel's of course has done it but
you'll notice that the United States
does not recognize that Israel has
nuclear weapons of course they know it
but they don't recognize it and there's
a good reason for that
if they recognize that Israel has
nuclear weapons
US law comes into force and I have to
ban US military and economic aid to
Israel so the best idea is to keep it
quiet hoping that the media and the
information system don't talk about it
but a Solidarity movement could bring
that into the open now there are other
laws in the United States called the
Leahy law
Patrick Senator Patrick Lee which bans
military aid to any military units that
are engaged in systematic human rights
violations not the Israeli army is
constantly in a solidarity movement
couldn't bring this into public
attention but there are large parts of
the country who we're not interested at
all in Israel Palestine which don't like
to see foreign aid go in violation of US
law that would I think be possible to
develop a movement to try to ban US
military and economic aid in Israel he
fought over bitterly but it could open
doors could open ways to lead to what
might be a significant change in US
policy and a shift in the support not
for Israel isolated to the most
extremely reactionary sections and
evangelical Christians that can't be
reached on this issue they have another
agenda there's nothing to do with Israel
but those are all possibilities I think
which can be exploited both in Europe
and here of course it'll take a lot of
popular activism and engagement that
bring them into reality but as far as I
can see that's about the only serious
hope for Palestinian rights or for
anything like a just settlement of this
dispute okay thank you so much thank you
for this talk and providing us with any
perspective and now we can transition to
the Q&A session if it's okay please okay
so after the Trump plan has lost its
role as an honest broker due to this
fact due to this fact that the two-state
solution that UN has been offering since
1948 collapse the two-state solution so
can we say that according to things that
you've said that you mentioned can we
say that it's collapsed I mean it's not
gonna work anymore what we needed was a
proposal exactly that work well let's
take a look at its history which in the
United States is totally suppressed and
very little known in Europe the
doctor'll system is very rigid on these
issues but there is a history the
two-state settlement reached the United
Nations Security Council in January 1976
though there was a resolution brought
with the support of Egypt Syria Syria
and Jordan calling for a two-state
settlement on the internationally
recognized border with I'm quoting it
now with guarantees for the right of the
to Israel and Palestine to live it to
exist in peace and security within
secure and recognized borders that was
the resolution the Israel violently
opposed the Israeli prime minister Prime
Minister Rubin said
there will never be a Palestinian state
the United States vetoed the PLO gave it
tacit support it condemned the tyranny
of the veto after that though there was
another similar resolution in 1980
United States vetoed it
after that the issue shifted to the
General Assembly UN General Assembly can
also block by u.s. veto the assembly
almost every year passed some fairly
strong resolution and pretty similar
adopted almost unanimously the US and
Israel were opposed occasionally some
u.s. dependency but basically unanimous
well that's the international record is
it still viable I think so if the United
States changed its position and came out
in support of it Israel would be
compelled to obey when the United States
lays down the law Israel can do nothing
in fact every US president prior to
President Obama had made demands on
Israel that it didn't like but it was
forced to accept not if this demand came
it would also be forced to accept it in
the 1970s Israel made a fateful decision
to choose expansion over security they
could have had security full peace
treaty with a major Arab states PLO
along the lines of the 1976 resolution
but they prefer they'd made a decision
to prefer to abandon security in favor
of expansion
that's what we've seen for the last 50
years that means that they're totally
dependent on the United States they've
abandoned any support from any
meaningful support from any worlds so
when the u.s. lays down the orders they
have to obey so that's a possibility and
if there was a change in US policy get
it might eventually you know okay so how
about the one state solution once there
is no one state solution that's in total
illusion it's in fact serves as a way to
support Israel there is no possibility
that Israel would agree to go to turn to
terminate its existence to go out of
existence and to become a Palestinian
state and furthermore there is no
support for that in the world none not
in the African countries not in the
third world the global south certainly
not in Europe third world countries are
very jealous of sovereignty they don't
want to see sovereignty over overruled
it's dangerous for them so this is a
proposal with no support no possibility
of being realized it's a way of avoiding
the fact that the two realistic options
are one a two-state settlement in accord
with the international consensus and to
the greater Israel project that we see
being implemented before our eyes know
I've always been in favor all my life
back to the 1940s of what's now called
one state solution of some sort of by
national settlement for the former
Palestine I think we can move towards
that
up until 1975 it was in fact feasible I
was writing about it but there was no
interesting
not from the Arab states not from the
Palestinians of course not from Israel
so it died by the 1975 things changed
Palestinian nationalism for the first
time became a force on the international
agenda at that point the options shifted
to either two states or the Greater
Israel project and that's where they
remain talked about one state today is
like saying let's lay down our arms and
have peace tomorrow that would be nice
but that's not a program can we also say
that it has a connection with the
demographical problems because I've
heard that most of the people most of
the Palestinians in the West Bank
actually do agree with the one-state
solution but the Israelis don't actually
accept it because they see the people in
the West Bank as like terrorists so
they're like really so their terms is
that there are people there are people
if there were one state the Palestinians
would outnumber the Jews which means
Israel would disappear it would become a
Palestinian state of course this was not
going to accept that furthermore no one
in the world supports that not the
European states not the African states
not China not Russia no there is ZERO
support so saying I would like it is
like saying I would like to have peace
on earth I mean if you want to achieve
your objectives you have to become part
of the real world you can't live in a
world of illusion you can't say
like a child I would like to have this
therefore that that's what I want you
have to look at what the real world is
and see what can be achieved and this
could be a long-run goal the way I
described but it's not an imminent it's
not a possibility for the near future
okay thank you so much
parem design is slavi and its success is
clear how much do you think Jewish lobby
is into you as affect the Israeli policy
and how does it actually affect it
happens is that if the United States
government doesn't care that much you
note then organized sectors of the
population can have a bigger impact
includes the Jewish lobby includes the
Turkish level so for there is a Turkish
American population for years they've
been blocking the recognition of the
formal recognition of Armenian Genocide
very effectively they have enough
pressure so they block and you talk
about this other pressure groups
Greek Americans and evangelicals have a
strong influence on policy very strong
influence if they're a large part of the
population 25% they're the core of the
Republican Party now so they have a
major influence the same is true of
judge groups though they have pour a lot
of money into campaign funding for a
long time less now than before they
dominated the media and journals of
opinion that's declined with effort a
major thing on the other hand when the
US want something they run into the
corner and disappear many times so for
example that they know much better than
to confront us power
as I said if you want I can go through
the record but it's true of every
president except Barack Obama he's the
first one who never made a demand on
Israel but before that so take his
predecessor George W Bush known Israel's
economy relies very heavily on military
production and military export
there's a huge market that they want to
break into with high-tech weapons
China China would like to have them
Israel would love to send the high-tech
weapons to China it's continually made
efforts to do so it's been continually
slammed down by the United States most
recently George W Bush who not only
demanded that they stop it but went out
of his way to humiliate Israel he
demanded a formal apology for having
made this effort but he blocked entry of
high Israeli military officials didn't
the United States and they of course
back down and there's case after case
something if the US government strongly
and the the lobby didn't make a war say
a word not a word because this is a
strong position
they're not gonna confront the u.s.
power it's not 100 percent correct but
it's overwhelming how do you think that
the Israeli media and their intense
cyanus propaganda affect the public
opinion towards the israeli-palestinian
issue for the Israeli public or for the
world for the world yeah um yeah in the
in the sense of these are the policies
in conflicts well it affects the world
insofar as other countries pick it up
and amplify the people in the United
States don't read the Israeli media I
mean I do but
not very many people to so whatever
appears in the Israeli media reaches the
United States France England and so on
through their own information systems if
the New York Times picks up Israeli
propaganda and distributes it then it
reaches Americans and I'm sure it's the
same in Turkey
you know the Israeli press but if it
does have an influence on international
media which then presented to the Rome
publics in Israel itself it's quite
striking what's happened you go back to
the 1970s Israel was a leading social
democratic country was very respected
throughout the world European young
Europeans leftist progressive young
Europeans would go to Israel to enjoy
living in a kibbutz has seen the social
democratic country in Solon considered a
model for progressives around the world
that has totally changed Israel is now
regarded with contempt and dislike the
result of the occupation and the Bertil
efforts to refresh Palestinians that's
happened in the United States too until
you can just tell you my personal
experience I've been giving talks on
this topic and writing about it for
publicly for 50 years I literally used
to have police protection if I gave a
talk on me at a university on
israel-palestine he was my own
University there had to be a contingent
of police there to prevent violence
totally changed by now you can the huge
crowds you can barely get a critical
question the turning point
Kame actually with the Israeli attacks
on Gaza you go back to cast lead 2006
kind of strong there was a strong
negative reaction here changed opinion
enormous especially among young people
then it just continued so it's really
propaganda has much less influence than
it had in the past the media still keep
to it pretty much and he leads opinion
pretty much does
but among the general public there's a
shift okay so you're saying that there
is this positive change in the public
opinion that's or it's the conflict so
what this is the path which is leading
us to the solution for this conflict
will shift in public opinion has not yet
led to a shift in policy it's not enough
for people to want something doesn't
matter that has no effect on policy that
the government disregards with people
want if it's not interested in them it's
serving other interests but if public
opinion gets organized and effective
then it can have an effect in fact
you're seeing it right now in the
streets of the United States that's
organized public opinion which doesn't
want to tolerate anymore
what they've been tolerating for years
the murder of George Floyd is not that
unusual the things like that that
happened for a long time but the public
has mostly been kind of quiet in fact
it's very interesting to look closely
the closest analog to what's happening
today in the United States is 1992 I
don't know if you know about it but a a
black man Rodney King was practically
beaten to death
by Los Angeles police he went went to
try they went to trial and they were
acquitted that led to a huge uprising in
Los Angeles went on for over a week 60
people were killed now the federal
federal troops were called out to try to
suppress it there wasn't much of a
reaction in the rest of the country it's
very different from what happened now
now there's been an enormous reaction
all over the country
Chiefs of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that
top military officers in the country
have come out supporting the protesters
that's utterly without precedent and
it's the result of organized activist
efforts to bring to bring about a change
in public opinion which has happened not
over the entire country by any means but
over significant parts of it that's how
things change it's not enough to want it
you have to do something about it
okay so this is what actually activism
is like right can we call it as activism
and can we say that BDS and such
movements like Jewish Voice for Peace
are organized effective moments the idea
of boycott and divestment there aren't
any sanctions a boycott and divestment
was actually initiated in 1997 by an
Israeli group worried of Neriah a very
fine journalist a militant peace
activist he and his group goo Shalom
peace group initiated a boycott
divestment program aimed at the occupied
territories was pretty successful it's
picked up pretty broadly even the
Presbyterian Church one of the main
churches in the country supports boycott
and divestment for the occupied
territories they go on to call for
divestment from US corporations who were
involved in any way
in the occupied territories that's a
very viable proposal it could lead to
real consequences
then came the BDS movement initiated by
Omar equity in Palestine picked up all
over it's different it does mention the
occupied territories but it insists on
policies which are self-destructive it
insists on say academic boycotts of
Israel
Sergi Colton you can make an argument
for it but if you're an activist who
thinks about consequences you ask what's
going to happen if I call for an
academic boycott in Israel perfectly
obvious to be a huge backlash you'll be
accused of total hypocrisy with some
justice why don't you have a boycott on
Harvard and MIT and Chicago they're
engaged much worse policies no source
and what happens is the discussion
shifts away from Palestinian rights to
issues of academic freedom hypocrisy and
so on a net loss for Palestinians the
same with the second of the BDS
proposals they have three one is
occupied territories one is a boycott of
Israel until it ends over repression
which simply turns the topic to other
issues and least charges of hypocrisy
forget the Palestinians the third is an
insistence on return of Palestinians
okay that's a loser there is never going
to be return of all the refugees
everyone knows who the PLO knows they
knew it in the 1950s when they were
talking about symbolic return
recognition of the right of return but
not fully implementing it but the BDS
movement insists on implementing select
calling for one state so losing it's not
going to happen nobody supports it well
it does is open charges of anti-semitism
opens laws which ban the BDS movement so
then they go to fight the laws everybody
forgets the Palestinians okay the BDS
movement is well intentioned it's my
friends you know like them I argue with
them but the tactics are designed to be
suicidal
and that's exactly what we've seen what
we need is a popular movement which will
pay attention to the consequences of
what you do which will be committed to
to developing tactics which will benefit
the victims not tactics that make me
feel good tactics that benefit the
victims and that would be essentially
the kind that the hurry of narrowing
movement started in 1997 that the church
picked up that many European countries
are followed focused on the occupation
there you have a very strong case no
deviation to other issues enormous
international support know plenty of
public support you can really achieve
results so I think if a movement
solidarity movement develops which
concentrates on that picks up the kind
of topics I mentioned which the BDS
movement ignores because they're not
part of the official program they keep
to their official program they don't do
the kinds of things that could be
effective but if a movement develops
that does carry out effective tactics I
think ok thank you so much it was really
expressed you know okay I think you're
running out of time so I'd like to ask
discussion this is the question that we
were asking to all the speakers that
we're posting all participants here are
working on the israeli-palestinian
conflict we have journalists in here and
a group of researchers young academics
and volunteers from our Jerusalem
research platform and what advice would
you give to those who are considering to
focus their research on the conflict on
the israeli-palestinian issue we'd like
to hear your advices didn't understand
the question
okay so what would you what would be
your
to Isis to the young academics who like
yep my advice is to move to become an
activist who tries to change things but
to understand some principles of
activism there's one a central principle
that has to be kept in mind there's a
distinction between tactic work
sometimes called do good tactics and
feel-good tactics you can take tactics
that make you feel good saying look what
I'm doing
isn't it wonderful I feel real good
about it there are other kind of tactics
that help the victims
that's much harder the feel-good tactics
are easy but pointless they divert
attention to what has to be done the do
good tactics are hard but they're what
matter that's true in Israel Palestine
it's true in everywhere else let's take
the protests in the United States right
now if you take a close look you'll
notice that black organizers and black
activists are trying to direct the
protests to peaceful nonviolent protest
that means they're opposing a lot of
young white activists who are angry and
want to break windows and shout at the
police and so on that's the difference
between do good and feel good tactics
may make you feel good to break a window
and to scream at the police but that
increases the strength of the
reactionary forces that are supporting
racism so if you want to support the
right wing do it straight out don't
pretend you're not even racist or
anti-fascist you're not what the black
organizers are doing is saying we want
progress for ourselves we don't care if
you feel good we want things to be
better and for ourselves
and there's overwhelming evidence that
peaceful protests lead the progress
violent protests lead to regression to
overwhelmingly been true the reasons are
pretty obvious violent protests are much
easier it's much easier to break a
window than to engage in peaceful
protests but that distinction has to be
kept in mind on every issue it's hard
but important it's true and
israel-palestinian as we were just
discussing drew on this issue through an
every other issue you have to ask what
are the consequences of my actions gonna
be in particular what are the
consequences there is the victims you
mentioned something really important
actually it's reminded me a code that
you were saying in your on Palestine
book you were saying that we have to
consider what Palestinians actually want
instead of what we actually want so this
is something that we don't really think
about because everyone is trying to find
its own solution instead of asking two
Palestinians themselves instead of
looking at looking to the victims so
make there are so many questions I don't
think that we will be able to help them
certainly but maybe you'd like to say
something on this like why is it so
important to think about the victims and
why we have to consider what they
actually wants in the path which is
leading us to the solution
well what Palestine want and they have
every right to wanted is a solution for
all of Palestine in which there is
justice and equality for everyone no
discrimination the cooperation mutual
aid and so on and that's not an
impossibility but it can only come in
stages
it's not gonna come by just snapping
your fingers things don't happen that
way has to come and stages that can be
achieved now there is one stage that can
be achieved since 1975 when Palestinian
nationalism became a major issue about
the only thing that can be achieved in
the short term is some viable two-state
settlement
it's a terrible settlement I think it's
awful but it's the one that can be
achieved and it can be the basis for
moving on if the cycle of violence
hatred anger declines normal relations
among human beings will overcome them in
fact that's happened every time there
were periods of peace that people
started Jews from Israeli Jews would
cross into the occupied territories for
commerce or see friends or something
peaceful relations among people just
begin to develop that sooner or later
everyone will realize that it makes
absolutely no sense to draw a line
through the former Palestine and say we
don't talk to each other that's harmful
to everybody so I think the borders will
slowly erode and they will lead through
a possibility of moving on moving on
perhaps to a bi-national Federation
Federation of two states which can then
erode still further we've seen plenty of
examples of that in the past furthermore
we should not worship the imperial
borders the borders between say Israel
and Lebanon were imposed by Imperial
violence French and British violence no
reason to worship that because your
personal incident back in the early
1950s I was living for a while on a cute
in Israel no I was young then your age I
went hitchhiking in the north and I
while I was hitching with one evening I
was hitchhiking and just want you know
hiking in the North a Jeep came in a
road behind me a guy got out of it and
yelled at me he said come back in Hebrew
you need to come back here in the wrong
country
I had wandered into Lebanon because
there was no border the border is
totally artificial of course now it's an
armed camp but that's as a result of
what's happened in the recent years and
it can erode I think in time it can be
recognized that it makes no sense to
divide the Galilee into two different
areas there one unit that border if any
road and it's in that context that there
might be some hope for real significant
return of refugees so if you're
interested in return of refugees I think
that's the long-term hope that you
should look for but you can't get these
things just by saying I want them so
let's have them you have to ask how can
I move step by step towards achieving my
objectives and what are the tactics that
will lead to it that's the way to get
some results on any issue then in
particular on this one
exactly thank you so much which I accept
a few more questions or should we end
the session here you have to leave have
another interview coming up ok thank you
