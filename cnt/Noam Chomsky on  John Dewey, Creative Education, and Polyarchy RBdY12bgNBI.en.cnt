we we only have just a minute left
unfortunately but one of the quotes that
you referred to as John Dewey in your
miss education book and I'll just read
it the ultimate aim of production is not
production of goals or goods I'm sorry
but the production of free human beings
associated with one another on terms of
equality could you just maybe end with a
few comments about that well general do
it was the leading American social
philosopher was well served by our
standards pretty radical I mean he I
think his position is correct Bertrand
Russell took very similar positions and
yes at decent education ought to be
creating free independent creative human
beings it doesn't have to be developing
them has to be allowing them to follow
those natural instincts there's a
natural among children the educational
system has to beat it out of them and
make from obedient and subordinates on
but a decent educational system would be
would allow these natural aspects of
human nature to flourish and encourage
them and it would be part of developing
a free and democratic society of real
participation but of course that runs
counter to elite interests the worth
remembering that the United States was
not founded to be a Democratic Society
and elites do not want it to be a
Democratic Society it's supposed to be
what political scientists on Pensacola
polyarchy system basically have a leak
decision and public gratification and if
you had the kind of educational system
that do we spend his life committed to
you wouldn't be able sustainment where
people would become active involved
engaged and we try to create a truly
functioning democratic society which
would as do we also pointed out require
industrial democracy that means
democratizing production Commerce and so
on which means eliminating the whole
structure of capitalist hierarchy his
positions were he's very mainstream Main
Street America but radical from the
point of view of prevailing doctor and I
think he's quite right about that in
fact there just to go to politics are
doing also pointed out there until wax
done unless that's done politics will
remain what he called the shadow cast by
business over society and the
educational system will be a system of
indoctrination control I was lucky as a
kid to be sent to a do at school and it
was quite quite an exciting experience
and I'm that now we have to wrap up that
thank you very much
