I noam chomsky thank you for joining us
today we would so in the 1960s you
published American power new mandarins
with a piece on resistance you've lived
more than half your life since you
originally wrote that curiosity in your
experience since then has anything
happened that has changed your alter
your conclusions from that the probe has
changed of course the conclusions change
but nothing fundamental as far as the
principles are concerned I mean that was
a time when I thought direct resistance
made good deal of sense and was involved
in fact by the time that article came
out of already didn't had been an organ
of trying to organize national tax
resistance for years and had been
involved in the resistance movement and
so on at the time it seemed to be
accessible undertaking a moment I don't
think it's worth with my own tactical
judgment is no would make much sense and
so they I don't rigidly trust my
tactical judgments that usually won't
have to do which can in principle I
can't imagine why anybody would question
whether your non-violence the right
approach I'm there may be times when
that Chris was be overridden but you
really have to have a priest nor
ornament for violence in what the
circumstance all right oh the you know
the sort of baseline is sure nonviolent
what I'm curious what then I guess is
how do you reconcile your sympathies
with the anarchist position with the
history of anarchism which was Spanish
revolution and Ukraine where there was a
lot of violence that was used you know
and don't take the Spanish revolution I
was told I mean there was violence of
course elected their preschool
like this but for the most part not loud
that the anarchist peasants took over
the land rat themselves anarchism horse
liniment or the factories and random
otherwise violence with substantial
amount wizards of self-defense so you
think he is they defended what they had
taken over but there is a tree the
street of violence you know propaganda
the deeds go already tradition but
that's not the name tradition and this
clown sir itself I'm see anybody right
you've said also that you do not concern
yourself a pacifist so where you kind of
draw the line between my pacifism it
pacifist is somebody who is always
opposed to violence no matter what the
circumstance he said so I understand
passively and I accept that principle I
think there are times when bronze is
justified has a strong justification so
there's a big burden proof t-bear
actually David Reynolds
the resisters league true pacifist
organization and once described me as a
fellow traveler I mean I agree with them
on almost every particular thing
principle right right so i know that you
supported um the America entering like
against Germany in World War two and
probably the Spanish fighting off
fascists the enemy's finals you know
kids but I so true commander woolrich
earlier so is it relegated to war and
not like internal social change it
couldn't for example suppose that that's
the concrete the Obama administration
which actually owns the auto industry is
pursuing the earlier policies of
dismantling plants that this family the
planet doesn't just limit the plan it
destroys the workforce their lines their
etchants the community you know the
families it's a big act I'll suppose the
workers do what I think they ought to do
take over the plant and start running it
themselves get enough support from the
outside to a federal government we can
change the government to give them the
funding that's required for converting
that can be done during Second World
Order if it was massive conversion of
industry huge to work on production was
extremely successful us industrial
production almost quadruple biggest
economic growth
so I think it could be done well
supposedly did that and there was a riot
attempt by former owners to prevent it
the violence of legitimate self-defense
right they even pick clothing thanks I
question on that I was actually curious
because when I understand Roosevelt had
instituted a lot of you know kind of big
government spending social spending
through the Tennessee Valley Authority
and stuff like that are trying to
stimulate the economy which didn't
really work that well and then once they
enter go to us he started military
kinkiness whatever they just like with
Nazi Germany the economy that helped
boost the economy back again well it
seems to have an aunt Ida progressive
message why is it that military spending
stimulating the economy more than the
ranks Bowman because it was more I'm in
the early the early New Deal the
dealings are right away but there was a
lot of purpose workers activism sit-down
strikes and so as I guess the New Deal
legislation got enacted including some
stimulative efforts and they work and
work massively that they were working
then in my case it was nineteen
thirty-seven the the Roosevelt
administration backed off
the deficit hawks cream in the as we now
call them sort of cold off the stimulus
and then I went back in the depression
and then it started to pull out again
afterwards when they started spending
again then came to war as fittings
essentially I've lived you know the US
end of the world that credible that but
it had stimulated the economy and that
was overcome just by substantial growing
economy so the fact is the stimulus work
Santa Nazi tyranny as you say actually
Nazi Germany in many ways less the
interesting discussion of this by the
economics are in Germany Albert Speer in
his memoirs he or is basically that none
of the reasons germany lost the war was
that it was not as totalitarian it's the
United States and England in the United
States and England the populations were
committed to the more so they didn't
have to be bought off they were
voluntarily committing themselves to war
the wage and price controls that Rosie
the Riveter
hard work and so on and it really worked
Germany they don't never really trusted
the population so they had the kind of
fight with me some possible with guns
and butter would I am off so that they
stay Placid and he argues that that held
back the German war effort buddy I don't
remember it he's a fearsome well if he's
right about that that might have swung
the war a Germany was technologically
much more advanced than the west of the
West Weston went Russians recently won
the war but just by sheer mass you know
not not by technological admit but not
even by military come wit of
battles were more or less equal
terminals always one but just sheer mass
ground of down and tore at the end the
Germans were beginning to use v2 rockets
which could have had a devastating
impact if it had been stopped by
conquest basic social shares right and
booze let's say another year what the f
comfortable but as far as the
stimulative measures were when the went
they they seem to work in fact it's true
right now to the obama administration
made a pretty small stimulus but had
some effect you know original
office estimates a couple of million
jobs not gained but not lost it's the
point right however the if you look at
the whole stimulus government's didn't
it was actually flat because that's the
government the federal stimulus slightly
increased the state and local stimulus
decline and it was just a study by one
of the National
