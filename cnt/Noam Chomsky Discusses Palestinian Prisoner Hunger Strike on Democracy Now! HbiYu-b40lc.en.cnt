eise report I'm Amy Goodman today we
spend the hour with world-renowned
political dissident linguist author Noam
Chomsky I interviewed him last week here
in New York at the 45th anniversary
celebration of nakhla the North American
Congress on Latin America Chomsky was
this year's winner of the latin america
peace and justice award nakhla said they
gave him the honor because quote
Chomsky's work has influenced
generations of concerned citizens who
are committed to social justice in the
Americas also honored was the Mexican
poet Javier cecilia who founded the
movement for peace with justice and
dignity after his son was murdered last
year in the drug war in Mexico visit
democracynow.org for our two-part
interview with the renowned Mexican poet
Cecilia noam chomsky is author of more
than a hundred books most recently
occupy he is Institute professor of
emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology where he's taught for more
than half a century I began our
interview by asking Noam Chomsky about
the approximately 2000 Palestinian
prisoners who have been on hunger strike
since April seventeenth representatives
of the prisoners have reportedly reached
a tentative agreement with Israel that
could end the strike many of the
Palestinian prisoners are being held by
Israel without charge under a procedure
known as administrative detention the
strikes intended to pressure Israeli
prison authorities to end the use of
solitary confinement and he's a wide
range of restrictions we did the
interview in a courtyard outside a
building at New York University I asked
professor Chomsky to comment on the
Palestinian hunger strike among the many
atrocities going on in a occupied
territories one of them is
administrative detention and another is
very harsh
a punitive prison conditions administer
Israel acknowledges several hundred
prisoners under administrative detention
this is basically no inspection so we
don't know some of them is in there for
years the that means no charge is just a
suspected of something and locked up
some of them over over again and the
hunger strikes are protest against these
violations of elementary human human
rights and of law in fact overall the
situation in the west bank and gaza gaza
remains a prison it's completely under
siege i'm in egypt has opened up a
little of the border so there's some and
free up and back but basically it's the
same system for you they can't export
to produce a candidate alive economy the
Israeli Navy pretty much bars fishing
the place is nothing can be
reconstructed because skippering in
construction material there is in fact
wealth through the tunnel system but
which has enriched have lots of nerves
if you want to call them that it's a
small sector of the population but most
of them are living and under kind of a
forced hunger strike the way Israeli
officials put it a couple years ago is
pretty accurate you don't want to kill
them all it feels look good but we'll
keep him on a diet so just a survival
level very young populations and no
future can't get out it's in a way now
like the refugee caption Lebanon which
is
do not support your transfers but the
the hopelessness and the scent when you
go through them you see kids playing in
these there's you saying you know
they're going to be there all their
lives and their children are going to be
there all their lives now never get out
that's what guys is like the west bank
is being the US and Israel have a plan
they're slowly implementing it
systematically take over whatever is
value in the West Bank and it's clear
what it is it was in a secret see now
the structure has been entirely obvious
distress step by step so you take over
everything within the engine X
alternately the illegal annexation the
color separation wall actually
annexation wall that includes much of
the arable land water resources that the
pleasant suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel
Aviv someone's take that over take over
the Jordan Valley where Palestinians are
being slowly driven out them Israeli
settlements are being built and you know
hundreds of wills or being sunk and so
on more arable land that officially
prisons what's left and in the regions
left
over half is essentially Israeli
territory area see the Palestinians
virtually no access to it and there are
salience cut through personal Jerusalem
itself is far larger than person ever
was and it's been annexed illegally of
course even in violation of security
council orders so this is vastly
expanded very personal juice Jerusalem
to the east of that is a salient going
to town founded in the seventies the
name they constructed under Clinton when
the 90 small doesn't mean its borders
reach virtually Jericho I bisects the
West Bank and if you go further north
for a couple of other Syrians which cut
what's left into unviable Canton's with
the aerial sure ruined the architect is
a policy d honestly he called the banter
stance which is not quite accurate
because South Africa relied on the black
labor so they took care of the bamboo
stance
that's just kind of a slave owners fair
slave you're kind of capital you got it
keep going let them reproduce and so on
and I also hope that the bantha stance
would be recognized by other countries
so that sort of more or less justifiable
it Israelis happily no interest in the
Palestinians now they can you know if
they disappear that's just fine so
they're kind of left in these cations
there's major infrastructure project at
project development summing and Israeli
or an American tourist and go from st.
Malo I mean to Tel Aviv superhighways no
Palestinian to the first maybe you see a
man over the go up in the distance the
landscape but that's the direction it's
moving so what do you think needs to
happen actually happen is very
straightforward there are a lot of
complex problems in the world where it's
hard to think of the solution Aleksei
Kashmir or eastern Congo try to figure
out a solution it's not so easy Ezra
Palestine it's transparent there's been
a overwhelming international consensus
for about 35 years on a the basic
structure of the settlement to state
settlement international border
its freedom 67 border out of maybe some
to use official US terminology when the
US was still part of the world back in
the early seventies with minor and
mutual adjustment so straighten out the
ceasefire line and then various
arrangements made for other issues
that's the basic structure actually that
came to the UN Security Council in 1976
it was brought by the major Arab states
vetoed by the United States to again in
1980 won't run through the rest of the
story but had been consistent barring of
a political settlement by us rejection
and until that changes nothing much is
gonna change so what do you think of the
BDS movement the boycott divestment
sanctions movement I think we yes sir
valuable tactic the little cautious when
it comes to be a movement it's a
personality back to South Africa BDS was
used and used effectively but there was
never a BDS movement
a movement begins to mean we've got a
plan and a commitment principles you
have to adhere to reapply the tactics
without considering the consequences and
so on I'm BDS is a tactic can be very
effective and in the case of South
Africa you take a look it was effective
and targeted so for example there was no
boycott of universities but there were
program boycotts as far as they had
racial hiring practices there were lots
of sports teams for the same reason that
also it's important to remember that
we've got divestment sanctions began
significantly in the case of South
Africa after decades of preparation by
the time these tactics again they've no
no support for apartheid anywhere in the
world congress was passing sanctions
legislation the UN had imposed an arms
embargo if a few looked through the 80s
this when they tactics reviews the
Reagan administration had to violate
congressional sanctions in order to keep
supporting South Africa as it did and
it's interesting to remember why the
United States supported South Africa was
part of the war on terror George Bush
didn't start the war declared the war on
terror he really cleared it reagan
declared it 1981 very
an open that nobody likes to talk about
it because of the cars that emerged but
true 1988 for example the African
National Congress Mandela's and see was
declared to be one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world so he
naturally had to support white
nationalists against this horrible
terrorist course it was 1988 by that
time overwhelming opposition to report
and in fact the US policy did change in
the next couple of years when US policy
changed the system collapsed what came
out of it is not very beautiful by any
means but at least apartheid collapsed
but and that could happen in this case
to infect for you know nadella himself
was just removed from the terrorist list
about two years ago he can help come the
United States without special
dispensation professor Noam Chomsky will
continue the discussion with him as he
addresses WikiLeaks the militarization
of police in the United States and
historical significance of Occupy Wall
Street but he'll begin by talking about
President Obama in a moment
