the United Steelworkers which is one of
the more progressive unions has recently
made some tentative arrangements with
Mondragon in the Basque Country this
huge and worker owned industrial banking
housing school educational cooperative
that could get somewhere and I mentioned
gar alperovitz this work he's discussed
very well the end of participate sand
the spread of worker owned enterprises
in mostly northern Ohio the old rust
bill they have a kind of an interesting
history and which it relates very much
to this back in 1977 at the beginning of
the concerted effort to destroy
industrial production in the United
States and sort of the beginning of the
kind of neoliberal assault on the
population we've been through in the
past generation a US Steel decided to
close its main steel plants in
Youngstown Ohio it was a steel town like
other working-class towns like Detroit
it had actually been built by the
working classes was their town they
didn't get the profit because there are
tools but they built it they wanted to
keep it
US Steel wanted to sell it they to close
it down and the Union offered to buy it
they had community support they even had
some support of I think it was a
Republican governor just bought let the
workers by the plant and keep running it
well you I still didn't want that in
fact this is consistent
I mentioned David Armand before he's one
has written about it and worked on it
very commonly around here to eastern
Massachusetts when workers decide to try
to take over an enterprise maybe an
enterprise which may be perfectly
profitable but not profitable enough for
the multinational who you know who runs
it maybe they don't want to keep in
their books when they try to buy it
which would be a good deal for the
multinational they refuse to sell it
for class reasons they have class
interests they do not want to see the
spread of popular democratic
organizations for perfectly obvious
reasons this just happened and I said
going but I'll come back to Youngstown
in a minute but it just happened a
couple of years ago right here and
Taunton there was a small but quite
successful manufacturing plant made
specialized parts for aircraft doing
pretty well but the multinational didn't
want to bother with it
so they were going to close it down the
Union you know UE in this case I tried
to buy it
multinationals usually refused to sell
it and there wasn't enough support
popular support to push it through if
there had been an Occupy movement at
that time real I think that's something
they might have pushed through actually
on a much larger scale a couple of years
ago Obama virtually nationalized the
auto industry not entirely but virtually
there were a couple of options that one
option was to restructure it use
taxpayer funding hand it back to the
original owners or other people just
like them maybe a different face but you
know bankers CEOs and so on and then
have it continue to do what it had been
doing before building cars that's what
they chose there was another option I
hand it over to the workforce have them
build what's needed in the country which
is not more cars for traffic jams but
high-speed mass transportation the
United States is very backward in the
world in this respect I mean you can
take a high-speed train from Beijing to
COS office Don but try to take a train
from Boston to New York it's about as
slow as it was 60 years ago this you
know this is really back where the
country needs it
and the the former auto industry could
have been handed over to the workforce
and given may be given some support
they're probably less than the auto
industry got to do this but that wasn't
an option suppose there had been a
large-scale Occupy movement you know
significant it was significant but
broader expanded well I think that could
have been pushed through takes popular
consciousness they're going back to
Youngstown the case went to court in
1977 the Union Union lost workers lost
and it was the steel mills were
destroyed but they didn't give up they
didn't just say ok we'll starve to death
or go somewhere else oh they began to
organize small the worker owned
enterprises and they've been spreading
around the Cleveland area and good
Youngstown good bit of northern Ohio
into other areas so it is taking place
but you know it's it's happening
elsewhere too in northern Mexico there
are quite successful worker owned plants
it's not easy because you know the banks
don't like to give them capital and the
government doesn't like them and won't
support them again for class reasons but
if the sufficient popular support these
things can develop
