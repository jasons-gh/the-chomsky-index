the problems of society are in a
substantial part moral problems but only
in the sense that when we plan our
actions we try to change things or
whatever we're doing it in terms of the
of some kind of moral values we ought to
be as clear about that as we can some
conception of what's right for people
and so on and good to be clear about
that
but beyond that I don't know where to go
I mean I think these subjects are too
intellectually thin for deep analysis to
carry us very far you work pretty much
by instinct and intuition I think that
most people tend to agree on these
instincts and intuition is when you sort
of clear away a lot of ideological cover
and if you can you want to work with
other people about it or clarify your
ideas or whatever you want to find that
level at which you have agreement about
moral values and then ask yourself
rational questions like given those
moral values and given the way society
actually is what should I be doing to
make it adapts better to those moral
values that's being you know responsible
human being whether it's in a small area
like the family or a big area like
