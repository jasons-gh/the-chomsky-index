we begin today's show with Noam Chomsky
the world renowned political dissident
linguist author and Institute professor
emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology where he's taught for more
than half a century Noam Chomsky has
penned more than a hundred books Noam
Chomsky spoke at the New York Public
Library along with former greek Finance
Minister Yanis varoufakis who will join
us in a minute in our studio during the
event Noam Chomsky was asked about
Bernie Sanders run for the White House
well Bernie Sanders is a extremely
interesting phenomenon he's decent
honest person and it's pretty unusual in
the he's considered radical and
extremist which is a pretty interesting
characterization because he's basically
a mainstream New Deal Democrat his
positions would not have surprised
President Eisenhower who said in fact
that anyone who does not accept New Deal
programs doesn't belong in the American
political system that's now considered
very radically the other interesting
aspect of Sanders is positions is that
they're quite strongly supported by the
general public and have been for a long
time that's true on taxes it's true on
health care so takes a health care his
his proposal for a national healthcare
system meaning the kind of system that
just about every other developed country
has at half the per capita cost of the
United States and comparable or better
outcomes that's considered very radical
but it's been the position of the
majority of the American population for
a long time so if you go back say to the
Reagan right
for example latest polls about 60% of
the population favored when Obama have
put through the Affordable Care Act
there was you recall a public option but
that was dropped it was dropped even
though it was supported by about almost
two-thirds of the population they go
back earlier say to the Reagan years
about 70% of the population thought that
national health care should be in the
Constitution because it's such an
obvious right
and in fact about 40% of the population
thought it was in the Constitution again
because it's such an obvious right and
at the same strong Tax Policy and others
so we have this phenomenon where someone
is taking physicians that would have
been considered pretty mainstream during
the Eisenhower years that are supported
by a large part often a considerable
majority of the population but his
dismissed as radical and extremist
that's an indication of how the spectrum
has shifted to the right during the
neoliberal period so far to the right
that the contemporary Democrats are
pretty much which used to be called
moderate Republicans and the Republicans
are just off the spectrum they're not a
legitimate parliamentary party anymore
and Sanders has the the significant part
of he has pressed the mainstream
Democrats a little bit towards the
progressive side you see that in Clinton
statements but he has mobilized a large
number of young people these young
people who are saying look we're not
going to consent anymore and if that
turns into a a continuing organized
mobilized mobilized force that could
change the country maybe not for this
election but at the longer term
that was Noam Chomsky the world-renowned
