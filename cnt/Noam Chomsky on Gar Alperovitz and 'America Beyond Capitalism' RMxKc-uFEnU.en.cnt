I was wondering if you'd read gar
alperovitz book America beyond
capitalism and if if you have what you
thought of his ideas in the book could
you repeat the title and author of the
book please i'm hamid either I was
wondering if he'd read gar alperovitz
America beyond capitalism okay and what
he thought of our that's very important
book and the work that he's doing that's
described there it is extremely
important that's one of the things that
can be done is very feasible that the
book reviews work fidel pair of it's
mainly has been involved in for some
years in trying to develop worker owned
enterprises mostly in ohio it took off
in Ohio for very interesting reasons and
I guess it was 1977 the as part of this
change in the socio-economic policy that
I was discussing so the US Steel
Corporation decided to close down its
operations in Youngstown Ohio the
Youngstown is a steel town it was built
by and around thee you know the steel
industry the working people the
community were extensively involved in
steel production and all that everything
that flows off of it manufacturing
plants wands all sorts of other things
so it was a steel town US Steel decided
to sell it off kill the town instead of
just giving up the workers in the
community were called the stakeholders
offered to buy the plant and run it
themselves that could have been done
with enough public support it could have
happened these were not Oh
issues at the time that way it didn't go
to court the court think the Union took
the case to court to try to get the
right to do it they lost in the court
but they could have won and it could
have been carried forward well so it was
a kind of defeat but like a lot of
defeats it wasn't the end of the story
it was the basis for moving on to
something else
and what it spawned was a lot of much
smaller scale efforts to establish
worker owned enterprises a lot of it's
called the Cleveland mob a lot of them
around Cleveland and other parts of Ohio
which are not huge enterprises but
there's a lot of them alperovitz miss
book reviews all of this you can look at
it for details and these are notice
worker owned that short of worker
managed that would be another step
towards liberation but it's real and
it's a way of reacting to the kind of
collapse of the productive system for
the 99% by just taking it over actually
if you take a look at standard texts and
business economics
you know nothing radical standard texts
and business economics and point out
that there's a no economic principle or
any other principle that says that
corporations should be controlled by
shareholders the shareholders
incidentally doesn't mean somebody who
you know whose pension fund has $2 of
theirs in the as a share that that
shareholders are very narrowly
concentrated shareholdings like top 1%
of the popular
most of it and that means big banks
interlocking directorates and so on
there's no economic principle that says
they're the ones who should determine
investment policy like just shipping
production to Foxconn there's no law of
economics incident that should happen it
could just as well be done by
stakeholders by the workforce of the
community perfectly consistent with
anything that anyone claims about
economic theory well you know there's no
reason for say the Occupy movement to be
less imaginative and ambitious than
standard business texts so yes
stakeholders could take over at parts of
the economy that are being dismantled
that run them effectively and direct
them to different purposes these are
very feasible tasks so for example one
of the things that Obama's praised for
by the kind of less liberal economists
Paul Krugman and others is for having
essentially nationalized the auto
industry and reconstructed it that's
pretty much what happened well what's
the auto industry was nationalized which
is simply what happened there were
alternatives one alternative was to
reconstruct it and hand it back to the
essentially the original owners not the
same names but same class same banks and
so on but that's what was done another
possibility would have been
and the auto industry over to the
workforce and the communities the
stakeholders and redirected towards
things that the country really needs not
only badly need high-speed rail for
example it's a you know it's a kind of a
shameful situation when you compare it
the US and other countries in much
poorer country and it would be a
tremendous economic benefit than that
it's the human benefit in all kinds of
respect means I could have got here in
two hours instead of wasting time at the
airport for example literally two hours
I happen to be in France a couple of
months ago giving talks the last time I
get it wasn't southern France and I had
to get from having yellow and southern
friends to the airport to go Airport and
of course is praying that goes directly
to the airport
it took two hours it's the same distance
as Washington the boss thinks better
what eight hours or something but all of
this isn't these are human costs they're
economic costs the things the country
badly needs the skilled workforce at the
in the auto industry could easily be it
could be reconverted to producing things
like this and other things and people
need that could be done under the
ownership and management of the
workforce and the communities well that
was an alternative that getting back to
Carl Herbet this is the kind of thing
talked about that particular case but
it's the kind of case that's coming up
all the time and these are very feasible
things they're not far out in Utopia
but- a big affect on the society and all
fairness is one of the very few people
is really doing very good work on this
book it's certainly worth the reading
thinking about what it describes whether
what options it suggests but this comes
up all the time I should say like
enforcement like living Boston there's
that a year ago this in a suburb of
Boston upon the manufacturing town there
was there was a reasonably successful
high-technology small manufacturing
plant that was producing equipment
high-tech equipment for aircraft and
they apparently were doing ok but they
weren't making enough profit for the
managers in the multinational
corporation who owned them so the
corporation wanted to just dismantle it
out of the Union you know I didn't
lecture over workers wanted to buy the
operation to just run it themselves
well they the corporation wouldn't agree
I suspect that they wouldn't agree
mostly on class grounds it's kind of not
a good idea to let people own and manage
their own workplaces and get the wrong
idea anyhow whatever the reason it
didn't work but if say the Occupy
movement had been around and if it had
been active
energetic enough and had it reached out
sufficiently that's the kind of thing it
could have participated in and supported
then maybe gotten it over the edge well
that'd be important in maintaining say
manufacturing in Massachusetts and that
kind of thing goes on all the time these
are options that are all over the place
so I've been gar alperovitz by the way
he's also had a long distinguished
career starting with his book atomic
diplomacy about fifty years ago as here
at the University
