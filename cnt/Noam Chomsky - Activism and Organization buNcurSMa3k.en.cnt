I'm just an ordinary mum who's just
thinks in terms of I don't want to
someday be holding my grandchildren and
watching something horrible happen and
feel like I didn't do anything and I
mean it's obvious what what you're doing
and my question is on a practical level
where do you see the most practical
place to put your energy I mean tonight
I feel an overwhelming I feel like it's
too big it's too much to even make a
dent in the way things change is because
lots of people are working all the time
and you know they're working in their
communities in their workplace or
wherever they happen to be and they're
building up the basis for popular
movements which are going to make
changes that's the way everything has
ever happened in history you know
whether it was the end of slavery or
whether it was the Democratic
revolutions or anything you want you
name it that's the way it worked you get
a very false picture of this from the
history books in the history books
there's a couple of leaders
you know George Washington or Martin
Luther King or whatever and I don't want
to say that those people are unimportant
like Martin Luther King was certainly
important but he was not the civil
rights movement Martin Luther King can
appear in the history books cost lots of
people whose names you will never know
and his names are all forgotten than who
may have been killed and so on we're
working down in the south when you have
active activists and people concerned
and people devoting themselves and
dedicating themselves to social change
or issues or whatever then people like
me can appear and we can appear to be
prominent but that's not right because
somebody else is doing the work my work
whether it'll say giving hundreds of
talks a year or spending 20 hours a week
writing letters or writing books is not
directed to intellectuals and
politicians it's directed to what are
called ordinary people yeah and what I
expect from them is in fact exactly what
they are that they should try to
understand the world
and act in accordance with their decent
impulses and that they should try to
improve the world and many people are
willing to do that but they have to
understand in fact as far as I can see
in these things well I feel that I'm
simply helping people develop the
courses of intellectual self-defense
what did you mean by that such a course
I don't mean go to school because we're
not gonna get it there it means you have
to develop an independent mind and work
on it now it's extremely hard to do
alone the beauty of their system is it
isolate to everybody each person is
sitting alone in front of the tools
that's very hard to have ideas or
thoughts under those circumstances you
can't fight the world alone some people
canvass prayer the way to do it is
through organization so of course as an
intellectual self defence will have to
be in the context of political and other
organization and it makes sense I think
to look at what the institutions are
trying to do and to take that almost as
a key what they're trying to do is what
we're trying to combat if they're trying
to keep people isolated and separate and
you know and so on well we're trying to
the opposite we're trying to bring them
together so in your local community you
want to have sources of alternative
action people with parallel concerns
maybe differently focused but at the
core sort of similar values and a
similar interest in helping people or
not defend themselves against external
power and taking control of their lives
and you know reaching out your hand the
people who need it that's a common array
of concerns you can learn about your own
values and you can figure out how to
defend yourself and so on in conjunction
with others
