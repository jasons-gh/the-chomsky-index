not just so much of the developed world
but the American population has been
clamoring for action in fact support for
say the Kyoto Protocol is so
overwhelming that a majority of bush
voters thought that he supported it
because it's such an obvious thing to
support but there's a huge gap in the
United States between public policy and
public opinion not just on this issue a
huge range of issues so public opinion
is pretty much excluded from influence
on policy as a result even a very strong
support for the public does not enter
into policy choices on this or other
issues as far as the Bush administration
is concerned their position is the
familiar one of corporate executives
which is the sector of the population
that they represent an effect if you're
a CEO of a corporation
you don't pay much attention to what's
going to happen five years from now you
pay attention to the bottom line in the
next quarter that's going to determine
your salary or prestige you know the
power of your corporation and so on if
it turns out that the world is going to
collapse five years from now that's
somebody else's business
you
governments reflect the interests of
their populations and people of course
would like the world for their
grandchildren to live in so therefore
they have different points of view but
the very same individual as state
manager and as a human being and it may
have very different it may make very
different choices you can see this when
people drop out of office and they come
with the world from a different point of
view there are many such conflicts I
mean even though the government is
extremely closely linked to major
corporations in particular energy
corporations so the Bush administration
practically comes out of the energy
sector even though there's a very tight
linkage there are conflicts striking
conflicts when the same individuals say
Dick Cheney is representing corporate
interests or state interests and
sometimes it's almost comical just to
give a minor example which will take a
major example which illustrates it take
an impending war with Iran
the corporations are in favor of the
population is overwhelmingly opposed the
the energy corporations would be pleased
to enter into Iran and exploit its oil
resources but the US government won't
allow because it has a state interest
the state interest goes back to the
standard mafia-style of international
affairs
The Godfather does not accept
disobedience has to be punished and in
1979 Iran was disobedient they overthrew
a u.s. imposed tyrant who was a
centerpiece of us power in the region
and what's more they even put some
American hostages diplomats in prison so
therefore all of us Iranian history
which was horrible is eliminated and we
got to punish the Iranians for that the
u.s. immediately started supporting
Saddam Hussein's war against Iran
we're not with harsh sanctions and the
energy corporations can't break through
that even though the administration
comes straight from that sector in fact
there's more dramatic cases that takes
at Cuba the US has been punishing Cuba
for Cubans not Cuba people of Cuba for
forty five years because of what
internal documents call successful
defiance they're successful defiance of
US policies going back to the monitor a
doctor
The Godfather does not accept that
successful defiance is intolerable
people have to be punished to ensure
that the they overthrow the government
that is defying the master the
population of the United States large
majorities want to establish diplomatic
relations with Cuba and the embargo and
the terror and so on and so forth it's
been for true for decades a lot of
business world wants to do the same
thing they see market opportunities and
particularly interesting is the oil
companies Texas oil companies George
Bush's background the Texas oil
companies want to exploit offshore Cuban
oil US government which comes right out
of that sector more allowed to do it
sometimes it reaches comic proportions
about a year ago there was a meeting in
Mexico between Cuban energy officials
and Texas oil company executives
including some of the big one big bigger
ones like Exxon Mobil The Washington
discovered that it was being held in a
Sheraton Hotel which is owned in the
United States and they ordered the hotel
to throw them out now here you have
George Bush and his friends coming out
of the Texas oil industry you have their
friends the Texas oil industry they're
trying to reduce US dependency on
foreign oil by exploiting close oil but
in his capacity or whoever makes the
decisions in their capacity as state
executives the u.s. is perfectly willing
to shoot themselves in the foot
to prevent a use of oil nearby to harm
their constituency in order to ensure
that successful defiance will not be
tolerated now any Mafia Don will
understand this and those kinds of
conflicts exist in the case of the
global warming for the the the real
constituency of the Bush administration
energy corporations multinationals and
so on they don't care that much what
happens in their capacity in those
institutions it doesn't matter if their
grandchildren don't have a world to live
in of course when they go home it
doesn't matter
but people act differently in
institutional frameworks
you
he's correct but it's far more general
I'm protects a LED it was known that
lead was poisonous by the early 1920s
they took 50 years in the United States
before he could get some legislation to
protect children from dying from lead
poisoning it was done you know facts
were known companies were keeping a lot
of it secret but most of it was known 50
years I take tobacco but it's never been
technically criminalized but there are
now alleged measures administrative
measures which make it difficult for
children to smoke it's been known for
decades that tobacco is far more lethal
than hard drugs comparably more lethal
but the major corporations and the media
which go along with them have held it
back might they say Europe I read
recently and an article of a book by
Hugh of Sean seed of British journalists
that the European Union subsidy for
tobacco industries is greater than the
amount of money the European Union
provides for alternative crops for
people growing coca that's supposed to
be one of the ways to stop drug
production provide them with alternative
crops they get less money for that then
the British tobacco companies and the
others get for poisoning people at a
level far beyond that of hard drugs well
you know those are the short-term
calculations of people whose
institutional role is to maximize profit
market share and power whatever they may
think you know move outside they may be
the nicest people in the world and I
remember once when the butcher of Lyon
was captured Klaus Barbie I finally
captured and he had worked for the Nazis
and then the Americans picked him up he
was doing exactly the same work for the
Americans and they finally spirited him
off to satellite in America was coming
embarrassing but he was finally picked
up he was taken to France he was going
to be tried I have to be listening to
the I think was probably National Public
Radio had an interview with his daughter
she said she didn't believe any of the
charges against him because he was the
nicest father in the world and he was
very loving the care of everybody in his
sweet guy and so on which i think is
probably perfectly true you can be one
thing at home and you can be something
else in an institutional role you can be
destroying the world and your
institutional role consciously
and loving your children at home
you
case after case of poison and
destruction and so on has this property
the same is true with what you began
with apocalypse soon which was not my
phrase it was Robert McNamara's sober
serious analysts warn of apocalypse soon
is correct we not seen unlike climate
change which we may be past the point
where we can solve it or maybe mitigated
but something Bad's going to happen the
case of nuclear war which is far more
dangerous I mean that's terminal
terminates of species we know what to do
how to solve it and it's not a mystery
the solution is understood but it's just
not interesting so we'll take the chance
of serious chance of apocalypse soon or
Armageddon of our own making as centers
and then put it because it's more
important to be able to shake our fist
at people
you
if you take in
course they teach you that a market
consumer market is based on informed
consumers make
