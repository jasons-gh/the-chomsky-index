a piece we feel like um that's the topic
that we're going to be talking about so
that's why we're doing that um first of
all honored absolutely honored
incredible you know my experience with
you and with the kind of ideas that you
present started in high school when I
saw a video called manufacturing consent
in my sociology class and what was
literally taken back just completely
kind of started things in new for me in
terms of thinking about systems of
governance and the way that you
presented it as a kind of misinformation
and then you know later on going down
like our universe via we're looking at
masumi and the news and without II and
then of course we kool and so I just
youtubed bucco and i found this debate
with you and him from some time ago and
was just completely taken back I mean
first of all he it was a very intense to
be and I think I've watched it other
times I don't have to tell you there's
with the postmodernist like to call a
subtext which you didn't see but the
Front's elders the moderator of the
debate that was it it was Dutch
anarchist and that was a period money
Dutch anarchists were carrying out quite
amusing actions to try to you know bet
they'd live which was sort of anger
everyone's like for example the lacing
they're going to fancy horse shows with
elephants and burgers and putting LSD in
the horses food so they start to
transfer
anyway once a fuoco is completely bald
and on the way to the studio plants
stopped at his apartment and he came
down carrying a bright red wig and
throughout the whole debate he had this
bright red wig on his lap and he kept
nudging fucose I put it on put it on I
was trying to keep her laughing and
these are the things you don't see I'm a
televised interview of course probably
not if you look carefully you might see
ya well sort of what I was interested
with that regard was you have an
acclaimed critique of the media the you
know general industrial complex has it
stands and I was wondering what are the
links between some of the challenges
that you presented to Coco and your
modern criticism of the media and so on
well fucose position exactly what he
believes i don't know but his official
position is that there's no issues have
right and wrong just questions of power
so if you listen to the discussion he
towards the end when he was in a kind of
a Maoist phase at that time when you the
issue came up about say proletarian
revolution and i think i asked him what
would you support it even if it was
wrong he said there is no such issue
it's just I'm on the side of the working
class of course I'd supported whatever
comes out but not with regard to the
media from his point of view at least as
I understood that there cannot be any
critique they have power now they're
part of the corporate system they're
supporting the corporate system that's a
job so you can describe it that there's
nothing to criticize about
there's no sense that there ought to be
some other duty and responsibility
against which you can evaluate what
they're in fact doing you could say the
same bat Goldman Sachs like they just
gave themselves 17 and a half billion
dollars of compensation after having
tanked the economy and being bailed out
by the taxpayer well you know there's
there's an ethical point of view from
which you can criticize that but if you
don't accept that there are ethical
standards independent of particular
power structures there's nothing to
criticize why shouldn't they rip off in
public truthfully and so I guess if
we're looking at it from that
perspective and just thinking about in
terms of the vehicle of delivery you
know you've got anonymous the hacker
group you get WikiLeaks now you've got
basically what amounts to a revolution
started by social media and the like the
internet and so on so how do those
structures then completely flip the
whole thing on its back they have a
mixed fact the internet and as you
probably know is developed right around
here under the military it was in the
hands of the military for decades and
national science foundation then
privatized and it's it's a it's a
powerful instrument but like other
technology is has you know the good side
and a bad side it depends how it's used
I'm it's a tremendous tool for research
for interaction for undercutting
concentrated authority it's also affect
it's an instrument of indoctrination so
for example if you if you want to become
a biologist and I was you asked me for
advice I wouldn't say go into the
Harvard biology library and read
everything that's not the way to become
a biologist but when people approach the
internet that's essentially the way
they're approaching it it's just a vast
store of
information disinformation sense
nonsense unless you have some framework
for inquiry and investigation it's
either meaningless or worse and in fact
it ends up being often a kind of a cult
generator for people who don't have a
serious framework for inquiry if
somebody wants to be a biologist it's
not enough just to walk into the Harvard
biology library have to know what your
lips where do you find out what you're
looking for well that comes from
interaction study the depth of inquiry
looking at the tradition so on and so
forth if that's lacking then the the
library or more generally the Internet
can just be way of misleading people so
it's got since both aspect and the same
is true of the social networking I think
this is a scene access how many can be
used effectively as it wasn't Potter
square it can be used at the other
extreme that I saw an article recently
about a Newman disease that's developing
among the teenage girls sleeplessness
because they sleep holding their cell
phones or whatever they are just in case
it 3am somebody will call and say you
know I just had a sandwich and they
don't want to miss that you know because
it's too important I can relate lately
okay a story about I have a friend who's
was a bombing pilot in the during the
Vietnam War and he was bombing northern
Laos which was one of the real horror
stories of the war was kind like a stone
age society they were wiping it out
mainly because i had the airplanes and
they know what to do it after the war he
sort of thought about what he'd been
doing had pangs of conscience anyway he
devoted the rest of his life to trying
trying to rebuild northern Laos and and
it is really a stone-age community
scattered they don't nothing yet one of
the he man she get a philanthropist to
put up a cell tone cellphone towers and
he got someone else to distribute sell
cell phones dead these are people you
know almost nothing you know I asked him
what do they do with him he said well
the first thing that happened was that
the teenage girls started talking to
each other and then other people sort of
got the idea and somebody would call his
friend in the next week just another
natural so I think its genetic
