there are conflicting values and taken
in isolation each of the that uses quite
legitimate so the value of preserving
human life or for that matter the life
of any organism that that is a value
that we should accept you shouldn't just
go arbitrarily kill some animal because
it's fun to kill it I that's a
reasonable value on the other hand most
people will agree to swat a mosquito
okay well that the idea that life is
should be valued has come into conflict
with another value and we know what that
one is and that's commonly the case the
values that we hold are not absolute
they are always contingent they conflict
and life is made up of decisions in
complicated situations in cases of
conflicting values if you listen to just
one in isolation yeah it may sound
legitimate and and maybe is but you have
to ask what it means under particular
conditions so choice is legitimate
preserving life is legitimate and
sometimes they run into conflict what's
really
