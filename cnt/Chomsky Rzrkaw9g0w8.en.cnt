good evening my name is Fred Newhouser
I'm the chair of the philosophy
department here at Barnard and I'm very
happy to welcome you tonight to Barnard
College and to this lecture by Noam
Chomsky sponsored by the Center for
Palestine studies at Columbia University
the last time I heard professor Chomsky
speak was in the mid-80s when I was a
graduate student here and if I remember
correctly the talk was held in this very
same room it's a little bit depressing
for me to think that his talk that
evening almost 30 years ago could have
borne the same title that his talk has
tonight which as you already know is
America and Israel Palestine war and
peace among other topics professor
Chomsky will address how the United
States is strategic alliance with Israel
affects the process of peace in the
Middle East and why the u.s. is so
involved in that region in the first
place our time tonight is very limited
and for that reason I'm going to forego
a long introduction we'll start right
off with Professor Chomsky's lecture
which will last perhaps 40 minutes and
that should leave us about 40 minutes
after that for questions and answers
before i turn the podium over to him i'd
like to just mention and recommend to
you one of his most recent books that's
directly relevant to the topic tonight
this book which is co-authored with Ilan
Pappe is called Gaza in crisis
reflections on Israel's war against the
Palestinians it's published by Haymarket
books and they're at the back of the
room and have plenty of copies of that
book and other books for sale if you'd
like to pick one up after the lecture I
think we'll just move right into
professor Trump's keys lecture I'm very
honored to present to you professor Noam
Chomsky
actually I didn't pick the title for
that book if I had I would have called
it the US war against the palace which i
think is more significant certainly for
us well a good place to start this
discussion is a useful concept that I'll
borrow from British diplomat a young
British diplomatic historian mark Curtis
and his important and i might add
therefore neglected works on post post
World War two British crimes of which
there are many he makes a distinction
between people and what he calls on
people on people are those who sort of
look human but are not considered worthy
of elementary human rights and that
happens to be very crucial distinction
for this topic come to it soon but just
first notice that the distinction is
ever-present so a couple about a week
ago the New York Times had a headline
saying the West celebrates a clerics
death the cleric was a lackey killed by
a drone wasn't just death it was
assassination and another step forward
in Obama's global assassination campaign
which actually breaks some new records
in international terrorism well it's not
true that everyone in the West
celebrated there were some critics
almost all of the critics of whom there
were many criticized the action or
qualified it because of the fact that
our Lackey was an American citizen that
is he was a person unlike suspects who
intentionally murdered or collateral
damage meaning we treat them kind of
like the ants we step on when we walk
down the street they're not American
citizens so they are unpeopled and
therefore they can be freely murder
that's it's some may remember if you
have good memories that there used to be
a concept in anglo-american law called a
presumption of innocence innocent until
proven guilty in a court of law that's
so deep in history that there's no point
even bringing it up but it did once
exist some of the critics have brought
up the Fifth Amendment the Constitution
which says that no person person notice
shall be deprived of life liberty or
property without due process of law so
of course that was never intended to
apply to persons so it wasn't intended
to apply to unpeopled and unpeopled fall
into several categories there's first of
all the indigenous population either in
the territories already held or those
that were expected to be conquered soon
it didn't apply to them and of course it
didn't apply to those who the
constitution declared to be three-fifths
human so therefore unpeopled that latter
category was transferred into
theoretically into the category of
people by the Fourteenth Amendment that
essentially the same wording as the
fifth amendment in this respect but now
the person was in
to hold of freed slaves that was in
theory in practice it barely happened
after about 10 years the category of
three-fifths human were returned to on
category one people by the device of
criminalization of black life which
essentially restored slavery maybe
something even worse than slavery if he
went on to the second world war and it's
being reinstituted now past 30 years of
severe moral and social regression in
the United States well the fourth
amendment amendment was recognized right
away to be problematic the concept of
person was both too narrow and too broad
and the courts went to work to overcome
both of those flaws the concept of
person was expanded to include legal
fictions sustained created and sustained
by the state what's called corporations
and it was also an era over the years to
exclude undocumented aliens that goes
right up to the present the recent
Supreme Court cases which make it clear
that the corporations not only our
persons but their persons with rights
far beyond those of persons of flesh and
blood so kind of super persons the
mislabeled free trade agreements give
them astonishing rights and of course
the court has added more but the crucial
need to make sure that the category one
people includes those who escaped from
the horrors we've created in Central
America and make
go try to get here those are not persons
their own people the and of course it
includes any foreigners especially those
accused of terror which is a concept
that has taken a quite an interesting
conceptual change an interesting one
since 1981 when ronald reagan came into
office and declared the Global War on
Terror was called a G white and current
fancy terminology I won't go into that
here except with a comment to note on
how the term is now used without any
grazing even any notice so take for
example Omar hotter is a 15 year old
child Canadian he was accused of a very
severe crime namely trying to defend his
village in Afghanistan from us invaders
obviously that's severe crime serious
terrorist so he was sent first to secret
prison in Bagram then off to Montana mo
for eight years after eight years he
pleaded guilty to some chargers that we
all know what that means if you want if
you would pick up a few of the details
even in Wikipedia more other sources so
he pleaded guilty and was given eight
more years a sentence could would have
gotten 30 more years and he hadn't
pleaded guilty after all it isn't severe
crime defending your village from
American aggressors his Canadian so
Canada could have him extradited but
with the typical courage they refused
they don't want to offend the master
understandably well the crime of
resisting aggression it's not a new
category of terrorism there may be some
of you old enough to remember the slogan
a terror against terror which was used
by the Gestapo in which we've taken over
the none of this arouses any interest
because all of these victims believe
belong to the category of unpeopled well
that coming back to our topic now the
concept of on people is central to
tonight's topic Israeli Jews are people
Palestinians are unpeopled and a lot
follows from that as clear illustrations
constantly so here's a clipping if I
remember to bring it from the New York
Times front page story Wednesday October
twelfth the lead story is deal with
Hamas will free Israeli held since 2006
it's gilad shalit and right next to it
as a running right across the top of the
front page is a picture of four women
kind of agonized over the fate of blood
shall eat friends and supporters of the
family of Staff Sergeant you let shall
eat received word of the deal with the
families protest tent in Jerusalem well
that's understandable actually I think
you should have been released a long
time ago but there's something missing
from this whole story so like there's no
pictures of Palestinian women on no
discussion in fact in the story of what
about the Palestinian prisoners being
released where do they come from and
there's a lot to say about that so for
example we don't know at least I don't
read it in the time
whether the release includes the
Palestinian the elected Palestinian
officials who were kidnapped and
imprisoned by israel in 2007 when the
United States the European Union and
Israel decided decided to dissolve the
only freely elected legislature in the
Arab world that's called democracy
promotion technically in case you're not
familiar with the term the so I don't
know what happened to them there are
also other people who've been in prison
exactly as long as you let shall eat in
fact one day longer the day before gilad
shalit was captured at the border
israeli troops entered gaza kidnapped
two brothers the wom our brothers
spirited them across the border and
violation of the Geneva Conventions of
course and they've disappeared into
Israel's prison system I'm clue what
happened to them I've never seen a word
about it and as far as I know nobody
cares which makes sense after all on
people whatever you think about
capturing the soldier a soldier from an
attacking army plainly kidnapping
civilians is far more severe crime but
that's only if they're people in this
case really doesn't magic matter it's
not that it's unknown so if you look
back at the price at the press the day
after the more my brothers were captured
as a couple of lines here and there but
it's just insignificant of course which
makes some sense because there are lots
of others in prison thousands of them
many in without charges there's also in
addition to this the secret prison
system like facility 1391 if you want to
look it up on the internet secret prison
which means of course a torture chamber
in Israel
actually was reported pretty well in
Israel when it was discovered also
reported in England and in Europe but I
haven't seen a word about it here and at
least anywhere that anybody's likely
look I've written about it a couple of
others all of this is these are all on
people so naturally nobody cares in fact
the racism is so profound that it's kind
of like the air we breathe through
unaware of it just pervert pervades
every year coming to the title of this
talk it could mislead and and it could
be interpreted misinterpreted as
supporting a kind of conventional
picture of the negotiations such as they
are united states on over here then
these two recalcitrant forces over there
the United States is an honest broker
trying to bring together the the two
militant difficult groups that don't
seem to be able to get along with one
another now that's it is the standard
version but it's totally false I mean if
there were serious negotiations they
would be organized by some neutral party
maybe Brazil and on one side you'd have
the US and Israel on the other side
you'd have the world that's literally
true
but that's one of those things that's
unspeakable although it's it's very
clear if you look at the record oh just
give a few of the high points or maybe
low points which illustrate this much
Richard record so let's go back at 40
years in 1971 1971 the US and Israel
made one of their most important
decisions with a lot of consequences
Egypt offered is really full peace
treaty in return for withdrawal from the
territories and all they cared about was
so that I cared about was Egyptian
territory the Sinai at that time Israel
was beginning to implement major plans
for settlement than the Egyptian Sinai
is going to be a new city meet
supposedly a million people Jewish of
course settlements yonke buti'm others
they're driving thousands of peasants
Bedouins into the desert destroying
towns and mosques cemeteries on and on
and they had a choice in certainly this
offer by Sadat I said absolutely nothing
about the Palestinians he also regarded
them as on people so there was a few
phrases about refugees which didn't mean
anything but nothing about Palestinian
rights Israel considered the offer and
decided to reject it as saying they
would not retreat to the 67 borders the
internationally recognized border Jordan
made a similar proposal shortly after I
don't think that one was even answered
the crucial question always is what's
the master going to do and in fact if
you go to Washington there was an
internal debate over it there was a
split and in the government
William Rogers Secretary of State in the
State Department were apparent
apparently in favor of accepting so
that's offered and certainly we don't
have a good documentary record from this
furious st kind of piece together but so
it looks as though Rogers was in favor
of it it was pretty much like his own
proposals Henry Kissinger at the time
was trying hard to displace the sea was
national security advisor to displace
the State Department I think the State
Department was his biggest enemy in the
world I mean way down below somewhere
was Russian and somebody else but if the
State Department said it was raining he
would tell Nixon sun's shining and this
went on until he finally kicked out
Rogers and took over well since Rogers
was in favor of it Kissinger was of
course against it and he explains it if
you read his memoirs he says he was in
favor of what he calls still me meaning
no negotiations just forced and it kind
of understandable to a person who
believes in nothing but force what's
called a realist and international
relations theory it looked as though
Israel had all the force if you read the
internal record from Israel at the time
just quite interesting the line was
Arabs don't know which end of the gun to
hold you know we know anything we like
so why bother so Kissinger went along
with the Israeli rejection and rejection
of the Jordanian proposal which turned
out to be quite significant that Sadat
kept trying to convince the u.s. to
accept his offer to become basically a
satellite kicked out the Russians did
everything he could made it very clear
that if Israel continues to build in the
Sinai there'd be war yum eat beans yummy
was the name of the town yummy city in
fact you
means wards and nobody paid any
attention you know Arabs don't know
which end of the gun to hold then came
the 1973 war turned out they didn't know
which end of the gun to hold in fact was
a very close thing for Israel they
barely survived last minute shipments of
arms kind of saved me and they
understood it's a problem the Kissinger
understood who he does understand for
sign off he understands anything else
but he recognized that the Arabs just
can't be disregarded then starts the
famous shuttle diplomacy leading to a
Nobel Prize for Peace finally in 1979 78
79 the Camp David agreements in which in
effect the US and Israel accepted
Sadat's 1971 offer except that they
accepted in them from their point of
view a harsher form because by the 70s
the issue of Palestinian national rights
had kind of entered you know
international agenda so they were at
least compelled to make some gestures
towards Palestinian national rights this
is regarded as a diplomatic triumph in
American diplomatic history great
triumph of Carter and Kissinger it's
actually a diplomatic catastrophe by fit
refusing to accept peace when it was
offered they led they opened the way to
a very significant war which
incidentally came pretty close to being
a nuclear war but barely managed to
escape and finally accepted what they
rejected in 1971 though in a harsher
form well that's nineteen seventy one
meanwhile other things that happened as
I mentioned the Palestinian issue of
national rights began to appear by the
mid seventies and in 1976 that came
another critical
it also wiped out a history and you can
find it if you really search but sort of
politically incorrect so not notice in
January 1976 the three major Arab states
so-called confrontation states the Syria
Jordan Egypt are brought to the Security
Council a resolution calling for a
two-state settlement that was the first
official international reference to the
notion of a Palestinian state to state
settlement on the international border
internationally recognized border region
67 with guarantees for the right of
every state in the region Israel and
Palestine to exist in peace and security
within secure and recognized boundaries
that soon became an overwhelming
international consensus but by now
virtually everybody accepts it in fact
had for a long time Israel reacted
refused to attend the session it reacted
by bombing Lebanon with no pretext
killing about 50 people presumably that
was a reaction to the UN meeting the
United States reacted more politely
namely by vetoing the resolution that
continued to happen I will run through
the whole story but it's been pretty
much the record ever since at the
General Assembly well I'll skip forward
til 1988 in 1988 the Palestinian
National Council formally accepted
essentially this framework that tacitly
accepted it before so Tuesday settlement
rights of every state in the region you
know to exist in peace and security and
so on and so forth
Israel in the United States immediately
reacted Israel reacted with a formal
declaration that their can't quote the
words are there can be no additional
Palestinian state between Israel and
Jordan they declared that Jordan is a
Palestinian state the Jordanians don't
think so and Palestinians don't think so
but remember they're on people so it
doesn't matter so there can't be another
Palestinian state and added that the
fate of the territories would have to be
determined according to the guidelines
of the State of Israel that was
essentially a coalition government at
the time labor the cool Paris from here
the you know again as always the
question is how the United States will
react and the United States reacted at
once and what's called the Baker plan
December 1980-88 I guess 89 the Baker
plan essentially just repeated the
Israeli formal declaration so no
additional Palestinian state between
Jordan and Israel and fate of the
territories settled according to the
guidelines of the State of Israel well a
little bit later came the famous Oslo
agreements couple years later the Oslo
agreements were heralded as a fabulous
breakthrough in the struggle for peace
robin and RF met on the White House lawn
with Clinton holding him under his arms
and sort of rubbing reluctantly show can
in the other direction and they issued a
declaration of principles if you read
the Declaration of Principles very short
but two pages you can see exactly what
it meant it was a total capitulation
hundred percent the Declaration of
principle states that the final outcome
of negotiations will be based on un 242
anyone who knows anything about this
story knows that you n 2 42 says nothing
about the Palestinians accept refugees
so if that's the final outcome
Palestinians have given up and that was
understood I'd say he criticized it I
criticized a couple of other people the
most important was hydro powder of the
shafi he was the conservative
nationalist is probably the most
respected person in the territories and
he had in fact been heading the
negotiations team within the Madrid
framework he rejected it right away in
fact he refused even to attend the day
of all on the White House lawn and for
very simple reason exactly what I said
he says this just gives up any hope of
national self-determination and
furthermore he added and stressed it
says nothing about continuing settlement
if Israel continues its settlements the
programs then games over so he refused
to attend manaphy his person of
principle one reason he was a respected
but there was a lot of unfortunate
euphoria about it well meanwhile the
settlements continued right through the
90s you look at the pace of settlement
under Clinton steady increase peaked
actually in the year 2000 with a sharp
increase also the US and Israel put into
operation at that time a very
significant program early 90s they put
into operation a program to separate
Gaza
from the West Bank now that happens to
be in direct violation of the specific
terms of the oslo accords which says
they're in a territorial unity which
can't be broken but remember we're
talking about international outlaws the
United States and Israel so they do what
they like and subordinate educated
classes they can get away with so they
immediately began to separate Gaza from
the West Bank that's been persisting
sins and that's quite important because
it means that if any kind of national
anted rights are ever granted to
whatever fragments remain in the West
Bank they'll be in prison they'll be
imprisoned between Israel and Jordan
Jordanian dictatorship they'll have no
outlet to the outside world which would
have to be Gaza of course they also lose
very important part of Palestinian
territory and that again continues until
today in pre ugly ways well I should
mention that the settlements are at not
only illegal but recognized to be
illegal this is really no debate about
this I'm Security Council the
International Court of Justice the
United States used to recognize them as
illegal too and it was more or less part
of the world and now it says they're
disputed or something so Press says
disputed Israel recognize that they were
illegal right away in late nineteen
sixty seven when the settlements began
Israel's leading a legal advisor well
international lawyer Theodore Iran now
quite a distinguished international
legal figure he advised the government
that any settlements at all or in
violation of the Geneva Conventions
which says are explicitly you can't
transfer population to occupied
territories a war crime so that's the
Israeli eternal general agreed with
atoms formed the government same thing
and perhaps the most interesting
reaction was Moshe Dayan he was he's
kind of went about the more dovish end
of the spectrum and person who did have
some sympathy for the rights of
Palestinians he and he was in charge of
the occupied territories Minister of
Defense he said yeah it's true it's in
violation of international law but
countries violate international law so
we'll do it too and as long as the boss
says it's okay it doesn't matter what
international law is he also gave a kind
of a poetic image to explain what's
happening he said it's a little bit like
Bedouin customs I mean a Bedouin will
kidnap some young girl and raper and a
force her to marry him and ultimately
she'll kind of accept it and maybe it'll
she'll even think it's a great thing and
that's what will happen with the
Palestinian he added will inform the
Palestinians that we have nothing for
you you shall live like dogs and whoever
wants to leave can leave and we'll see
where this leads meanwhile we'll
continue settlement and goal is to have
permanent rule over the territories
that's at the dovish end so there's no
real debate about this in anything
involving what's called Jerusalem the
Jerusalem isn't only is a huge territory
about five times the size of
annexed by Israel anything involving
Jerusalem is doubly illegal because it's
in violation of specific security
council resolutions relating to
Jerusalem in fact some of those are even
signed on to by the United States went
in the early days when it was still part
of the world well the I won't go through
the rest of the record just to say that
there's been one break one interesting
break in the record of total rejection
ISM on the part of the US and Israel
that was in december two thousand
clinton's last month in office clinton
recognized that the proposals in the
failed Camp David agreements couldn't be
accepted by any Palestinian any Arab and
he therefore gave a different presented
a different framework it was called his
parameters they're kind of vague but
more forthcoming he then made a speech
saying both Israel and the Palestinians
accepted the parameters of both sides
had reservations and they met in Taba
Egypt both sides in january two thousand
one and tried to hash out their
differences and we actually have a
pretty good record of this a lot of it
in English a lot more in Hebrew and I
basically converge they were getting
pretty close in fact in their last press
conference both sides said that with a
little more time they might settle
everything well the negotiations were
broken off at that time by Israel Prime
Minister Barack and since then there's
been no formal negotiations well that
tells us something it tells us that if
an American president is just willing to
Alette let diplomacy proceed it might
actually
implement the international consensus
which are stress again is almost
exception was well this continued a
couple years later the quartet was
formed US Europe Russia in the UN and
they issued a road what's called a road
maps called bushes road map which
everyone is supposed to live up to Hamas
is constantly denounced because it
doesn't accept the road map less notice
is that Israel immediately rejected the
rosemont road map it formally accepted
it but added 14 reservations which when
you read them completely eliminate its
content now this was kept pretty quiet
came out in public apart from activists
for the first time in a jimmy carter's
book you know the famous book about
peace and apartheid the book was roundly
condemned all over the place but i never
saw one mention of the fact that his
book was the first one that reviewed
publicly for a mainstream audience of
the israeli reservations which rejected
effectively rejected the roadmap well
that's that then the next major event
was the 2006 elections the u.s.
basically promoted them tried hard to
get their own candidate elected a bus
but he lost these were free elections
first ones in the arab world would
carefully monitored that recognized to
be pre and free and fair but they had a
flaw of the wrong side one we have a
concept of democracy which says it's
okay as long as our candidates win but
anything else happens no it's not
democracy so instantly within days the
US and Israel instituted programs to
punish the Palestinians severely
for the crime of voting the wrong way in
a free election and your toddled along
as it usually does also joining in the
punishment well that was 2006 then
starts the gaza gaza horror story had
been awful enough for years but kind of
escalated then in the next year in the
summer of two thousand seven at the US
instantly right after the elections also
began a standard policy if you don't
like a government that let's organize a
military coup so they began to organize
a military coup led by a Fatah strong
man I'm addict lon Hamas preempted the
coup attempt it was a fierce battle in
Gaza and Hamas essentially won the
battle that led to much more severe
sanctions and it's bad enough to book
the wrong way in free election it's
worse to block a military coup intended
to overthrow the elected government and
then things got a lot worse in the next
summer july two thousand eight Hamas and
Israel reached a truce Hamas lived up to
the truth Israel officially recognizes
that during the truce not a single Hamas
rocket was fired that's despite the fact
that Israel didn't observe the truth
Israel did not part of the terms were
that Israel would end the siege of Gaza
which is of course an act of war and
they didn't and they had a reason the
reason is gilad shalit hadn't been
released remember he's a person unlike
the thousands and Israeli jails many of
them without charge so therefore they
didn't accept it but nevertheless Hamas
lived up to it on November forth under
the cover of the US election Israel
invaded Gaza completely funny pretext
kill have a doesn't Hamas activists and
then Rockets
firing as usual all the casualties were
Palestinian hundred percent late
December Hamas offered to renew the
truth Israel considered it to rejected
it decided instead to invade that's
Operation Cast Lead his number 27th
really shocking war crimes and won't say
anything about them they're pretty well
covered there's a by Norman Finkelstein
which is kind of a pretty definitive
study of what happened there's also a
very revealing book by which i don't
think it's an I'm sure it's been
published your bike to Norwegian doctors
and that's Gilbert than the Eric fussing
who amazing people they were working in
the main hospital veiled shifa hospital
right through this whole Horror Story
and they just give a very gripping
account I mean I couldn't put it down as
I started reading it which just goes
kind of day by day the cars that were
happening there that's I certainly urge
everyone to read it even if you don't
learn new facts it gives you a picture
that's you know that the International
reports don't quite convey well
meanwhile the u.s. block to cease fire
usual action this is after Obama had
been elected before he came into office
and he was asked of course if he
anything to say about these massive war
crimes and he had an answer he said
there's only one president and I'm not
the president yet so I can't say
anything he was saying things about
everything else but not that actually
his campaign did say something they
released a statement of his
that if his daughters were under attack
by rockets he would do anything to stop
them he's referring to Israeli people in
steroid you know town nearby not the
ones who are being subjected to what
fussy and Gilbert call infanticide and
the term is accurate you read your book
will see why it was infanticide
miserable violent and Fanta site but
their unpeopled so Obama had nothing say
about then the operation was very
carefully calibrated so that it would
end almost moments before Obama's
inauguration so then he could come up
with the famous next statement that
applies to everything let's not look
backward let's look forward that's a
wonderful slogan for the people who are
holding the clothes on every topic and
Obama uses it all the time well the next
thing that happened is that Obama gave
his first major speech on this topic a
couple days later announced the
appointment of George Mitchell as
negotiator which makes sense sensible
appointment except for what he had he
added that Mitchell isn't going to have
any powers and he made a very clear he
had the genius to miss it but it was
missed he welcomed the Arab Peace plan
there's an arab peace plan which been
around in the US it rejected it the our
peace plan goes beyond the international
consensus and calls for normalization of
relations with israel after a two-state
settlement is established and Obama said
very good that the Arabs are doing this
they ought to now implement their plan
by normalizing relations with Israel
he's literate you know he knows
perfectly well that that was not the
plan so did the journalist who pretended
not to see what he was saying he emitted
totally the condition
namely to state settlement not a word
about that and just said y'all go ahead
and normalize relations that's a way of
telling the world i'm not going to do
any and in fact that continues on
israel-palestine april as the worst
record of any president go on with the
details that continued last februari
came another major step obama vetoed a
Security Council resolution that's
normal I mean dozens of them but this
one was particularly interesting and
even got suppressed because of obama was
vetoing a resolution which called for
the implementation of official US policy
namely stop the settlement expansion
which is of course criminal so if he did
it state department had the issue
complicated explanations but he just
became a laughingstock at that point by
now bush obama has actually made a major
achievement he succeeded in reaching a
level of unpopularity in the arab world
which is even higher than bush and that
takes him doing the bush i think had
about nine percent support i think
obama's now to about five or something
he's mainly an object of ridicule with
this continual humiliation of himself
and of course in the country is really
just ridicule with some reason well
meanwhile settlements continue and
perfectly brazenly in fact after Obama's
veto Israel quite correctly took that to
be you know a green light saying do
anything you like so they in fact they
already know it but this finish did in
fact it's utterly brazen just the last
couple of days Israel's announced a
couple of thousand new housing units in
what they call
give out tomatoes that's a settlement
new settlement in between and Bethlehem
and Jerusalem East Jerusalem feel look
at those two cities there you can see
one from the other and Israel has been
gradually surrounding Jerusalem with you
know expanded Jerusalem with illegal
settlements and this kind of closes the
ring it means that the people in Bethlem
can see Jerusalem but they want to get
there you know maybe they go through
Cyprus or something like that but and
that's done perfectly brazen you know
reading newspaper small column and they
know they can do whatever they like at
least well Obama will just genuflect in
fact humiliate himself as he's been
doing pretty impressively it's actually
interesting to compare with former
president so Bush number one a little
self-respect when Israel was brazenly
insulting the United States by
announcing a settlement expansion the
day in which James Baker patrician
Secretary of State showed up the Bush
administration sort of punished them it
in fact Baker was furious and he told
Israeli government hiring talk to them
anymore and he gave that he said here's
the telephone number of the State
Department you want to get in touch with
us call us up and bush announced some
sanctions not very heavy one was but
sanctions which were essentially called
off by Clinton Bush number two went
beyond when he his administration
ordered in Israel not to sell advanced
armaments to China which they really
want to do with their militarized state
it's a great market they refused and
Bush bush administration not only
compelled them not to do it but when out
of the way to humiliate them publicly
they would not allow Israeli officials
to come to Washington they insisted on
an official apology
I said we're not going to take that
stuff from you guys oh but that's
nothing like with Obama he just
genuflect and then they know it well
that's that's what's happening here
right now with regard latina goshi
ations the US and Israel are delighted
to have them go on as long as they need
to preconditions crucial preconditions
one is that they're under us control us
has to control the whole region so let's
keep your about everybody out so they'll
run the negotiations which guarantees
that they'll get nowhere and the second
precondition is that Israel must be
permitted to continue to build
settlements I will describe what this
means but if you look at a map you can
figure it out the those are clear
preconditions no negotiations can
continue until those are met this is
described differently in u.s. median
commentary what's claimed is the
Palestinians are imposing preconditions
namely there be real negotiations and
that Israel should stop building
settlements well you look at it that way
if you want but a more accurate way if
you grant that Palestinians or people is
that it's the US and Israel which are
imposing strict preconditions designed
to ensure that absolutely nothing will
happen the kind of in disgust over the
pointlessness of this farcical process
the Palestinians already decided to go
to the United Nations that Israel was
actually deeply concerned about this
this was called a forthcoming tsunami
there was an interesting meeting of the
Israeli oligarchs dozen or so people who
pretty much on the place secret meeting
which was
naturally leak was published in the
Israeli Hebrew press don't think it
appeared in English that was interesting
I'm the oligarchs are pretty upset they
said if if the Palestinians are
recognized by the United Nations that
we're going to go into what they called
a program of what they call South Africa
nization longshoreman all stop loading
ships countries will boycott our goods
officials won't come here we'll end up
like South Africa and they don't like
that after all they own the place they
don't want it to go down the tube so
they urged Prime Minister Netanyahu
essentially to accept the international
consensus that what they referred to
explicitly was a particular version of
it the so-called geneva queried
informally negotiated between high-level
palestinian and israelis released in
december 2003 I think boycotted by
Israel us didn't pay attention at all
accepted by the rest of the world as
usual representatives from Europe came
to applaud it and so on it's kind of
like the Taba close outcome roughly in
line with the international consensus
you can argue about this and that but
somewhere in that region so they asked
netanya they urged on yahoo to accept it
but he understands the United States
very well so he simply dismissed it then
comes the UN episode it's basically the
US vs the world as usual most of the
world almost the entire world supports
Palestinian statehood in fact is always
recognized by Austin us of course
objects and says it will veto anything
at the Security Council crucial question
is what Europe will do will Europe have
the integrity
take a mildly independent stance or will
it just now before the master as it
usually does and that's what you're
excited to do it decided to go on with
the master to make it even more evident
they selected the utterly pathetic Tony
Blair to deliver the message to the
Palestinian saying you guys are on
people forget it go back to the US run
negotiations Palestinian Authority had
the dignity to say that I can talk to
Blair any more correctly but anyway that
essentially killed the UN initiative
well meanwhile the West Bank is being
broken up and it essentially an accord
with what used to be called the show run
plan Israel takes over everything behind
the they they call it security wall the
annexation wall which is important it is
taking over the Jordan Valley now for
those of you want the details of that is
a very good report that just came out
from bit Selim the Israeli human rights
group which gives details in the Jordan
Valley of sinking of Wells setting up
regions where Palestinians are not
allowed and so on and what you can see
is just taking over the Jordan Valley
that imprisons what's left and what's
left is catalyzed no sad ends running
through its three of them breaking it up
into unviable unit Israel has finally
understood what imperial powers long ago
knew that it's good to buy off the
elites so maybe not everybody should
live like dogs as I on said those in
Ramallah you know they leads they should
have nice restaurants you know
Shakespeare plays
that sort of thing just like any third
world country any colony that you go to
and we'll keep them quiet and then what
happens elsewhere still live like dogs
and of course guys that will be
destroyed well that's where it stands
now what are the options here I think
there's some misunderstanding and it's
worth clarifying I think there are
basically two options one option is this
will continue the other option is a
two-stage settlement now when this is
discussed including by Palestinian
intellectuals and even Palestinian
officials and others what they say is
wells another option namely will let
Israel take over everything and then
we'll have an anti-apartheid struggle
civil rights struggle but there's the
slightest reason to think that so we're
going to happen Israel doesn't want to
take over everything this is not like
South Africa where the apartheid
government needed the black population
just workforce you know they couldn't
just cast and lose Israel doesn't need
the Palestinians neck doesn't wanna die
ons proposal was state and was correct
so they'll never take it all over
they'll continue to develop a very
intricate programmer carefully organized
program of infrastructure development
expansion so on take all the valuable
resources the valuable land is a nice
suburbs of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv which
are up in the hills and the West Bank
take over the Jordan Valley and let the
rest rot except for Ramallah where they
can have restaurants the and deliver so
there won't be an anti-apartheid
struggle there won't be any demographic
problem a fancy name for too many
non-jews and
state that won't happen so that's just
not an option and there's no point
thinking about it if you're opposed to a
two-state settlement at this point
you're essentially telling the
Palestinians get lost because didn't
offer them anything and I think that's
worth thinking about shouldn't have
illusions well a final comment about
this I mean that there are lots of
problems all over the world a lot of
them it's very hard in the imagine
solution you know sort of trying to work
out a solution to say custom years
pretty hard but of all the problems in
the world this has got to be the easiest
one to solve there's an overwhelming
international consensus there has been
pretty much for 35 years on a political
settlement you can argue about the
details but the basic form is very well
known there's one barrier the United
States won't allow and the United States
most powerful state in the world so what
it says goes but that's but if US
rejection ISM can shift and it could
situation be quite different in fact it
be nothing much to block a move towards
a political settlement not a very pretty
one in my opinion in fact I don't like
it at all but of the immediate
short-term options the best one that I
can think of and maybe an opening
towards further developments later maybe
better once but as far as I can see
those are the alternatives and I for us
I think that's kind of an optimistic
conclusion because it means that the
future is actually in our hands if we
decide to use the power we have
okay okay we have time now for some
questions there's no line over there so
we'll start over here hello dr. Chomsky
it was a pleasure hearing you speak my
question is you clearly denounce us and
Israeli aggression or state-sponsored
terrorism as you'd call it towards
Palestine however you've expressed
support for Hezbollah and you're even
greeted warmly by them in the year two
thousand six so my question is how would
you explain this double standard and if
it this is not a double standard then
how would you justify that thank you I
actually don't hear very well especially
through a mic so I need a translator but
he didn't my translator isn't here
either for some reason it's it's very
hard to understand up here on stage
pardon me these mugs embed to try to get
a little slower maybe a little louder
okay hmm yeah like I said dr. Sean to
use a pleasure hearing you speak however
you denounced us and um us and Israeli
aggression towards Palestine which you
call state-sponsored terrorism however
in the year two thousand six you're
greeted warmly by Hezbollah on a visit
to Lebanon and you've also expressed
their support towards Hezbollah and
during this visit in the year two
thousand six you are endorsed you
endorsed those in Hezbollah you allowed
them to keep their you express your
support for them keeping their arms and
I live in two months later they attack
they attacked Israel so how would you if
if this is not a double standard and how
would you justify this I think I know
your asthma is bad yeah so let's take
Hezbollah has bars
the US doesn't want to admit it
Hezbollah is the major political force
in Lebanon there were elections in
Lebanon I think a year ago and if you
read Thomas Friedman he practically wept
with joy said he just loves free
elections makes him his heart melt and
what was so great about this election
was that Obama of one over a modern a
Judd well in fact the Hezbollah based
coalition one about fifty four percent
of the votes same as Obama's victory in
the last election but the system in
Lebanon is skewed by an old French
imperial system that was imposed that
grants confessional representation and
the Shiites through the poorest part of
the population they don't get anywhere
near their proper representation so even
though the Hezbollah based coalition
handily won the election they didn't
have the majority of Representatives and
nasrallah you know he said accepted that
without any comment so they are in fact
the major they and their allies of the
major political force what about their
position on the use of force well you
know here there's several questions that
have to be asked one is does Lebanon
have a right to defend itself from
Israeli attacks actually Israel's
invaded five times in the last roughly
30 years so does Lebanon have a right to
defend itself I mean if they don't okay
then the arguments over let's suppose
they do have a right suppose they're
people not on people well the Lebanese
army can't defend them everyone think
it's permeated by it's totally
infiltrated by Israel you know us has
heavy control over it so they can and
everyone knows they can't defend Lebanon
there's only one force that can defend
Levin
namely Hezbollah and I've done it pretty
successfully it's when the reasons are
so hated in Israel in the United States
they finally drove after years they
drove Israel out of its illegal
occupation of southern Lebanon year 2000
and when Israel attacked in 2006 they
fought quite a surprising defensive
battle and Israel was pretty well
bloodied they had to pull out without
achieving their objectives and there's
no other force that can do it so and
what you say that as well I attacked
Israel that's kind of a little
misleading Israel finally withdrew in
the year 2000 in the following years
there was no Hezbollah provocation at
all even though Israel was constantly
violating the border kidnapping people
in Lebanon bringing them to Israel
putting him in prison killing them
sometimes in fact he read one of
Israel's leading strategic analysts as
if maayos he wrote an article after the
2006 war and the title was something
like border violation his border
violation he said yeah Hizbollah
violated the border but in fact we do it
all the time so we can't say anything
about that in us-israeli propaganda it's
called a hezbollah attack okay maybe
they should have done it maybe they
shouldn't in fact when they did it it
was with the support of the majority of
the population now they captured is
really wanted to capture Israeli
soldiers at the border and use them in a
prisoner exchange well there are lots of
Lebanese and Palestinian prisoners in
Israel Lebanese too so okay maybe right
may be wrong but it's a little you can't
call it aggression especially when you
look at in the context now you can like
Hezbollah or not that's a separate
question but I think these are the basic
relevant facts
about it over here thanks again for
coming it can you hear me in this is
that okay um thank you for coming to
speak tonight so my question for you is
so in a two-state solution and there may
not be an exact answer but just in your
opinion in a two-state solution what
would Israel do with 500,000 settlers
and that is should they be removed or
what exactly is your take on that in
your opinion what what came after that
you got the important part yeah can you
hear me now is that better okay in a
two-state solution what would Israel do
with 500,000 settlers in a two-state
solution what what Israel do with the
settlers let me just go back and say one
more word about the preceding question
because there's an interesting fact
about it which is known to people who
read the Hebrew press but isn't
acknowledged here one of the the main
prisoner that that's what I wanted
released is Samir cantar was a little
bit like Omar hotter I think there's a
15 year old boy I think who was Lebanese
it was accused of a really brutal murder
killing it two-year-old Israeli girl
well maybe that's right oh maybe not his
Israeli interrogator the guy who
interrogated him you know from the shin
bait says he's innocent he didn't do it
you know he's convinced so we can put
that aside the what would happen to the
settlers well I I know what my feeling
is I mean what the two sides would
decide is up to them but my feeling is
that Israel should offer to evacuate
settlers back to Israel
it should give them inducements to leave
their government subsidized homes
because remember they're heavily
subsidized to move into the occupied
territories would say okay leave your
subsidized homes in the West Bank and
we'll give you subsidize homes in Israel
my guess is that probably ninety five
percent of the sellers at leave if there
are a few worth adducts choose from
Brooklyn who want to hang on to every
rock they should be a link they should
be allowed to stay in a Palestinian
state but that's my over here
over here please mr. Chomsky you
mentioned that negotiations under us
control would have specific
preconditions according to some evidence
on your part however at the United
Nations just a few weeks ago Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu stood up and
called on direct negotiations here in
New York without preconditions Mahmoud
Abbas said no what is your comment on
that because reverse leg exactly what I
said Netanyahu imposed two crucial
conditions the negotiations have to be
under us control that means the world's
leading rejectionist power will have to
be the negotiator okay that kills them
right away and crucially he insisted on
a very important precondition Israel
must be allowed to increase its illegal
settlements which are tearing the place
to shreds and of course everyone
including him knows that as long as the
negotiations go on under us control
their go on forever I mean while Israel
take what it wants so yeah is he stood
up and he announced those crucial
preconditions which in the US are
interpreted differently because remember
we don't consider the Palestinians to be
people there on people so therefore we
interpret it you read the press here as
Palestinian preconditions it's not what
it is he's imposing
it's it's really you know quite
straightforward the two issues are
should the u.s. run them which
guarantees that nothing will happen and
should Israel be permitted to continue
its illegal settlement programs which
are indisputably illegal which will
essentially give it what it wants those
are the preconditions this last question
was an excellent model for how to ask
your questions slowly and enunciate yeah
actually if they don't come too close to
the mic I think it's better and in I
just it may be better not to come too
close to the mic yeah okay it's gonna be
a tough act to follow okay good evening
professor Chomsky can you explain what
is meant by a bi-national state and if
the two-state settlement that you talked
about the one based on the international
consensus if that's if that goes through
would that be a precursor to an ultimate
bi-national State or would that be an
ultimate end in and of itself no take
your explanations Oh a bi-national state
but whether whether the plan you're
talking about
20 by now well I mean I've actually I've
been in favor of a bi-national State all
my life actually not even in favor of
that I don't see any particular reason
for worshiping the Imperial imposed
borders for government when I happen to
live in Israel with my wife about 60
years ago and that we were students of
backpacking around and so on we happened
to cross the Lebanese border it wasn't
marked you know it's imp there's no mark
that's just the galilee and arbitrarily
broken into by Britain and France for
their own Imperial reasons why should
maybe have to accept them why should why
should we regard them as Holy so short
of that and I it's not a small point if
you do worship the borders then I think
about is a much better solution back in
the 1940s I was a Zionist youth leader
but opposed to a jewish state in favor
of by national state based on
arab-jewish working class cooperate I
still think that's the best idea but I
only know of one way to get there at all
that's even possible and that's in
stages if there's another way I'd like
to hear about it but I mean I hear a lot
of you know people talk about one state
which means bi-national state because
there's two national groups but just
saying I want one stage it's like saying
I want peace in the world then mean
anything till you tell me how you go
from here to there and I've only heard
one proposal that you moved to the
international consensus which
essentially everybody accepts outside
the United States and Israel and once
that's established my guess is that the
people themselves will see that it
doesn't make any sense anyone who's
traveled in that region or live
knows that there's simply no sensible
way to draw a line through sis Jordan
that makes any sense at all you know so
I assume that what would happen is the
cycle of violence would reduce relations
would begin normal in normal ways to be
established commercial cultural others
fact it already it happening you know
across the border with Jordan and when
that continues at some point there will
be a recognition that should move
towards something like maybe federalism
and from federalism you can move on to
something closer if the two sides see
that there's a better way to live and in
the longer term my feeling is the people
in that whole region given if they're
not if they're not blocked by imperial
power will move towards something like
kind of an ottoman system now nobody
wants the Ottoman Empire back no its
brutality and corruption and everything
else but they had the right idea about
something they left people alone it
partly because they were too corrupt to
do anything about it but they left
people alone so you know you go to
Beirut there Jerusalem whoever it is
that the Armenians run their affairs and
Greeks run their affairs and Jews run
their affairs there weren't many of them
and they sort of interact it was kind of
a pretty friend you could travel from
Cairo to Baghdad to Constantinople that
ever crossing a border and there were
plenty of connections and for that
region I think that makes a lot of sense
I think it makes a lot of sense for
almost every region but that's another
story it and I think maybe it could move
on to that I mean if there's some other
plan I'd like to hear it but the only
other thing I here
slogans over here mr. Chomsky in 2007 at
Camp David and I'm sorry in 2000 at Camp
David under Clinton's direction a hoot
Barack offered ninety-seven percent of
the West Bank and one hundred percent of
the Gaza Strip and Arafat turned his
head and walked away from the
negotiations what ensued was the second
intifada and years of Hamas and
Palestinian terrorism target against
Israel how can you Felicia sleek clean
that it was Barack that walked away from
the negotiations when it was in fact
Yasser Arafat who turned around you're
talking about that you're talking about
the Camp David agreements in two
thousand yes yes yep we really don't
have to discuss that because Clinton
himself recognized that they made no
sense in fact a couple of months I mean
yeah I mean you can look it up if you
want but what I said you can easily is
easily document it's all in print the
Camp David negotiations were in the
summer the standard tail here is what
you repeat said but a couple of months
later Clinton recognized that no
Palestinian no Arabs ever go to accept
the terms that he and Barack tried to
impose he recognized they made no sense
he presented his parameters in December
and just as I say addy gave a speech in
which he said both sides of accepted
them they have reservations they'll meet
to work out their reservations then
followed what I described so there's no
need to discuss it you know there really
isn't I mean there is an official story
it's true but like a lot of official
stories it falls apart very quickly as
soon as you look at the fact
over here maybe I don't know enough
about the relationship between the
United States and Israel but why in your
opinion why do you think the US has been
allowing Israel too quick to allow these
war crimes and to become you know just
to be almost voiceless about what's
going on even though they're very much
aware that terrible things are happening
and there's so much injustice currently
nice so why does the u.s. support these
criminal actions and the West Bank and
Gaza and so on well I mean part of the
reason is pretty simple Israeli Jews or
people Palestinians are unpeopled and
you treat people and unpeopled quite
differently but then there are serious
reasons to Israel offers a lot to the
United States Palestine offers them
nothing Palestinians have no force they
have no wealth they don't have powerful
support so there's none of any human
rights oh it's a elementary principle of
state graph Israel and the other hand is
a rich advanced technologically advanced
highly militarized society it provides
that has very close strategic and
intelligence relations with the US in
fact we look back at the history
us-israeli relations were established in
their current form in 1967 and something
happened in 1967 there was you know we
know that there was an Israeli Arab war
but there was more than that at that
time there was a war going on between
Saudi Arabia and Egypt that was an
actual wars fought
mostly proxy war booze real and what lay
behind it was a serious conflict between
secular nationalism based in Egypt and
extremist religious fundamentalism based
in Saudi Arabia and the US and the UK
have pretty consistently supported
extremist fundamentalism and still Lou
in fact and opposed secular nationalism
and there's good reasons for that
secular nationalism threatens whether it
will do it or not to take over the
resources of the region and use them for
the benefit of its people the religious
extremists fundamentalism though work
for whoever will you let them play their
games and get wealthy so there's it's
only a very good historical work on this
for both Britain in the United States if
you want the documentation but it's
pretty consistent and it continues today
well this conflict was going on and
Israel succeeded in destroying the
center of Arab secular nationalism which
was in Egypt and that was a great gift
to the United States and to Saudi Arabia
its main ally and you know they were
impressed actually the long history but
that made a change and that's when the
relations were established in their
current form and then it continued so in
1970 for example the Jordan there was a
Palestinian uprising in Jordan and it
looked for a while as if Syria might
intervene to prevent the Palestinians
from being massacred the United States
didn't like that at the time the United
States was so bogged down in Southeast
Asia that it couldn't possibly do
anything so it called on israel
mobilized you know has very powerful
military force Siri back down and that
was considered another gift to Saudi
Arabia they were concerned that Saudi
Arabia might be threatened by a national
stop rising and Jordans a lot of
conflict between the two and at that
time the Nixon Doctrine was established
this was called the Nixon Doctrine was
that of course the main concern in the
Middle East is the energy reserves that
goes way back to the Second World War
even before the main concern is the
energy reserves mostly in Saudi Arabia
safely under the control of Islamic
religious extremists who do what we like
and we got to keep it that way but then
somebody has to protect the dictators
who we support from their own
populations and so there have to be what
the Nixon administration called cops on
the beat the local Jean d'Armes
preferably non-arab because they do a
better job killing Arabs and then police
headquarters of course is in Washington
and branch office in London so that's
the basic structure and at that at the
time the cops on the beat were Iran
non-arab under the Shah who was loyal
ally and a dictator Pakistan which
provided the Saudi royal guard and so on
a lot of still do a lot of Pakistani
mercenaries working in Saudi Arabia
Turkey you know non-arab big military
force and now Israel was added to it so
Israel is another cop on the beat and a
very useful one and it sort of continues
like this I go through the record if you
like but there continue to be very close
the military and intelligence relations
the United States uses Israel to
reposition weapons Israel can in fact
carry out experiments with advanced
weapon
on live targets which is useful you know
try out your new weapons that way and
all sorts of in a hole and also Israel I
mean by the 1980s it was becoming
Congress was imposing constraints on
support for our most vicious clients so
you needed surrogates would move in and
do it taiwan israel you know British
intelligence contractors and others but
Israel played a big role in that kind of
secondary services so that's one
category another category is strict
economic Israel US investment in Israel
high-tech industry is increasing pretty
quickly and it's considered for a close
relationship I'm para is a highly
militarized high-tech economy in fact if
you look at one of the interesting
WikiLeaks exposures listed vital regions
of the world which are high strategic
importance to the United States must be
protected at all odds there weren't a
lot of them that one of them was right
near Haifa Raphael military industries
and one of the places where they
developed drones other high-tech weapons
and that's considered just part of the
United States in fact the Raphael's big
military industry actually moved their
management to Washington because they're
closer to the Pentagon and the funders
and so on a very close integration Intel
which is the biggest chip company in the
world they have a new generation of
computer of chips coming along which
they think will sweep the market they're
building their main Factory in Israel
and a lot of other connections like that
and that's an edge on the other hand
again the Palestinians offer absolutely
nothing you know there are other factors
which I think are probably
underestimated cultural factors there's
a is a structure in the world that's
political scientist sometimes called the
anglosphere England and it's offshoots
suits are the United States Canada
Australia New Zealand the Anglosphere is
somewhat unusual in the history of
imperialism in the Anglosphere the
English settlers exterminated the native
population and replaced them it's not
the usual course of imperialism and
that's deeply embedded in the culture of
the Anglosphere now we did it so it's
got to be right and the Jews are doing
it so it's got to be right and if you
look at international diplomacy about
the only countries that big countries
that sometimes go along with the United
States I mean the Marshall Islands
doin's on but real countries are
Australia and increasingly Canada they I
think just sense a kind of commonality
and this is reinforced by something else
the Anglosphere is unusually religious I
mean deeply religious it's a fundamental
these are fundamentalist societies
particularly the United States the
United States one most extreme
fundamentalist societies in the world I
mean about a third of the population it
believes in the literal truth of the
Bible I doubt that there's another
country in the world it comes close to
that and about half the population
thinks the world is created a couple
thousand years ago that's what it says
in their interpretation of the Bible
about two-thirds of the populations
expecting the second coming some of them
like Rick Perry expected in our lifetime
these are extremely unusual things well
and in fact it's not you know we think
about it sometimes as you know
uneducated people in rural Texas it's
not it's the elites Lord balford
Christian Zionism in England long
preceded Jewish Zionism and it was they
elites you know Lord Balfour Lloyd
George these guys in the United States
when general hallenby conquered
Jerusalem during the First World War you
take a look at the headlines in the now
press Richard the lion-hearted defeated
salad and we won the Crusades literally
he saved the jerusalem from the payment
well the Bible says something else the
next thing that has to happen is Jews
have to go back to Israel in the evenin
the Roosevelt administration harold
ickes major person said that the return
of the Jews to Palestine is the most
important event in human history and if
you're a bible reading fanatic you could
believe that and this permeates large
parts of marin culture from the elites
down to evangelicals when you get to
people like say bush number two you know
evangelical extremists and others well
it takes out a different form but that's
real and that I think reinforces the
general sense that there's got to be
something right about the Jews kicking
out the Palestinians because it's pretty
much what we did and in fact if you look
back over the history the analogy of
Jews and Palestine to the United States
and Red Indians runs all the way through
you find it all over the place I don't
know how much weight to put on these
factors but I think they're significant
cultural factors along with the very
clear strategic intelligence military
and economic factors it could be changed
I mean if significant parts of the real
us power system decided to shift it
would shift and in its only there are
signs of that interesting signs of it if
you read closely stuff that's coming out
and you know for military leaders until
it high intelligence officials even the
Centers of strategic planning like the
CSIs Center for Strategic International
Strategy one of the
you know conservative think tanks
conserved with military they're
beginning to raise questions about
whether the strategic analysis the
strategic alliance with Israel really
make sense at this point I'm sure you
saw a statement by General Petraeus the
head of the Strategic Command not Street
of Central Command for the region he a
couple years ago said that Israel's
intransigence is harming our brave boys
and girls fighting out in the field he
was immediately shut up but he was
expressing a view that is expressed by
others if that ever broke through I
think you would see a wave of
anti-semitism in the united states that
would be fierce you know these jews are
harming our brave boys and girls and not
going to accept that and it might shift
American policy radically it wouldn't be
very pretty and I don't want to see it
change that way but it could happen
other things could happen too but but if
you just consider the balance of force
and power and wealth between Israel and
the Palestinians what's happening kind
of almost follows like a theorem over
here thank you hello
is this fine okay how has the language
surrounding on people's evolved since
the genesis of the State of Israel to
contemporary times and how can the
Palestinians distinguish themselves as
peoples well the actual term is more
recent it's far as I know not before
Mark Curtis who used it a couple of
years ago and his books on the British
imperial crimes but it's the concept is
there you know and it goes way back and
that's the way we treat the native
population here no they're on people you
kill them exterminate them break
treaties steal their land the
african-american populations kind of
obvious in fact the Constitution says
they're three-fifths human our own
people as I mentioned the 14th amenity
that the Civil War but it really didn't
just for a couple of years and I went
right back to the same thing with
criminalization and so on we're right in
the middle of it now and the cut it's
just a standard Imperial concept
actually is a pretty interesting history
if you look at the I don't know if we
should go into this but if you look at
the intellectual history it's kind of
interesting in the 17th century in
England and France imperial powers there
was a lot of concern they were there
discovering lots of new creatures you
know expanding beyond Europe and you get
these blacks orangutang a lot of others
and there's a lot of discussion about
which ones are people and should have
rights and which ones aren't people and
especially if you are a cartesian that
was pretty crucial because there's a
cartesian is a sharp distinction between
creatures who have a soul and those who
don't the ones who have a soul or people
ones who don't are not people they're
machines in fact a long story behind
this a lot of debates and they were kind
of a you know trying to make figure out
who's they kind of looked the same
they're not European so how do we decide
that's a very interesting discussions a
lot of it had to do with one of my
favorite arguments was by Louie Racine
the son of the dramatist he concluded
that apes are actually smarter than us
and the proof is they don't use language
and the reason behind it is that they
understand that if they use language we
would enslave them like we enslave the
blacks maybe you could add that to the
literature on teaching Apes language
they're smart enough not to do it but
but it was a serious issue right through
the early days of imperialism and then
it kind of goes on you know over here
professor Chomsky what are your thoughts
about the recent diplomatic tension
between Israel and Turkey about the
marmot mavi marmara event and the UN
report and turkeys role in the region
regarding the peace process
religion between Turkey and Israel of
the recent events well Turkey and Israel
have been very close allies since
nineteen fifty-eight it was kind of
secret at the time you know known but
not discussed but in 1958 Ben Gurion and
made you know agreements with Turkey and
they've been very close allies since the
continued right through the Nixon
Doctrine period military relations
economic relations it they couldn't have
much in the way of the public diplomatic
relations because you know have to look
it didn't fit with the image but they
continued in fact it was Israel's only
regional ally and an important one well
last couple of years that's in fact
decline Prime Minister Erdogan has taken
pretty strong stands against Israeli
crimes during the Gaza attack he was
about the only Western sort of quasi
Western if you like leader who actually
came out very strongly denouncing the
crimes the West mostly accepted them
then came the mavi marmara incident
where Israel attacked ship in
international waters it's called hide
it's called hijacking when Somalis do it
and it happened to be a Turkish ship
mean primarily no not technically was
essentially a Turkish ship they attacked
the ship international waters and killed
nine turks one of the American citizen
and Turkey didn't like that and that
made relations much worse Israel was
quite surprised by this reaction and
with good reason I'm in Israel have been
hijacking ships
international waters for decades and it
goes back to the 70s you know the ship's
going between cypress and Lebanon Israel
would attack them you know the capture
kill people kidnap people bring them to
prisons in Israel and nobody ever made a
fuss about it because the US was saying
you know fine and they didn't quite
understand why all of a sudden it's an
issue but it did become an issue and
it's now going beyond I mean practically
whether Israel has reacted in it Israel
is going way to the right you have to
understand it was at ten years ago I
think they were smoothed it over but
Israel went way out of its way to make
the relations worse so the foreign
minister in Israel as a foreign minister
Donny il on sub for what is he he was
foreign minister yeah he called in that
he was a deputy foreign minister ething
yeah he called in the Turkish ambassador
and set up a kind of a televised scene
in which he was sitting on a high chair
and the Turkish ambassador sitting on a
low stool and it was all televised and
he's kind of lecturing him you know
that's just not done and diplomatic
relations and the turkey didn't like it
a bit you know that they're things going
on like that and it's gotten pretty
tense by now I mean turkey has stated
that they're kind of they'll do it but
they'll send naval vessels to a company
ships trying to break the Gaza siege
like the flotilla if that happened under
what would happen and we go to war just
recently there was an announcement on if
it's true that Israeli planes were
scrambling in Israeli in Turkish
airspace
to harass is Turkish vessels that are
exploring for natural gas that's a big
conflict brewing all through the recent
region you know there's been a lot of
natural gas discoveries and that whole
region and everybody wants a piece of
them and a lot of conflicts and one of
them is Turkey and Israel Turkey
complained about it I don't know if it's
true it was just reported on the on the
press but if that kind of thing goes on
there could be serious conflicts thank
you over here hi professor Chomsky just
want to thank you for doing what you do
and considering the global protesting
going on especially this past Saturday
and even in in New York City do you
think a people's movement can start in
Israel to challenge these policies and
if so how would the u.s. react to that
thank you well I mean there has been a
pretty interesting kind of Occupy
movement in Israel it's a relative to
population it's probably the biggest one
in the world it's pretty it's it's kind
of that they have pretty narrow goals
understandable but narrow you know it's
it's pretty reasonably privileged people
you know people like you basically
students you know relatively well-off
families who are being squeezed hard by
the neoliberal policies so they can't
get apartments they got to live in their
parents homes you know can't get decent
jobs and same things happening all over
the West and they protested about that
it excluded by decision anything related
to the occupation so it didn't mention
that like the reasoning apparently was
if they brought it up it would just
under minor Palestinian Israeli Arabs
apparently didn't participate they're
the most repressed group in Israel along
with Orthodox Jews who also live in
poverty I don't think they participated
so it's kind of a you know relatively
affluent educated uprising and a pretty
serious one but for now our goals could
anything go beyond that it's pretty hard
to say Israel's changed a lot in the
last few years dramatically it's shifted
way to the right this shows up in
diplomacy and a lot of other things so
for example take the demand that
Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinians
recognize Israel as a Jewish state as
far as I know that's just arisen in the
last couple of years it was never raised
before then it's just a kind of a
barrier to ensure that negotiations
won't get anywhere and it's quite kind
of like the notion right to exist which
as far as I know a rose in the 70s after
steps were being taken to accept the
right to exist in peace and security you
know the wording of un 242 got to raise
the barrier to prevent having no country
has a right to it no state has a right
to exist like New Mexico recognizes the
United States but it doesn't recognize
its right to exist on half of Mexico
with conquered by aggression you know as
far as a Jewish state is concerned you
know Obama recognizes it but no sane
politician say recognizes Pakistan as an
Islamic state that's where they call
themselves so we recognize Pakistan but
we don't recognize Pakistan as an
Islamic state we just recognize Pakistan
same with you know Saudi Arabia extreme
but so this is a new demand and it's a
reflection of the general shift to the
right which is
very noticeable so whether anything in
Israel amazingly they do not you know
overwhelmingly I know the figures that's
very high do not understand why the
world was outraged by the Gaza attack
they don't understand why the world was
outraged by the mavi marmara in fact the
standard picture in Israel you know side
from the fringes is our brave soldiers
were attacked by the people on the ship
I'm that's their conception overwhelming
they're kind of circling the wagons if
he has a certain resemblance to South
Africa there's some interesting
comparison that a lot of comparison
strong with South Africa most of them
don't make any sense but there's some
that are very I think meaningful mention
one around nineteen sixty the apartheid
regime understood that they're beginning
to be recognized as international pariah
and in fact I think nineteen sixty or so
the foreign minister called in the
American ambassador and told them we
have the documents of in declassified
that we understand we're a pariah state
ever when votes against us in the United
Nations but you and I know that there's
only one vote in the United Nations
yours and as unit as long as you support
us we don't give a damn what the rest of
the world thinks and that's exactly the
way it developed by the 1970s the UN
imposed an embargo by the 1980s the US
Congress imposed sanctions the Reagan
administration continued the sports
south africa as part of their global war
on terror affected in 1988 the reagan
administration declared that the african
national congress meant
Congress was one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world he had to
defend the White regime against them it
was not a small thing that led to
millions of deaths literally and that
continued until about nineteen
eighty-eight meanwhile a South Africa
was acting more and more what looks like
irrationally I'm they were carrying out
major atrocities just kind of kicking
the world in the face you know attacking
refugee camps for no reason killing
hundreds of people and they have at the
White regime thought as long as they got
the United States behind them it just
doesn't matter what the rest of the
world thinks which turned out to be
right around nineteen ninety four
reasons that we can only surmise there's
no documentary record the United States
changed its position suddenly and that
was the end of apartheid within a couple
of years it was formally gone I think
you can guess the reasons but we don't
really have documentary evidence and I
think Israel's following the same course
than treading on pretty thin ice it's my
job to make sure professor Chomsky gets
to his flight on time and in order to do
that we have to leave right at seven
forty-five so I'm very sorry to the
people who wanted to ask questions but
couldn't but we need to stop here and
thank professor Chomsky
