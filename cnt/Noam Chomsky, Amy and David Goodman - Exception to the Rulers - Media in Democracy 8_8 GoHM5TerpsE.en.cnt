the invasion of Iraq was likely to
increase the threat of terror exactly as
it has done every intelligence agency
predicted this every and strategic
analysts did it yeah and that
demonstrates their priorities the
priority is to control dependent society
and major military bases right at the
heart of the oil-producing region
they've just demonstrated by the
invasion of Iraq so what's the debate
about if we were allowed to think what
sane people take for granted we wouldn't
be paying attention to the line 11
hearings
I'm going to have to cut it off now I
would like to end with one question
police for professor Chomsky and
interview a few years ago publication
the weekly alibi you said and I quote
you can do good things with the internet
the question is whether it will still be
possible to do good things after it
falls totally into the hands of private
power I wondered whether you could come
on what you consider to be the state
current state of the internet and the
potential of news and information in
that medium today I'm briefly the
internet like almost the entire economy
the whole new economy was developed in
the state sector there's a dynamic state
sector of the economy in the United
States that's where most innovation and
creativity and development takes place
it's a perfect device because it
socializes the risk its socialized the
cost and if anything comes out handed
over to private power that's called free
enterprise the internet is a good
example it was in the state sector for
about 30 years I was handed over to
private power around 1995 in some manner
that nobody's been able on earth yet it
was just done and it's led the changes
in fact Norman media critic Norman
Solomon rota did a study where he looked
at the references to the internet before
and after the transfer to private power
and before the transfer the main
references to the internet were
information superhighway after the
transfer it was ecommerce okay that's
one of the effects of transferring to
private power a public creation now ever
since then there's been a struggle and
it goes on as to whether the internet is
going to be a free and open system or
whether there will be ways to control it
so as to divert people away from what
they might be interested in and into the
directions that
corporations that own it and funded want
them to go in so if you look something
up you know you won't find something I
don't know whatever it is first you have
to wade your way through a pile of ads
that are coming and you know don't go
down the path they're trying to take you
through and so on and so forth you know
these are all that's part of the
struggle you know what you're looking
for you can still find it but it's but
there are of course going to be efforts
made to make it harder and harder on the
other hand there's a struggle to keep it
more and more open and it's like meet
other parts of the media no it's a
terrain struggle how it turns out
depends on what people like you do a bit
and I hope you all sign up for the daily
digest of democracy now so you can get
all the news alerts and headlines every
day and the stories that we're working
on with that I'd like to say thank you
