asian of Iraq it was bad before but
within a year Bush and his advisors have
turned the United States into a pariah
state it's greatly fear throughout the
world it's regarded as the greatest
threat the world peace by substantial
majorities back us last October the
national press was forced to recognize
and quoting that the world is more
concerned about the unbridled use of
American power than they are about the
threat of Saddam Hussein actually that's
an understatement no matter how much the
world hates Saddam Hussein it's only in
the United States that he's feared no
one else regarded him as a threat
including his neighbors hate him but the
not afraid of that's a special us
property that's reached the point where
the the fear and concern over us power
has been featured in the national media
recently cover stories in Newsweek and
Washington Post recently there's a one
of the major polling centers the
research centers is the Pew Center Pew
Research Center recently published a
poll on the image of the United States
around the world Europe mainly it's
plummeted that's particularly a bush in
his associates most places it's still
dissociated from the country though
there are some exceptions like Poland
and Turkey where the country is feared
and hated but it will follow if they
keep at it it will follow it will be do
not them but everyone the head of the
non-aligned movement that's governments
of roughly eighty percent of the world's
population former colonies basically my
prime minister mahathir of Malaysia is
very pro-american very much part of the
whole us
economic project what's thirdly called
globalization he recently said that that
the United States today under the
current leadership is more dangerous to
the world than Hitler that wasn't
reported here we want to stay in a
cocoon but it's reported elsewhere like
England you want to get out of the
cocoon you should know that well you
look beyond it gets some ways even more
remarkable you won't know I'm sure that
every year the World Economic Forum has
meeting in usually in Davos Switzerland
it's usually very upbeat and
enthusiastic not this year this year it
was there was an atmosphere of what the
press called gloom the theme of the
meeting last January was building trust
and the reason for that was the World
Economic Forum had just done a poll
which they'd released about trust and
leadership around the world and they had
found a sharp decline and trust there
was only one they had various categories
the only category that had even a
majority of slight majority of the
population trusting them was
non-governmental organizations right
below them came the UN and spiritual and
religious leaders below them were
Western European leaders keep going down
to get the corporate managers very
bottom leaders of the United States it's
pretty amazing Colin Powell was sent
there by the administration as their
emissary he had a very rough time he was
bitterly condemned the focus of the
meeting was the coming war with Iraq
which they were strongly opposed to and
in weren't by no means impressed with
Powell's proclamation that the u.s.
declares the sovereign right to use
force as it wishes
it's going to lead even if nobody's
following didn't win a lot of hearts and
minds this remember is the core of the
international establishment these are
the people who the business press calls
the Masters of the Universe includes
corporate executives or paying thirty
thousand dollars each to attend the
major figures everywhere that kind of
opposition to government policy is
completely without precedent and it
extends right to the United States at
the heart of the the elite opposition to
the political leadership is again
extraordinary the major foreign affairs
journals american academy of arts and
sciences and others popular opposition
also has absolutely no precedent there
was an international gallup poll that
wasn't reported here again preference
for the cocoon last december and the
results were pretty interesting run
through them but just one result one one
question asked i had to do with the war
that bush and Blair and Powell and the
rest are declaring and are now carrying
out a war that they carry out without
any calling themselves the allies but
they're allied only in the sense that
they're allied against almost universal
world opinion the coalition the
coalition forces is the propaganda
system calls him a war carried out by
them didn't even barely reach ten
percent support in any of the country's
poll of the Opposition in Europe was
greatest in the countries that were
lying where the leadership was lining up
with Washington over the overwhelming
opposition of there
population that's incidentally being
lauded here in a demonstration of hatred
and contempt for democracy that also has
no precedent David was making jokes
about France but the reason for why
France and Germany are so reviled is
that they're taking the government's are
taking the position of the overwhelming
majority of the population and that's
considered a crime
it's a pretty striking fact the
government's that are praised with
Rumsfeld calls the new Europe their
countries where the leadership is taking
their orders from Crawford Texas and
disregarding you know ninety percent of
the population those are the good guys
what this tells you about the attitude
towards democracy among elites here is
pretty astonishing don't have to come in
on it that's I'm sure you notice that
the biggest demonstrations by far in
February mid-february we're in the
countries where the leadership was going
along with the United States Italy in
Spain same figures at all same right
through Eastern Europe so hungry for
example has also about eighty or ninety
percent opposition to the war under any
circumstances and the Latin America of
course overwhelming opposition are
always overwhelming opposition thereto
US military intervention which they've
had a little bit of experience with the
when the Allies had to have their summit
meeting in which they presented an
ultimatum to the United Nations and not
to Iraq they presented an ultimatum to
the United Nations Bush player aznar
saying you follow us in 24 hours or else
where did they mean well they couldn't
meet in any country were there people
around that's too dangerous they met in
a US military base on an island that's
where you gotta meet like the World
Trade Organization which had to meet and
Doha make to make sure there's no
demonstration to be surrounded my navies
that tells you a lot well it's it's a
real achievement and you really have to
ask how you know let's say you're this
Martian observer how did bush and his
associates managed to make themselves
the most feared and hated political
leadership in the war
old in fact maybe ever shaming the
country and ultimately endangering its
people had to do it well you look back
you can see how they did it just without
through the whole story just start glass
September because there was a big change
then last September's a lot of important
things happened and they made an effect
on world and us opinion the first and
most important was the declaration in
late-september of the national security
strategy immediately and surprisingly it
was harshly criticized in the main
establishment International Affairs
journal foreign affairs council on
foreign relations which dissing them
they do it in sort of muted terms but
you could see the concern was called an
imperial grand vision the government
announced a pretty remarkable doctrine
basically what it came down to is that
the u.s. is going to rule the world by
force that's the dimension in which it
has overwhelming dominance the u.s.
probably out spends the rest of the
world combined and military force by now
it's going to rule the world by for sins
going to do it indefinitely if the US
government perceives any potential
challenge to its domination of the world
that's going to destroy that's the
doctrine that was announced it's
sometimes it's usually in the press it's
called a doctrine of pre-emptive war
that's not what they announced a
preemptive war has a mean it means that
if you're under attack you know you're
under imminent threat of attack like say
remember back in 1983 the Russians were
going to bomb us from an airbase in
Grenada well
say the Russian planes are in Grenada
and they are flying to Florida about the
bomb us then a pre-emptive war would
mean you're allowed to shoot them down
before they bomb and maybe even bomb the
threatening airbase in Grenada that's
pre-emptive war that's be an imminent
attack that's taking place that's not
what was proposed in September what was
proposed is that they can attack anybody
they decide to call a potential threat
now sometimes that's called preventive
war but even that's not fair because
they're allowed to invent the threat
it's not preventing anything necessarily
that's the doctrine that was announced
the goal to use quote somebody else was
to use force to prevent any challenge to
the power position and prestige of the
United States and no legal issue arises
if the u.s. acts to prevent any such
challenge that's now the position of the
rulers of the country that out spins
probably the rest of the world combined
and means of violence or close to that
and it's now a forging new and very
dangerous paths over near unanimous
world opposition most striking and
dangerous of them as the development of
lethal weaponry in space which really
does pose a threat to survival of the
species well I mentioned I was quoting
someone else it's important who it was
it was Dean Acheson respected elder
statesman senior adviser of the Kennedy
administration quotes what he said in
1963 right after the Cuban Missile
Crisis which almost led the terminal
nuclear war the roots of the missile
crisis were a campaign of international
terrorism that the Kennedy
administration was carrying out again in
order to carry out what's now called
regime change in Cuba and we know why
one of the part of the freedom that
we've obtained if we want to use it is
that we have unusual access to internal
secret government documents they get
declassified there's thousands of pages
of them on this we can choose to ignore
them if we want are we going to look and
if we look we find that the reasons for
the campaign of international terrorism
were that the very existence of the
Castro government is a successful
challenge to US policies that go back
150 years what does that mean well 150
years of US policy saying you follow our
orders or else and the existence of that
regime was successful defiance of that
furthermore it was regarded as a threat
because of the possible spread of the
castro idea of taking matters into your
own hands which has great appeal to
people in the region who suffer from
similar forms of oppression we got to
stop that 150 years of policy tell us
that well that was the reason for the
international terrorist campaign led
right to the missile crisis almost
nuclear war just learned how close it
was after the crisis was over the
terrorist campaign was renewed along
with economic strangulation and right at
that point dean acheson informed the
American Society of international law
that no legal issue arises in the case
of a US response to a challenge to its
power position position or prestige well
that's approximately the Bush Doctrine
of September 1992 and this is the
opposite end of the political spectrum
remember and that's important to note
won't understand ourselves remember what
the political spectrum is well why the
