interesting city did you get their
marker night children
my name is Peter Engels
it's not
sit down there
in particularly the two speakers of
tonight the combination is unusual
having a professor of linguistics and a
secretary of defense on one platform
I assume that professor Chomsky is
interest in war is as profound as mr.
Balkan Stein interest in the use of
language but what they certainly have in
common is their passion for politics I'm
afraid that a to distinguished speakers
of tonight have serious differences of
opinion and that is exactly the reason
why they have been invited most of you
will know that professor Chomsky and mr.
Baca Stein have conducted a fierce and
sometimes ferocious debate in NRC
Hondo's blood they have been disputing
virtually every fact the other mentioned
and I have no illusion that they will
agree on the evidence this evening one
of our readers wrote me a letter in
despair and said with a variation on
oral how is it possible that two people
know so much and agree on so little
what professor Chomsky calls
brainwashing and a freedom or
manufacturing consent it's to mr. Bokka
Stein obtaining the necessary consensus
in a Democratic Society the one
considers the media basically
independent despite some distortions and
shortcomings the other sees the media as
a willing instrument of indoctrination
for the ruling classes the elite in the
letter in the lattice view only limited
discussions his discussion is allowed
provided the fundamentals of the
existing capitalistic system remain
intact
maka Stein basically accepts the
Democratic capitalistic state Chomsky
things and possibly dreams about a
different democracy in which the
creative talents of the people are
better used I come back to although he
wondered how it is possible that beliefs
are so often firmly held completely
without foundation and often plainly at
variance with obvious facts about the
world possibly this debate will show us
how oh well Yin our two guests of
tonight are now some words about the
order of the discussion all parties
concerns have after long and polite
negotiations agreed on the rather strict
structure each of them starts with an
exposition of 25 minutes without
interruption that means interrupting
each other
secondly they have five minutes for
reply and rejoinder again without
interruptions
the third exchange is of seven half
minutes each with interruptions and
finally both gentlemen will have two and
a half minutes for the closing remarks
again without interruptions and I hope
much will then be clear to us in order
not to confuse the debate and
necessarily I would like to ask the
public not to interrupt you your chance
will come later well the order of debate
resembles a genetic code
it is CBBC CBBC which means that mr.
Chomsky is going to start mr. Chomsky
may I invite you
don't hesitate interrupt
well this evenings the program is
scheduled as a debate which puzzled me
all the way through there are some
problems one problem is that no
proposition has been set forth as I
understand debate people are supposed to
advocate something and oppose something
rather more sensibly a topic has been
proposed for discussion
the topic is manufacture of consent and
I think it's a topic that merits careful
thought because it bears directly on
fundamental problems about democracy and
freedom and what I'm going to do is talk
about the topic well let's begin by
being clear about the notion under
discussion
the phrase manufacture of consent was
coined by the influential American
journalist walter Lippmann writing in
1921 he described I'm quoting him now a
revolution in the practice of democracy
as the manufacture of consent has become
a self-conscious art and a regular organ
of popular government he thinks the
revolution is justified the reason is
I'm quoting that the common interests
very largely elude public opinion
entirely and can be managed only by a
specialized class whose personal
interests reach beyond the locality the
common people he continued are a
bewildered herd and they can be at most
the interested spectators of action in
short only an elite can deal with the
problems that lie beyond the current the
common understanding and the
revolutionary new techniques of
propaganda and mass communications
provide the means to ensure that the
bewildered herd will not interfere where
they don't belong namely in the public
arena now how does Lippmann that's the
concept
how does Lippmann specialized class gain
the power to manufacture consent for the
public policy that they design well the
answer is rather simple those who
control resources and investment
decisions and so on
have the power to define their special
interests as the common interest and
they can influence rather substantially
the selection and the actions of the
corporate and state and cultural
managers who constitute the specialized
class under these conditions which are
largely satisfied in practice Lipman's
assertions become meaningful and even
familiar in fact they are a modern
version of the dictum of the founding
fathers of American democracy that I'm
quoting the people who own the country
ought to govern it quoting John Jay the
Bolshevik overtones of Littman's
conception are evident Lippmann
specialized class corresponds to the
Leninist vanguard of revolutionary
intellectuals his manufacturer of
consent is their agitprop the Bolsheviks
also regarded the masses as ignorant and
incompetent and they quickly dismantled
organs of popular control they relied
upon relatively crude means of
manufacture of consent or force when
these did not suffice now the country
the phrase manufacture of consent is
relatively new but the concept is old it
takes on different forms as social
conditions vary that's rather
enlightening to see how common a theme
it is in modern history since the
origins of modern democracy in the 17th
century 17th century England those who
described themselves as men of best
quality have been deeply concerned over
the attempts of the ignorant and stupid
masses the bewildered herd to control
their own affairs one commentator in the
17th century warned that the popular
Democrats were arousing the rascal
multitude and rabble against their
natural rulers the Lords Gentry
ministers lawyers rich and peaceable men
they were revealing the mysteries of
government to the common people and
thereby making them so curious and so
arrogant that they will never find
humility enough to submit to a civil
rule the rabble
both of the contestants for power in the
Civil War they did not want to be ruled
by King or Parliament they said but by
country men like ourselves their
pamphlets explained that it will never
be a good world while Knights and
gentlemen make us laws that are chosen
for fear and do but oppress us and do
not know the people swords and these in
fact have been quite common themes
through modern history since walter
lippmann go back to him was writing in a
particular social context which gives
meaning to his notions thoughts it was a
period of severe domestic repression
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare there was a
harsh attack on labor on freedom of
speech and democratic politics the
repression was launched in fear that the
Bolshevik Revolution shortly before
would inspire the ignorant and incapable
mass of humanity to become masters by
virtue of their overwhelming numbers on
quoting Woodrow Wilson Secretary of
State whose expressing the standard fear
of democracy the liberal intellectual
community at the time was much impressed
with their successful service in
Wilson's propaganda campaign to induce a
generally pacifist population to join
the European war as they put it they
were proud of having imposed their will
upon a reluctant or indifferent majority
using such measures as what they called
historical engineering that is shaping
the facts of history so as to serve the
needs of state power was a task
undertaken by a group of eminent
historians who formed a National Board
of historical service the intellectual
class also relayed fabrications about
Conn atrocities and other matters that
were devised by the ministry the British
Ministry of Information which secretly
defined its task as to direct the
thought of most of the world the Wilson
administration created its own agitprop
agency to direct the thought of the
population at home propaganda and its
merits were in the air along with fear
of what was called the mass of humanity
and it was in this context that Lippmann
spoke of the revolutionary new methods
of manufacture of consent sorry I've
been talking all day
Wilson's propaganda agency first in
American history was the precursor of
the far more elaborate program of the
Reagan administration to control
domestic debate by manipulation and
deceit when this secret and illegal
program was finally exposed high
officials of the administration
described it as the kind of operation
that the military conducts in enemy
territory the terminology is apt it
captures the attitude toward the general
public an enemy that has to be subdued
the corporate world was also much
impressed with the new techniques of
engineering of consent the term that was
devised by the leading figure of the
public relations industry which
underwent a rapid expansion in the
post-world War one years dedicated to
the task of controlling the public mind
as executives put it this huge industry
offers its services for engineering
consent to government policy while also
in their words educating the American
people about the economic facts of life
to ensure a favorable climate for
business industry manuals explain
quoting that the conscious and
intelligent manipulation of the
organized habits and opinions of the
masses is an important element in
democratic society those who manipulate
this unseen mechanism of society
constitute an invisible government which
is the true ruling power of our country
it is the intelligent minorities which
need to make use of propaganda
continuously and systematically and of
course they do so by virtue of their
private power it's unnecessary to add no
this is taken very seriously in there's
been a long and very self-conscious
campaign of business to subdue
particularly the labor movement by these
methods in 1938 the board of directors
of the National Association of
Manufacturers
described what it called the hazard
facing industrialists in the newly
realized political power of the masses
unless their thinking is directed at
warned we are definitely headed for
adversity and great efforts were made to
direct to redirect their thinking by
1954 Daniel Bell who was then an editor
for the leading business magazine
fortune wrote that it has been
industry's prime concern in the post-war
years to change the climate of opinion
assured in by the depression this so
called free enterprise campaign he puts
free enterprise and quotes indicating
that it's a fraud which it is this free
enterprise campaign has two essential
aims to rihwan to rihwan the loyalty of
the worker which now goes to the Union
and to halt creeping socialism which
means the mildly reformist capitalism of
the New Deal the scale of business
public relations bill goes on was
staggering through advertising and press
and radio training program for training
programs for workers and other means the
effects were seen they were seen in
legislation to constrain union activity
the attack on independent thought that's
often mislabeled McCarthyism and the
elimination of any articulate challenge
to business domination several years
earlier in 1947 a State Department
public relations officer remarked that
smart public relations has paid off as
it has before and will again public
opinion is not moving to the right it
has been moved cleverly to the right
well the rest of the world has moved to
the left has admitted labor into
government has passed liberalized
legislation the United States has become
anti-social change anti economic change
anti labor in fact the situation in
Europe was more complex than he
indicates but I can't go into that here
Lippmann's thoughts on manufacture of
consent have frequently been reiterated
a few years later for example by the
influential moralist and foreign affairs
advisor Reinhold Niebuhr who is much
revered by George Kennan
the Kennedy intellectuals and many
others called the official establishment
theologian he wrote that rationality
belongs to the cool observers that's
Littman specialized class because of the
stupidity of the average man he
continued the cool observers must
provide necessary illusions and
emotionally potent oversimplifications
for the stupid masses Harold Lasswell
explained in the encyclopedia of the
social sciences that we must not succumb
to democratic dogmatism
