all right well thank you for seeing
sinners today and as you know we want to
talk really about ideas of anarchism
your thoughts our Chanukah and it's
going to be a rather wander each at okay
but hopefully we'll we'll get somewhere
as they never know
alright in I think in in the middle 90s
you in an interview that you gave you
talked about one of the problems with
anarchism was it maybe it was too
negatively criticized but didn't offer a
positive well I don't if I said that I
shouldn't have car I don't agree with it
right in fact you can take a look at the
show yes I was I was yet yeah I mean
there are anarchist studies which offer
proposals for society in such meticulous
detail yeah that they go beyond anything
yeah plausible in my view like about
this auntie on is a famous case yes yes
who 1936 I guess wrote a critique of the
anarchist revolution in Spain and it was
an Argentine anarchist who was in Spain
and he called after the Revolution or
something like that and he laid out a
very detailed program for what a largely
anarcho-syndicalist vision of Spanish
society or for the matter any society
ought to be like and there are many
other proposes I mean the question I
think the question about detailed
planning for the future is not so much
can we do it sure we can do it lots of
different ways but whether we know
enough about human beings about society
institutions the effects of introducing
institutional structures into human life
do we know enough about that to be able
to plan in any detail what a society
should look like or should it be an
experimental guided by certain general
ideas about inequality in authority and
domination and mr. half people if people
explore different ways of working
through this maze and see what comes
natural to them how much variety there
should be you know what are you going to
do with people who don't want to work
for people with criminal tendencies or
people don't want to go to meetings and
you know this millions of questions that
come up that to what extent you want to
interchange jobs or delegate
responsibilities on the basis of
interest and talent and so on if
somebody wants to be a carpenter or a
nuclear physicist or a pianist and
somebody else wants to be an
administrator do you necessarily require
that they interchange jobs as a matter
of principle even if they're all happier
if they don't I don't think we know
there's both positive and negative
comments you can make about that but I
don't think we know the answers I was
reading them Isaac Pawlenty that the
Spanish libertarian communists serious -
who was arguing
while the like that and he was arguing
that well you know if one becomes a
teacher one learns by experience and if
one becomes a doctor one learns by
experience wasn't one isn't a doctor
when once twenty-two you learn and maybe
that's how anak is more to be seen where
do we at a very general level I think we
would all agree that people in the rough
range of those who call themselves
anarchists which is pretty broad yeah
there would be at least a general
agreement that whatever social
structures and arrangements are
developed
they ought to maximize the possibilities
for people to pursue their own creative
potential and you can't make a formula
for the now people are too different and
they ought to be different and the
differences ought to be encouraged and
it's just like with raising children you
want to find their own path
you don't say here's the rigid framework
out sometimes we will do but shouldn't
say here's the framework you're supposed
to follow and my own view differ from
some of my close friends on this is that
we should be cautious about trying to
sketch out the nature of the future
Society in too much detail it's not that
it can't be done it can be done can be
done interesting ways of different ways
and has been done but I think the real
question is to what extent is it
important to do it and to what extent is
it important to just try an experiment
and chip away at existing structures and
so on actually another problem which I
think must be faced is that at any
particular point in human history people
have not understood what is oppression
it's something you learn I mean if I get
back to my say parents and grant that
they my grandmother she didn't think she
was oppressed by being in a super
patriarchal family
where the father would walk down the
street and not recognize his daughter
when she came because you're not
supposed to not because you didn't know
who she was because you know not to your
daughter she didn't feel like oppression
I just felt like the way life works I
mean what psychic effects it had
internally that's a complicated question
but as anyone involved in any kind of
activism knows say the women's movement
I mean one of the first tasks is to get
people to understand that they're living
under conditions of oppression and
domination it isn't obvious no and who
knows what forms of oppression and
domination we're just accepting without
even noticing them and at some further
stage of self enlightenment and communal
understanding will recognize those are
things we have to do and we can't plan
for them we don't know about link to
that then did Emma Goldman a seeker
older and feared for the father may not
be an immediate revolution became very
influenced by I think Gustav Landau who
talked about that the state isn't just
out there is inside us that we have to
become ourselves as free as we can be in
in capitalism that in fact that them she
was always worried that there may be
chance that people won't be ready for
revolution and that there is a way of
developing the politics of the personal
so maybe more people could be ready to
experience out life that's possible
that's quite true I mean people in fact
there are you know the people who
understand this the best are those who
are carrying out the control of
domination in the more free societies
like the United States and England where
popular struggles have won a lot of
freedom over the years and the state has
a limited capacity to coerce there's a
very striking that it's precisely in
those societies
that elite groups the business world
state managers and so on recognized
early on that they are going to have to
develop massive methods of control of
attitude and opinion because you can't
control people by force anymore and
therefore you have to modify their
consciousness so they don't perceive
that they are living under conditions of
alienation oppression subordination and
so on in fact that that's what I mean
you know probably a couple of trillion
dollars a year spent on this in the
United States very self-consciously I
mean from the framing of television
advertisements for two-year-olds to the
knit to what you taught in graduate
school economics programs it's designed
to create a kind of a consciousness of
subordination and also of it's also
intended specifically and pretty
consciously to suppress normal human
emotions so normal human emotions are
sympathy and solidarity I mean not just
for people and if adults stranded
dolphins you know it's it's just a
normal reaction of people and if you go
back to say the classical political
economists people academ Smith this was
the core of human nature and society's
gotta deal with this well you know one
of the main concentrations of
advertising and education is to drive
that out of your mind
and it's very conscious in fact it's
conscious and social policy right in
front of our eyes today it says they
take the effort to destroy Social
Security what's the point of that well
the point I mean there's no there's a
lot of scam about financial problems of
isn't natural total nonsense but the and
of course they want you know they'd like
Wall Street to make a killing but
underlying it all I think is only much
deeper Social Security is based on a
human emotion a natural human emotion
which has to be driven out of people's
mind namely the emotion that you care
about other people you care it's a
social responsibility to care whether a
disabled Widow
across town has enough food E or whether
a kid across the street good school or
something and you have to get that out
of people's heads you have to make them
say look you're a personal rational
wealth Maximizer if that disabled would
have didn't prepare for her own future
it's her problem not your brother
it's not your fault that she doesn't
have enough to eat so why should you
care there is no such thing as society
as a mother I thought you said yeah I
mean there's only you maximizing your
own wealth and subordinating yourself to
power and not thinking about anyone else
and that has an effect you can see it in
attitude to not just get back to your
point the same is true of those who are
trying to change society to more decent
forms yes you're going to have to do
with people's consciousness and
awareness and as I say every recognize
your nose I mean taking the women's
movement was a striking example begins
with consciousness series and group
where people talk to each other and
bring out elements of their lives that
they may not perceive very clearly and
it's true across the board in
educational institutions and factories
everywhere else as far striking to see
how these this has worked over the years
and if you go back to the early days of
the Industrial Revolution say like red
round your lower Lawrence that place for
the textile mills were being created and
so on among the people who were drawn
into the early factories young women
from the farms you know Irish artisans
from the slums and so on there was an
extremely radical consciousness yeah it
was just natural they didn't learn and
read Marx or anything like this never
created European radicals I've never
heard of anarchism or anything else it's
just the natural assumption it's in
their very fruit grass something lost
but the free press of those day is
expressed just took for granted that
wage labor is pretty much like slavery
and that those who work in the mills are
on obviously why do we need these boss
is telling us what to do and that there
and that the whole factory system
industrial system is just crushing our
cultural values and creative impulses
and turning us into robots and so on and
so forth all of this was understood
taken for granted you go out to a
working-class neighborhood today you
front of it and that will be it's not
that they people be taught it it has to
be brought out from their inner nature
where it's been suppressed by very
conscious efforts actually you know it's
for striking to see how consciousness
sees show you in about like a century
ago Taylorism was introduced into
industry Taylorism Frederick Taylor's
yes that I don't know so the idea was to
basically the idea is to turn workers
into robots so every motion is
controlled choices and the become
essentially robust it was it was like
everything else it was initiated in in
the military system because there you
can carry out experiments cost free and
cost and take risk taking and so on but
then it was transferred to industry mass
production system and so on and I did
Lenin was very enamored of it means yes
that I think you know because basically
the same conceptions as capitalist
knowledge and the idea was to robotize
work but it was very quickly recognized
that like the 1920s that what they
called on job control you know turning
person into a robot on the job can be
extended to off job control that is
controlling every other aspect of life
the same way so why should people not be
robots and they're entirely and to be a
robot means to focus your attention on
what we called the superficial things of
that that fashionable consumption not on
care for one another not on working
together to create a decent environment
not the new for you you know what
the world be like for your children just
turn turn you into a passive consumer
and obedient person who pushes buttons
every couple of years and it's thought
that's democracy follows orders don't
think and identify your own value as a
human being in the amount of useless
consumption that you can carry out and
that's off job control and it and it
runs from through all the institutions
and it's a huge and yes and yes
to overcome off job control and make
people realize that you know your value
as a human being isn't how deep you can
go in debt and how many credit cards you
can max out to get commodities you own
it's not your value as a human being
it's something else I mean when you go
to a you know you go to a mall and over
the weekend and you see young kids were
in their spare time young girls usually
their spare time what's fun you know
it's window jam and that's they want to
do it can sit do it but what this tells
you about how people's consciousness has
been modified by offshot control is
pretty frightening yes I yes i link to
that as well one of the things that I
think is striking when you look at the
history of anarchism is that it's it is
most popular it was almost an organic
movement and answering community needs
the Jewish Anika's in New York in the
1890s in Spain obviously but Argentina
as you mentioned France isn't community
also being destroyed by things such as
technology where now there are more
communities in cyberspace then maybe the
type of community that you or I may have
grown of myself and you know there's a
coal mining community where you knew
everyone and everyone knew you and yes
there were tensions but you had that
sense of relationships isn't that really
going very quickly it isn't technology
helping that go
it might be a technology is a pretty
neutral answer right it could go in that
direction go in opposite direction I
mean technology could in fact be used to
let the workforce and a factory run it
without any managers by providing people
at the workbench with real-time
information that would enable them to
join with others and making sensible
decisions that's another use of the
Schulte was that technologies and get
developed in fact that they're very
interesting studies of how it does work
so one of the main studies was done by
some of the test was done by David Noble
we used to be here a little too radical
it doesn't mean here it's a terrific
work on a lot of things but the main
went the main one nine times he studied
it was called numerical processing that
is computer controlled machine tool
production that kind of mean and that
was like everything else developed in
the military system where you can do it
at public cause right right but it was
designed there were a lot of different
ways of designing it he points out so
one way of designing it would have been
to eliminate managerial levels and put
decision-making into the hands of
skilled mechanics who would who sort of
knew what they're doing they're usually
people no more anyway
as in the offices upstairs yeah and I'm
sure it was true in the coal mine yeah I
think that will mine work the guys down
there good one is sitting in an office
in New York summer but so put the
decision-making into their hands and the
technology could have been designed for
them and studies were done showing that
would even increase profits but it was
done the opposite way it was done in
such a ways to increase levels of
management control which is highly
inefficient 2d skill mechanics I and to
turn them into robot tool it just push
the buttons well that's a choice as to
how to use technology and it's a kind of
class warfare but it has nothing to do
with inherent nature of technology and I
think the same is true here whatever the
point you make is an interesting one and
I don't you know I don't know what's
gonna come of it but it is true that
there are virtual communities yes which
are very real I mean I would say that
95% of my close friends I've never seen
yes we just interact all the time on the
internet and you know my age I figure
it's perfectly reasonable when I see my
grandchildren do it I don't like it and
I think they have to learn yeah it's
about face-to-face meeting well just
going to the ass because I mean my son
does instant messaging and instant
messages with people whom one is at
school he can hardly talk to you know
but on it provides a neutral framework
but I worry and obviously because I'd
rather he spoke and interact it I agree
with you I don't know what kind of
effect this is going to have on young
kids growing up I mean they live in
anime
world yeah and even interacting with
people who are adopting false
personalities and you know when kids
used to play Dungeons & Dragons well
okay
I wasn't in it I didn't love it but it
seemed much wrong with it on the other
hand when you're living we know a lot of
your life is in an imaginary world with
characters who you have created created
themselves and you don't have face to
face human interactions with that can
have psychic effects which I don't think
we understand that could be pretty
taking that a step forward you know that
there is a tendency certainly in the
last ten years of anarchism we call it
primitive is arnica primitivism who
suggests it capitalism is so rotten but
a lot the technology involved a couple
ism is so rotten would you thought to
just get rid of the whole thing it's so
destructive so corroding so so horrible
that it's just damaging people let's
just get rid of it and step you know
tobacco or forward it in their eyes to a
more natural organic world or one with
nature is that possible I mean you know
I sympathize with the people that say
that but I don't think they are
realizing that what they're calling for
Sebastian as billions of people because
the way society is now structured and
organized urban life and so on and so
forth if you eliminate these structures
everybody dies for example I can't grow
my own food
it's nice idea but it is not we're not
in this room and in fact none of us want
to live a hunter-gatherer life it's
there just too many things in life that
the modern world offers us but just on
plain terms of survival that's calling
for the worst mass genocide human
history yes and unless one thinks
through these things it's not really
serious yes I yeah sorry couple quick
things that a lot of people I know in
Europe know you through your your
introduction to Daniel gurans book I
think is a-- and we slight lag away K+
put out his no girls no masters in
English yeah it's a great book it's
obvious that for Garron he was very keen
to blend what I think he felt with the
bust best aspects of anarchism and the
best aspects of socialism into this
libertarian communist libertarian
socialism Arian so she is really for
them do you do you think that those two
terms libertarian socialism and
anarchism as synonymous so do you think
there are real differences I don't think
you can really say because the terms of
political discourse aren't well defined
I mean capitalism trade state pick any
one you know they're pretty loose terms
which is okay it doesn't make sense to
try to define journeys carefully when
you don't have any explanatory theory in
bed
but the fact is that we can't really
answer the question anarchism covers too
many things libertarian socialism covers
too many things but I think I think I
mean I sympathize with what he's trying
to do I think it's the right thing and I
think he look carefully there are really
close similarities in relationships
among the the ADI state the more a D
status Tandi Vanguard is left elements
of social of soap of the socialist
movement the Marxist movement effect say
people I count on Michael yes others
just close similarities between them and
MIT some of the wings of the anarchist
movement like the anarcho-syndicalist
facts pretty hard to make much of a
distinction between say panicles
workers councils and
narcosis uses conceptions about
organized society there's some
differences but there are the kind of
differences that are exist on people who
are working together and comradely
relationships so yeah that's a sensible
blend so in my view is a much sharper
distinction as between all of these
movements and the various forms of
totalitarianism like Bolshevism or
corporate capitalism and so on I don't
want there you have a real break yes
totalitarian structures on the one hand
freezers free societies in the other in
fact I think there are similarities
between significant ones between
libertarian socialists is on the nanner
kids on this blend and even very
mainstream thinkers like down do it yeah
yes they're striking similar well now he
was quite influenced by stealth in the
modern school and he took a lot of those
ideas and so what about a visitor's unit
basic view was that unless we eliminate
what he called Industrial feudalism and
turned it into industrial democracy
which is means pretty much where news
control then the whole formal democratic
system done during billing mean very
much and he comes straight out of the
mainstream air yesterday the air example
play a couple of quick things I know
from from reading you very much
impressed I think you will be going by
people I panicked I can't go to the left
communist strand I take it you don't see
a danger of things like workers councils
or the worker panic or go to lead into
another form of totalitarianism you
think that breaks from that there's
plenty of danger right but the same
there's also danger that the
participatory economics completed their
health care ISM I mean every one of us
has been in
act movement meetings we all know the
dynamics if your face but whatever
you're working on you know yeah putting
a traffic light in the corner organizing
resistance against the Vietnam or
whatever where maybe there's a meeting
of people and there's you know there's
we differ in our liberals of tolerance
for boring activities I mean some people
just drop off pretty fast like me for
example I can't tolerate that much of it
other people really committed to
basically controlling it and there is a
natural dynamic in which the most free
cooperative libertarian structure can
turn into an authoritarian mode just by
virtue of who's going to stick around
and take enough control and finally make
the decisions and everybody wants to go
do something else and so on and so forth
those are always danger the last person
standing
and you'll never overcome and we're all
perfectly familiar with it from groups
of friends affinity groups working on
something right yes so yes those are
always problems to deal with them you
can't do there's no magic formula for
preventing that for that okay and link
to that I guess is is what you feel
about the role of classic change in
anarchism there's no doubt that
certainly I think in America there is a
tendency of anarchism in new Anik is
thought to see classes belonging to the
past it really isn't the most relevant
foci loci change anymore I mean others
people have worked in your coal mining
community factory for so the data
processors in industry I mean if you if
those are your jobs a young have any
problem with cloud you know who gives
the pluses and who takes it gives the
orders and it takes them and you know
why the capital you understand the
capital concentration that lies beyond
the choice of those who give the orders
and those who take the orders those are
class differences often some other
domain you can say I don't see them but
the letter into the real life of people
who live and work in society and I don't
think they had much problem discerning
class differences and their significance
there's a huge difference between giving
orders and taking yeah if and even if
it's true that the people are giving
orders are taking them from somewhere
else but that's the nature of
totalitarian systems it's not the top
guy gives the orders to the bottom guy
there's levels of transmission through
which orders are taken and given
managerial supervision and the
decision-making of various kinds and
that creates a whole variety of class
fundamental class differences and there
are plenty of people who just take the
orders or else run starve
yeah choice shoo-shoo in fact we see
class issues arising all the time
I mean takes a real concrete issues like
one of the very concrete issues right
now is what's called outsourcing what
attitude should people take thirty
outsourcing and their conflicting values
I mean first of all outsourcing is a
very misleading term outsourcing is
internal to totalitarian institutions
I mean if GM outsources that means they
are transferring jobs to some to
indicate to a company a firm under their
control which is able to escape labor
laws
our mental constraints and so on to give
them cheap inputs for the next stage of
manufacturing but that's all internal to
command economies so outsourcing is it's
kind of like a pretense that some do the
free market or definitely it doesn't it
has to do with internal workings of
command economies all right should which
it our attitude towards it I mean if
people here are losing their jobs
because you can get to a worker you know
ten percent of the cost and say India or
China should we be for it or against it
well you know arguments both ways and I
think all the arguments are highly
misleading because they're accepting a
framework we shouldn't accept I mean if
you accept the framework that says
totalitarian command economies have the
right to make these decisions and the
dip the wage levels and working
conditions are fixed facts and then we
have to make choices within those
assumptions well you know then you can
make an argument that poor people here
ought to lose their jobs too even were
people somewhere else because that
increases economic pie and go through
the usual story but why take this
assumption yeah I mean you know there's
there's other ways of dealing with the
problem for example rich people here
people like me for example you know who
are on top few percent of the income
ladder we could cut back our luxurious
lifestyle so pay proper taxes all sorts
of things and I'm not even talking about
Bill Gates and the people who are
reasonably privileged instead of
imposing the burden on the poor here and
say well you poor people have to give up
your jobs because even where people need
them over there we can say okay we rich
people will give up some small part of
our ludicrous luxury and you can't use
it to raise living standards and working
conditions elsewhere and to let
have enough capital to develop their own
economy by their own means and then the
issue won't arise but it's much more
convenient to say poor people here ought
to pay the burden under the framework of
command economy totalitarianism
that's easy with but you know if you
think it through it would certainly kill
no no and everyone was every social
issue you think about real life on the
ones you read on the table she has these
properties we we don't have to accept
and shouldn't exactly that the framework
of domination of thought an attitude
that allows only certain choices to be
made and those choices almost invariably
come down to how to put the burden on
the poor myth that's class warfare yes
you know you want to call class user
work but it's class warfare
even by real nice people I just think
that it's good to help workers again but
within a framework of class warfare
which preserves our own privilege and
transfers the cost to the poor year and
yeah that's these are critical again
matters of raising consciousness among
very decent people you know yeah our
friend I his isn't a more grim question
yes faltering declare in the 1900s in an
essay talks about their the hope she has
of of a peaceful change into a better
world and talks about then that the
masters were creating such a system that
they're going to reap a horrible war
wind now are we still in a situation
where a peaceful transition to a free a
better world is possible for us or is
can we not say or is it unlikely as it
years go on
actually nobody knows what my own
subjective judgment you know low
credibility subjective judgment is that
the opportunities for peaceful change
are considerably greater now than they
have been in the past and the reason for
that is that the repressive apparatus of
state and corporate power has been
reduced you can't break up strikes with
Pinkerton guards anymore I won't get
away with it
you can't send out the police to smash
up the working-class sub from town so it
comes to us alone in the national court
you can get away with that in law well
that makes a difference I mean enough
victories have been won yes so that
repression has reduced so much take a
look at this simple question of how many
workers get killed in labor action well
you know it used to be very high yes and
it went up to late 1930 yes is it I mean
I can remember it as a kid you know
workers getting killed in labor actions
by security guards you know Pinkertons
police the rest of it that has stopped
yes
I mean maybe occasion it will happen but
you know it's a substantial change so
having a look at the Goldman papers you
know we look at the New York Times that
we get students to look at the daily
papers of the 1890s I think every week
there's an underworld to see all don't
kill and I saw it as a kid not you know
and childhood memories of watching
police wade into this of women's dryers
outside a textile plant just being the
 out of the line well you know I
don't think you get away though no no
all right
and that generalizes just like it'd be
much harder now for the u.s. to
institute a military coup and say Brazil
than it was 40 years ago
much harder in fact probably impossible
because they've been just enough changes
so that people won't accept the name and
the structures of power of dissolved
right by now in fact a lot of the
structures of power are very fragile a
lot of them have shifted from direct
coercion to indoctrination and thought
an attitude control well you know it's
bad enough and get bad enough have your
kids bombarded with program this
television but it's a lot different than
having them beaten over the head by oh
yes yes and having torture chambers are
out and so so those changes mean that
there are many more options for peaceful
change but it does make it more complex
to fire it back yeah makes a very
complex you have to fight out at least
if it's a pink it's in college you know
who your enemy your enemy is and when
it's your friendly executive in the
soulful corporation is really on the
same side that you are until and so
forth yeah then it's harder but it
doesn't mean it's impossible no no a
couple days ago I happened to be giving
that Obama give his personal things away
but I'm gonna give a talk which I do
every year to a terrific group of young
monthly young labor the activists in a
group at Harvard which is run by a
fantastic person
artists dynamic wealth wire labor
activist feminist terrific this program
for the bringing the labor young labor
leaders into harder was it begun I guess
around 1940 as part of the corporate
academic reaction to this perceived
threat real threat of significant
radical labor action that might just
revolutionize the country I'm after all
to sit down straight is like one thought
away from taking over the plant it was
really close it was understood well part
of the technique of undercutting that as
it was becoming harder to use Pinkerton
guards and police and someone smashed
this up it became understood that what
you have to do is socialize the rising
young Labour leadership civilized yeah
teach him how to bring him to Harvard
and do it Harvard's Buddha in fact what
it does with his own students teach him
how to have collect conversations and
class so very you know solidarity and
drink the right wine and just pick up
the right attitudes into relations and
so on so that's stick these young guys
in the business school no see world
friends and we all doing the same thing
until it's over
and when I like that for years until the
labor I could get every about and years
ago Sevilla Boston Cincinnati's become a
senator of 14
International labor activism and the
reason is all these ideas that you just
barely below the surface as punctually
surface slightly and it all comes out
because it's all so natural and obvious
it takes massive effort to beat it down
but and by now it's completely different
yes but and has the effects all
throughout the world because you're
everywhere well I can be done in all
kinds of places but those are modes of
peaceful change and if I'm just in
around lifetime as they've led to very
big change and in the past even more you
know something like that the changes
going both directions so on the one hand
you can't crush homestead the way you
could 100 years ago on the other hand
the consciousness that led to homestead
is gone hmm
so it's not just progress but rebuilding
that consciousness is a lot this is the
kind of peaceful activity that can be
carried out and is in many respects a
lot easier than fighting the National
Guard yes yes final questions I think we
run out of time
I've just been working on Bergman's book
now on that and just a cape recive just
republished it what is Anika's him
reading his letters in the twenties when
he's working on the book and he's
finding it very difficult one of the
things that he's trying to come to grips
with I think in the book is well why
haven't people come to this idea this
idea which to me is just common senses
is just what we were saying earlier this
natural instinct almost is solidarity
and support and I've seen Russia I've
seen totalitarianism
why haven't analysts ideas had a greater
impact in the world I think he's talking
about now that's eight two years ago
nearly and and the question we're also
facing as people at least believe what
is in Emma Goldman says anarchism is the
only belief that shows man men and
women's a true self who they can be we
see that we know that instinctively it's
still at such a minuscule impact these
are true or is it as I don't think it's
true that it's a - Gill impact I mean a
lot of the progressive social change of
the past century yeah isn't anarchist
like an aggressive taxation is an
anarchist Social Security is an
anarchist but it's a reflection of
attitudes and understanding which if
they go a little bit further do reflect
anarchist commitment and they do they
are based on the idea that there really
should be solidarities into the
community mutual support mutual aid and
so on and so forth and opportunities for
creative action and they're all based on
these they don't you know they're
subdued and channeled and modified so
they don't take real libertarian forms
but they're there and they lead the
social change of why hasn't it going
further well a large part of its
violence so picks a workman's experience
in Russia he entered into a violent to
talk to Aryan stating I mean up until we
Bolshevik takeover coup
we're going to call up until that there
were very significant popular
libertarian sometimes anarchist
initiatives all over running from
peasant anarchism of Ukraine to workers
councils Soviets and so on and so forth
they were simply smashed by force
by great violence I mean Lenin and
Trotsky were to palette area and
extremists and they had a theory behind
it they were kind of dedicated Marxists
who believed that the backward primitive
country like Russia can't go to
socialism masters principals tell us
that and therefore we have to drive it
drive the country by force through the
stages of essentially state capitalist
development and then ultimately
something will happen I mean they
weren't repeating the master accurately
this required suppression of many years
of Marx's later work which were
literally suppressed I am studying the
peasant societies and Russia she's known
and so food but that doesn't really
matter I mean the ones they had a
conception that used it had the force it
was it wasn't easy
like you know to destroy Maka's movement
through crunch dot eliminate the Soviets
and so on wasn't a trivial operation
boost carried out and Berkman so out and
he saw totalitarian vicious totalitarian
society arising very much the way
anarchist had predicted yes I mean
because ins spelled it all out if I
given Trotsky initially worked before he
joined it said what was going to happen
I said Rosa Luxemburg and others but it
happened so that and that's their
variant our variant was different Wilson
Berkman was writing right after Wilson's
Red Scare which made the patriot act
look like it
I was a violent repression run by the
progresses Woodrow Wilson and not just
affecting anarchists not just chemical
but it was kicked it up but even people
pretty much in the mainstream like
Eugene Debs
leading labour figure he I mean Wilson
is completely addicted it tossed him to
jail because he raised some questions
about the nobility of Wilson's War and
refused even to grant amnesty when
everyone else was writing down this this
was real vindictive and it really fresh
tin dependent thought freshman labor at
a big effect as as violence alongside
the violence there is the rise of
massive propaganda that's the rise of
the public relations industry s to try
to control attitudes and beliefs but
quite apart from that there's something
quite simple I mean there are
disciplinary effects to the way life is
organized it takes a student today
students today have may arm or in some
way and a lot of ways they're freer than
they were 60 years ago their attitudes
and commitments and so on on the other
hand a more disciplined yes they're
disciplined by that yes yes part of the
reason for arranging education so you
come out the heavy debt is that your
discipline or let's take the last 20
years the neoliberal years roughly
what's called globalization but
neoliberalism a lot of it is a very
striking part of it is just needed
discipline it wants to eliminate freedom
of choice and impose discipline how do
you do it
welcome you if you have a couple in the
United States now working 50 to 50 hours
a week put food on the table you don't
have time to think of it enough how to
become a libertarian social when I
worried about is how do I get food and
where can i shop cheaply
I gotta get the kids to take care of and
I got something doing them you know when
they're sick I've got to go to work and
what's gonna happen to you know the and
that's very that's well designed
techniques of imposing discipline and
there are costs to trying to be a
dependent and it just takes a trying to
organize a labor union and if you're the
organizer there's going to be a cost to
you and maybe the workforce or gain let
this across to you and we know there is
we know what the cost is not just in
energy and effort but just in punishment
yes and the people who are living in
fragile circumstances have to make a
reasonable calculation they say I should
take the cost and get by so there are
many reasons why normal instincts and
attitudes don't come out but you know
over time they often do that's where we
have social triggers are the better okay
hey thank you for your time it's really
kind ok really kind of you great to meet
you as well thank you for you
