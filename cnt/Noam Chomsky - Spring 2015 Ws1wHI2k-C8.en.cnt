greetings we're here with professor Noam
Chomsky at MIT who is the world's most
cited living author and the reason I
bring that up call the time is because i
want to bring attention to how often
he's not seen on TV if he's the most
cycling author what they want you to
hear that he has to say well anyway the
reason it that i'm here today gnome is
that i've run for congress a couple
times as you know and what I've seen and
what's up a disturbing factor I've seen
is the rise the Libertarian Party in the
United States and I want to ask you to
give us a little background on the
history of how libertarian
libertarianism in the US has strayed
from its origins in Europe littered the
libertarian conceptions basically come
out of classical liberalism 17th 18th
century classical liberalism and it's
the core principles of classical
liberalism were opposition to
illegitimate Authority people should be
free from constraints and controls by
authoritarian structures which have no
inherent legitimacy basically one or
another form of tyranny or domination so
in the early days they were concerned
with feudalism with tyrannical States
and so on in the look but by the little
late 19th century on through the 20th
century the major some of the major
authoritarian illegitimate structures
are the corporate system the private
pyrenees by liberation is basically a
tyranny right dominated from the top
supporters from above and down below at
the bottom you can read yourself you
have no it doesn't end of anything like
popular Democratic control without the
year with the liver tears with the
so-called libertarian movement in the
United States which is only have people
I offer that friends agree with them oh
yeah but there are policies whatever
their goals may be their policies 10 art
attempt to drive people under the
control of the worst possible form of
tyranny unaccountable private Garrity
that's the opposite of libertarianism
right well I don't for those doesn't in
debates and so forth well actually going
back to the 2004 vice presidential
debate it was interesting is they had a
green there and they also had a
libertarian and the libertarian whenever
it came to social issues he was late
well we leave that up to the community I
mean they had it right with the drug war
they had it right with you know not not
being you know the US getting involved
in all these interventions you know to
get out of those but when it comes to
social policy it's like when we leave
that up to the community communities
aren't doing a very good job they leave
that up the community now who's the
community the community is not a
collection of people who are equal in
opportunity in power the community the
society consists of a highly
inegalitarian structure with extreme
wealth and power concentrated in a very
small sector and most people
disempowered that's the community so if
you leave things up to
what you're in effect saying is yeah
let's let the top fraction of 1% in
wealth and power determine everything
fine what are they going to determine
well in SAR interest so that's this is
again I'm not saying whoever the speaker
was believes this but the implications
the consequences of this pretense that
you're leaving things to a community of
equal participants is just wildly off
base all right so they has into a
community of people of within a group
within which a tiny percentage I feel
literally a fraction of one percent have
overwhelming power and I opportunity and
as you move down the scale less and less
and most of them are simply doesn't
power well what I'm worried that is that
it were coming up on Charlie breathe
through a article entitled 545 people
and this he made an argument that you
know with the matter you've got the
Senate the the Congress and and you get
the president and nine Supreme Court
members so other than that so you had
536 of those people week shoes and boy
any sort of with the electoral process
that we all know that we don't actually
choose them right for one thing large
part of the population doesn't even
bother to vote oh I know that really
reasons for it but everything you know
that my struggle against all odds has
been to try to get these a election
actually incidentally last time I mean I
was included in debate and but the
Republican didn't show so they didn't
televised so if it's not put over the
propaganda box it's like as if it it
didn't even happen but what I fear is
that with the rise of the third party
seems like the Green Party in the US the
Libertarian Party is rising that a Green
Party is going it is is lessening and I
just want see more of this reason
for that the Libertarian Party whatever
the goals and intentions of the
individuals is a party whose programs
favor concentrated wealth and power but
the for a lot of regulars works
relatively acceptable right there for a
lot of regular folks though that's what
I'm saying saying perfectly nice people
you know these maybe people say look I
really believe in freedom liberty
equality and so on yep take a look at
their policies their policies say for
example remove regulation on financial
institutions right what does that do it
frees them to concentrate power to
punish the rest of us and of course in
the background is something that's not
since it takes a financial institutions
the government actually in many ways is
designs policies which ensure that the
taxpayer subsidizes those instant oh of
course or five that's not discuss no
that's not this guy well I instantly
that's not a joke it was recently an IMF
study international monetary fund
already with the profits of the major
and the calf doesn't major US banks
polish and Kristin almost entirely to a
tacit government insurance policy that
is a tacit commitment that they won't be
allowed to crash that is not just the
bailouts that's a small part of the
point they get access to cheap credit
they get inflated credit ratings there
they have the opportunity of making very
risky and hence profitable investments
because of the collapse taxpayer will
step in and bail amount all of that
contributes enormously to their profits
the business press Bloomberg estimated
the implicit taxpayers
idiot about over 80 billion dollars a
year right now what do you say that a
person who says a libertarian socialism
that's an oxymoron that's an oxymoron in
the United States it's not us in the
United States libertarian means support
for capitalists autocracy and yes the
would be an oxymoron just talk about a
socialist support for capitalists
autocracy but that's a u.s. term but
it's funny the people feeling in the
world men the legacy of classical
liberalism which is quite different
workers struggles what I'd like to say
John Stuart Mill outstanding figure of
classical liberalism was in favor of
work for ownership of enterprises Wow
okay because when you talk about so many
things i'm making it so the average Joe
or Jane can understand the United States
yeah in the United States of the
spectrum this is a business run society
to an unusual estate well they got
funding supposedly well not the race the
guy I was wanting to guess but somebody
else I heard they got funny from the
Koch brothers and miss brought yeah koch
brothers call themselves libertarians
and you know meanwhile they're lavished
with huge government subsidies and
protected and all sorts i mean even the
Pentagon is to a substantial extent of
subsidy for the energy corporations
right there Oh pipe bomb sea lanes the
energy system working for them well i'm
home visit small Florida I'm hoping that
the Green Party can be seen as something
apart from tree hugging not that that's
bad tree huggers or whatever x rays is
interesting see you know hi Leanne
donated society liars if you're trying
to protect the commons from attack by
private power your denounced us
tree-hugging right that's if you can't
answer the arguments you use invective
and they use it it's powerful I mean
they can change like green can become a
bad word I remember like the AIDS
appetite suppressant candy and then all
sudden you don't see commercials for
that after aids came around effective
propaganda is pretty dramatic one
interesting case is right of return to
great concurrent concern is the health
system if they're been poles in the
United States for decades and which
would show that the population did some
is it most people are in favor of some
kind of national health care yeah but
they had it is there another country's
fill of course it's never even been
considered when public option was but
not the public option was innocent when
Obama produced his Affordable Care Act
if they're initially there was a
proposal for a public option why it was
favored by a large majority of the
population it was dropped without
discussion I have because what the
population wants actually doesn't matter
but the propaganda has been so intense
that by now that as soon as Obama's
proposal was instituted the propaganda
created substantial effect majority
opposition to it which remains even
though it's a small step towards what
the public is always wanted well I look
like some I mean in my opinion is to
step away from it because I'm worried
that it you know it mandated corporate
insurance so now they're not going to
want to get that up very easily those
profit tears are not going to want to
get that
it does remember before that that's all
there was alright well I know a lot of
people that's why I say this is a small
step towards offering people some kind
of possible health care you'd be
surprised I mean I have facebook friends
and stuff have had their their their
hours cut back so they don't meet so
they don't have to fit into the ACA
their employers don't have to cover them
so now you have a lot of people i don't
i don't know if the ACA did anything for
anybody really did there's tens of
millions of people who are uninsured who
now have some form of medical okay and
there's people like me we're going to be
fine because i'm in the middle well
there are people who for whom it may not
of hell I think it's not to medical
relatively it's been a small step
forward I was just take a look first of
all huge numbers of people who are
completely without medical support air
now have an opportunity for if they're
insured furthermore the insurance
companies are now and prevented from
from using the prior medical right of
private as I very significant I was
asked about that in a pencil it's kind
of intriguing there's called Obamacare
that's like tree-hugging that's to
demonize it by associating it with this
hated figure incidentally black which
doesn't well something well to what it
takes in the liberals call it Obamacare
yeah it's always it's me you know and
I'll tell you something from out there
talking to thousands and thousands of
people that's the reasons as Republicans
were voted in I mean they did this ACA I
mean you talk to people who are like
somebody who's working 40 hours a week
and then gets cut down to 28 hours
that's no that's very marginal the main
thing that's
and is that enormous numbers of people
tens of billions have been given the
opportunity to have medical care I mean
there are cases of the kind of dimension
but they're not much oh well I know a
few of them and I'm one of the ones is
going to be fought we'll put it this way
if he's from what i understand it 19 out
of 20 or cover shouldn't we live in a
society with 20 out of 20 or coverlets
why said it's a small stir and it would
have been cheaper smalls we're going to
code it much everybody it would have a
much cheaper from out the middleman just
to extend Medicare to the whole popular
exactly but let's be clear it's a small
step you know in the United States
government funding of medical care is
about at the level of other industrial
countries but that's about half of total
the total cost since we have to go
through a privatized system costs a
laser will flayed it so it's roughly
twice the per capita cost of other
countries and pretty poor outcomes but
that's because of the privatized element
not uh if you there's a ton of
bureaucracy payment in fact the costs
are vastly underestimated even this
figure twice as high as other countries
standard figure that's an under estimate
and that's for ideological reasons
economists do not count the cost to
individuals so if suppose you'd say
originally my wife had to get you know
go through this system to get insurance
well you know it takes days of work you
have to work through a maze of
bureaucracy you try to use the web at
pro it's crazy you call somebody you're
waiting for an hour to leave you can
speak to them all of these are costs
these are huge costs but the individuals
so they're not counted same is true
quite generally I suppose you get a
and there's a mistake in it and you want
to get the benefits it right you call
the number you get an automated response
with a menu that doesn't have what you
want right and try to talk to a person
and then you sit there for half an hour
listening to music well every once in a
while automated voice says you know we
appreciate your life finally you get
some human being may be solved that's a
cost to you right and that cost is
spread over huge numbers of people and
but those are not counted by economist
what they count is the cost to the
business so this may be profitable for
the business so it's called efficient
but if it's not it's costly for the
population but that's not called
inefficient these are ideological
decisions if we included them then the
cost of us medical care would not be
twice as highs other countries would be
far beyond that it's a extremely
inefficient system for people quite
inefficient for the efficient for the
rich and that's the way policies
designed and if you follow the
libertarian proposals so called the
Rotarians that's what the world will be
liked even more so than today so what
would you think that libertarians when
it comes to I mean they're against the
ACA but they what are they were they in
favor of 50 you know what they're in
favor of pics area Rand Paul was a
doctor's of today's Kathie but he said
blunt at one point that he's opposed to
any government involved in a healthcare
because it's the same as slavery eyes is
on a doctor and if the government orders
mean to take care of someone that's
slavery yeah that's libertarianism in
other words if you can pay for it
they'll do it for you if you can't
do it was but if we public option the
doctor would still be paid yeah but he
wouldn't be paid with but he would be
compelled to do something at a cost
below what somebody else would bear well
that's I'll tell you his work when I was
interviewed had work only for the rich
you don't have to take care of the
people to come in as simple an emergency
room at a hospital yeah if somebody
comes into we actually have national
health care in the United States it's
called emergency rooms I know you can
get into an emergency room that you have
to take care of you yeah that's
extraordinarily costly even from the
point of view of the economist's
measures and for human beings it's
tremendously costly he said no emergency
room for our or signup day is not a
surfer but the rand paul's position was
I don't want to be forced to take care
of people I don't want emergency rooms
to exist I want to just do what it would
I choose for the richest so here here we
are I mean in the u.s. we rank I think
it's in it in like around 35 or
something like that in life expectancy I
remember you criticize this in
manufacturing consent that when we were
in a low twice and now the figures are
more regular up there I think it last I
sold his 36th it's funny he's in debate
i mentioned i said in a high 40s because
of different figures you see and the guy
twisted it around in the paper he said
that i said that people live to be in
their life what is that and and you know
what we're not doing that that that
great with the system here I remember it
as a chiropractor when I've left the
office Medicare was good when I started
it was bad but it became one of the
better insurances because all the rest
had gotten increasingly worse when you
you know you had some middle person in
there of calling the shots is like
Medicare is interesting it's it's much
more efficient than the private system
right it is expensive because it has to
through the private system that those
are the extra costs of Medicare like I
have Medicare in my age but it does work
through the private system you still
have to pick a private insurance policy
all right just as a secondary all of
those reports well when you say public
option and Medicare for one you say we
really should do away with that other do
away with the copay order it all
together only been looked in most in
most countries of the world my wife
happens come from Brazil if you're ill
and Brazil you could you go to a doctor
you go to hospital now actually that's a
little bit misleading because in many
countries the public system is
underfunded so the wealthy will go to
private doctors and private hospitals
Roger it's still kind of two tiered but
in a different way but at least for the
general population you're guaranteed
some level of health care with well I
certainly hope that with these uh any
upcoming elections I mean people are fed
up if you look at what the Republicans
and the Democrats are putting out there
for the presidency it's really it's
really terrible I hope that we just have
the lies to take a look at the figures
on respect for the political system wait
Anna Congress its single digit single
digits if president maybe you know
fifteen percent even the Supreme Court
which used to be high up i think is in
the low 20s now well people are getting
aware but they still want considered
outsiders of spoilers and we don't have
time to get into that um that's actually
the book i'm writing is called election
spoilers and i'm saying that the
spoilers of the media who sent through
the candidates not the candidates who
challenge the system yeah and there's
not much difference between the two as
time goes on i mean they're both
corporate funded parties what's happened
over the years is both parties are
shipped to the right a kind the
republicans are shifted so far that
they're simply off the spectrum off the
spider or not
parliamentary party anymore not there
fact one of the leading conservative
commentators Norman Ornstein very
respected conservative political analyst
and art and Enterprise Institute he
simply described the modern Republican
Party is a radical insurgency why
abandoned any commitment to the
parliamentary process yeah and you can
see that the less and they get away with
it so far here comes our for it you've
you've got to this the balls you've said
I've said is the reason I'm doing this
our planets future is at stake right now
if we don't turn this thing around well
actually this is the first time in human
history when we have to make decisions
which will determine whether our
grandchildren have a decent world to
live in we're advancing towards a
precipice which we might fall over in
which case the chances for decent human
survival are finished and there are
basically two crucial problems one is
nuclear weapon Jim by a miracle virtual
miracle we survived the last 70 years
without destroying ourselves he asked
always on there's always a chance all
the other is a simply climate
catastrophe right which is coming along
and we can try to deny it if we like but
that's determining the fate of our
future generations people wake up for
that election time that's what I hope
they can owe you
the population is in favor of stronger
action but the decision making classes
are not now so we read the newspapers
they tell you about the marvels of the
great expansion of fossil fuel
production it's going to lead to a
century of energy independence where
that means oil companies are prepared if
the current glut declines to four new
oil into the market it's just wonderful
except that it's destroying ourselves
it's unbelievable what people did for
profit well I hope that things do turn
around in the next election of me is for
those 545 people who Charlie spoil up I
mean basically well governors have a
little bit steak tips of Congress Mitch
McConnell his chief priority is to
ensure that we maximize the use of the
most destructive fossil fuels and the
coal because his kin is rich
constituents and you may profit profit
over people at the expense of the world
in which it can't in this case it's
really easy and Germany is it's shutting
down there than including you get the
solar we get the geothermal we get the
help Wiggy that's the most we could deal
with this capitalist economy in the
world and they're moving toward
sustainable energy Wow well I hope we
end up with the same as we don't have
much time gotta keep writing definitely
