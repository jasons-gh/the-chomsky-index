go what are the main differences between
libertarian socialism and revolutionary
state socialism well state socialism in
my view is just a contradiction in terms
you can't have workers control over
production which is socialism also has a
core notion you know back to the gangs
in the 19th century and the core notion
is workers control over production it's
very similar to a dark ism but at least
that's the core you can't have that if
you have total state control so for
example by that standard the United
States was more socialist than Russia
was I mean work for self control
production but they have at least some
influence and go at strike no they can
they can part to goodness there are many
of these co-determination and so on that
Russia was a euro that was the least
socialist country in the world so I
would just say that state socialism's
just a contradiction you can't talk
about it but so the only kind of
socialism there is is one or another
variety of libertarian socialism
