I think it's probably a good thing that
this meeting comes at the end of the
week of terror in South Vietnam I know I
was much shocked by and I'm sure you
were it's hard to know what one can say
about the events of the past week my own
reaction is one of horror at the
terrible slaughter of awe at the amazing
heroism of those who are officially
designated as our enemies of guilt of
guilt that we still permit this heart to
continue even now even after this week
no one doubts that in some hideous sense
of the word the United States can still
obtain a victory can still win in
Vietnam but if the men in Washington are
still at all rational they must realize
that this can only be a victory of the
graveyard
the only possible American victory is
the one that was described a couple of
weeks ago by the editor of the Vietnam
Guardian one of the many journals
suppressed by the Saigon government he
said you cannot defeat the other side
militarily unless you devote the next 30
or 40 years to it you can win if you
keep killing for a generation
you simply exterminate all of yet
nummies the way you killed the Indians
in America and there will be no more war
there's no reason to doubt that this
assessment is accurate and I suppose
that Washington must understand that but
if we're going to be thinking at all
seriously
about tactics about actions that might
contribute to ending this war short of
absolute annihilation we'd better try to
understand the mood in Washington not
yet wrapped up and romantic delusions
that come from talking to one another
too much and try to capture the mood to
react properly to the mood in the
country as well unfortunately we have a
president who probably represents pretty
accurately the main
stream of American opinion although
people in the peace movement don't like
to believe this I don't like to believe
that either but I'm afraid that Lyndon
Johnson probably does reflect prevailing
American attitudes when he says as he
did that without superior airpower
America is a bound and throttled giant
impotent and easy prey to any yellow
dwarf for the pocket knife what is
important about such statements is not
so much the undercurrent of racism
though that's bad enough but rather the
idea that we are prey to these yellow
dwarfs with their pocket knives
obviously we are easy prey to them only
in their countries where we have a
perfect right to be secretary McNamara
the well-known dove takes essentially
the same position although he does it
with a little bit more grace and
subtlety in his farewell testimony this
week which is well worth reading
he states that we are fighting in
Vietnam a quote to preserve the
principle that political change must not
be brought about by externally directed
violence and military force that's
political change that must not be
brought about by violence and force of
course political stability on our terms
may be brought about by externally
directed violence and military force as
we are now doing and of course he goes
on even beyond that to imply that we
uniquely of course have even the right
to care to use our violence to carry out
military and social political and social
change so he says I quote again
pacification involves nothing less than
the restructuring of Vietnamese society
pacification which of course for a year
has been under the direction of the
American military close to a year the
principle that we are fighting for then
is not the principle of non-intervention
in the internal affairs of other
countries no old-fashioned nonsense like
that but rather the principle that the
United States has the role of
international judge and executioner and
that it alone has
principal these are what secretary
McNamara's words mean and they are in
fact what they what he states when you
listen to them carefully and you pay
attention to their implications McNamara
also I'm sure the Vietcong will be glad
to hear this he explains that we do not
seek the surrender of the Vietcong
forces we would be content to see them
lay down their arms that's a quotation I
have to say that this is censored
testimony and probably in the uncensored
part he explains the difference between
surrendering and laying down your arms
but I don't know about that now of
course it's easy to make fun fun of
idiotic pronouncements like this but
amusement fades when you begin to
calculate the human cost or when you
begin to realize that the spectrum of
responsible opinion extends all the way
over from secretary Rusk on the one hand
to McNamara on the other McNamara who
takes for granted that we alone among
the nations of the world have the
authority to decide what are the
legitimate elements in Vietnamese
society and to use our incredible
military force to impose on Vietnam the
institutions that we and our wisdom and
benevolence have designed for them why
do we have this right the answer has
been given by a great many statesmen and
scholars we have this right because it
is in our national interest our
president has expressed the matter quite
clearly when he said quote there are
three billion people in the world and we
have only 200 million of them we are
outnumbered 15 to 1 if Mike did make
right they would sweep over the United
States and take what we have we have
what they want we're going to have to
stand and say Mike doesn't make right
as we're doing in South Vietnam for
example or in Guatemala say we're
according to the vice president
vice-president Rojas American Plains
based in Panama have been carrying out
at home raids against villages suspected
of harboring rebels
that's quote from LeMond those of you
who are so benighted that you're reading
is restricted to the American press
would not know of this statement by the
Guatemalan vice president when President
Johnson pleads that we're defending
ourselves from a superior force and that
we must stand in Vietnam or else they
will sweep over the United States and
take what we have when he says these
things he is unfortunately representing
a substantial and in fact probably
dominant body of American opinion to us
it seems hard to imagine that 30 years
ago
enlightened German opinion could believe
that there was a Jewish Bolshevik
conspiracy that was threatening the
survival of Germany the bearers of the
spiritual values of Western civilization
to others it may be equally difficult to
take seriously the picture of the
strongest richest country in the world
cowering in terror behind its nuclear
missiles and atomic warheads in fear
that what we have will be taken away if
we allow a tiny country halfway around
the world to follow its own course and
freedom from American domination but if
we want to think realistically about
America and what we ought to be doing in
America then we'd better bear in mind
that this is a pretty accurate
characterization we'd also better bear
in mind that this is a country where a
leading liberal commentator after all
that's happened in the past three years
can still describe the American war in
Vietnam in these terms
America is fighting a war now on the
principle that military power shall not
compel South Vietnam to do what it does
not want to do that man does not belong
to the state this is the deepest
conviction of Western civilization as
I've just pointed out we're not the
first nation to have seen itself as
fighting to defend the deepest
convictions of
civilization and when James Reston who
that was a quotation from can describe
what we're doing in Vietnam in these
terms then we can see what a long road
lies ahead before there's any hope that
this country will recover its political
sanity this is the context in which we
have to ask about what we're going to do
in connection with draft resistance and
other things it goes without saying that
inquiry protests educational efforts
must continue and intensify but dissent
everyone would agree must be coupled
with political action what means of
political action are open to us
unfortunately the political system
simply is incapable of coming to grips
with issues of war and peace we may wish
that this were otherwise but facts can't
be wished out of existence and it is a
fact the remarkable fact that in this
democracy there is not a single public
figure there is no segment of the mass
media that is willing to advocate or
even seriously to consider what is the
dominant opinion of mankind including
the so-called free world namely that the
United States should put an end to its
aggression and withdraw from Vietnam
as long as that remains the case it's
simply pointless and silly to think
about political action against the war
the political issues are not arising and
therefore there's nothing the one could
do about them even granted that we could
do about them something about them
worthy to enter the political arena and
that's not obvious in fact the only form
of political action that's open to an
American citizen today American citizen
who opposes American wars of aggression
is some form of resistance I'm afraid
now resistance is often discussed in
terms of moral responsibility and I
think this is quite proper it's quite
fair certainly is a moral responsibility
to avoid complicity in criminal acts and
to support those who are courageous
enough to refuse to be the agents of
government terror but it should not be
overlooked that resistance is also a
political act it's an act that raises
the domestic cost of American aggression
and that therefore poses certain
conditions that anyone must face who
makes the decisions to continue with
this aggression this is true in a
country that does regard aggression as
legitimate when it's not too costly one
has to think in these terms whether one
likes it or not there are many respects
in which one could exemplify this and I
want to even bother spelling out the
details because I think they're obvious
take the case of graduate students the
government's got to decide within the
next couple of months what to do about
graduate students they put off the
decision for a year if they exempt them
then the draft resistance people have a
very effective organizing tool I think
for that may be able to let them reach
into working class lower middle class
neighborhoods to point out clearly it'll
be then perfectly obvious that this is a
war that the rich can buy their way out
of I don't think that the government is
going to allow that tool to be used I
think it's probably politically
difficult or impossible in an election
year at least to give a blanket
exemption to students on the other hand
if they do not if they decide the draft
students it's possible that they might
run it up against very serious
resistance that the government will be
forced to carry out repressive acts
against the socio-economic elite the
leaders of the next generation and
that's a very different matter
from shooting down people in the streets
of Detroit in Newark this is really
costly and furthermore I think that we
have to recognize that one of the costs
of the war a cost that I'm sure they're
well aware of in Washington is just the
disaffection just the contempt for the
government that is more and more
widespread among young people no doubt
that repression and punishment of those
who refuse to take part in war crimes
can only deepen this disaffection and by
doing so can increase in a very serious
and significant way I think the cost of
this and maybe future wars and it goes
without saying that at all to support in
any form direct involvement will
increase substantially the cost of
repression hence the political value of
these acts if those were here and others
like them in other cities if they're
willing if we're willing to give part of
our incomes and part of ourselves I hope
that's increasing order of importance to
this effort then I think it can be a
very powerful force one that shouldn't
be underestimated
now there are a lot of things that can
be said about the more long-range
significance of resistance I don't think
that it has to be thought of simply as a
negative act directed against this war
if we think about the kind of country we
live in the kind of role it plays in the
world then I think we can easily see why
we can hope at least we can try to look
for ways to turn this movement of
resistance into a weapon that will go
beyond the an act kind form of action a
nucleus of action will go beyond trying
to put a stop to this war before it
leads to annihilation of the Vietnamese
or something worse there are many
aspects of the situation that could be
discussed one that I think is
particularly frightening is simply the
fact is simply the enormous coverage
that's given to the atrocities that are
committed in the war of course of people
who were involved in the peace movement
through their share and increasing the
exposure to these atrocities and through
the quite without their efforts through
the mass media
were absolutely saturated with evidence
of American war crimes is undoubtedly
the first war in history where any
country has exposed its own war crimes
on the front pages and in the television
will I wasn't television before not you
know on the surface this looks like a
sign of the democratic free character of
the society but probably all it is is a
sign of the fact that nobody cares about
these things as long as we're doing them
and in fact the more we have this
saturation the greater the danger is in
a very serious sense this impact on the
American public of the vast coverage of
these events I think is very frightening
in its implications it can lead to a
kind of habituation to atrocity to a
raising of the level at which one gets
shocked that could be a very fearful
thing and I think points to what may be
the real long-range significance of the
kind of resistance that's now in its
incipient stages the sort of resistance
is forcing us to confront the most
important issue that can possibly exist
in the world dominant power in the
country that by any objective standards
is the most aggressive and expansionist
in the world this resistance is forcing
us to be aware of our own passive
complicity and it's engaging us in a
struggle against an otherwise inevitable
accommodation to still greater and
unending violence American power is in
fact so overwhelming that there is no
one in the world who can call us to
account the responsibility to do so lies
on American citizens on US and on us
alone quite apart from these long-range
issues I think if we think merely in
terms of immediate political impact
maybe political effectiveness then a
very strong argument can be given that
support for resistance does constitute
the most effective way for a citizen to
raise the domestic cost of American
aggression in this war and to make his
own personal contribution to ending it
or at least limiting it probably and we
should not forget this at great cost to
himself
personally I believe that if American
democracy does survive this crisis then
the Fort Hood 3 and the Boston Five and
other people like them will be
recognized as the people who struggled
to save humanistic and democratic ideals
in the face of the apathy and the
ignorance and the moral cowardice of the
society as a whole but
but I do want to emphasize the word
ultimately ultimately maybe a long way
off and ultimate vindication
maybe little comfort for those who will
suffer for their commitment to the
values that we all pretend to hold it's
up to the rest of us to make sure that
this is not so - stand beside them in
their effort to bring this war to an end
and to save our own country from
becoming an object of hatred and
contempt for civilized mankind this I
think is the problem that we face today
that we should be thinking about at what
is a critical and what may be a
desperate moment in American history
