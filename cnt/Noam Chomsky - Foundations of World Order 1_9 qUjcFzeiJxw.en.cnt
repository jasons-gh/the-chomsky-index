you
ha you patient souls who've been here
for a long time holding your seats
welcome I'm Jane Gould the coordinator
of the technology and culture forum and
i'd like to welcome you to tonight's
program Noam Chomsky on the foundations
of World Order 50 years of the UN the
World Bank the IMF and the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights before we
turn to tonight's program I call your
attention to the technology and culture
forums next program reinventing
universities for the 21st century
there's a sign with all the information
above my head and do come Wednesday
March third at five-thirty p.m. in 6 120
the technology and culture forum will be
hosting for more programs this spring if
you'd like to be on our mailing list you
can either sign on one of the sheets of
paper on the table in the hall as you
leave or go to our website and just put
yourself on to the list now to tonight's
program we're all here because we want
to hear Noam Chomsky Chomsky is honored
by MIT as an institute professor his
doctoral thesis on transformational
analysis began his radical
transformation of the field of
linguistics honorary degrees learned in
professional societies significant
awards his list is luminous few have
escaped his notice and yet as a public
intellectual professor Chomsky has
always taken seriously his
responsibility to stimulate and lead
public debate in addition to speaking
and writing on linguistics and
philosophy he's taken on intellectual
history contemporary issues
international affairs u.s. foreign
policy to name a few of his key topics
late this last year I received an email
encouraging me to participate in a 70th
birthday card for Noam Chomsky online
global hundreds thousands the list went
on and people couldn't resist saying how
they'd been challenged and inspired by
Chomsky tonight he's here to look at the
last 50 years what we created what we
have and where we are to go Noam Chomsky
just realize well listening to chain
announced the title that's also just
about 50 years since I walked into this
building for the first time but I won't
talk about that we've just passed the
50th anniversary of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights that was a
few weeks ago the human rights regime
which was encoded in that declaration is
one of the pillars of the system of
World Order that was constructed on the
wreckage of World War two there was
there were two other major foundation
stones one was the international
political order which is articulated in
the United Nations Charter and the third
is the international economic system
sometimes called the Bretton Woods
system designed primarily by the United
States and Britain right at the end of
the war these three systems were closely
integrated conceptually and in fact the
thinking behind them illustrates that as
does the their interactions over the
years and to a degree that's quite
unusual in world affairs the three
foundations reflected public attitudes
and concerns over quite a wide range for
that very reason the principles that
were articulated and some extent
instituted those principles were quite
distasteful to elite elements who were
in a namely those who were actually in a
position to construct and shape and
guide the actual world order and they
very quickly took steps to dismantle or
at least attenuate
lofty principles the conflicts over
these matters constitutes a large part
of modern history post Cold War history
that's not the usual framework of
analysis for discussing it but in my
opinion it ought to be well large issues
there's lot in print there's many
treatises yet to be written even to be
researched I don't think the topics have
been addressed with anything like enough
seriousness but to try to give I'll try
to give some indication of why I think
that's an appropriate and instructive
way to view the contemporary world
system it's it's our origins I'm the
Second World War and maybe it's likely
future so the main question that I want
to get to is what has been the fate of
the three basic and integrated pillars
of world order that were established
half century ago and specifically what
has been the role of the United States
which has been the primary actor on the
world scene throughout remain so and the
one that's most important for us for
obvious reasons independently of the
significance and scale of its
contributions which are usually quite
great for equally obvious reasons well
that's the main question that I want to
get to but I'd like to approach it by a
detour just to make life more
complicated and the detour has two
tracks that I'd like to explore a little
bit and then from them get back to the
questions the first track is simply to
remind everyone of what you already know
we have to bear in mind that the
questions are not abstract and they're
not about some distant planet so it's
not like academic topic for an academic
seminar we're dealing with questions of
life and death
of suffering and pain and despair the
voices that are heard not that one the
voices that are hurt are those of the
are those are the rich and the powerful
naturally there are also those who have
sought to be a voice for the voiceless
their fate hasn't been too happy some
were simply assassinated by our hands or
those working for us a chapter of modern
history that one doesn't read about too
much in fact they were assassinated and
there's quite a number of them ee in
that they were first killed and then
silenced so you can do a check and see
how many your friends can tell you the
names of Eastern European dissidents and
murdered their murdered counterparts in
Central America and how many books
you've read by one and by the other and
so on it's an instructive lessen the but
the voices that we hear the ones that
remain are typically the powerful and
that's important because that's not the
only voice that's the voice of a small
minority here and on tiny minority
worldwide well let me illustrate from
right now there are major stories in the
press these last few days on the g7
meetings the meetings of the seven
richest industrial countries and on the
interchanges between the their leaders
so for example president sure acts of
France his interchanges with the robert
rubin who I guess might be called
co-president of the United States we
have to give Alan Greenspan at least
half the president
the so that's been all over the the
front pages and those discussions are
interesting and tell you a lot look at
them closely they even not so closely
they review the outcome of these
discussions g7 and the other
interchanges reveal the power of the
United States in a rather dramatic form
and also its extreme isolation even
among the richest countries and if
you'll go more closely and you learn a
lot about the true nature of the
actually functioning international
economic system of the difference
between the doctrines that apply to the
rich and the powerful by their
insistence and the opposite doctrines
which are imposed on everyone else that
comes out with great darkness and the
articles discussing the these these
issues come back to that in connection
with the third pillar of World Order the
international economic system well there
are no stories and I mean none on the
g15 meetings which have taken place at
the same time in Jamaica last couple
weeks in the in the national press it's
literally zero I rely on a database
search done by a friend who has access
to that monster the New York Times The
Washington Post and The Wall Street
Journal have no word on them there's no
shortage of information associated press
had stories that they weren't run and
the BBC World Service has had extensive
coverage and if you look around the
peripheral press particularly in Florida
there was coverage Florida I presume
because of the Latin American connection
but the National Press blanked it out
now these aren't Sonny that these aren't
minor countries these are major these
are not what are dismissed as basket
cases like sub-saharan Africa this is
Argentina Brazil Chile
ago India Indonesia Nigeria quite
substantial countries in which people
expect to make a lot of money as they
can 17 of them even though it's called
g15 a good part of the world and they do
have something say believe it or not and
you can even read it for example you can
read it on the front page if you happen
to subscribe to the leading journal and
Egypt the the ala Haram the which has an
English edition so you can read it in
English the United States what they say
at the g15 meeting is that the United
States and Britain is mostly quotes are
unwilling to enter into a dialogue with
the south the south is what is
euphemistically called the developing
world which direction they're developing
you can argue about the US and Britain
are unwilling to engage to enter into a
dialogue with the south which is always
forced to make concessions in the World
Trade Organization to the benefit of the
rich the true story of globalization
they continue is that the North has
MIT's g7 has to make maximum benefit and
the south is only entitled to a limited
margin of development and if this margin
is crossed the Western speculators are
there to take you down as quickly as
they can that's not false but it's a
considerable understatement and the
writers surely know it us power and
violence has also been there to take you
down as quickly as it can if countries
try to pursue the path of independent
development of what's called in u.s.
planning circles radical nationalism or
economic nationalism or sometimes even
excessive development that's not to be
permitted in the current period of
globalization for reasons I get back to
you don't have to send the Marines that
often the speculators can do
we can do the job the g15 meeting goes
on to issue a plea to western investors
it says we don't want to stifle you but
we want to know who you are and we want
you to come and go in an orderly fashion
that's precisely what the north will not
accept the demand that that not be
accepted is a core part of the
multilateral agreement on investments
which has been deflected thanks to
activist pressure which succeeded in
escaping media controls but deflected
not stopped coming back in other ways
all right and the point is to prevent
what the g15 plea from being realized
