well the notion security is used as if
we understand it now here's a
contribution that the philosophers could
make there's a standard line in a belief
in international relations theory and
public commentary and so on that the
main goal of governments is to achieve
security but tooth questions are never
asked security for whom and security
against whom okay that's worth thinking
about those things one thing you can if
you look at the record it shows quite
clearly that governments any system of
power whether it's a government or
corporation or whatever it may be is
interested in security for itself you're
interested in security for state power
and they're interested in security
against their enemies but a primary
enemy is always the domestic population
that's shown over and over so I don't
know just take take one recent event the
United States recently joined in a
request to the International Criminal
Court to try Syrian leaders for the
crimes of their Committee but there was
a proviso they cannot inquire into
crimes of Israel and they cannot inquire
into crimes of the United States
actually the second condition is
redundant because there's legislation in
the United States which grants to the
president the right to use force to
rescue that's the term any American
who's brought to the Hague for trial
sometimes called the Netherlands
invasion act the US government is self
immunized against international law this
is one of many examples well that's an
illustration of an interesting topic I'm
time to go into it but in
that's an illustration of how one of men
eight of Hell states are interested in
their own security and what about the
enemies like the domestic population
well yeah they don't not concerned with
air security in fact if you want to
investigate how state didn't is quite an
interesting record but if you look at
the actual record of state policy it
constantly subjects the general
population to extreme dangers in the
interest of protecting state security
the whole history of nuclear weapons
illustrates this quite dramatically
taken even more of this example right
now there's a major threat to the
security of populations environmental
catastrophe huge threat how our powerful
States reacting by increasing the threat
give you the details if you like you're
probably familiar with them the security
of their own population is a very
marginal concern for States security for
themselves is a concern security for
concentrations of private power is a
concern the plenty of illustrations of
that right now for example there's two
huge trade agreements being negotiated
the trans-pacific and transatlantic
enormous efforts and international
economic Arrangements notice that these
are being conducted in secret the
domestic population which is an enemy is
not allowed to know about it it's not
completely in secret it's not secret
from the hundreds of corporate lobbyists
and lawyers who are actually writing the
legislators these agreements they know
about it but it's and if you look at the
agreements they have almost nothing to
do with trade they certainly have
nothing at all
with free trade now they have to do with
investor rights that's an example of the
one of many of the ways in which states
preserve the security of the 1% you were
talking about concentrations of private
economic power it's not a big surprise
because it's those concentrations that
mostly make the laws and determine
policy so naturally they're concerned
with their own security but not security
of populations now let's go back to the
question of whether suppose that in the
United States we were capable of
preventing the National Security Agency
from following you around with your
because your cell phone say and and
storing the information about who you
talk to where you are and so on how
would your security be harmed if that
was stopped I mean it doesn't have a new
with the Russians and the Chinese of
course we don't want them to do it
either but they're probably incapable of
it we don't want anyone to do it
we don't want the Czech government to do
it but no personal security is harmed if
the United States
you know the dinosaur in the room stops
doing it's there it just isn't an issue
there there's another question should
government's conduct intelligence about
other states well that's a separate
question
so should Russia for should Iran let's
say try to figure out what the United
States and Israel are trying to do you
know they have every reason to do that
after all the United States and Israel
are violating international law everyday
by by stating that all options are open
with regard to Iran that is a meaning
that means that their daily threatening
Iran with war
and in fact even nuclear war that's what
all options or pokken means they take a
look at the United Nations Charter which
is the foundation of modern
international law article 2 bans the
threat or use of force and International
Affairs so they are violating it daily
and therefore Iran certainly has a right
to try to figure out what they're doing
and you can think of other cases where
states that are under a taxi or a threat
of attack have a right to carry out
intelligence efforts there's one
striking case that this is it's quite
real in fact right now as you may know
or should know for 50 years the United
States has been attacking Cuba
large-scale terrorist war not small
large-scale terrorist or economic
embargo economic strangulation just a
couple of days ago the US Justice
Department slammed the French bank with
a huge fine maybe ten billion dollars
because they claimed that the French
Bank is violating US sanctions against
Cuba it's one of the charges what's the
justification for those sanctions none
just part of an effort to undermine and
destroy Cuba the Cubans have this also
involves terror attacks direct terror
attacks a couple of years ago the Cuban
Cuban intelligence infiltrated Florida
these come from Florida the terror
attacks they infiltrated the Florida
exile community to try to determine when
terror what kind of terror attacks were
being planned and they got a lot of
information they managed to infiltrate
it they invited the Cuban government
invited the FBI the US National
please ativan to present them with the
information about terror attacks being
planned against Cuba on u.s. territory
which is of course a crime in the United
States how did the US government react
by arresting that people who infiltrated
and presented them with the information
some of them are in jail maybe for life
long jail sentences you probably don't
know about this because the Western
propaganda system carefully protects
people from knowing about your own
crimes you've got to know about the
crimes of enemies but your own best not
to know about it's part of the
protection of state power from the
domestic population of these this isn't
I'm not making this I'm not this is not
a hypothetical case this is an actual so
sure there are K and I think it was
quite legitimate for the Cuban
government to try to detect and discover
the terrorist activities on US soil
and to present the information to the
American government I think that's quite
legitimate so there are cases I think
I'm sure you think of others where
intelligence activities could be
legitimate but activities like a
violation of the US Constitution and
it's generalizing it globally say to
determining what you are doing every
time you walk across the street with
your cell phone I don't think that's a
legitimate it doesn't and if it was
stopped nobody would be harmed thank you
