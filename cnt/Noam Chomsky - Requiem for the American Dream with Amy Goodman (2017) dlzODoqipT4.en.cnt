well no it's wonderful to be together
with you again in order to ensure that
the audience stays to the end do you
think we should save that to what we
practice for the end very ok we'll do
that we're gonna get to the book and I
think it's intimately related to so much
of what's happening in this country in
the world today but I wanted to ask you
about this comment that you made that
the Republican Party you said is the
most dangerous organization in world
history
can you explain I also said that it's an
extremely outrageous statement but the
question is whether it's true I mean has
there ever been an organization in human
history that is dedicated with such
commitment to the destruction of
organized human life on earth not that
I'm aware of is the Republican
organization I hesitate to call it a
party committed to that overwhelmingly
there isn't even any question about it
take a look at the last primary campaign
plenty of publicity a very little
comment on the most significant fact
every single candidate either denied
that what is happening is happening
namely serious move towards
environmental catastrophe or there were
a couple of moderates so-called Jeb Bush
who said maybe it's happening we really
don't know but it doesn't matter because
fracking is working fine so we can get
more fossil fuels then there was the guy
who was called the adult in the room
John Kasich
the one person who said yes it's true
global warming's going on but it doesn't
matter he's the governor of
in Ohio we're gonna go on using coal for
energy and we're not going to apologize
for it so that's a hundred percent
commitment to racing towards disaster
then take a look at what's happened
since the November 8th was the election
there was as most of you know I'm sure a
very important conference underway in
Morocco Marrakech Morocco almost roughly
200 countries at the United Nations
sponsored continent a conference which
was the goal of which was to put some
specific commitments into the verbal
agreements that were reached at Paris in
December 2015 the preceding
international conference on global
warming the Paris conference did intend
to reach a verifiable treaty but they
couldn't because of the most dangerous
organization in human history the
Republican Congress would not accept any
commitments so therefore the world was
left with verbal promises but no
commitments
well last November each they were going
to try to carry that forward on November
8th in fact there was a report by the
World Meteorological Organization very
dire analysis of the state of the
environment and the light likely
prospects also pointed out that we're
coming perilously close to the tipping
point where which was the goal the goal
of the Paris negotiations was to keep
things below that coming very close to
it and other ominous predictions at that
point the conference pretty much stopped
because the news came in about the
election and it turns out that the most
powerful country in human history the
richest most
powerful most influential the leader of
the free world has just decided not only
not to support the efforts but actively
to undermine them so there's the whole
world on one side literally at least
trying to do something or other
not enough maybe although some places
are going pretty far like Denmark a
couple of others on the other side in
splendid isolation is the country led by
the most dangerous organisation in human
history which is saying we're not part
of this in fact we're going to try to
undermine it and we're going to maximize
the use of fossil fuels could carry us
past a tipping point
we're not going to provide funding for
as commited in Paris to developing
countries that are trying to do
something about the climate problems
we're going to dismantle regulations
that retard the impact the devastating
impact of production of carbon dioxide
and in fact other dangerous gases
methane others okay so the conference
kind of pretty much came to a halt of
the question that continued but the
question was can we salvage something
from this wreckage and pretty amazingly
the countries of the world were looking
for salvation to a different country
China here we have a world looking for
salvation to China of all places when
the United States is the wrecking
machine that's threatening destruction
in that with all three branches of
government in the hands of the most
dangerous organization in human history
and I don't have to go through what's
happened since but the in general the
cabinet appointments are designed to
assign to people whose commitment and
beliefs are that it's necessary to
destroy everything in their department
that could be of any use to human beings
and wouldn't just increase profits and
power and they're doing it very
systematically one after another
EPA Environmental Protection Agency has
been very sharply cut actually actually
the main department that's concerned
with the environmental issues is the
Department of Energy which also had very
sharp cuts particularly in the
environment related programs in fact
there's even a ban on posting and
publishing information and material
about this and this is not just at the
national level of the Republican Party
whatever you want to call it has been
doing this at every level so in North
Carolina a couple of years ago where the
legislature mostly thanks the
gerrymandering is in the hands of the
Republicans there was a study they
called for a study on the effect of
sea-level rise on what sea-level rise
might be on the North Carolina coast and
there was a serious scientific study
which predicted not all forget how many
years not a long time about roughly a
meter rise in sea level which could be
devastating to Eastern North Carolina
and the legislature did react namely by
passing legislation to ban any actions
or even discussion that might have to do
with climate change actually the best
comment of this wish I could quote it
verbatim was by Stephen Colbert who said
if you have a serious problem the way to
deal with it is to legislate that it
doesn't exist
problem solved you know this is this is
going on all over the country and it's
not just it's not simply climate change
that's bad enough but there's a another
huge specter that we're kind of trying
to survive under and that's nuclear war
and it's a whole other story here both
the Obama administration and
increasingly Trump are radically
increasing that danger this the threat
of the protection of of the new
developments is captured very
effectively in the best simple monitor
of the state of the world established at
the beginning of the nuclear age by The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists I'm sure
you all know about this but the bulletin
of Atomic Scientists regularly brings
together a group of scientists political
analysts others very serious people to
try to give some kind of estimate of
what the situation of the world is the
question is how close are we to
termination of the species and they have
a clock the Doomsday Clock when it hits
midnight we're finished and of the human
species and much else and the question
every year is how far is the minute-hand
from midnight well in at the beginning
in 1947 the beginning of the nuclear age
it was placed at 7 minutes to midnight
it's been moving up and back ever since
the closest it's come to midnight was
1953 1953 the United States and Russia
both exploded hydrogen bombs which are
extremely serious threat to survival
intercontinental ballistic missiles were
all being developed
this in fact was the first serious
threat to the security of the United
States there's interesting story behind
that that'll put it aside
unless there's time to talk about it but
then it came to two minutes to midnight
and it's been moving up and back since
two years ago 2014 I think it was the
analysts took into account for the first
time something that had been ignore the
fact that the nuclear age at the
beginning of the nuclear age coincided
with the beginning of a new geological
epoch the so-called Anthropocene has
been some debate about the epoch in
which human activity is drastically
affecting the general environment
there's been debate about its inception
but the world geological organization
has recently determined that it's about
the same time as the beginning of the
nuclear age so we're in these two eras
in which the possibility of human
survival is very much at stake and with
us everything else - of course living
all living most living things which are
already under very severe threat well a
couple of years ago I think it was 2014
The Bulletin began to take that into
account and moved the minute hand up to
three minutes to midnight where it
remained last year a couple of - about a
week into Trump's term the clock was
moved again to two and a half minutes to
midnight that's the closest it's been
since 1953 and that means extermination
of the species is very much in very much
an open question I don't want to say
it's solely the impact of the Republican
Party obviously that's false but they
certainly are in the lead in
openly advocating and working for
destruction of the human species I agree
that's a very outrageous statement so I
therefore simply suggest that you take a
look at the facts and see if it has any
merit or if it just should be bitterly
condemned that's up to you
my view of the facts are pretty clear at
this point as president Trump nears his
100th day North Korea and Iran have been
a major focus are you concerned that
with the president at the lowest
popularity rating I think in any
presidents history at this point that he
will focus abroad as he has in the last
few weeks dropping the Moab the mother
of all bombs and Afghanistan bombing the
Syrian government and yet focusing
specifically on North Korea in Iran and
North Korea McMaster general McMaster
the National Security Advisor saying
tensions with North Korea are coming to
a head do you think there is a
possibility that the US would attack
North Korea I mean the this
administration is extremely
unpredictable Trump probably has no idea
what he's going to do five minutes from
now so you can't literally so you can't
really make predictions with much
confidence but I doubt it very much the
reason is very simple an attack on North
Korea would unleash no matter what
attack it is even a nuclear attack would
unleash massive artillery bombardment of
soul which is biggest city in South
Korea right near the border which would
wipe it out including plenty of American
troops would
there doesn't as far I mean I know
technical expert but as far as I can as
I read and can see there's no defense
against that furthermore North Korea
could retaliate against American bases
in the region where there's plenty of
American soldiers and so on also in
Japan they'd be devastated North Korea
would be finished you know so would much
of the region but they but if attacked
presumably they would respond very
likely in fact the responses might be
automatic McMaster at least and mattis
understand this how much influence they
have we don't know so I think an attack
is unlikely but the real question is is
there waivers of dealing with the
problem there are a lot of proposals
sanctions big a new missile defense
system which is a major threat to China
will increase tensions there military
threats of various kinds sending an
aircraft carrier the Vinson to North
Korea except by accident has happened to
be going in the opposite direction but
we'll forget that but these are those
are the proposals that the kind of
proposals is how to solve it actually
there's one proposal that's ignored I
mean you see a mention of it now and
then it's pretty simple proposal
remember the goal is to get North Korea
to freeze its weapons systems weapons
and missile systems so one proposal is
to accept their offer to do that it
sounds simple they've made a proposal
China and North Korea proposed to freeze
the North Korean missile and nuclear
weapons systems and the us instantly
rejected it and you can't blame that on
Trump Obama did the same thing a couple
of years ago same offer was presented I
think was 2015 the Obama administration
instantly rejected it and the reason is
that it calls for a quid pro quo
it says in return the United States
should put an end to threatening
military maneuvers on North Korea's
borders which happened to include under
Trump sending of nuclear capable b-52s
flying right near the border
maybe Americans don't remember very well
but North Koreans have a memory of not
too long ago when North Korea was
absolutely flattened literally by
American bombing that was pregnant there
was literally no targets left and I
really urge people who haven't done it
to read the official American military
histories the air quarterly review the
military histories describing this and
what they describe it very vividly and
accurately they say there just weren't
any targets left so what do we do well
we decided to attack the bomb they dams
the huge dams and it's a major war crime
people were hanged for it at Nuremberg
but put that aside and then comes an
ecstatic gleeful description of the
bombing of the dams and the huge flow of
water which was wiping out valleys and
destroying the rice crop on which Asians
depend for survival lots of racist
common but all with exultation and Glee
you really have to read it to appreciate
it
the North Koreans don't have to bother
reading it they lived it so when nuclear
capable b-52s are flying on their border
along with other threatening military
maneuvers they're kind of upset about it
strange people and they continue to
develop what they see as a potential
deterrent that might protect the regime
from and the country in fact from
destruction this has nothing at all to
do with what you think about the
government so maybe it's the worst
government in human history okay but
these are still the facts that exist so
why is the United States unwilling to
accept an agreement which would end the
immediate threats of destruction against
North Korea and in return freeze the
weapons and missile systems well I leave
that to you and remember that's
bipartisan in this case could could
negotiations go the usual argument as
well you can't trust them and so on and
so forth but there is a history and I
there's no time to run through the
history it's quite interesting begins in
1993 when Clinton under Clinton of the
North Koreans made a deal with Israel to
terminate North Korean missile shipments
to the Middle East which is a great a
serious threat to Israel in the world
and in return Israel would recognize
North Korea the Clinton administration
wouldn't accept that they pressured
Israel which has to do what they're told
to withdraw from it and North Korea
responded by ascending by firing their
first intermediate range missiles I
won't go on with the rest it's a very
interesting story but there was actually
an agreement in 2005 that North Korea
would completely dismantle its nuclear
weapons and missile systems and the
Finnish dismantled them in return for a
non-aggression pact from the United
States an end to threats provision but
by the West that means by the United
States of a a a light water reactor
which can't produce nuclear weapons but
could produce be used for
but a peaceful purposes research medical
other purposes and that was basically
the agreement 2005 didn't last very long
at the Bush administration instantly
undermined it it dismantled the
consortium that was supposed to provide
the reactor and it immediately imposed
pressured that and it when the US
pressures it means it happens banks to
block North Korean financial
transactions including perfectly
legitimate trade so the crazy North
Korean started producing missiles and
nuclear weapons again and that's been
the kind of record all the way through
so yeah maybe the most horrible regime
in human history but the fact of the
matter is the regime does want to
survive and it even wants to carry out
economic development there's pretty
general agreement about this which it
cannot do at any significant way when
it's pouring resources very scarce
resources into weapons and missile
production so they have considerable
incentive including survival to perhaps
continue this process of reacting in a
kind of tit-for-tat fashion to US
actions when the u.s. lowers tensions
they do when we raise tensions they go
on with these plans how about that as a
possibility I mean it is if you look at
the press casually mentioned that it was
not a bad article in The Washington Post
about it recently by US professor
teachers in South Korea so occasionally
it's this strange possibility of letting
the North Koreans do exactly what we
want them to do sometimes this is
mentioned but it's pretty much dismissed
we can't do that sort of thing there are
similar questions to raise about Iran so
Iran is you know the again the adults of
the room
like mattes and so on say it's the
greatest threat to peace you know the
greatest sponsor of terrorism on and on
how is it a sponsor of terrorism well
could go through that so for example in
Yemen that's claimed that they are
providing some aid to rebel tribesmen
hooda tribesmen in Yemen okay maybe they
are what is the United States doing in
Yemen it's providing a huge flood of
arms to its Saudi Arabian Ally who are
destroying the country who have created
a huge humanitarian crisis huge numbers
of people killed massive starvation the
threatening out the bomb a port which is
the only source of aid for surviving
people but Iran is the major source of
terrorism and if you look around the
world there's many questions like this I
don't want to go on too long but very
strikingly and this there's one lesson
that you discover when you carefully
look at the historical record and what
I've just described about North Korea is
pretty typical over and over again there
are possibilities of diplomacy and
negotiation which might not succeed you
can't be sure if you don't try them but
which look pretty promising which are
abandoned
dismissed literally without comment in
favor of increased force and violence in
fact that's also the background for the
1953 moment when the clock moved to 2
minutes to midnight and the u.s. faced
the first serious threat to its security
that in fact you know since probably the
war of 1812 could have been avoided and
there's pretty good evidence that it
could have been avoided but it was the
possibility was literally not even
considered and case after cases like
this it's worth looking at the
historical record
that perspective to ask whether that
general comment has some validity I
think if you do you'll find that it has
considerable merit I last interviewed
you on April 4th just a few weeks ago on
Democracy Now it was the 50th
anniversary of dr. King giving his
beyond Vietnam speech why I opposed the
war in Vietnam where he called the u.s.
the greatest purveyor of violence in the
world and I wanted to turn from North
Korean Iran to Syria it was the day of
the gas attack in Syria so he didn't get
to talk about it very much and I'm
wondering your thoughts on what you
think happened
and then the ensuing u.s. bombing that
President Trump would later talk about
saying he was having chocolate cake with
the Chinese president very very good
chocolate cake when they launched the
Tomahawk missiles into Iraq he said and
he was corrected by the interviewer
right who said it was actually country
ragheads so about the same but well
there are some things we know for sure
there was a serious chemical weapons
attack nobody doubts that it's plausible
that it was the Syrian government which
does raise some questions it's not so
obvious why the Assad regime would have
carried out a chemical warfare attack at
a moment when it's pretty much winning
the war and the worst dangerous phases
is that a counter force will enter to
undermine its progress so it does raise
some questions
it also even though maybe the you can
think up some reason why the Assad
regime which is a murderous brutal
regime might have done it
it's eat there's even another question
as to why the Russians would have
allowed it remember this is a the
airbase is a joint Russian Syrian base
Russia has plenty of clout in Syria and
for them it's a total disaster
they have global concerns not just local
concerns in Syria so there are some
concerns and there are further concerns
there has been the white house did put
out a careful analogous efficient and
intelligence report to explain an
account showing why they had absolute
confidence there was Syrian government
attack now this was analyzed closely by
a very serious and credible analyst
Theodore Postol
from MIT who has a long record of
highly-successful credible analysis is a
highly regarded strategic analyst and
intelligence analyst and he gave a
pretty devastating critique of the White
House report you might you can pick it
up online and take a look at it so there
certainly are some questions that
there's that Syria is capable of a
monstrous act like that the Syrian
government that much is not in doubt but
one question that arises is before doing
something could you find out what
happened okay I mean let's have an
inquiry take a look and see what in fact
actually happened there are plenty of
cases where things that were looked at
things as though things happened but
they didn't I'd remember that report
reporting from Syria is extremely
difficult if reporters go into the
rebel-held areas and don't do what
they're told you know get your head cut
off
Patrick Coburn and others have written
about this just can't seriously report
from those areas there are obvious
questions when you're reporting from the
government so it so the reporters are
there are very good report
doing a serious courageous job but
there's not much you can do so we just
don't know a lot well those are the
circumstances in which the 59 Tomahawk
missiles were launched that's pretty
easy it's easy to sit in Washington and
push a button and say cook kill somebody
that's considered courage you know men
macho was showing how strong we are
what did they actually do well
apparently the Tomahawk missiles were
targeting a part of the airfield that
doesn't seem to be used and in fact the
next day that planes were taken off and
affect the village that was attacked by
the chemical weapons has been even more
heavily attacked by straight bombing
from the Assad government after the 59
Tomahawk missiles so whatever they were
intended to do it doesn't seem to have
anything to do with Syria I suspect that
what they were intended to do was pretty
much what you described to shore up
trumps image as I think was nikki Haley
at the UN said there's a new sheriff in
town so now we've got Wyatt Earp
you know I'm pulling out his gun and
getting rid of the bad guys but no more
of this soft stuff so it was probably an
attempt to shore up that image pretty
much like the bomb in Afghanistan nobody
knows what it was for or what it had to
do with probably destroyed a large part
of Afghanistan and shortly after that
there was a massive incredibly brutal
and successful Taliban attack which
killed a couple hundred recruits
most of them unarmed the young draftees
didn't know what they were doing the was
so bad that the Defense Minister
resigned them scenes of any effect on it
was supposedly aimed at Isis maybe it
was maybe it wasn't they don't seem to
be affected by it so these look like
that doesn't seem to be any strategic
analysis behind
any of these actions as far as anyone
can tell they seem like kind of about at
the level of the Twitter's that keep
coming out is something that kind of
occurs to me so why not do it it's cheap
may kill a lot of people makes me look
good you know makes it seem as if I'm
defending the country and so on it's
hard to see it as anything but that that
these things help the people of Syria
and Iraq is very hard to imagine what do
you think has to be done to solve the
crisis the humanitarian catastrophe in
Syria
it's a terrible catastrophe and you know
unfortunately there isn't a lot that can
be done about it there are some things
that can be done I mean the idea that
you can send in the Marines and bomb and
so on that has a small problem if you do
you probably set off a nuclear war and
not only a Syria destroyed the rest of
Syria but the rest of the world too so
there's a little difficulty in that
scenario whatever one thinks about the
justification for it so what can be done
well one thing that can be done which is
really easy very easy is to take care of
the people fleeing from this disaster
there are huge numbers of people fleeing
from the disaster what do we do about
them make sure they don't come here you
know kind of like people fleeing from
you know my relatives in fact fleeing
tronic flee from Eastern Europe and
under the knots before when the Nazis
were coming along not we don't want them
not here you know so the Syrians don't
come maybe a tiny trickle but very few
come here Europe's not that much better
in fact pretty horrible too so one thing
you could do is just take care of the
people who are fleeing of the disaster
another thing you can do is provide
humanitarian aid for those in the region
there are countries who are absorbing
refugees
remember like take Lebanon it's not a
rich country like us poor country about
40% of the population are refugees many
of them fleeing from the Israeli wars as
far back as 48 and many a huge number of
Syrians Jordan another core countries
absorbed the huge number of refugees in
Turkey has a couple of million Iran has
accepted refugees so there are very
there are poor countries that are
accommodating refugees but not the rich
countries the rich countries it's not
our business certainly not us it's even
more serious problem with regard for
wither for us moral problem with regard
to Central America but let's keep the
Syrian so another thing you do is
provide badly needed aid and assistance
for those who have succeeded in fleeing
the disaster or who remain in parts of
Syria where survival as possible but are
living under horrible conditions
that's all cheap and easy frack tiny
fraction of increasing the military
budget to cause more destruction now the
other thing that can be done and is
being done is to try to support local
efforts throughout Syria at local
ceasefires just to lower the level of
violence that's happening in different
places yeah maybe the people don't like
each other but people sometimes like to
survive and there are accommodations
worked out and they could be helped a
broader possibility is to try to pursue
the negotiations that will lead to some
kind of diplomatic settlement now there
have been efforts but they're mixed and
there probably can't be certain but
there seemed to be possibilities that
were emitted but dismissed so for
example in 2012 there were reports from
former Finnish minister of the sari has
a very credible record of involvement in
international peacekeeping who claimed
that the one that a republic that our
Russian diplomat had proposed a
settlement in which Assad would be eased
out in the course of the negotiations
and some settlement would be reached in
which the Assad regime would be ended
that was apparently dismissed without
comment the US and Britain and France
just assumed at that point that they
could overthrow the Assad regime they
didn't have anything to do with it
that's the report a report appeared in
England as far as I know it was never
even reported here by good reporters is
it true who knows
got a look into it to find out whether
it's true you have to inquire you have
to pursue the options if they exist and
they weren't but there are things that
could be done not what we would like to
see you know it would be nice to see
here's solutions we'll make everybody
happy in the destruction but those just
don't seem on the on the possible agenda
because for all kind of reasons
including the threat of a very serious
war if Russia and the United States
don't act in a high level of concert in
in pursuing whatever they may be doing
you know I wanted to before we get to
your book your latest book ask you about
this latest development in the United
States the director of the Central
Intelligence Agency gave his first major
address and he focused on WikiLeaks and
it looks like now the u.s. is preparing
an arrest warrant for Julian Assange
who's been holed up in the Ecuadorian
Embassy in London for almost five years
now
Pompeyo calling WikiLeaks a hostile
non-state intelligence service calling
Julian Assange himself a demon and said
he's not protected by the First
Amendment your thoughts well I think
speaks for itself
WikiLeaks has released lots of
information that governments don't like
it's overwhelmingly information that
citizens should have it's information
about what their governments are doing
and perfectly natural that systems of
power or don't want to be exposed so
they'll do what they can to prevent
exposure the I think it's a disgraceful
act in fact I think it's disgraceful
even to keep Julian Assange holed up in
the Ecuadorian Embassy he's I did visit
him there once but you can guess
yourself it's in many ways worse than
imprisonment at least if you're in
prison you can see other prisoners and
you can get out and look at the sunshine
oh and then he's in a small apartment
where you can't go out you know go to
the balcony but that's about it
the smaller particle a couple of rooms
inside a small apartments not a big
embassy the embassy is like a kind of an
apartment in London surrounded by police
and so on
there's been no credible basis for any
of this and to go on to try to Cara to
raise it to the level of criminal
prosecutions I think is again one of
these efforts to look tough at home and
the kind of effort that a government
would carry out that is dedicated to
trying to protect itself from exposure
of facts that citizens should have but
systems of power don't want them to have
I think that's the crucial issue that
suggestions are it has to do with his
aiding-and-abetting
perhaps Chelsea Manning and also Edward
Snowden doing that with Edward Snowden
which he openly admits while he's
trapped in the Ecuadorian embassy if if
the charge is true he should be honoured
for Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden
or carried out heroic courageous acts
they fulfilled the responsibility of
somebody who takes citizenship seriously
that is who believes that the people of
a country ought to know something about
what their governments up to okay like
if their government is carrying out
murderous brutal attacks in Iraq people
should know about it takes us back to
Martin Luther King's talk in 1967 if the
government is and corporations to in
deadly are listening in to your
telephone conversations and what you're
doing you know tapping this discussion
so on we should know about it
governments have no right to do things
like that
and people should know about it and if
they think it's okay fine let them
decide not do it in secret
I think people wouldn't agree to it
that's why it's kept secret why else
keep it secret you know and these are
people who exposed it at great risk to
themselves so those are heroic
courageous acts if WikiLeaks was
abetting them more power to them that's
what they should be doing I mean
President Trump endorsed WikiLeaks right
he said I love WikiLeaks to campaign
when it was releasing things that he
liked no any sister no power will do
that you release information that I like
it's great but I don't want to be
exposed
speaking of entities that President
Trump doesn't like he calls the press
the enemy of the American people the
enemy of the people can you assess
as the media assesses President Trump in
his first 100 days the media's behavior
well I think the media has fallen over
backwards to try to give him some
protection and leeway I mean you know
there are things that are so ludicrous
and outrageous that a reporter simply
can't keep from saying something about
them like there's one ridiculous claim
after another that comes out of the
tweets you know three million illegal
undocumented refugees voted for Clinton
Obama the wiretapped the Trump Tower you
know one after another
my sense is this is just a guess that
this is a media strategy that it's the
Bannen from speiser strategy to try to
keep attention focused on the one or
another form of lunacy but not look at
what's actually happening at what's
actually happening is that Paul Ryan and
his associates behind the scenes are
systematically and carefully dismantling
every element of government that is of
any benefit to people and that doesn't
maximize corporate power and profit I
mean the dedication of the Republican
leadership especially the Ryan's type
leadership their dedication to slavish
servility to corporate power and wealth
is just phenomenal I mean read this
morning's business pages their latest
step is to try to prevent exposure of
complaints against banks that carry out
improper activities it is possible now
thanks to consumer protection act for
people to criticize when they think a
bank has carried out some improper
activity but we've got to keep that
silent you know because we have to
protect corporations from any exposure
of criminal activities that might carry
out I mean down to that level in fact
everywhere you look I mean the health
care proposal was so shocking that I was
a proposal basically to cut taxes for
the rich and to ensure that poor and
middle class people the people who voted
for Trump in fact don't get medical aid
as you saw of course the Congressional
Budget Office estimated 24 million
additional people uninsured it was an
analysis of that by Steffie wool handler
David Hamel Stein two health specialists
just studying the relationship between
lack of insurance and deaths there's
plenty of evidence about that and it
turns out that would have meant about
45,000 additional deaths a year well
that's okay as long as you cut taxes for
the rich and step-by-step that's what's
happening behind the facade of Trump
isms and you know speiser antics before
the press and the press is pretty much
falling for it that's what they focus on
not what's being carried out there is of
course a criticism mild criticism of
outrageous lies but I think that just
plays the game that's what the lies are
for then you can yell about the liberal
press that is trying to undermine us so
all the kind of a desperate effort to
keep a con game going a Trump does have
a base voter base he's kicking them in
the face with abandon and the idea is
how do you hold on to them while you're
doing this
not an easy trick and this I think is
part of the con and there are people in
the press who are pointing it out Paul
Krugman for one but nothing like it it
should be which takes us to your latest
book requiem for the American dream
where you talk about the 10 principles
of the concentration of power and wealth
how it's happening what to watch out for
well credit for the 10 principles goes
should go to the producers of the film
what they did was take a lot of
interviews and discussions about all
sorts of things and put them in a
coherent and I think pretty effective
form including formulating ten
principles that's their contribution and
including material that discusses them
and you can look at the film and see or
the book but my feeling is they did a
really good job
this book is accompanying this film that
is now out on Netflix but you talk about
for example principle one reducing
democracy principle to shaping ideology
and principle three redesigning the
economy well all of those fall together
and they're part of a pretty remarkable
development that's taking place in
actually in human history humans in the
last 60 or 70 years have succeeded in
creating a kind of a perfect storm
literally - there's a kind of a pincers
movement that we've created two major
attacks on the prospects for survival
global global warming nuclear weapons of
the Anthropocene the nuclear age and the
third is a set of socio-economic
policies designed to under
the possibility of dealing with the
problems the problems could be dealt
with only in a functioning democracy of
engaged informed people who could make
decisions who would be informed and
could make decisions to deal with the
crisis but the so called neoliberal
programs of the past generation is sort
of somewhat market oriented programs
designed to undermine the institution's
the governmental and popular
institutions that might deal with these
issues all a unit one result is a very
significant decline in democracy you can
see it in the its which is almost built
into the policies it's perfectly built
you can't carry out economic policies of
the type that have been there that have
been implemented in the past generation
in a functioning democracy that's
impossible let me just take a look at
the numbers so the neoliberal programs
were basically taking off right around
1980 escalated started little with the
late Carter escalated under Reagan went
on more under Clinton and so on 2007 was
the peak of supposed success this is
right before the crash a lot of euphoria
among economists political analysts
about the great achievements of
neoclassical economics of the Great
Moderation the you know the the deal
with liberal programs dismantling of
regulations all these great successes
2007 what was happening to American
working people at that time in 2007
wages real wages were lower than they
had been in 1979 when the experiment
took off in fact for the majority of the
population it's a period of
stagnation or decline the benefits have
declined people had been some of the
reasons were explained by Alan Greenspan
head of the Federal Reserve who was
charged pretty much of managing the
economy he testified to Congress that
part of the success of the economy that
low inflation and so on was due to what
he called growing worker insecurity
people working people were insecure they
were intimidated they knew they that
they were in a dangerous situation for
Carius situation as a result they didn't
press for increase in wages invent for
decent wages and benefits they were
willing to accept in fact effective
decline in their living standards and
greenspan who was a close observer of
the economy pointed out that this
continued even when jobs were increasing
in the late Clinton period it was deeply
embedded in the nature of the policies
being carried out that working people
are intimidated the living for Carius
lives that many of them are part-time
they're losing security their unions are
being destroyed and their wages are
declining so it's all great the economy
is wonderfully healthy
can you carry out policies like that in
a democracy I'm gonna people gonna vote
for it
the same in Europe even worse in many
ways the so-called austerity programs
even the economists of the International
like the IMF International Monetary Fund
their own economists say report that
these policies make no economic sense
but the IMF bureaucrats the ones who are
part of the decision-making apparatus
they vote for them how do you and the
effect on Europe is the same thing as
far as democracy is concerned just like
in the United States there's
anger contempt for major Institute for
centrist for you know for the major
governing institutions here is Congress
there are system the political parties
you just saw it in France yesterday the
two major parties were barely visible in
the election and it's happening all over
Europe same kind of thing that's
happening here I mean here it's
happening in a way which is almost
farcical because of the you know the
kind of actions carried out by the
leadership in Europe it's being it's
being pursued in a way which is really
ominous I mean you know if we look for
our back to find a time when fascist
parties actually had power in Europe and
we know what happened and now there are
neo-fascist parties with fascist roots
often which are pretty close to power
even in places like Austria and Germany
which have some memories of France as
well was under the Nazis was extreme
very Pro Nazi country the Vichy
government was rounding up Jews faster
than the Germans one of them really ugly
record and seeing these things come back
or just seeing a situation in which
according to recent polls a majority of
Europeans think there should be no more
Muslims in Europe I mean that evoked
some memories about nice ones and a lot
of you can't attribute it all to the
neoliberal economic policies but a lot
of it does follow from that when you
impose on people circumstances of this
kind you have to make sure that they
have no no way of responding politically
in Europe it's done pretty
straightforwardly the main decisions
about socio economic policies are made
by the so-called troika IMF European
Central Bank and the European Commission
which is unelected so three unelected
body
they make the decisions they do listen
to voices the voices of the northern
banks mostly German banks and the people
suffer and they get their angry
frightened often reacting in dangerous
ways we see similar phenomena here so to
go back to the pincers movement what's
happened is we've created two huge
threats to survival we have
systematically not you and me but the
leadership has systematically created
socio-economic policies which have as a
consequence almost immediate consequence
the undermining of functioning democracy
the one thing that might deal with that
disasters like I said it's kind of
perfect storm real credit to the human
species to have contrived something like
this
principle for is shift the burden onto
the poor in the middle classes principle
5 attacked the Solidarity of the people
6 let's special interests run the Gili
regulators 7 engineer election results 8
use fear and power of the state to keep
the rabble in line is it necessary to
comment as manufacturers consent and
principle 10 is marginalize the
population in fact that's exactly what's
happening and it's the and there's a
reason for it you cannot carry out the
kinds of policies that have been
developed in the last generation and
have the population function
democratically in Europe you can't get
people to vote for policies which are
undermining their lives which are a
limit which are leaving especially the
younger people without any hopes of
decent employment which are driving
people to precarious existence
which are undermining wages reducing
benefits in England right now
undermining threatening what had been
the world's most by far the world's most
effective and efficient national health
system you can't get people to vote for
things like this so what you have to do
is marginalize them in one way or
another turn them against each other
aim turn their anger against vulnerable
people that's a standard technique get
people to don't look at the people who
are really doing this to you look at the
ones who are more vulnerable immigrants
the poor you know Muslims blacks anybody
we're familiar with that too there's not
a slight history about it so sure that
just it's like a it's like a almost
logical consequence of the
socio-economic policies which have been
imposed and lauded in fact by elites
including liberal elites a lot of this
was done but say by the Clinton
administration that's what was held the
deregulation for example at which
immediate very quickly led to one or
after another financial crisis that was
initiated by liberal economists we were
telling us how wonderful it is and
there's actually a you know a theory on
the Oakland neoclassical economic theory
which says yeah that's fine
actually there were people who warned
against it there were people who knew a
lot of left in independent economists
but even people right out of the
mainstream like Joseph Stiglitz Nobel
laureate back around 1995 or so that he
wrote an article actually in a World
Bank research journal in which he warned
against what he called the religion that
the market knows best they says that's
the religion as he put it that's being
followed by economists and he says you
got it take a look at that religion like
a lot of religions just doesn't work
the economic history and even logic show
us lots of things that are wrong about
it but that was pursued with abandon on
the basis of theories of the efficient
markets no rational behavior of rational
expectations and so on none of which had
any empirical basis our founding but
they were the the doctrines were
accepted for the very simple reason that
they were highly beneficial to wealth
and power that makes them acceptable and
you get the results that you have the
undermining of the only means possible
to try to deal with the existential
crises that we have created so again
it's a kind of perfect storm part all
sorts of sources including just socio
economic policies of a bipartisan nature
you talk about a perfect storm do you
think fascism is rising in the United
States I think there's a danger of
fascism in Europe but I don't think that
it's for one that you have to be a
little bit careful about that I mean if
you're a black kid in the ghetto yeah
you can see it kind of looks like
fascism but for most of the country most
of us Pete like people like us there
aren't stormtroopers in the streets
there's no fascist political party
there's no ideology of fascism the Trump
ideology reduces to pretty much me you
know that's
not fascism whatever you think it is so
there's there are serious dangers but
but I think fascism in a way gives it
too much credit it makes it look like
more of a well formulated ideology than
it actually is I think what we're seeing
are the desperate efforts to try to hold
together rising disasters that for which
the means have been undermined in the
resistance from the women's protests
massively larger than president Trump's
inaugural crowd just the day after you
have to look at the tweet to the protest
just this week from the March for
science on Earth Day on Saturday - the
one that's coming up next Saturday April
29th another people's climate March the
March for science took place on every
continent in the world the people's
climate March promises to be much larger
does this give you hope oh there's a lot
of reasons for hope first of all there
is enormous resistance the kind of thing
that's happened sometimes before like in
the early 80s when there was huge public
opposition enormous public opposition to
the dangerous increase in nuclear
weapons development and it had an effect
like I mentioned that the bullet of
atomic scientists a couple years ago
Doomsday Clock went to three minutes to
midnight that's the closest it had been
since 1984 when there was a major war
threat with the increase in nuclear
weapons threats and it was significantly
attenuated by popular action and then of
course there was the activism of the 60s
and the 70s it didn't end in the 60s by
any means so some of the most effective
popular movements with the biggest
impact on the society are really
developed in the 70s like the women's
movement
the environmental movement's and so on
the seeds were in the 60s but they
weren't there yet they were just barely
beginning all of that has really
civilized the society had lots of
positive effects and it goes on right to
the present so the most I think the most
significant fact about the last election
it was not Trump's victory which was
very serious for the country in the
world but the astonishing success of the
Bernie Sanders campaign it's worth
remembering that that broke with over a
hundred years of US political history
u.s. elections are pretty much bought
you can predict with remarkable
precision electoral outcomes by looking
at simple measures like campaign funding
there's very serious work on this the
main person who many of you know is Tom
Ferguson political scientists at UMass
done really good work on this and it's
very impressive work you can almost
predict the outcome of an electoral
campaign president House Senate just by
looking at campaign funding and of
course that's a predictor of policy as
well and that's been well known you know
from way back among people that run
campaigns and up by now the evidence is
overwhelming so what it Sanders do had
no corporate support and no support from
the wealthy no support from the media
which mostly either dismissed or
denigrated him the unknown person nobody
had ever heard of him he was proposing
what about New Deal policies by
contemporary US standards that's what he
called with some justice of political
revolution actually the policies he
proposed it wouldn't have surprised
Dwight Eisenhower he favored similar
policies by and large in fact even said
that
anyone who doesn't accept the New Deal
programs just doesn't belong in our
political system there was strong
supporter of unions and so on we've come
quite a ways since then but Sanders was
a voice going back to the period when
there was very rapid growth the Galit
Aryan growth the serious beginnings of
an attack on some of the deep crimes of
the country that go way back
like the racist crimes and others then
came the 60s the civilizing effect their
consequences then a regression the
regression of the last 30 40 years the
neoliberal programs and all their
consequences and then saying that
without but not ending activism by any
means was plenty of activism and Central
America solidarity movements for example
which was quite effective but Sanders
broke with over a century of history
that's pretty serious and it's having an
effect Fox News informed us should thank
them for that they did a poll of
popularity of political figures how much
do you like various political figures
one person was way in the lead Bernie
Sanders far above anyone else even
higher among young people those are
pretty serious achievements and there's
a lot to build on there and in fact out
of the Sanders popular movement there
are developments growing which I think
are quite constructive and are
coalescing and integrating with many
other things that are happening so there
are plenty of grounds for hope but the
we are in an extremely dangerous
situation it's not I missed some of it
let me know if there's a little time
just go on with something that isn't
reported and is extremely serious last
January a couple of weeks into the a
week or so into the Trump term the
minute-hand
moved that two and a half minutes to
midnight but since then we have learned
things which I suspect would lead the
same group of analysts to push it even
closer to midnight what did we learn not
that your read about it in the press but
what did you learn if you looked at
what's happening well there was an
extremely important article that
appeared in The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists which is the main scientific
journal that deals with nuclear and
other strategic issues at what it
discussed was the nuclear modernization
programs that were initiated by Obama
and are being carried forward more under
Trump and it pointed out it's a
technical article but basically what it
pointed out is that these modernization
programs had already increased the kill
capacity the destructive capacity of the
US nuclear weapon systems by a large
factor by maybe a factor of three enough
they said to completely wipe out the
Russian deterrent okay it's not that the
Russians don't know this Russia does not
have our sophisticated early warning
system satellite warning systems they
have much more primitive ones they don't
get much advanced warning of a alleged
attack there have been many close calls
in the past because of this well now
they're aware that the u.s.
modernization programs are able to
completely wipe out their deterrent
because we so expanded already our
destructive capacity by a huge factor
that would and as they point out in the
article this means that the system of
stability by which the world has been
kind of hanging by a thread a pretty
slender thread it's being seriously
threatened means that in the event of
some rising tension
there's plenty of tensions at the
Russian border not at the Mexican border
at the Russian border plenty of them and
plenty of provocations they might just
out of desperation decide well we better
launch a preemptive strike or we're gone
we don't have a deterrent that's what's
being developed it's another great
contribution of human intelligence to
develop means to make our own
destruction far more likely that's
what's been that's what we've learned in
the last couple months these should be
screaming headlines all over the place
just like the there should be headlines
about the Republican Party trying to
destroy the prospects for organized
human life that's what journalism would
be if it were concerned with bringing to
people the things that are significant
for people who live in a democratic
society who can make decisions about how
to deal with the problems they face in
their lives now almost nothing about it
it's not a secret you know it's not
classified you can find out about it
it's free country in that respect and
important respect should respect and
honor that but these are the things that
are happening right now and it means
that the sledgehammers that we've
constructed in our brilliance to
threaten our survival are getting far
more dangerous while the political
mechanisms that might lead to a sensible
reaction are being destroyed and we see
the impact in the rise of anger contempt
for institutions irrational reactions of
kinds of things that scapegoating you
know things that are pretty dangerous
we've again constructed a remarkable
perfect storm well and we have time for
a few questions maybe five or at the
most six questions and if you can keep
them very brief Ashley is coming to the
mic to organize we have more limited
time than we thought so we're going to
take about one or two questions if
that's okay with everyone thank you
hi I was wondering as an aspiring
linguist
do you believe that linguistics can
provide context to contemporary
political occurrences and if so how
I think linguistics can make a great
many contributions but in another domain
it can help us understand the unique
human capacity that is the fundamental
property that separates us from the rest
of the animal world our ability to do
things like we're doing right now now
where does that come from
we're the only animal that can do
anything remotely like this and it's the
source of creative activities if you
look at the evolutionary record the real
outburst of creative activity appears to
be associated with the emergence of
language and you can learn a lot about
these aspects of human nature and human
creativity and so on but as far as
analysis of the world political
situation is concerned and frankly I
don't think anything's required but
common sense and a little bit of work
common sense
open mind some work it's not hidden
thinks all pretty much on the surface
what we understand is pretty much
apparent to us if we take the trouble to
find out and I don't think any
specialized fields whether it's
linguistics or political science or
economics that can tell you something
but almost everything that's happening
of significance is pretty easy to
ascertain by a person who looks at the
world with an open critical mind and is
willing to search for things that are
not right in the front of you and that
are hidden on the sides but are
available
and final question I I actually was just
wondering if you felt that Abraham
Lincoln was justified in the suspension
of habeas corpus during the Civil War
it's a it's not a trivial question a lot
was at stake but my own feeling is that
it was an act of state that was not
justified well no thank you not only for
this evening but for your decades of
commitment to improving the human
condition
[Applause]
