so for their benefit we have to regiment
their minds the way in army regiments
their bodies ensure that they're under
control make it very clear that they
don't participate in workplace
management and certainly not in the
political arena there to be outside
somewhere and the dedication with it
with which this task has been pursued is
pretty awesome I if you I mean just to
take a right after the fall of the house
of labor in the 1920s when American
labor really was smashed and people were
privatized and tried to accommodate
individually to a most undemocratic
America's Montgomery and others have
pointed out at that was a time when
there was great sort of you know about
the end of history and the topi of the
Masters and it's all over you know us
good guys at one everybody else's at our
feet kind of like some of the stuff you
read the day I and it sort of looked
like that you know that's pretty much
looked that way well a few years laters
you know the whole thing collapsed and
there was militant working class
struggle and the all sorts of other
popular activism and there had to be an
accommodation I'd be some kind of
accommodation to the to these unwashed
masses who were getting out of line
sit-down strikes and all sorts of things
and there was indeed there was this
fragile social compact that Doug Fraser
referred to was indeed established I
wasn't in a gift you know it was won by
struggle and the meaning the labor laws
and the limited social system in fact
American workers back in the 1930s began
to get the rights that had been standard
long before even in much more brutal
societies you read the right-wing
British press over the say early part of
this century they can't believe how bad
American workers are treated the same
was true of visitors from Australia and
so on
by the 1930s the US was sort of brought
into the more or less the mainstream of
industrial society on these matters to a
limited extent in fact but to some
extent and that caused hysteria among
the Masters so you read the business
press x 19 36 or 37 again these are
things which in a really free society
everybody would study in elementary
school because they're really important
that these give the real framework of
the society in my view the they were
talking about the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses and how we must do
something to save ourselves or our way
of life will be gone and we know a lot
of time to do it they started right away
by the late 30s there was a big
anti-labor campaign that had built up
its with new techniques you know there
was still use of force but it was
understood that that's not going to work
the way it did so there was a shift to
more propaganda community Oregon that
the main idea it's called a Johnston the
Mohawk Valley formula I guess it was
cool something like that yeah Mohawk
Valley formula was designed by a lot of
public relations hotshots around 36 37
at the time of some of the steel strikes
to have a new what they called
scientific methods of strike breaking we
don't just come in you know with clubs
and shoot people and smash their heads
and that sort of thing we do it the
scientific way because the old way
doesn't work anymore and the scientific
methods of strike breaking were in fact
drawn from the public relations ideas of
the kind that I talked about the main
idea was to mobilize the community
against the strikers and the union
activists to present a picture which is
by now so standard you can hardly turn
on the tube without seeing it because
it's just poured out and you know like
streams ever since then
the basic idea is to present a picture
of the world that looks kinda like this
there's there's us you know kind of big
happy family in the community the you
know the honest workmen going off every
morning with his lunch box his loyal
wife who's making the meals and taking
care of the kids the hard-working
executive who's toiling day and night
and the interests of the you know his
workers in the community the friendly
banker who's running around looking for
people to lend money to and so on and so
forth that's us you know and we're all
in harmony harmony was a big word we're
in harmony we're all together it's
Americanism you might take a look at
that word Americanism it's an unusual
term it's the kind of term that you only
find in totalitarian societies as far as
I know so like in the Soviet Union
anti-soviet ISM was considered the
gravest of all crimes you know and the
Brazilian generals had some concept like
that aunty Brazilian but try say
publishing a book on aunty Italian ISM
and see what happens in the streets of
Rome or Milan people won't even bother
laughing so ludicrous idea the idea of
Italian ism or you know norway ism or
something like that or just be obvious
ridicule and societies that have some
kind of residue of a democratic culture
inside people's heads i don't mean in
the formal system but in totalitarian
societies it is used and as far as I
know the United States is the only free
society that has such a concept maybe
there's another one if it might try it
in place as you know but anyhow
Americanism is an anti-americanism an
done Americanism and so on these are
concepts which go along with harmony and
getting rid of those outsiders and all
that kind of stuff another part is
simply to induce hatred hatred fear
among people so it's a diverse society
you know you go to Europe most places
are pretty uniform this is a very
diverse society so it's easy for
propagandists it's pretty easy to get
people to you know hate the guy next
door
looks a little different there one thing
or another and huge campaigns go on to
instigate divisions among people I don't
tell you about this it's all so familiar
you go on but but these are very natural
techniques of social control if you
can't control people by force you have
to control their minds you have to
control their attitudes yet exactly like
they say well going back to the Mohawk
Valley formula the idea was to move into
a community flood it with where there's
a strike going on flood it with
propaganda you know take over the media
the churches the schools everywhere else
poor in this propaganda about harmony
and so on the way I described it and
then there's those bad guys out there
we're trying to disrupt our harmonious
slides you know like that union
organizers probably a communist
anarchist anyway and probably unamerican
and he's trying to you know destroy all
these wonderful things we have and we
got a band together and kick him out you
know we have to defend their way of life
against this a lot of religion gets
thrown in remember that the United
States an extremely fundamentalist
country I mean you look comparatively
comparative statistics it usually
religious fundamentalism declines as
industrialization goes up it's free
close correlation the United States is
off the chart you know it ranks with
devastated peasant societies probably
more fundamentalist than Iran there's
all why this is so is I don't know but
I'm in fact complicated question but one
factor is that it was certainly
consciously fomented by Business Leaders
that goes way back to the 19th century
when they were supporting their favorite
II I mean John Dee Rockefellers favor
and evangelists was who scored a lot of
money into with some guy who said that
people ought to have more enlightened
ideas than labor agitation that was one
of his famous phrases and the more
enlightened ideas are you know go to
church and listen to orders and you know
do what they tell you and shut up you
know that's the more enlightened ideas
and it's a really interesting case
because the Mohawk Valley was the model
that was later used for strike breaking
and destruction of the labor movement
work period so it's quite interesting to
see what happened right there instantly
I know any literature on this do you yes
it's these these are untouchable topics
you know and as you can almost say that
anything that's important you know it's
going to matter for people's lives it's
got to be sort of off the agenda and it
sort of makes sense you don't want
people to know about it like you don't
want people to know the wrong kind of
thing after all that makes sense you
know it's like it's not a conspiracy or
anything it's just common sense if you
have a certain degree of power and
authority and privilege you just don't
want people to know things that might be
harmful to them because they're really
like children remember and we're the
ones who have to make the decisions
would
