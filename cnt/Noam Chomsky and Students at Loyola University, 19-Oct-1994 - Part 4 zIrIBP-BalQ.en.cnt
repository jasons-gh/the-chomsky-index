for that I mean I you know they've my
department wouldn't even let me be
department chairman because I'd probably
ruin everything in three seconds
do you see
technological developments like
things like that
self-regulated democratic
possible
well if this if you can hear this was
things like what about alternatives like
say internet and you know electronic
communication and so on which have which
aren't directly under the control
they're just not they're not just big
corporations like the media or so
therefore might have other options it's
a complicated question and I think it's
an interest a very interesting question
interesting see how it works itself out
in the next couple of years the as you
correctly said the internet is for a
special sector Society the Internet's
for the wealthy no you have to be rich
enough to are privileged enough to be
able to get into it yeah but that's
wealthy you know I mean professors like
to complain about how bad their salaries
are but they're like up in the
stratosphere and getting much too highly
paid it's my opinion by the standards of
the general population
including me but the the fact is that
you got to be part of the relatively
privileged part of the population before
you're even part of this thing you know
now for that privilege part of the
population remember that this is a
taxpayer supported operation so it's
just part of the general public subsidy
to the rich you know it's run through
those are actually started through the
Pentagon which is just the way of
funneling public resources to the rich
it's there now and it's like a lot of
things it has a mixed character so for
example if I was I'm sure that there's a
lot of thinking going on you can be
certain about whether to allow the
internet to exist part of it part of the
problem with it from the point of view
of powerful interests is it just too
Democratic it's very hard to control
what's in it you know in fact I have a
daughter in Nicaragua and the only way I
was able to there was no you couldn't
call telephone or anything during a war
period the only way I could contact her
was through the Pentagon you know
because the ARPANET you know which is
this core of this thing which is
basically a Pentagon system I'm in it
because I'm in MIT and somebody there
was in it because I don't know why and
you could sort of set up email
connections between say me and my
daughter and managua during the Reagan
war
through the Pentagon okay well you know
that's the kind of thing that happened
and you know a lot of people don't like
that obviously and they don't like the
fact that you can get the GATT treaty
and you can get the latest news on I
mean like stuff that I've been talking
about almost all of it you can find on
the internet if you look so that's bad
you gotta stop that
yeah that's Kenya no email to Cuba it's
interesting that it's almost cut off to
Nicaragua but not quite you know there's
still one or two connections but yeah
Cuba's interesting I don't know then the
so that on the other hand it has other
advantages it diverts people it atomizes
people when you're sitting in front of
your to your alone you know there's
something about human beings that makes
face-to-face contact very different from
banging on a computer or than getting
some noise coming back that's very
impersonal you know and it breaks down
personal relations and that's a good
part of it from the point of view of
power because it makes people less human
and a very important thing is to drive
human sentiments out of people so if you
can eliminate things like face to face
contact and you know direct interaction
and so on and just you know turn people
into sort of like what's caricature
doesn't it kind of MIT nerd you know
somebody who's kind of got antennae
coming out of his head and this wired
into his computer if you can turn
everybody into that it's sort of an
advantage because then you've really
made people even more inhuman and
therefore more controllable and so on
and there's other complicated things
like they see one thing I've noticed
recently I don't know if you've noticed
this David is that a lot of activists
are dropping subscriptions to journal to
left journals why because they can get
it through the internet well enough I
was in the CIA I would be saying look
let's let this thing go you know because
even if they get the it alone it's true
that it has the negative effect of
allowing people to get more information
but it has the positive effect of
destroying alternative institutions okay
so therefore let's let it go you know
because when these guys stop
their subscriptions - you know I don't
know a Z magazine or something then
that's going to destroy that institution
and that'll separate people even more so
if there's anybody that doesn't anyone
in the CIA with this much brains you
know but if they had enough brains they
would say let's let the thing go because
they'll probably destroy the dissident
institutions and it'll destroy them
because we're so antisocial that we
don't see the point of supporting
institutions everybody's after
themselves remember that's what you
taught from childhood even if I and you
on the left and still have that
ingrained like you're an activist you
still have engrained in your head I'm
not for myself and therefore if I can
get the information for nothing why
should I help build an institution
that's a very antisocial attitude but
you find it you know it's very hard to
break out of it I mean we just got it
so you know it's got that character the
other the long-term tendency the
internet my suspicion is it will be like
some article I read somewhere I forget
maybe the Wall Street Journal or
something which was describing the great
potential of this thing and it went
something like this it said that this is
interactive you know so it said well
here's the kind of thing you can look
forward to they're really up there yet
there's an upbeat account it said
everybody's gonna have this everybody's
meat tied into it and we'll be able to
have people really interacting in a new
way and then that described if two
examples of how it could work one for
women one for men for women they could
be sitting there you know in front of
all their equipment and on eighty-three
home shopping channels you know models
show up saying waving something and sort
of giving you the message you better
have that or else something terrible
happened to you so they can say okay I
better have that and then they can push
a button that's the interactive part and
ten minutes later you know something's
delivered at the front door okay that's
women interact what about men I said
well men you know like the red-blooded
thing to do for men is like watching the
Super Bowl now now when you watch the
Super Bowl it's completely passive just
drinking the beer and that sort of thing
but now it's going to be interactive so
before the you know the quarterbacks in
a huddle and all that sort of thing and
the interactive part will be you'll
they'll be a message flashed out all the
red blood
men and they'll be supposed to say look
here's what I think the next play ought
to be like I think it'll be a pass you
know and you push a button and says pass
and then after the quarterback calls the
play he's not listening to you of course
and by the coach actually calls the play
I guess and tells the quarterback the it
will be flashed on the screen you know
63 percent thought it should have been a
pass and so on that's the interactive
part for men so everybody's really
involved now in society you know like
women buying stuff they don't want and
spending money and Men you know becoming
even more imbecilic they're already made
the Big E and so on and that's that's
all to the good because that's a way of
controlling people and if you just if
you let the thing run that's where it's
going to go something like that on the
other hand it does have alternatives as
you some of them are being fought about
right in Chicago right now there's a
community based group Chicago media
network or something which involves
African or American journalists and
teacher Teachers Union and others who
are trying to get an alternative cable
channel community-based cable channel
well I just told yesterday we were sort
of beaten down and that court somewhere
and they're now filing another court
suit but that's the kind of thing that
could happen now unless they get support
they're gonna lose you know they they
get public support they're gonna win and
that's exactly the way these things work
you know you you will get public you
these things can be useful very
important as alternative sources in fact
as the only sources you know as the real
public sources if people are willing to
fight for them if they're not willing to
fight for them they'll end up with home
shopping and the Super Bowl and you're
seeing an example of it right here right
in front on this in the Chicago media
action group and get involved you can
make a change forget about it nothing
will happen the guys who are always
there some groups are always fighting
big business is always fighting they
don't stop and if other people aren't
involved in the struggle they win
praxis
is about the idea that same
don't have apparatuses and that is part
of
the absence also the proposition
that reason why
the ology economic abrasive
versus
that remains
of course easy to be satisfied
criticizing racism of that at one point
that was made about mr. peaceful
in there and this is something
if Hemingway was perfect
I don't know let's take the publisher
that I mainly publish with South End the
main seller in South End happens to be
bell hooks black woman the there you go
down all the hole it's people like I'm
one of them but Manning Marable is
another you know black intellectual I
don't look the fact that there's plenty
of racism in the society that's in the
left - you know you absolutely
nobody's gonna argue that of course
there is but I don't see why it can't be
overcome like take I can't be overcome
and I think there have been attempts to
overcome it like take the Panthers one
of the reasons why Fred Hampton was
killed was that he was opening up things
to poor whites and in fact to whites
generally I mean like I was at Fred
Hamptons funeral you know and possibly
possibly I mean Martin Luther King was
popular you know first of all Martin
Luther King was opposed strongly opposed
like the Kennedy administration really
disliked it and they tried to block him
in every possible way but it finally got
to the point where they couldn't stop it
any longer so they pretended they liked
them but then and there was a period of
sort of popularity for King when he was
seen to be focusing on extremely narrow
issues you know like racist sheriffs in
the south and so on okay we can be
against that as soon as Martin Luther
King turned to broader issues whether it
was the Vietnam War or the number the
poor people's March was the last one he
became you know pariah no I don't know
whether that's why I was killed or not
but he certainly became a pariah because
he was just focusing on general issues
and the couple years live a year to
about that time the Panthers were
getting organized and in fact the
Panthers were unusual for a urban-based
black group in that they were trying to
reach out and did so there were good
connections I mean it was a tricky
business because the Panthers were like
other you know any group that's coming
out of urban society is gonna be a big
mixture so like the Panthers had
criminal elements they had hustlers they
had serious organizers it was like a
mixture of everything the ones who
survived incidentally the criminal
elements because police didn't care much
about them but the or the Hampton types
were destroyed and they were they had
white black I was with a white mainly
white group resist which had good
contacts with the Panthers back in the
late sixties like I say I was invited to
the funeral there was no reason why this
couldn't continue except that you know
wasn't able to resist outside force
so the racism is certainly there and you
got to watch it but I don't you know it
doesn't seem to me it can't be overcome
you know
well that's cuz but he presents himself
that look that's not fair look Manning
Marable presents himself there it's not
that anybody else presents him that way
the people who read him understand that
people who read him understand that and
they accept his picture of himself as an
African American intellectually which is
correct that's his picture of himself
you know I respect that and you
recognize that it holds generally and
look that's been true of the left for a
long time it take somebody like CLR
James well you know he was a left
intellectual happen to be black you know
but he was a leading left intellectual
and while you're absolutely right in
saying that there's plenty of racism in
the left it seems to me that's the place
where there's been least of it and in
fact kind of interesting if you look at
labor history so take say the Homestead
Strike which I mentioned before I don't
think there were very many blacks there
but there was plenty of the equivalent
of racism I mean at that time it was
against the Huns anybody from Eastern
Europe was called a hun you know it's
like from Slovakia Hungary or anything
like that and they were treated just
like blacks and there was vicious ethnic
hatreds and homestead in that region
they were overcome during the strike
that was the first time that people
actually cooperated across ethnic
grounds because they were fighting
together for something that happened in
the formation the CIO then there was a
lot of black workers black and white
workers were actually working together
on the CIO and it seems to me there are
plenty of common and that happened in
the civil rights era of common struggles
which bring people together like snick
for example was very open you know it
was white black anything and snick got
destroyed and I think that's part of the
reason for it so your your point is
right the society is very races it's got
other kinds of divisions and you gotta
keep conscious of them and you have to
overcome them about the Praxis point I'm
not so sure I agree I mean you know when
you say there's no praxis I don't
exactly
that means I mean there are plenty of
things that can be done I don't think
they have to be described with fancy
terms and we do the things that can be
done you know the kinds of things that
are the next stage where we are now and
I don't think that there's any general
formulas about that you've just asked
where you are you know what are the
problems that exist where are people
ready to move and you try to do
something with them there's a spectrum
of them and there's no simple answer as
to which ones are should have the
priorities people judge differently but
I'm very skeptical if somebody comes
down to the Praxis
you know like some formula thing here's
the way we're supposed to do it I'd be
really skeptical about then first of all
I want to say just very quickly that
last night I saw this Time magazine on
the with the front cover regarding that
I killed work that you had mentioned and
I was just appalled by it I would not
know what to do with myself
how about if you replied oh how about a
bar do you notice that you read the
article oh I mean the article claims
that one of the things that discusses is
the idea that black women don't nurture
their children you know of this because
they came from Africa where the climate
was such as you know I mean you know
this stuff that's right out of an
athlete how would I feel and you know
what I just
I don't know what to do women is just
rage maybe I would wake up everyday
maybe I'd be despondent maybe I try to
relate to other people as human beings
but inside there would be a burning fire
see but I think the right I mean I agree
with that emotional reaction but if you
think about it the right way to respond
is to ask what are they doing it for it
and they're doing it for a very simple
reason like I said last night 40% of the
kids in New York most of them are black
and Hispanic or living below the poverty
line that means they're destroyed okay
well you can't and that's the result of
very definite social policies which is
supported by the New York Times okay
there are certain social policies which
are driving people down the destruction
well you can't say that plainly so you
need some cover well what's the cover
okay bad jeans you know who knows maybe
you know but and once you understand
that then you know how to deal with it
well you know it's not it's not that
their audience wants to hear that
it's the oven some of it does is that
that's the proper ideology just as it
was proper for the Nazis at some point
to say Jews are a virus that's
destroying our society it is proper for
the New York Times to run articles
taking seriously the idea that black
mothers no nurture their children and
like take me Oscar Nozick Jews we're
supposed to be at the top we have small
families because that's what we're like
that's why my mother came from family
was 11 kids you know because Ashkenazic
Jews have small families of course she
was an East European you know living in
a peasant society maybe that had
something no no that's not what social
science tells you okay well that's you
know these these things are such as such
transparent ideological weapons that you
don't even you should even bother
arguing about them we should just
understand them transparently for what
they are I'm in a real Commissar culture
which is dedicated to trying to obscure
the most elementary truth and therefore
is able to do things like this on the
front
the New York Times well that's the world
we're living in and you know you can
understand the emotional reaction and
it's easily understandable but it's not
the right one because what's going on is
very transparent
