do you believe what you read in the
media I'm not talking about die and
Fergie but about the important stuff
that politics and economics has it ever
occurred to you it could be a system of
propaganda designed to limit how you
imagine the world well that's the view
of Noam Chomsky who's been teaching here
in Boston the past 30 years
described as America's leading dissident
he's based for Massachusetts Institute
of Technology where although it's very
cold it isn't exactly the Gulag
Archipelago as a working journalist
myself I've come to talk to Professor
Chomsky about bias in the media
all Wells nightmare a place where
propaganda rules we're thought is
controlled comrades attention here is a
special bulletin from the Ministry of
peace it's now a familiar if chilling
Cold War fable most of us would say it's
old hat but is it not police are joining
you the chief job of a newspaper is to
inform to tell people decades the
freedoms of thought and expression have
been central to Western democracy the
media sees itself as free fearless
stroppy and for many in power the press
are too strong so the idea that all wels
warning is still relevant may seem
bizarre but no to gnome
Chomsky we fix the image of a truth
seeking media is a sham Chomsky has
devoted his life to questioning Western
state powers isn't power
having virtually invented modern
linguistics by the age of thirty Chomsky
joined the gathering swell of protest in
the 60s what it is Chomsky MA on a
faculty at MIT and I've been getting
more more heavily involved in anti-war
activities for the last few years since
then Chomsky has championed a brand of
anarchism becoming deeply hostile to
establish power and privilege and in
recent years he's refined what he calls
the propaganda model of the media on a
brighter note commercial break the
government he claims that the mass media
brainwash under freedom not only to the
media systematically suppress and
distort when they do present facts the
context obscures their real meaning too
much you might wish to be honest the
invasion of East Timor by the Indonesian
army caused indescribable slaughter
hundreds of thousands died but it was
more or less ignored by the mainstream
Western media because Chomsky argues we
were selling arms to the aggressors
but Wars where the West's interests
directly involved get a different
treatment for Chomsky coverage of the
Gulf War was servile trivial criticisms
were aired fundamental ones were ignored
hello
I drew mark how are you hi Matt Chomsky
has numerous critics which chairs being
allotted yes the media so influential ok
have dissident views we really been
excluded in an age of relative media
diversity in the age of the internet
right this is one of what about
Chomsky's own access what about this
very program
professor Chomsky could we start by
listening to explain what the propaganda
model as you call it is for many people
the idea that propaganda is used by
democratic rather than nearly
authoritarian governments will be a
strange one well the term propaganda
fell into disfavor at the around the
Second World War but in the 1920s in the
1930s it was commonly used and in fact
advocated by leading intellectuals by
the founders of modern political science
by wilsonian progressives and of course
by the public relations industry as a
necessary technique to overcome the
danger of democracy the institutional
structure of the media is quite
straightforward we're talking about the
United States but it's not very
different elsewhere the the major there
there are sectors but the agenda-setting
media the ones that sort of set the
framework for everyone else like the New
York Times and The Washington Post and
so on these are major corporations parts
of even bigger conglomerates like other
corporate institutions they have a
product with an ax market their market
is advertisers that is other businesses
their product is privileged relatively
privileged audiences more or less that
selling audiences they're selling
privileged audience these are big
business big corporations selling
privileged audiences to other
corporations now the question is what
would a rat what picture of the world
would a rational person expect to come
out of this structure then we draw
conclusions about what you'd expect and
then we check and yes that's the picture
of the world that comes out and is this
anything more than the idea that
basically the press is relatively
right-wing with some exceptions because
it's owned by big business which is a
truism is well known well I would call
the press relatively liberal here I
agree with the right-wing critics so
especially the New York Times in the
Washington Post and which are called
without a trace of irony the New York
Times is called the establishment left
in say major foreign policy journals and
that's correct
but what's not recognized is that the
role of the liberal intellectual
establishment is to set very sharp
bounds on how far you can go this far
and no further
give me some examples of that well let's
take say the Vietnam War the probably
the leading critic and in fact one of
the leading dissident intellectuals in
the mainstream is Anthony Lewis of the
New York Times who did finally come
around to opposing the Vietnam War about
1969 about a year and a half after
corporate America had more or less
ordered Washington to call it off and
his picture from then on is that the war
as he put it began with blundering
efforts to do good but it ended up by
1969 being a disaster and costing us too
much so what was that on the criticism
what was the non propaganda model have
told Americans about Vietnam war at the
same time same thing that the mainstream
press was telling them about Afghanistan
United States invaded said first of all
in the 1950s had set up a standard Latin
American style terror state which had
massacred tens of thousands of people
but was unable to mean to control local
a local uprising and everyone those at
least every specialist knows that's what
it was and when Kennedy came in in 1961
they had to make a decision because the
government was collapsing under local
attack so the u.s. just invaded the
country in 1961 the US Air Force started
bombing South Vietnamese civilians
authorized napalm crop destruction then
in 1965 January February 1965 the next
major escalation took place against
South Vietnam not against North Vietnam
that was a sideshow
that's what the honest press would be
saying but you
find a trace of it now if the press is a
censoring organization tell me how that
works is that you're not suggesting that
proprietors phone one another up or that
many journalists get their copy spiked
as we say it's actually or well you may
recall has an essay called literary
censorship in England which was supposed
to be the introduction to Animal Farm
except that it never appeared in which
he points out look I'm writing about it
the tellurian society but in free
democratic England that's not all that
different and then he says unpopular
ideas can be silenced without any force
and then it gives to sledded he gives it
to sentence response which is not very
profound but captures it he says two
reasons first the press is owned by
wealthy men who have every interest in
not having certain things appear but
second the whole educational system from
the beginning on through just X gets you
to understand that there are certain
things you just don't say well spelling
these things out
that's perfectly correct I mean they're
it's the first sentence is what we
expand this is what I don't get it
suggests that I mean I'm a judge could
like me are self censoring no not self
centering your there's a filtering
system that starts in kindergarten it
goes all the way through and it's not
the work 100% but it pretty effective it
selects for obedience and subordination
and especially I think that says stroppy
people won't make it don't be influenced
behavior problems or if you read
applications to a graduate school you
see that people will tell you he's not
he doesn't get along too well with his
colleague you know how to interpret
those nice I'm just interesting this
because I was brought up like a lot of
people probably post-watergate film and
so on to believe that journalism was a
crusading craft and that there were a
lot of disputatious stroppy difficult
people in journalism and i have to say i
think i know some of them well i know
some of the best and best-known
investigative reporters in the united
state
I won't mention names but whose
attitudes or the media is much more
cynical than mine
in fact they regard the media as a sham
and they know and they consciously talk
about how they try to play it like a
violin if they see a little opening
they'll try to squeeze something in that
ordinarily wouldn't make it through and
it's perfectly true that the mature
you're speaking for the majority of
journalists who are trained have it
driven into their heads that this is a
crusading a prep a profession
adversarial we stand up against power
very self-serving you on the other hand
in my opinion I hate to make a value
judgment but the better journalists and
in fact the ones who are often regarded
as the best journalists of quite a
different picture and I think a very
realistic way how can you how can you
know that I'm self censoring how can you
know they just answering I'm sure you
believe everything you're saying but
what I'm saying is if you believe
something different you wouldn't be
sitting there sitting we have a press
which has seems to meet a relatively
wide range of you there is a pretty
small sea conservative majority but
there are left-wing papers there are
liberal papers and there is a pretty
large offering of views running from the
far right to the far left for those who
want them I don't see how a propaganda
model can that's not quite true I mean
there have been lot of studies of the
British press and you can look at them
by James Curran as the major one which
points out that up until the 1960s there
was indeed a kind of a social democratic
press which sort of represented much of
the interests of working people and
ordinary people and so on and it was
very successful I mean The Daily Herald
for example had not only more it had far
higher circulation than other newspapers
but also a dedicated circulation
furthermore the tabloids at that time
when they were in the Sun we're kind of
labor based that by the 60s that was all
gone and it disappeared under the
pressure of capital resources what was
left was overwhelmingly the sort of
Center to write press with some
dissidents it's true I mean we've got
our object a couple of large set layer
newspapers which are left to centre
right which are which are
but you know putting in neo-keynesian
views which the you call the elites are
strongly hostile - it's interesting that
you call me okay and left-of-centre I
just call it straight Center the net
left the center that value terms of
meaning sure you could but there's
there's a and your life very they're
extremely good journalists in England a
number of them they write very honestly
and very good material a lot of what
they write could interfere here on the
other hand if you look at the question
overall I don't think you're going to
find a big difference and the fuse that
there are many studies of the British
press but the few that there are have
found pretty much the same results and I
think the better journals will tell you
that in fact we can get what you have to
do is check it out in cases so let's
take say what I just mentioned the
Vietnam War the British press did not
have the kind of stake in the Vietnam
War that the American press did because
they weren't fighting just check some
time and find out how many times you can
find the American war in Vietnam
described as a US attack against South
Vietnam beginning clearly with outright
aggression in 1961 and escalating to
massive aggression in 65 if you can find
0.001 percent of the coverage saying
that you'll surprise me and in a free
press a hundred percent of it would have
been saying that that's just a matter of
fact it has nothing that was left and
right let me come up to a more modern
war which was the the Gulf War which
again you know looking at press in
Britain and watching television
critiques of American television I was
very very well aware of the anti Gulf
War dissidents William that they did the
the no blood for oil
campaign that's nothing I that's not the
dissidents nobody in fact isn't that the
remote note the setup Saints attack and
quake took place on August 2nd from
August within a few days the great fear
in Washington was that Saddam Hussein
was going to withdraw and leave a puppet
government which would be pretty much
with us had just done in Panama the US
and Britain therefore moved very quickly
to try to undercut the danger of
withdrawal by late August negotiation
offers were coming from Iraq
calling for a negotiated Iraqi withdraw
the press wouldn't publish here they
never published them in it the it did
leak however good it was a great tonight
about whether the judges vina negotiate
sorry no that was not a debate there was
debate about whether he should continue
with sanctions which is a different
question because the fact of the matter
is we have good evidence but by late by
mid or late August the sanctions are
very worked because these stories were
going to high American officials in the
State Department former American
officials like Richard helm they
couldn't get the mainstream press to
cover them but they did manage to get
one journal to cover them Newsday that's
a suburban journal and Long Island the
purpose obviously being to smoke out the
New York Times because it's the only
thing that matters it came out of
Newsday and this continued I won't go
through the details but this continued
until January 2nd at that time the
offers that were coming were apparently
so meaningful to the State Department
that State Department officials were
saying that look this is negotiable
meaningful maybe we don't accept
everything but it's certainly a basis
for negotiated withdrawal the press
would not cover it Newsday did a few
other people did I have a couple of our
beds on it and to my knowledge you can
check this the first reference to any of
this in England is actually in an
article I wrote in The Guardian which
was in early January you can check and
see if there's an earlier reference okay
let's look at one of the other key
examples which you've looked at too
which would appear to go against your
idea which is the Watergate water that
is a perfect example I have discussed it
at length in our book in fact it'll be
where it's a perfect example of the way
the press was subordinated to power but
this in fact this brought down
investment let me give you any for just
a minute let's take a look what happened
there here it's kind of interesting
because you know you can't do
experiments in history but here history
was kind enough to set when I set up set
one up for us
the Watergate exposures happen to take
place at exactly the same time as
another set of explosion namely the
exposures of COINTELPRO of sorry objects
ablaze interestingly I have to explain
it because it's vastly more significant
than Watergate that already makes my
point COINTELPRO was a program of
subversion carried out not by a couple
of petty crooks but by the national
political police the FBI
under four administration's it began in
the late Eisenhower administration ran
up till this is the payment of the
socialist work as much that my Social
Work is quoting one tiny fragment of it
it began by the time it got through I
won't went through the whole story it
was aimed at the entire new left at the
woman women's movement at the whole
black movement it was extremely broad
its actions went as far as political
assassination now what's the difference
between the two very clear in Watergate
Richard Nixon went after half of US
private power namely the Democratic
Party and and power can defend itself so
therefore that's a scandal he didn't do
any nothing happened like I was on
Nixon's enemies list I didn't know
nothing ever happened no but but
nonetheless you wouldn't say it was an
insignificant event no it was a
president it was a case where half of us
power defended itself against a person
who had obviously stepped out of line
that's so and the fact that the press
thought that was important shows they
think powerful people it'll be able to
defend themselves
now whether there was a question of
principle involved happens to be easily
checked in this case one tiny part of
the COINTELPRO program was itself far
more significant in terms of principle
than all of Watergate and if you look at
the whole program I mean it's not even a
discussion but you have to ask me what
COINTELPRO is you know what Watergate is
there couldn't be a more dramatic
example of the subordination of the
educated opinion to power here in
England as well as the United States I
know you've concentrated on foreign
affairs and that some of these key areas
are being too hot about domestic law but
well I'd like to come on to that because
it still seems to me that on a range of
pretty important issues for the
establishment there is serious dissent
Gingrich and his neo conservative agenda
in America has been pretty savagely
Lampoon the apparently fixed succession
for the Republican candidates he at the
presidential election has come apart at
Clinton who is a powerful figure is
having great difficulty with whitewater
everywhere
one looks one sees dis junctures
openings within a spectrum so narrow
that you really have to look hard to
find well let me let me can I just stop
you there because because you say that
the spectrum is narrow but on the one
hand let me know us very we've got the
Ayala straight flat tax Republicans
right the way through to relatively big
state Democrats finally won it find a
big state Democrat the position now is
exactly what Clinton said Europe big
government is over the government's
failed the war on poverty has failed we
have to get rid of this entitlement
business that was Clinton's campaign
message in 1992 that's the Democrats the
the different what what you have now is
a difference between sort of moderate
Republicans and extreme Republicans
actually it's well known that there's
been a long-standing sort of split in
the American business community it's not
precise but it's sort of general between
high tech capital intensive
internationally oriented business which
tends to be what's called liberal and
lower tech more nationally oriented
little more labor intensive industry
which is what's called conservative now
between those sectors there have been
differences and in fact if you take a
look at American politics it oscillates
pretty much between those limits there's
good work on this incidentally the
person has done the most extensive work
is Thomas Ferguson's political scientist
you want one more example which will
have some resonance in in Britain and
Europe is the great argument over the
north american free trade association
the nafta argument we're given
interesting if there is something which
one could describe as a global
opposition movement that is trade union
environmental community based then it
was certainly present in the anti-nafta
shall I tell you what happened what site
ever have what I'm going to say is the
that well those are words were well you
know we were well aware of that is
exactly force they were not permitted
into the press and I've documented this
I'll give you references if you like we
could we read all the pages and
Brittany's all out as I did not for
example OLMS did you read the report of
the king of the office of Technology
Association of Congress what are you
sorry did you read the report of the
labor advisory committee well I did I
don't get these articles but I read I
read many articles
but I'll tell you after argument I'll
tell you what you very I'm sorry if it's
tough well if you're interested in the
facts I'll tell you what they are and
I'll even give you sources the the NAFTA
agreement was signed more or less in
secret by the three presidents in
mid-august of the that's time of congrat
right in the middle of the presidential
campaign in mid-august
now there's a law in the United States
1974 Trade Act which requires that any
trade related issue be submitted to the
labor Advisory Committee which is Union
base for assessment and analysis it was
never submitted to them a day before
they were supposed to give their final
report in mid-september it was finally
submitted to them they were in fear the
union's are very right pretty right wing
but they were infuriated they had never
been shown this they had strong that
even at the time that they had the right
they're giving 24 hours to write the
report they never found look at the text
nevertheless they wrote a very vigorous
analysis of it with alternatives
presented saying look we're not against
math but we're against this version of
it they get a good analysis happen to be
very similar to one that had been given
by the Congressional Research Service
the office of Technology Assessment none
of this ever entered the press the only
thing that entered the press was the
kind of critique that they were willing
to deal with Mexico bashing right-wing
nationalists and you know and so on that
entered the press but not the critical
analysis of the labor movement now it
means somehow by process of osmosis was
something I've taken up quite a lot in
nineteen after argument analysis of
worker protection environmental
degradation may I continue this goes on
in the press right until the end
by the end there were there were big
popular movements opposing it was
extremely hard to suppress all of this
to suppress everything coming out of the
labor movement out of the popular
movements and so on but they did at the
very end it had reached such a point
that there was concern that they might
not be able to round this through now
take a look at the New York Times in the
Washington Post say the liberal media MO
and the National ones in the last couple
of weeks I don't say I've written about
and pay what you find what you find is a
hundred percent support for NAFTA
refusal to allow any of the popular
arguments now tremendous labor bash can
I come back to make sure that I own this
and the point about the liberal press as
against the conservative press because
in Britain over the last two years
politicians I come across are deeply
irritated ranging on furious about
attacks on them in the press day after
day on issues which have come to be
known as sleaze they feel that they are
harassed that they are misunderstood and
that the press has got above itself is
uppity and is destructive that's the
message that they are giving good now
are you saying that that old process
same doesn't matter sure because it's
all part maher zain I mean when the
press the same thing is true here when
the press focuses on the sex lives of
politicians reach for your pocket see
who's pulling out your wallet I mean
because those are not the issues that
matter to people I mean they're very
marginal interest the issues that matter
to people are somewhere else so as soon
as you hear you know the press and
presidential candidates and so on
talking about values as I say put your
hand on your wallet and you know that
something else has happened but it but
it's been much more than with us be much
more than bed hopping it's also been
about taking money from the corporation
is paying for corruption corrupt judges
fine topic from but yet corrupt party
big business is not in favor of
corruption you know and if the press
focuses on corruption Fortune magazine
will be quite happy they don't care
about that they they don't want the
society to be corrupt they want it to be
run in their interest that's a different
thing
corruption interferes with that so for
example when I was with a just haven't
come back from India the Bank of India
released an estimate economist there
tell me it's low that a third of the
economy is black meaning mostly rich
businessmen not paying their taxes well
that makes the press because in fact
certainly transnationals don't like it
they want the system to be run without
corruption robbery bribes and so on just
pouring money into their pockets so yes
that's a fine topic for the press on the
other hand the topics I've talked about
are not fun topics is it much to
significant what would a press be like
do you think without propaganda model
what would be rereading in the
is that we don't read about it just
given a dozen examples on every example
that incidentally you've picked I
haven't picked I mean I could pick my
own I'm happy let you pick them on every
one of those examples I think you can
demonstrate but there's been a severe
distortion of what the facts of the
matter are this has nothing to do with
left and right as I've been stressing
and it has left the population pre
confused and marginalized a free press
we just tell you the truth this has
nothing to do with life I've given the
power of big business part of the press
what can people do about this they can
do exactly what people do in Haitian
slums and Hills organize in Haiti which
is the most we take that must most the
poorest country in the hemisphere they
created a very vibrant lively civil
society in the slums and the hills and
conditions they most of us can't even
imagine vaguely we can do the same much
more easily you've got community
activists in America you've got not I'm
not talking about the community
so-called communitarian movement but I'm
talking about the local community and
writers all over the place all over the
place take say a city like Boston and
the way all sorts of people they don't
even know of each other's existence it's
there's a very large number of them one
of the things I do constantly is run
around the country giving talks one of
my main purposes and the purpose of
people invite me is to bring two people
together people in that area who are
working on the same things and don't
know of each other exists because the
resources are so scattered and the means
of communication are so marginal there
isn't just much they can do about it now
there are there are things that plane
things that are happening so it takes a
community based radio which is sort of
outside I was going to ask you about
that and about the internet which has
certainly got pretty other access at the
moment well the internet has had like
most technology as a very double-edged
sword it had like any technology
including printing it has a Liberatore
potential but it also has a took a
repressive potential and there's a
battle going on about which way it's
going to go as there was for radio
television and so on but ownership an
appetizer right and about just what's
going to be in it and who's going to
have access to it remember incidentally
that the internet is a nail each
operation
most of the population the world has
never made a phone call you know so
that's certainly not on the internet I
nevertheless it's it does have
democratizing potential and there's a
struggle going on right now as to
whether that's going to be realized or
whether it will turn into something like
a home marketing service and a way of
marginalizing people even further that
discussion went on in the 1920s over
radio that's interesting how it turned
out it's when it went on over television
it's not going on over the Internet and
that's a matter of popular struggle look
the company don't live the way we did
200 years ago or even 30 years ago
there's been a lot of progress
it hasn't been gifts from above it's
been the result of people getting
together and refusing to accept the
dictates of authoritarian institution
and there's no reason to think that
that's over you've been portrayed and
some would say Katy portrayed yourself
as a little lonely dissident voice you
clearly don't do lonely if I say nothing
like guys I certainly do not portray
myself that way I can't begin to accept
a fraction of the invitations from
around the country I'm scheduled two
years in advance and at that I'm only
selecting a fraction are you speaking to
be huge overflow huge audiences and
these are not a leading intellectuals
either these are mostly popular
audiences i I probably spend 20 or 30
hours a week just answering letters from
people all over the country in the world
I wish I felt a little more lonely I
don't of course I'm not on NPR you know
one wouldn't be in the mainstream media
but I wouldn't expect that why should
they why should they offer space to
somebody who's trying to undermine that
power and to expose what they do but
that's not the moment professor jokes
key thank you very much
