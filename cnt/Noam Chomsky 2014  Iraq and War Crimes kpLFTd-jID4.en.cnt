so if i'm viviana focus mostly on the
war crimes in the second station okay so
I mean I guess before we go into that or
I guess maybe we should discuss whether
or not that evasion itself was a war
crime well there is in a well accepted
definition of aggression rule is defined
pretty well at the Nuremberg Tribunal
it's been it's now in international
documents General Assembly resolutions
essentially selling sending the Armed
Forces your Armed Forces into another
state without its invitation
essentially what aggression means so
there's a textbook case of aggression
totally illegitimate and aggression it
doesn't matter if they thought they had
a pretext or not having believing you
have a pretext there's no justification
for aggression aggression was defined in
the Nuremberg Tribunal which is kind of
the foundation of modern international
law as the Supreme international crime
differing from other war a war crime but
differing from other war crimes and that
it encompasses all of the evil that
follows so in the case of the u.s.
British invasion of Iraq major work
supreme international crime it
encompasses everything that followed the
under thousands of deaths the millions
of people displaced the destroyed city
is the destruction of the culture of the
the the sectarian conflict that was
elicited by the invasion which is now
tearing Iraq apart has now spread to the
whole region and as has having a
devastating effect throughout the whole
region leading to major international
confrontations all of these are part of
the are
compass by the initial crime of
aggression so yeah this is an extremely
serious were crime in a world that had
any pretense of Justice Bush Blair the
rest of them would be facing an
international tribunal for a rid of the
nuremberg variety i don't suggest that
they get the best panel because I don't
believe in it but incidentally at
Nuremberg the chief US prosecutor
Justice Robert Jackson okay pretty
eloquent talk about the meaning of the
tribunal at the time that what he said
is we in the tribunal are handing these
defendants a poisoned chalice and if we
ever sipped from it we must be subject
to the same punishment or else the
tribunal is just a farce Victor's
justice so we had a choice either we
applied the same principles to ourselves
or else we simply say that the tribunal
Norman burg tribunal was just judicial
murder those are the choices it's all
part of the initial act of aggression
and again it makes no different zero
whether they thought they had a pretext
maybe they thought maybe they didn't
think so doesn't matter what their
actual motives were that's not part of
the definition of aggression particular
tactics and particular weapons I
released a second siege the first one
that comes to mind is
tactical for constants by fire that we
were using and this is basically you
know if you don't know what's on a house
or what's in a particular area you shoot
into it
and you know if you hear something I
don't know what you would hear yelling
screaming or whatever you know then you
know there are people inside civilians
are combatants this seems like a
indiscriminate tactic is that is it
right to think that it's an
indiscriminate tactic and obviously a
crime but we should also bear in mind
that the discriminant tactics were also
crimes so as you know better neither one
of the first a lot of this was reported
pretty straight I should say day by day
just to mention an anecdote I at the
time of the second attack I happen to be
giving talks in New York on that
Columbia University on political issues
but I switched the topics and the series
of talks day by day I just referred
discuss in that day's news front page of
the New York Times discussed and what
they were describing was serious war
crimes and they were describing them
with the positive stuff at fashion as
dude isn't this great you know but the
crimes were open so the first act that
was done was to take over the General
Hospital taking over a hospital is not
only part of the whole area of war
crimes but is a specific crime well it's
crime and specifically identified by the
Geneva Conventions as a work run they
took over the hospital patients were
thrown out of the beds
forced to lie on the floor and shackled
doctors shackled front-page picture over
the New York Times and describing this
kind of with I would take the lead but
certainly approval isn't this look what
we're doing I mean that's again
everything is a war crime once you carry
out an invasion but this is a specific
discriminative work
not indiscriminate and lauded they
claimed there was some questioning about
it and be military gave a justification
they said it's appropriate because the
General Hospital is a propaganda agency
is giving out reports on casualties and
that incites resistance so since it's a
propaganda agency you know it was
particularly justified all right I don't
know how far back you'd have to go to
find things like this and it happened
day after day them you read in the press
about how there
the Marines are digging the rats out of
their Warren's you know things like that
kind of the terminology was used though
we had no idea at least I can't find out
how many casualties there were because
we don't investigate our own casualties
if other people commit crimes we carry
out huge investigations you know if you
can blame something on say survey or
Khmer Rouge you dig up every inch of
ground to see if you can find a bone and
so on when we carry out the casualties
you don't describe what was kind of
captured by the commanding general Tommy
Frank
that we don't do body count in other
words we don't care how many people we
killed many our business in America so
there's no real estimate of the number
of people killed but it's gotta be large
I'm in the Marines essentially
surrounded with town they did allow
women children to flee but locked
everyone else in and then comes the
attack and whoever was killed there were
missed killed by tactics of the kind you
describe they're still being killed by
the destructive weapons were being used
in fact it has a certain comparison with
Schreber nature which in the West is
considered the open to crime it's quite
different from forever nature well then
first of all the trevor nature was a
response hideous response
a criminal response but a response to
attacks that were taking place from her
protected City into the surrounding
areas where atrocities were being
carried out effectively Bosnia militias
were boasting about the being read about
them in the Washington Post and they
were certainly going to elicit a
counter-attack and they did the
counter-attack was similar to fully
adjourn
the place was surrounded the women and
children were not just allowed to free
they were trucked out the men and boys
were left and then came a massacre and
kind of like fuller G but arguably more
justified so it's a yes by every
standard it's a major crime and
including the reporting of it in the
commentary on which were generally
positive even encouraged to flee
military age males defined very loosely
like 55 were forced to stay in the sea
regardless of any evidence that's
represent on would this constitute given
the discriminant tactics and discussed
with this this constituted failure to
distinguish between civilians and
combatants by definition but like
forever nature was a was a crime this
was a worse room yeah of course
it's and even if they were combat and it
wouldn't mitigate it
you don't have an invading army has no
right to just murder combat and just
like that you know
I mean you see this in the current and
commentary on the drone assassinations
there's a lot of focus on collateral
damage you know some civilians were
killed
what about killing suspect I mean murder
suspects has been a crime for eight
centuries and the foundations of
anglo-american law of magna carta eight
centuries ago said that any you know
they narrowed it the freemen but the
point says by now any person is entitled
to a speedy trial by a jury of his peers
short of that he's innocent you can't
get make people guilty because you say I
don't like them or I think maybe someday
don't harm me so the killings of the
people who were targeted or criminal as
well very important five letter word
spelled P or WBUR if you have it you can
do whatever you like with impunity and
the rest of the world is intimidated you
can see striking to see how intimidated
they are a very dramatic illustration
just a couple of weeks ago now you
remember the plane or the president
Bolivia or all US was flying across
Europe and several European countries
including France but barred their
airspace to the plane it finally landed
in Austria for technical reasons and the
Austrians security forces inspected the
plane all of this is utterly outrageous
and violation of any imaginable
diplomatic protocol and international
agreements that the European countries
are so terrified of Washington
that they just if Washington tells you
we don't like this they collapse and
terror the United States is an
intimidating country but nobody's going
to take it on I mean some glue and
doesn't work very well and part of the
reason it's intimidating is total
impunity they do what they like in total
impunity now you can see it I'm in
Guatemala for example you know it's not
the most democratic country in the world
has finally succeeded in bringing to
justice some kind of justice one of the
leading killer from the 1983 us mark
that's almost inconceivable in the
United States for much worse crimes I
should say the Red Cross estimated that
fifty thousand civilians were trapped in
Fallujah at the time of the second siege
but my command actually told myself and
everyone else in my unit that there were
no civilians left from the city that
everyone who remained was a terrorist
combatant there are other reports from
other people of a navy petty officer in
particular who was also part of the
operation saying that his command told
them that it was a free fire zone is
there a law against this sort of
misinformation from command to their
troops everything that happened is in
violation of law so sure this particular
case is but that is the definition of
terrorist a terrorist is somebody we're
planning to kill that's a terrorist you
can say the same but the drone killings
today but I'm so-called liberal
president he says his Tuesday morning
meetings that this guy is a terrorist
so I have to admit you know while I was
in Fallujah I I didn't see the world it
wasn't it wasn't obvious to me I I knew
something was wrong to you that wasn't
quite right but even have mixed feelings
for its work on how we just not see them
this is happening we don't see them for
the same reason that the journalists and
editors of the New York Times didn't see
them we're trained to assume that
anything we do is legitimate or not the
only ones in history to have that
assumption fact it's almost universal
and powerful systems but we're trained
from infancy to regard the United States
as noble benevolent maybe it makes
mistakes but basically good intentioned
and everything we do is right because
you did it look when I grew up as a kid
you know we grew up in the kind of you
know liberal Roosevelt style New Deal
families but my best friends and I would
be out in the woods playing cowboys and
Indians really with the Cowboys killing
the Indians I mean you know mostly
exterminating indigenous people but we
did it so it's got to be right then you
see the movies in which you extol the
people are doing this and on you know on
through from great end of Obama praising
the Indochina Wars Noble we did it it's
got to be right so it's not surprising
that somebody who's you know holding a
rifle in the middle of a war zone
wouldn't see anything it's it's hard to
blame them when like to see you in
Fallujah when they people sitting in the
air-conditioned offices with every
possible amenity around them look at it
and phrase it
that's where you should be question I
mean how could the editors of the New
York Times permit a front page
photograph of the occupied hospital with
patients on the floor knowing perfectly
well that this is a major war crime
quite apart from what you think about
the invasion but it doesn't matter that
we were doing it it's got to be right
and then you give this pathetic
justification which simply deepens the
car and it said you know I mean how many
people have I'm taking the Indochina war
you know the major workaround of the
second the post Second World War II
Earth has anybody been charged for
crimes the only people who were charged
for crimes were gi's out in the field
you know half crazed GIS in a village
where they didn't know who was going to
shoot at the next you know they commit
the teen crimes know the kind of movie
line but I mean what about the guys in
the office is elated were sending them
there who were targeting their villages
with b-52 grades and I said comparably
were strong I mean I was like a footnote
that I wrote about at the time when it
happened if it was afflicted yeah I'm
sure it was a crime but you can't blame
these guys but they were in the
situation we're in no position to make
subtle distinctions about what you can
do and what you can't do sure they
shouldn't treat women children but in
that situation it's hard to blame them
but once the blame are the ones in the
editorial offices of the officers in
Washington and then all of us who see
this and pretend we don't see it and so
on so yeah you didn't see it but people
are much better positioned to see it
well said
