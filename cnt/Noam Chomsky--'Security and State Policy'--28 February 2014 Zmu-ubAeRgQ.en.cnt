a leading principle of international
relations theory is that the highest
priority of states is to ensure security
so a standard formulation by George
Kennan one of the planners of the
post-war world as he put it his
government is created to assure order
and justice internally and provide for
the common defense what's called
national security and the proposition
seems a plausible almost self-evident
until you begin to look more closely and
ask the question security for whom for
the general population for state power
itself for dominant domestic
constituencies depending on what we mean
the credibility of the proposition
ranges from very high to negligible so
security for state power for example is
ranked very high that's illustrated by
the great efforts that statement states
exert to protect themselves from the
wrong populations even from the scrutiny
of their populations Edward Snowden
explained his actions by saying that
he said the public had a right to know
about these programs the public had a
right to know that which the government
is doing in its name and that which the
government is doing against the public
and the same could be justly said by Dan
Ellsberg Chelsea Manning and other
courageous figures who've acted on the
same democratic principle the government
of Stan's of course is quite different
it's that the public does not have a
right to know because security is
undermined severely undermine so it's
asserted there are several good reasons
to be skeptical about a response like
that the first is that it's almost
completely predictable that's what a
government says whenever a government
act is exposed it's reflexive and being
predictable that carries a little or no
information a second reason for
skepticism is the nature of the evidence
presented was actually reviewed by
well-known international relations
scholar John rear Shimer he writes that
the Obama administration not
surprisingly initially claimed that the
NSA spying played a key role in 1454
terrorist plots against the United
States implying that it violated the
Fourth Amendment for a good reason this
was a lie however the general Keith
Alexander the NSA director eventually
admitted to Congress that he could claim
only one success that involved catching
a Somali immigrant living in San Diego
who had sent 8500 dollars to a terrorist
group in Somalia that's what this huge
operation has succeeded in achieving so
far well there is a sense in which
security is threatened by public
awareness a namely security of state
power from exposure and that's important
the basic insight was expressed very
well by distinguished political
scientists who held the chair of science
of Government at Harvard University
Samuel Huntington he pointed out that
the architects of power in the United
States must create a force that can be
felt but not seen power remains strong
when it remains in the dark exposed to
the sunlight it begins to evaporate that
incidentally is in favor of secrecy if
you go on with the rest of the
discussion in the US is elsewhere the
architects of power understand this all
too well of course people who have
worked through the huge mass of
documents declassified by the government
can hardly fail to notice how frequently
it is security of state power from the
domestic public that's a prime concern
and not national security in any
meaningful sense often security is
motivated by the need to guarantee the
security of powerful domestic sectors
the United States that means the
corporate sector one persistent example
of this is the mislabeled free trade
agreements they're mislabeled they're
not free trade agreements they radically
violate free trade principles they're
substantially not about trade at all but
rather about investor rights and they're
certainly not agreements at least if
people are part of their country's
people when they know about them are
usually opposed these instruments are
regularly negotiated in secret like the
current transatlantic trans-pacific
partnership huge treaties being
negotiated not entirely in secret of
course they're not secret from the
hundreds of corporate lobbyists and
lawyers who are running right writing
the details of the agreements with an
impact that
not too hard to guess and in fact is
revealed by the few parts that have been
exposed through WikiLeaks Joseph
Stiglitz Nobel laureate in economics
reasonably concludes that as he puts it
with the US trade representatives office
representing corporate interests not
those of the public the likelihood that
what emerges from the coming talks will
serve ordinary Americans interest is low
the outlook for ordinary citizens in
other countries is even bleaker and the
record will supports that including
NAFTA so security of the secrecy makes
sense there just as in the case of the
NSA secrecy there is real it real
interests that are being secured but
against the population not of the
population on security of domestic
constituencies means the corporate
sector that's a regular concern of
government policy and that's hardly
surprising given their a role in
formulating the policy in the first
place examples are too numerous to
mention so I'll skip them let's turn to
the and to the third interpretation of
security security for domestic
population in sharp contrast there are
substantial evidence that that kind of
security what's called national security
it's just not a high priority for state
policy now there plenty of illustrations
the one current one is the global terror
campaign that Obama is carrying out
completely unprecedented campaign of
global terror carrying out with great
enthusiasm and in fact the war on terror
terror generally since it was declared
by ronald reagan in nineteen eighty-one
rida cleared by bush twenty years later
and more strikingly it's also true of
strategic planning
nuclear policy in particular to an
extent that's not properly recognized so
let's have a look at a few cases start
with the case of so-called war on terror
so take for example the assassination of
Osama bin Laden President Obama as I'm
sure you recall I brought it up with
pride and an important speech on
national security last may vary widely
covered but there was one crucial
paragraph that was ignored Obama held
the operation took credit for it but he
said it cannot be the norm and the
reason he said is that the risks were
immense the Navy SEALs I'm quoting might
have been embroiled in an extended
firefight but by luck he said that
didn't happen nevertheless the cost to
our relationship with Pakistan and the
backlash among the Pakistani public /
encroachment on their territory in
aggression than others do it it was
severe and well let's add a few details
that he didn't mention the seals were
under orders to fight their way out if
they were apprehended they would not
have been left to their fate if they had
been as Obama put it in broiled in an
extended firefight the full force of the
US military would have been used to
extricate them Pakistan has a powerful
military well trained highly protective
of state sovereignty and of course it
has nuclear weapons and Pakistani
specialists are quite concerned about
penetration of the security system by
jihadi elements their presence is itself
a consequence of the massive terror
campaign it's also no secret that the
population of Pakistan has been
embittered and radicalized by the drone
terror campaign
and other US policies including
pressuring the Pakistani military to
attack tribal regions that had been left
to their own by the British imperialists
and their Pakistani successors well
while the seals were still in the bin
Laden compound a Pakistani chief of
staff kyani it was informed of the
invasion and he ordered his staff his
words to confront any unidentified
aircraft that he assumed they were
probably from India meanwhile in Kabul
right down the road the General Petraeus
ordered us warplanes to respond if
Pakistanis scrambled their fighter jets
well as Obama said the worst didn't
happen by luck and it could have been
quite ugly could have been nuclear war
but the risks were faced without
noticeable concern or subsequent comment
which is also interesting well it's a
lot more to say about that operation and
it's actually quite immense cost to
Pakistan but instead let's look more
closely at the concern for security more
generally the beginning with security
from terror then turning to the much
more important question of security from
instant destruction by nuclear weapons
so Obama's global assassination campaign
as I said by far the world's worst
terrorist campaign never been anything
like it it's also a terror generating
campaign and that's well understood not
the highest levels so for example
general McChrystal former former head of
the US forces in Afghanistan after Iraq
he pointed out that for every innocent
person you kill you create 10 new
enemies actually the concept of innocent
person which is now standard in u.s.
discourse that tells you how far we've
progressed in the past eight hundred
years next year is the 800th anniversary
of Magna Carta
which established the principle of
presumption of innocence persons
innocent until proven guilty in a proper
trial with a jury of peers now that was
the foundation of anglo-american law but
that's ancient history by now the word
guilty has a different meaning it means
targeted for assassination by President
Obama and the word innocent means not
yet accorded that status though he might
be next Tuesday in the president's
assassination meetings a couple of days
after the Boston Marathon bombing Obama
ordered an assassination in a remote
Yemeni village actually we rarely learn
about such crimes but it happened that
there was a young man from the village
in the United States and he testified
about the operation before a Senate
committee he reported that for years
that jihadis had been trying to turn the
villagers against the United States but
they had failed the villagers knew
nothing about the United States except
what he was writing about it and he
liked the United States but he said one
drone murder in the village actually a
murder of a person who could easily have
been apprehended one drone murder
vindicated jihadi propaganda turned the
whole village into people who hate
America and want to retaliate against it
once again swelling the ranks of the
terrorist networks that have
proliferated under the war on terror
there now all over large parts of the
world and deeply motivated for revenge
not surprisingly connect how we would
react under similar circumstances well
meanwhile we're developing the
technology to facilitate terror
targeting ourselves there's an article
in Britain's leading journal of
international affairs David Hastings
done a recent article he outlines how
the increasingly sophisticated drones
that were
hoping our perfect weapon for terrorist
groups he puts it there cheap easily
acquired and in general possess many
qualities which when combined to make
them potentially the ideal means for
terrorist attack in the 21st century he
says you can already buy a small drone
on the internet for a couple hundred
dollars and they're getting much more
sophisticated perfect terrorist weapons
we're developing them and every
possibility that will be the victims but
that's not a concern because that has to
do with defense security the population
which is not a particular interest of
states senator Adlai Stevenson the third
he was referring to as many years of
service and the Senate Intelligence
Committee he wrote that cyber
surveillance and metadata collection are
part of the continuing reaction to 911
with few if any terrorists to show for
it a near universal condemnation the
United States is widely perceived as
waging war against Islam against Shias
as well as Sunnis on the ground with
drones by proxy and Palestine from the
Persian Gulf to Central Asia Germany and
Brazil resent our intrusions and what
have they wrought well the answer is
that they've brought a growing threat of
terror as well as internet international
isolation the Stephenson is quite
correct about near universal
condemnation the former CIA chief and
Michael Hayden it recently conceded as
you put it that right now there isn't a
government on the planet that agrees
with our legal rationale for these
operations except for Afghanistan and
maybe Israel and he's probably wrong
about Afghanistan
hayden's conclusions are reflected in a
international poll that was just
released by major polling agencies in
England and the United States gallop in
the United States it was released in
December and one of the questions was
which country do you think is the
greatest threat to peace in the world
today guess who was first the United
States was far in the lead nobody else
was even close second place Pakistan had
one third the votes of the United States
and that was inflated by the Indian vote
other countries were way down a world
opinion of Iran was very low world
opinion sharply rejects the domestic
obsession that Iran poses the greatest
threat to world peace and in fact it is
an obsession shared almost nowhere else
that pole was not reported in the
mainstream media in the United States
we're not supposed to know things like
that it's not important and what
Americans are supposed to believe quote
President Obama is that for generations
the United States of America has played
a unique role as an anchor of global
security and as an advocate of human
freedom that's what we're supposed to
believe if not what the world thinks we
don't know about that actually Obama
produced this declaration while his
bombs were raining on Libya in violation
of a UN Security Council resolution 1973
that the United States Britain and
France had forced through it called for
a season immediate ceasefire
negotiations and actions to protect
civilians including the civilians in the
areas that were reduced to the level of
Grozny after Russian attack by NATO
bombs according to on the scene reports
from the Western press not the US press
Britain other countries and if most of
the world sharply disagrees with the
preferred self-image we can
cheerfully ignore them or condemn them
for their backwardness not understanding
our magnificence there are historical
precedents for that and they're not
particularly attractive there's also
virtually no acknowledgement of the
extensive polling by Western agencies US
and other Western agencies in the Arab
world with very interesting results and
what it shows is that Iran is disliked
but it's just not regarded as a threat
overwhelmingly they rank the United
States and Israel as the major threats
they face now in this case Americans are
supposed to believe that the Arab
support the US stand on Iran that's
what's reported constantly but what's
not mentioned is that they're reporting
the attitudes of the dictators not the
population standard practice is to
restrict attention to friendly dictators
ignoring populations that reflects the
dominant concern for democracy and for
people generally will go on to nuclear
weapons much more important matter even
instant destruction by nuclear weapons
has never ranked high among the concerns
of state authorities so Apple record on
that own sample a little bit of it
starting in the early days of the Atomic
Age remember in the early days around
nineteen fifty the US was overwhelmingly
powerful it enjoyed remarkable security
controlled the hemisphere controlled
both oceans controlled the opposite
sides of both oceans there was one
potential threat not yet developed on
the horizon that was ICBMs with nuclear
warheads there's a comprehensive review
of nuclear policy by McGeorge Bundy
national security advisor for Kennedy
and Johnson he had
access to the highest level sources that
he has some interesting comments he
writes I'll quote in the timely
development of ballistic missiles during
the Eisenhower administration is one of
the best achievements of those eight
years yet it is well to begin with a
recognition that both the United States
and the Soviet Union might be in much
less nuclear danger today if those
missiles had never been developed and
then he adds an instructive comment he
says I am aware of no serious
contemporary proposal in or out of
government that missiles should somehow
be banned by agreement in short there
was apparently no thought the discussion
but not even thought of trying to
prevent the sole serious threat to the
United States the threat of utter
destruction it just had zero
significance not even a staff paper
discussing it well could it have been
prevented can't be sure of course the
Russians were way behind and Technology
knew it it's conceivable that they might
have considered such an agreement and in
fact there are indications that that was
true but in the quite extraordinary
hysteria of those days you couldn't eat
they couldn't even be perceived so that
one suggestive indication of possible
opportunities is a remarkable proposal
that Joseph Stalin made in 1952 he
offered to allow Germany to be unified
with internationally supervised free
elections on one condition that it not
join a hostile military alliance and
that's hardly an extreme condition in
the light of the history of the past
half century which I don't have to
review to you well Stalin's proposal was
taken seriously by one respected
political commentator James Warburg but
apart from him it seems to have been
entirely
ridicule recent scholarship has begun to
take a different view one well-known
Soviet scholar autumn ullam bitterly
anti-communist now he writes recently
that the status of Stalin's proposal is
an unresolved mystery Washington wasted
little effort in flatly rejecting
Moscow's initiative on grounds that were
embarrassingly unconvincing leaving open
the basic question with Stalin ready to
sacrifice the newly created german
democratic republic east germany on the
altar of real democracy with
consequences for american peace and
american security that could have been
enormous that's a mystery it was
ridiculed dismissed not discussed one of
the most prominent Cold War scholars
mehleb Melvin Lefler reviewing a recent
research and the Soviet archives that
have been coming out he points out that
many scholars were surprised to discover
that Lavrenti bahria the sinister brutal
head of the secret police proposed that
the Kremlin offer the West a deal on the
unification and neutralization of
Germany agreeing to sacrifice the East
German communist regime to reduce
east-west tensions and improve internal
political and economic conditions in
Russia opportunities that were
squandered in fact that even discussed
in favor of securing German
participation in NATO under the
circumstances going back to the early
50s it's not at all impossible that
agreements could have been reached that
would have protected the security of the
population of the United States from the
gravest threat on the horizon the threat
of total instant destruction but the
possibility apparently was not even
considered it's another indication of
how slight a role authentic security
plays in state policy I should add that
none
this is discussed in scholarship either
the two quotes that I mentioned are rare
it's just disregarded if state
authorities didn't care at all about
instant destruction of the population
what interest is there in that let's go
on to the next topic meanwhile repeating
the mantra of international relations
theory that security and national
security is the highest goal of state
policy well this was revealed again in
the years that followed after stalin's
death 1953 Nikita Khrushchev took over
and he very quickly recognized that
Russia could not compete militarily with
the United States the richest most
powerful country in world history and
comparable advantages and he understood
that if Russia wanted to escape its
economic backwardness and of course the
devastating effect of the war it would
have been necessary to reverse the arms
race and he took steps in that direction
he proposed sharp mutual reductions in
offensive weapons the incoming Kennedy
administration considered the offer and
rejected it instead turning to rapid
military expansion oh gee that continued
even when first chef unilaterally
reduced offensive weapons one of the
leading international relations scholars
Kenneth waltz died recently supported by
other strategic analysts with close
connections with US intelligence he
wrote that the Kennedy administration
undertook the largest critique and
conventional peacetime military buildup
the world has yet seen even as Chris
chef was trying up once to carry through
a major reduction in the conventional
forces and to follow a strategy of
minimum deterrence and we did so even
though the balance of strategic weapons
greatly favored the United States
it's severely harmed national security
but enhance state power well there was a
Soviet reaction it was placing missiles
in Cuba in October 1962 to try to
redress the great imbalance and it was
also motivated by something else that we
don't talk about it much here but
Kennedy was carrying out a major
terrorist war against Cuba wasn't a joke
it was a serious terrorist war under the
run by his brother Robert Kennedy for
whom who was the highest priority and
that terrorist war was scheduled to lead
to an invasion in October 1962 that's
when the missiles went in will that
brought the world to what Arthur
Schlesinger trinity's associate called
the most dangerous moment in history
that month late October the crisis
peaked on October 26th the Kennedy
received a secret letter from first chef
offering to end the crisis and by
simultaneous public withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and US
Jupiter missiles from Turkey right on
Russia's border the Turkish missile the
Kennedy was surprised he didn't know we
had missiles there they were obsolete
missiles and a withdrawal order had
already been all been been sent for them
and the reason was they were being
replaced by much more lethal polaris
submarines than invulnerable well that's
what was going on on at the most
dangerous moment in history at that
point Kennedy's own subjective estimate
of the probability of nuclear war was a
third to a half that was a war that
would have destroyed the northern
hemisphere was President Eisenhower put
it Kennedy refused I think that must be
one of the most horrendous decisions in
history and worse yet he's greatly
praised for his cool courage and
statesmanship
I think that's worth reflection well ten
years after that a Henry Kissinger
called a nuclear alert was the last days
of the 1973 is Israel Arab war it was a
purpose the purpose was to warn the
Russians not to interfere with his
delicate diplomatic maneuvers they were
designed to ensure an Israeli victory
but a limited victory so that the United
States would remain in control of the
region unilaterally and the maneuvers
word delicate the US and Russia had
jointly imposed a ceasefire but tis
injure secretly informed Israel that
they could ignore him hence a need for a
nuclear alert to frighten the Russians
away so that these delicate maneuvers
couldn't continue luckily once again the
Russians back down but security the
population had its usual status namely
zero it wasn't even a concern ten years
after that the Reagan administration
launched operations to probe russian air
defenses they simulated air and naval
attacks natually air attacks right into
Russian territory and naval attacks and
they gave a warning of a very high level
of actually DEFCON 1 nuclear alert the
all of this happened at a very tense
moment Pershing two missiles were being
deployed in Europe had several minutes
flight down to Moscow Reagan had just
announced the SDI program called Star
Wars program which the Russians
understood to be a first strike weapon
now that's how missile defense is
understood on both sides standard
interpretation and other tensions were
rising well naturally all of this
aroused great alarm in Russia unlike the
United States Russia is quite vulnerable
us is invulnerable but not
Russians they have been repeatedly
invaded than the virtually destroyed
actually that led to a major war scare
in 1983 was recognized to have been
serious but there are newly released
archives which revealed that the danger
was even more severe than historians had
assumed there's a recent CIA study which
is entitled the war scare was for real
that concludes that us intelligence
underestimated Russian concerns and the
threat of a Russian preventive nuclear
strike as a recent article in journal of
Strategic Studies which concludes the
Reagan exercises almost became a prelude
to a preventive nuclear strike actually
was even more dangerous than this we
learned that last September from a
report in the BBC reported that right in
the midst of these world-threatening
developments Russia's early warning
systems detected an incoming missile
strike from the United States and they
sent the highest level alert there's a
protocol for the Soviet military to
retaliate with a nuclear attack of its
own now there's an officer a person who
has to transmit the reports to the
higher-level officer on Duty's Stanislav
Petrov he just decided not that's
transmit the warnings this disobey
orders highest imaginal disobedience of
orders he didn't transmit the warnings
he was he received an official reprimand
and thanks to his dereliction of duty
we're here to talk about it security of
the it's not the only case security of
the population was no more a high
priority for Reagan planners and for
their predecessors are up tilted and it
continues up till the present I gave one
example before but there are plenty of
others and it continues even I'm putting
aside
examples like the Petrov case near
catastrophic accidents they happen all
the time that we don't have a full
Russian record than a fairly extensive
American record and it's it's appalling
actually a chilling new book on it but
by Eric Schlosser if you want to know
some of the details it's very hard to
contest the conclusion of the previous
commander of this general the butler who
said that the fact that we have so far
survived the the nuclear age as a matter
of some combination of skill luck and
divine intervention and I suspect the
latter in greatest proportion the
general Butler went on to describe the
US strategic plan of nineteen sixty the
calling for automated all out strikes as
in his words the single most observed an
irresponsible document i have ever
reviewed in my life he says with a
possible exception of its probable
Soviet counterpart which we don't know
about but there are competitors like the
regular easy acceptance of threats to
survival there are almost too
extraordinary to capture in words like
the kinds of indicated but the words are
there and they're worth reading and
start with the near hysterical rhetoric
ravings actually of NSC 68 many of you
know that's the major early Coast word
document and its content I've been
described but not its rhetoric that's
worth worth reading it reads like an
insane insane ravings of absolute
lunatics you should read it to see if
you think it's an exaggeration you
should read it and write to the present
the words are also there and high-level
documents the outline US strategic
doctrine there's one example which in
the Clinton years came out an important
time
it's a document of Stratcom the
Strategic Command which is in charge of
nuclear weapons it's called essentials
of post Cold War deterrence the
high-level document right after the end
of the Cold War several years after the
Soviet Union collapsed actually it was
also after the United States had begun
to expand NATO to the east in direct
violation of promises to Gorbachev that
when he agreed to the unification of
Germany within NATO actually that's a
matter that's on the front pages today
in connection with Ukraine the extremely
serious danger of course for expanding
NATO to the borders of Russia is no
small matter for them parts from the
promise to Gorbachev not to do it well
let's go back to the Stratcom document
it's concerned all mostly quoted it's
concerned with the role of nuclear
weapons in the post-cold war era and one
central conclusion is that the US must
maintain the right of first strike even
against non-nuclear States furthermore
nuclear weapons must always be available
because they should cast a shadow over
any crisis or conflict so they're
constantly used that just as you using a
gun if they go in to rob a store and you
aim it but you don't fire it it's a
point that Dan Ellsberg has repeatedly
stressed it's a mistake to say that the
weapons aren't used they're always used
a strat comm goes on to advise that
planners should not be too rational
about determining what the opponent
values most all of which must be
targeted it hurts to portray ourselves
as to fully rational and cool-headed
that the United States might become
irrational and vindictive should be a
part of the natural the national persona
that we project it's beneficial for our
strategic posture
if some elements may appear to be
potentially out of control and thus
posing a constant threat of nuclear
attack that's the document about
post-war post Cold War deterrence
nothing here about Kennan's order
justice of the common defense or for
that matter about the obligation under
the National proliferation treaty to
make good faith efforts to eliminate
this scourge of the earth and plans for
the future not very promising the
Congressional Budget Office reported in
December that the US nuclear arsenal
will cost 350 billion dollars over the
next decade and then costs of
modernization will quadruple from 20 24
to 20 30 there's a study of the Monterey
Institute of International Studies
estimated that the US would spend a
trillion dollars on the nuclear arsenal
in the next 30 years a percentage of the
military budget comparable to spending
for procurement of new strategic systems
in the 1980s under President Ronald
Reagan and of course the United States
is not alone as general Butler observed
it's a near miracle that we've escaped
destruction so far and the longer we
continue to tempt fate the less likely
it is that we can hope for divine
intervention to save us from our folly
well in the case of nuclear weapons at
least we know in principle how to
overcome the threatening catastrophe it
can be done but there's another dire
peril the tests its shadow over any
contemplation of the future that's of
course environmental disaster and here
it's not so clear that there even is an
escape although it is clear that the
longer we delay the more severe the
threat becomes and not in a distant
future so the commitment of
governments to the security of their
population is very clearly exhibited by
how they address this issue the issue of
destruction of the possibility for
decent existence for your grandchildren
well there's a lot of exuberance in the
United States right now about what's
called a hundred years of energy
independence as we become the Saudi
Arabia of the next century very likely
the final century of human civilization
of current policies persist he might
take a speech of President Obama's to be
a pretty eloquent death knell for the
species he proclaimed with pride to
ample applause read his words and now
under my administration America is
producing more oil today than at any
time in the preceding eight years and
that's important to know over the last
three years I've directed my
administration to open up millions of
acres for gas and oil exploration across
23 different states we're opening up
more than 75 percent of our potential
oil resources offshore we've quadrupled
the number of operating rigs to a record
high we've added enough new oil and gas
pipeline to encircle the earth and then
some that's our president and the
applause also tells us something about
government commitment to security he was
giving this talk in Cushing Oklahoma
it's an oil town actually the oil town
it's described as the most significant
trading hub for crude oil in North
America and industry profits are sure to
be secured as producing more oil and gas
here at home will continue to be a
critical part of energy society a
strategy as the president promised and
as we have
the march toward the precipice like the
proverbial lemmings well let me
summarize finally there is a sense in
which security is a high priority for
government government planners security
for the state and that means security
against its population security for the
primary constituency concentrated
corporate power all of that entails that
policy must be protected from public
scrutiny in accept those terms
everything falls into place as quite
rational even the rationality of
collective suicide which is exactly the
logic that we're pursuing of course
that's if the general public permits all
of this to continue that's always the
fundamental question
