what advice do you give the left-wing
parties to go to old powerful become
more powerful that's a matter of
engagement activism organization working
with people the left-wing movement
there's a lot of activism a huge amount
of left-wing activism all through Europe
in the United States more so than there
was in the 1960s for example but it's
character as what's called post
materialist it deals with very important
issues but these are not like for
example the feminist issues minority
rights gay rights concern for the
environment and so on these are crucial
issues but these issues do not reach to
the direct concerns of most of the
population their concerns are sort of
survival you know especially now in a
serious economic recession for example
in the United States maybe 20% of the
population now qualify for food stamps
otherwise there won't be a lead for
people who can't put food on the table
that gay rights is just not an
interesting issue and as long as the
Left movements are unable to connect
with the direct concerns of a proper
concerns of the majority of the
population working people poor people
and so on they're not going to have any
success they're not necessarily that
their goals are opposed but they're just
not close to the direct immediate
concerns of people who have to worry
about whether they're going to be able
to put food on the table am I going to
have a job tomorrow will my children be
able to go to school those are very
serious concerns
have to otherwise they're going to be
marginal
