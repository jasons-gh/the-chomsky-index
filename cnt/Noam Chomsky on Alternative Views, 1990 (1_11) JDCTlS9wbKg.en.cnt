the title particularly the subtitle
manufacturer consent in a Democratic
Society is a bit paradoxical
manufacturers consent refers to
indoctrination and indoctrination is
inconsistent with a Democratic Society
so you can't have manufacture of consent
in a Democratic Society there's in fact
a standard view on this matter which
does make it inconsistent the standard
view is expressed for example by Supreme
Court justice Powell when he speaks of
what he calls the societal purpose of
the First Amendment enabling the public
to assert meaningful control over the
political process that's pretty obvious
idea it the idea is that a democracy
functions to the extent that people have
free access to to information and
opinion and of course the opportunity to
act on it
well that sounds obvious in fact perhaps
almost tautological but it's worth
bearing in mind that there is a contrary
view in fact a very well-represented
contrary view in fact the country view
is probably the dominant view among
people who actually have written and
thought about the nature of modern
democracy and this contrary view can be
traced right back to the origins of
modern democracy in the 17th century
English revolution as in the case of
most revolutions maybe virtually all
that was a multi-dimensional affair with
a civil war between the supporters of
the king and the supporters of
Parliament but then a big popular
movement was against all of them and
didn't want and was trying to and had a
very
populist radical Democratic character to
it and was defeated the Democrats were
defeated within about 20 years by 1660
and you read their pamphlets they were
saying that we've lost the only question
now is who slaves the poor shall be king
or Parliament many revolutions have the
same consequence
maybe all so far till one yet to come in
the course of that struggle there was a
great deal of concern over the fact that
the general population was gaining the
opportunity and the even the idea of
becoming involved directly in shaping
their own affairs and that led to great
concerns John Locke wrote that day
laborers and tradesmen the spinsters and
dairymaids must be told what to believe
the greatest part cannot know and
therefore they must believe one of the
contemporary historians man named
Clement Walker wrote at the time that of
the deep concern of the liberal elements
we're talking about now over the fact
that these guys with their little
printing presses putting out pamphlets
and you know agitating and the army and
that sort of thing we're beginning to
reveal the mysteries of government and
he said if they do that they will make
people so curious and arrogant that they
will never find humility enough to
submit to a civil rule that has to be
stopped and the same idea comes right up
to the modern period without running
through the American Revolution you can
find it and so on in the modern period
you find major thinkers picking up the
same themes for example Reinhold Niebuhr
who's a much respected moralist and
political thinker and very very
influential and among modern political
leaders wrote that rationality belongs
to the cool observers but because of the
stupidity of the average man he follows
not reason but faith and the naive faith
of the
proletarian requires necessary illusion
and emotionally potent
oversimplifications which have to be
provided by mythmakers to keep the
ordinary person on the right course
walter lippmann who was the Dean of
American journalists wrote about what he
called the manufacture of consent that's
where that phrase comes from and he said
that the manufacturer of consent has
become a self-conscious art and a
regular organ of popular government in a
revolution in the practice of democracy
and this he thought was appropriate
because the common interests very
largely elude public opinion entirely
and can be managed only by a specialized
class whose personal interests reach
beyond the locality that would be
neighbors
cool observers now that was right after
World War one and the timing is
important during World War one John
Dewey's circle of liberal intellectuals
were extremely impressed with in their
words and their perception with having
imposed their will upon a reluctant and
indifferent majority with the aid of
propaganda fabrications about hun
atrocities and jingoistic
oversimplifications the point was that
as usual the population was pacifistic
and didn't want to go to war any point
in it in fact Woodrow Wilson won the
1916 election on the slogan peace
without victory a man they which he
predictably interpreted as meaning
victory without peace very quickly and
with the aid of the intellectuals they
felt at least maybe they were
exaggerating their own contribution that
they had whipped the population into a
war fever American Historians also
joined enthusiastically in the cause
they formed the National Board for
historical service the founder of it
said that what was needed with what he
called historical engineering a method
to serve the state by explaining the
issues of the war so that we might
better win it
the Wilson administration established
the first official government propaganda
agency in the United States called the
Creole Commission Commission on Public
Information which was a straight
propaganda agency to try to turn this
reluctant and indifferent majority into
a willingness to fight the war and
succumb the jingoistic fanaticism that's
actually a predecessor of a much more
ambitious program developed during the
Reagan administration
the Reagan's office of Latin American
public diplomacy theoretically under the
State Department but actually apparently
run by the National Security Council
that was an illegal operation as the
Congressional General Accounting Office
later concluded in a study of it a legal
operation which had the intent of
intimidating critics and the controlling
debate and discussion over Central
America its goals as they put it were to
demonize the Sandinistas and of course
to build up support for the US client
states the u.s. terror States in the
region that was exposed during the
iran-contra hearings by one of the very
few journalists who actually did some
work on the hearings did some
journalistic work instead of just
repeating the handouts Alfonso HRD of
the Miami Herald exposed this and when
he exposed being an expert leader came
out a lot more details and congressional
hearings when he exposed that he went to
high administration officials to ask him
to talk about it and they described the
these propaganda efforts as a
spectacular success one of them
described the efforts as the kind of
operation that you would carry out an
enemy territory it's a very evocative
phrase and it expresses the attitude of
the Reaganite political leaders and in
fact of state leaders generally towards
their own populations they're an enemy
it's the domestic enemy that you have to
control and marginalize and you want to
make sure that they don't become so
curious and arrogant that they won't
find humility enough to submit to a
civil rule
the out of the creel Commission but
going back to World War one there were a
number of consequences one of the
members of the creel Commission was a
man who went on to become the leading
figure and sort of patron saint of the
modern public relations industry Edward
Bernays he later wrote about what he
called the engineering of consent which
he said was the essence of democracy
it's and the public relations industry
is devoted in the words of its own to
major industry that which was devoted to
controlling what they call the public
mind educating the American people about
the economic facts of life to ensure a
favorable climate for business and a
proper understanding of the common
interests the public mind one AT&T
executive observed 80 years ago the
public mind is the only serious danger
facing the company and it's got to be
controlled Edward Bernays went on to
carry out such operations as demonizing
the democratic capitalist government of
Guatemala working for the United Fruit
Company when the United States was
planning to overthrow it as it did in
1954 turning the country into a
charnel-house which has remained ever
since there's also an academic twist all
of this in fact it's a major theme in
the academic social sciences going back
at least 50 years or more
