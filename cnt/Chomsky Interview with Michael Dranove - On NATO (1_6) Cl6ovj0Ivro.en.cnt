I just want to know if you've any
thoughts on recent NATO actions on his
recent NATO actions and the protests
coming up at the 60th NATO conference
and now you're speaking of that counter
conference could be give so many talks I
can't remember on the NATO conference
well I mean the obvious question is why
should may to exist in fact you can ask
questions but why should ever existed
but now why does it exist I mean the
theory was whether you believe it or not
that it yeah defensive alliance against
potential Soviet aggression but that's
the basic doctrine well there's no
defense against Soviet aggression so
where they believe that doctrine or not
that's gone now when Soviet in collapsed
there had been an agreement recent
agreement between Gorbachev and the US
government then the first Bush
administration the agreement was that
Gorbachev agreed to a quite remarkable
concession he agreed to let a united
Germany join NATO a hostile military
alliance now that is remarkable in the
light of history history of the past
century Germany alone had virtually
destroyed Russia twice and Germany
backed by hostile military alliance
centered in the most phenomenal military
power in history and that's a real
threat nevertheless he agreed but there
was a quid pro quo namely that NATO
should not expand to the east so Russia
would at least have the kind of a
securities oh and George Bush and
James Baker is Secretary of State agreed
that NATO would not expand one inch to
the east Gorbachev also proposed a
nuclear-free weapons own in the region
but the US wouldn't consider that okay
so that that was the basis on which then
shortly after the Soviet Union collapsed
well Clinton came into office what did
he do one of the first things he did was
to back down on that promise and expand
native to the east well that's a
significant threat to the Soviet Union
to Russia now there was no longer any
Soviet Union so the significant and not
surprisingly they responded by beefing
up their offensive capacity not much but
some so they rescinded their pledge not
to not to use nuclear weapons and first
strike NATO had never resented it but
they had and started some
remilitarization with Bush the
aggressive militarism of the Bush
administration as predicted induced
Russia to extend further its offensive
military capacity still going on right
now the when Bush proposed missile
defense systems in Eastern Europe
ultimate chick Slovakia that was a real
provocation to the Soviet Union I mean I
was even discussed in u.s. arms control
journals that they would have to regard
it as a potential threat to their
strategic deterrent meaning as a first
strike weapon
and the claim was have had to do with
Iranian missiles but forget about that
so and they take say it's condo bhama
Obama's national security advisor James
Jones former Marine Canada is on record
as favoring expansion of NATO to the
south and the east further expansion of
NATO and also making it basically an
intervention force and the head of
native who Scheffer he has explained
that NATO must take on responsibility
for ensuring the security of pipelines
and sea lanes that is it must guarantee
NATO must be a guarantor of energy
supplies for the West well that's kind
of an unending war so do we want NATO to
exist do we want that to be there to be
a Western alliant military alliance that
carries out these activities with no
pretense of Defense except no I think
that's pretty good question i don't see
any reason why should any more than one
of this there happens to be no other
military alliance even remotely
comparable but if there were one I'd be
opposed to that too so I think the first
question is what is this all about why
why is there why should we even be
debating native it is there any reason
why I should exist
