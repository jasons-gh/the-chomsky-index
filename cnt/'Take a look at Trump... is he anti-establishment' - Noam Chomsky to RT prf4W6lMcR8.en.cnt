there are a number of factors which
converged one of them common to much of
the world including the United States
England and the continent is the impact
of the neoliberal policies of the past
generation so if you take say the United
States right before the crash 2007 at
the peak of what economists considered a
great economic miracle working people in
the United States
I had salaries that were lower than they
were 25 years earlier before the India
liberal programs were initiated that's
pretty common around the world these
programs led were designed in such a way
that they would lead to stagnation or
even decline for a large part actually a
majority of the population they also
severely undermined democracy that's
even more true in Europe than the United
States with the transfer of
decision-making to the Brussels
bureaucracy in northern banks the result
of these processes is people are angry
disillusioned their hopes of the future
are collapsed they lose personal dignity
a sense of worth wellness a lot of this
turns into scapegoating blaming people
who are even more vulnerable than you
are like immigrants let's say or in the
United States North African blacks
anger fear some there some sometimes it
takes constructive developments like the
Sanders phenomenon the United States or
movements in Europe like si podemos or
Yanis varoufakis is m25 move and so on
but a lot of the time it takes harmful
and destructive forms there are other
factors but I think these are core
common factors which follow almost
directly from the socio economic
policies that have dominated since the
Reagan Thatcher years even more so in
continental Europe an establishment is
kind of a joke that take a look at Trump
and take a look at who he's appointed
for the cabinet frankly every his latest
appointment today the Secretary of
Treasury nutrient that's the most
important position that determines a lot
of what happens in the economy is he
anti-establishment
he comes from Goldman Sachs major
investment from where he was I think for
almost 20 years
this is drawing from the billionaire
class largely financial institutions and
military and so on in fact take a look
at the stock market that tells you how
anti-establishment it is soon as Trump
was elected and since stock values in
financial institutions escalated to the
sky they're delighted he's going to
eliminate regulations that
make more profit of course it'll lead to
another crash but that's somebody else's
problem the taxpayers will take care of
that energy corporations as stock values
exploded the biggest coal producer
Peabody cold I was actually in
bankruptcy proceedings but immediately
left in the election it stuck that you
went up 50 percent later more now that
shows you how anti-establishment it is
