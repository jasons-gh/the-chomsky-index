well one thing is it's grossly
misinterpreted so it's worth remembering
that the early classical liberals say
Smith and Humboldt were pre-capitalist
later ones like John Stuart Mill were
basically Social Democrats not its
classical liberal than many much of his
thinking but sort of democratic and
policies that he advocated in fact one
of the policies he advocated was workers
self-management I thought that was an
ideal society to move towards but the if
you go to the interpretations it's kind
of interesting so for example and I once
wrote a review of the the Bicentennial
scholarly edition of Wealth of Nations
put out by the University of Chicago
with an introduction by a Nobel laureate
Chicago economist George Stigler
practically everything he said about it
was wrong
as obvious he's never looked at the book
and in fact it was so extreme that even
some of the most important parts were
not even in the index so for example
takes a division of labor everyone is
familiar with the early paragraphs about
the butcher and the
wonderful it isn't so on but when Smith
continues a couple hundred pages later
he sharply condemns division of labor
and says it's a kind of an abomination
that any civilized society will have to
overcome by government intervention and
the reason is goes right back to the
roots of classical liberalism the reason
is that division of labor will turn
every human being into a creature as
stupid and ignorant as a person can
possibly be because of this be repeating
the same actions over and over it
doesn't have a chance to exercise his
intelligence and reaches full
development and so on and that's the
core of classical liberalism well
interestingly that passage on division
of labor didn't even indexed in the
scholarly edition so if you look up
division of labor is not there another
interesting case is the notion of
invisible hand actually Smith rarely
used the phrase but the few times when
he did use it are interesting it's used
once and wealth of nations so it's hard
to miss and if you look at the context
in which it's used it's basically a
critique of contemporary neoliberalism I
mean what he points out is that he says
talking about England of course as if in
England that the merchants and the
manufacturers have decided to invest
abroad and import from abroad they might
profit but the people of England would
suffer however he says there
inclination to operate within their own
country what's called home country bias
will lead them as if by an invisible
hand not to carry out these actions and
therefore things will work out in
England that's an argument against
neoliberalism that's the one use of the
phrase invisible and and wealth of
nations they use it again in his other
major book Moral Sentiments and he says
there is interesting he says that the
Ark is that even if you have a cruel and
vicious landlord who takes all the land
and so on nevertheless his natural
concern for the happiness of other
people will lead him as if by an
invisible and to make sure that the
necessities of life are distributed as
equally as they would be if there was an
equal distribution in the first place
that's the second use of Invisible Man
exactly and of course that's based on
his conception shared with David Hume
and others that a core element of human
nature is sympathy fact the equivalent
ocean so for Smith we have a natural
inclination to appreciate and enjoy the
happiness of others even if we don't
gain from it a role that he contrasts
that natural instinct with what he calls
the vile maxim of the Masters of man
all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else and he evidently thinks that the
benevolent element which is the core of
human nature will overcome the impact of
the vile Maxim
those are his uses of invisible hand and
weak the one case-by-case he's this is
pre-capitalist thinking now he wasn't
entirely pre-capitalist by any means so
for example if you look at Smith's
recommendations to the newly independent
American colonies actually during during
the Revolutionary War he gave advice to
the colonies the word was now the United
States - as to what policies they should
follow and the policies he advised are
what are called sound economics
basically the Washington Consensus
neoclassical economics just what's told
of the third world today so concentrate
on what you're good at
you know what later was both comparative
advantage for the colonies he said
produce primary products that
agriculture kind of overlooked slavery
but
the primary products of fish for
agricultural products and don't try to
develop industrial products because
England is much superior so everyone
will gain if you import advanced
industry and just you know but standards
of the day was advanced industrial
projects from England instead of
producing your own that will be
beneficial to everyone that's
contemporary economics well of course
the colonies were independent so they
didn't have to follow sound economics so
they did exactly the opposite mmm what
they did is block British manufacturers
with very high tariffs make the highest
tariffs in the world well into the 20th
century were able to develop a textile
industry for stage of Industrial
Revolution then all the accessories to a
textile industry you know like making
equipments or later in the century of
steel industry blocking superior British
steel and the finally the u.s. developed
actually followed Britain's own course
that's the way Britain at develop by
radically violating sound economics and
in fact that generalized to every
developed State Smith also urged the
colonies not to try to monopolize the
agricultural products that where they
had a natural advantage what he was
thinking of primarily was
compliments of the oil of the early
Industrial Revolution and again that's
what sound economics is that the
colonies did the opposite so they first
did develop a huge cotton production
through slavery the most radical
violation you can imagine market
principle and also by conquering half
America one of the goals of the conquest
of half of Mexico Texas what snow south
Southwest and West the United States was
to try to monopolize and the reason was
very straightforward the enemy in those
days was England England had a big
military force
it was preventing the United States from
conquering Canada from Cuba them knew
the idea was we the take a look at the
Jackson Orion presidents you know those
has revolved in the conquest of Mexico
what they said it straight out is that
if we can monopolize power we can bring
the England through air to our feet will
be able to overcome so if you take a
look at the record they did exactly the
opposite of south economics and prosper
on the other hand say take say Egypt go
back to say to the early 19th century
Egypt was about in the same not
identical but it was rather similar to
the early United States and its prospect
it
developmentalists dictator Muhammad Ali
he had cotton didn't have slaves but
they had you know could have developed
it was rich agriculture
that's why pullian conquered it in fact
and had the conditions that could have
led to an industrial revolution but they
had to follow sound economics by force
yeah the British simply announced
straight out that they were never going
to allow independent economic
development in the eastern Mediterranean
French collaborated and so Egypt did
follow the principles of economics and
Egypt is Egypt the United States is the
United States that generalizes worldwide
