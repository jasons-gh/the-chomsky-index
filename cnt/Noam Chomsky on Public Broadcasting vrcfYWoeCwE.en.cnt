the public broadcasting is not subject
as much at least to business and to
corporate and advertiser pressures
however of course it's subject to state
pressures and how free and independent
public broadcasting is depends
typically on how free the state is not
like in a free society public
broadcasting will be free for many years
the BBC was very independent with sure
another anti-democratic reactionary the
BBC has been become much more
constrained because the British
government is also imposing harsh
constraints on freedom of expression
under Thatcher another's mislabeled
conservative and but turning to the
United States public broadcasting is
very weak as compared with virtually any
other country any other democratic
country you know any of the you look at
the industrial democratic societies they
all have public broadcasting some of
them have only public broadcasting for
example in Israel is only a state TV in
England until recently there was only
state TV and now there's another channel
to whether generals I think in Canada FA
till recently there was only CBC there
may be another one now I forgotten but
that's common I mean those are major
channels and that's true of most
countries and how free they are depends
on how free the country is in the United
States they're very weak because here
things are run by corporations this is a
business run society and things supposed
to be under corporate control so public
broadcasting is very limited and in fact
it survives to a large extent on
corporate donations which is a
constraint Gulf and Western and one
famous case forced wnet TV in New York
to cancel a program on hunger simply by
saying they remove their submission and
they submit and public broadcasting is
is you know it varies across the country
in the major centers like Boston and
Washington and New York
it's very very narrow it's in fact it's
I think it's more tightly sensor than
corporate radio and television in other
parts of the country like you know
Laramie Wyoming and Des Moines Iowa and
maybe here it's more free and that makes
sense the same is true of the commercial
media because in the ideological centers
it's much more important to control what
people think what they think out and the
sticks doesn't matter so much because
there isn't much they can do about it
and as a result it's more open I mean I
can see that myself if I go to Laramie I
get interviewed on public television on
public television but the thing you can
see virtually inconceivable and awesome
and you know maybe a minute now and then
or something in the interests of you
know fairness but and the reason is that
you know for the main centers like say
Boston are subject to what's called a
liberal bias meaning tightly controlled
by ideological managers who know their
business and don't let things get out of
hand I think it's possible to put the
kind of pressures on public broadcasting
that can't be done on corporate media
but to that that requires organization
and real participation there are other
forms I should say one of the most some
of the most interesting and important
things are listener supported radio now
that's usually a small-scale operation
you know fly-by-night operation but
they're very important that's really out
of corporate control or state control
and you can tell you travel around as I
do to communities and the ones that have
listener supported radio are quite
different there's just an independent
culture that can sustain itself there
with people participating and you know
involvement of the community I mean it's
just much more democratic and that you
can see the results but that's you know
very limited resources because resources
lie essentially in the business
community
