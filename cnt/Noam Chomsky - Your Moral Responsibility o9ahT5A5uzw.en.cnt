they say that what the media do is to
ignore certain kinds of inferences that
are committed by us and our friends and
to play off enormously atrocities that
are that are committed by them and our
enemies and U+ I can say the Massey
Lectures that there's a test integrity
and moral honesty which is to have a
kind of equality of treatment of corpses
for these principles and I mean that
every dead person should be in Princeton
but every other dead person what I said
well I'm glad that's not what you say
because that's not what you do of course
it's not what I say I say the opposite
what I say is that makes me responsible
for our own actions primarily that's
something I wasn't equating them I was
comparing the treatment of them and
right if you want my value judgment they
should give much more attention to one
increase the we've killed then to a
hundred priests the Dave Kim this is
exactly that's exactly my methods to
ignore it's not not so much not only
talking work work the course is created
by them but also to learn courses that
are created by neither side but which
are irrelevant to ideological and that
one of you are one of your own causes
then you take very seriously the cosmic
Palestinians and Palestinians weighs
very heavily on your conscience and get
a Kurdish course doesn't support groups
for years the Kurdish that's the people
who are involved and I mean you know
they come and sign their petitions and
if you look at the stuff that the things
we've written and it takes a group does
take a look I mean I'm not analyst
internationally I can't do everything
you know I'm single universe person but
if you read
say they take a look saying that the
book that Edward Herman and I wrote on
this topic we wrote a book about this in
1979 in it we let's discuss three kinds
of atrocities went to three kinds of
blood that's what we called benign would
this watching the cares of them
constructive blood baths which other
ones we like and nefarious would that's
which of the wounds of the bad guys do
constructive blood baths or things like
the Indonesian massacres which we
supported my various blood bets are like
fun what we also discussed ones that
nobody cares about like Burundi first
probably the only discussion in the
literature I guess of the massacres that
we're going on in Burundi at that time
well we probably have the only
discussion delusions that I know of not
true the truth
we went out of our way to find the kinds
of blood bath or just ignored because
there's about them well again let me
stress
I'm not Amnesty International I do not
have the they either they yep ISM which
makes me the arbiter of all atrocities
over the world right I'm trying to give
an aid in this country and being managed
to this country and so on
I think principle that I think we go to
follow is not the one that you stated
it's the principle that we rightly
expect Soviet dissidents to follow so
what principle that we expect such a
rough to follow let's say what lets us
decide whether Sakharov some moral
person I think he is but suffer up does
not treat every corpse as it does not
treat every truck the trusted me is
identical has nothing to say about
American atrocities care about them what
he talks about in Soviet atrocities and
that's right because those are the ones
that he's responsible for but his just
just as it's a very simple difficult
point you're responsible for the
predictable consequences of your actions
I'm not responsible for the predictable
consequence of somebody else's action
now we understand this when we're
talking about dissidents in the Soviet
Union okay well we refuse don't
understand that when we're talking about
ourselves for very good reasons
commissar is in Soviet Union don't
understand that about dissidents
commissar is in the soviet union attacks
utter of and other dissidents because
they don't talk about american crimes
right we understand exactly why that's
just hypocrisy and cynicism when they do
it that we should understand the same
when we do it well the fact of the
matter is that I spend a fair amount of
effort on crimes of official enemies
there are a fair number of people in the
United States and Canada from the Soviet
unity in Eastern Europe who are there
because of my personal activities in
their behalf I don't think any pride in
that particularly I just do it because
I'm interested in the most important
thing but four million for you is to
think about the consequences of your
actions what can you affect all those of
the ones who primarily ought to be
concerned about
of course it reports it equips but
there's some that you can affect and
there others you can't do much about
well I like I can be worried about
things that happen in the 18th century
but I can't do much about them
