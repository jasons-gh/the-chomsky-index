okay in hopes and prospects you
mentioned your colleague Kenneth Hale
and has worked with Native Americans in
your opinion how important is the
problem of language extinction that is
how important is it for humanity to
preserve the current level of linguistic
diversity well Ken hell was whose friend
of hands as well and the teacher was a
fantastic linguist in person also he he
worked extensively with indigenous
languages all over the world
Australia he was one founders of
Australian linguistics were for the
Native American languages central
american african and so on and he did
really amazing work but this particular
aspect of his work was something that
greatly concerned and interested him
trying to protect for and as he pointed
out correctly when a language disappears
a lot is lost a language is a repository
of cultural wealth it's a way this
actually relates to what I was saying
before each language is a way of
understanding and interpreting the world
it carries the wealth of tradition and
history oral history which can be
extremely rich i'm alexi takes of the
bible for example for a thousand years
that was oral history before anything
was written down homers oral history and
that's all over the world that we're
losing those treasures every time a
language disappears and for the people
themselves they're losing their identity
if English disappeared we would lose our
cultural identity and that same is true
if it's a small group somewhere well one
of Ken's achievements in this regard
which was quite spectacular was to take
the language which was one of the major
languages spoken right here before the
colonists came every
where the United States is not an
ordinary form of imperialism the United
States is a settler colonial society in
fact that's true of the whole what's
called the Anglosphere the countries
that grew out of the British Britain's
imperial domination the United States
Canada and Australia
mostly New Zealand these are countries
where these settlers who came and didn't
just run the country the way the British
did in India the British in India
provided that bureaucrats the you know
the officer corps and so on but Indians
around the country under British rule
settler colonial societies are different
like ours if you go back to the founders
of the country like say George
Washington he understood very well that
we have to as he put it
extirpate of the Iroquois they're in our
way we have to wipe them out they're an
advanced civilization they in fact were
the basis for much of the American
constitutional system but we had to
extricate them they're in their way
Thomas Jefferson said we have to
exterminate the native populations
because they're attacking us why are
they attacking us well because we're
taking everything away from them he
didn't say that but in general the
settler colonial societies have to
pretty much exterminate the indigenous
populations or else marginalized them
well that's happened to here so where
we're sitting was a place where the
indigenous population was close to
exterminated pretty close to it there
are survivors one of the major languages
spoken was wanted up it hadn't been
spoken for a century the last speaker
was a century ago
ken and some students and woman from the
whompin I've tried which still exists
Jesse little though I managed to
reconstruct the language using
comparative evidence from other
languages and missionary texts that were
taken and preserved and from this they
were able to reconstruct what the
language must have been and it now has
its first native speaker Jessie little
those daughter who's a native speaker of
wampa not this is revitalized the tribe
it's there now studying it there
reconstructing their history their
reviving it's a pretty amazing
achievement Jessie got her PhD with us
with Ken it's the first time this has
ever happened I think now there are
efforts to do it in other places but if
you can revive I mean right now if
there's enormous destruction going on a
species destruction for example is
taking place at a level that hasn't
happened for 65 million years literally
at the time when an asteroid hit the
earth apparently and wiped out the
dinosaurs and a majority of living
species were destroyed mammals survived
that's where wrath why we were around
but that right now the same things
happening species destruction is
happening that at that level and now
we're the asteroid of course we're
destroying the species got massive great
language destruction is kind of a little
like that at a cultural and human level
you're destroying the richness of human
civilization and understanding of the
world it's disappearing fast it's
disappearing in Europe not just in
indigenous cultures so if you go to say
Italy there are people all over the
place who can't talk to their
grandmothers their grandmothers speak a
different language
they're called dialects but they're
actually different languages the number
of languages in Europe has contracted
radically over recent years through the
policies of state formation when states
are forms the formation of states is an
extremely violent
that it imposes a rigid form on
societies that and which brings bringing
together people have nothing to do with
each other and separating people owe
everything to do with each other
that's why Europe was the most savage
place in the world for centuries well
the process of state formation was
taking place you look around the world
today and just about every major
conflict is based on the imperial
borders borders were imposed by the
imperial powers for their own interests
and forming states which have no
significance for most of the people so
it takes a Pakistan and Afghanistan we
talk about terrorists crossing Pakistan
to Afghanistan they are many of them are
just Pashtun moving from one part of
Pashtun territory to another part of
Pashtun territory which is separated by
a line that the British imposed the
Durand Line which the Afghans have never
accepted and the Pashtun have never
accepted that happens everywhere
President Obama one of his achievements
has been to break all records and
deporting undocumented immigrants almost
2 million they're crossing a border the
mexico-us border which like state
borders generally was established by
brutal violence and oppression the u.s.
conquered half of Mexico President Grant
described it as been fought in it square
the war described it as the most wicked
war in history well okay that
established the border it was a pretty
open border the same kind of people
living on both sides until very recently
it's been heavily militarized now
primarily since NAFTA when NAFTA the
North American Free Trade Agreement was
instituted President Clinton his
advisers understood very well that this
is going to devastate Mexican
the Mexican economy and it's going to
destroy Mexican agriculture it's gonna
undermine small business and so alone
Mexican Campuzano is going to be quite
efficient but they can't compete with
highly subsidized the US agribusiness so
there's going to be a flow of immigrants
so we got to militarize the border to
prevent them send them back right now
for this day right here and near Boston
right around us there are people fleeing
from the Guatemalan Highlands Mayan
Indians fleeing from the Guatemalan
Highlands their languages are also being
destroyed why are they fleeing from the
Guatemalan Highlands well under Ronald
Reagan of the us-supported a genocidal
attack on the Highlands and the Mayan
Indians by the military dictatorship we
were backing in Guatemala and the
devastation was so extreme that they're
still fleeing well they're fleeing we
deport them they're coming across from
Mexico we deport them that's a state for
that's the way borders work all over the
world that's the way it works you take a
look at the horror stories all over the
world almost entirely the result of the
imposition of state borders which also
has the consequence of wiping out lots
of languages when you impose a state
border that the constitutes a France or
Italy or Germany or Guatemala or
whatever it may be or the United States
for that matter you're wiping out huge
numbers of languages which are internal
to the well this is a kind of it's not
species destruction but it's kind of
analogous to us that's going on all the
time and the effort to save species
cultures societies languages is a major
effort happening in Europe too so right
now there's a referendum coming up in
Catalonia another one Scotland
asking about autonomy or independence
that's dissolving the European state
system something which has been going on
for a while and reconstructing the
languages actually I visited Barcelona
in late 70s you couldn't hear a word of
Catalan it was spoken but secret because
under the dictatorship which the us back
it was bar ten years later if you go to
Catalonia all you hear is Catalan it
revived the Basque languages revived
other regional languages are reviving if
you walk around Wales kids walking out
of school or talking Welsh
things like this are happening that
Ken's achievement was unique but it's a
kind of a natural development I think
you should be stimulated myself but we
should recognize that there's enormous
loss when the cultural wealth of a
society disappears
that's encapsulated crucially in its
language
