Welcome to: What Happened, Question and Answer about Egypt with Professor Chomsky 
This event is organized by the Egyptian Students' Union at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
My name is Tariq Rakha, and as the president of this federation, I am pleased to welcome you on behalf of the members and directors of the federation. 
Our goal as a student group is to be an incentive to create an alliance between Egypt and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
We have three goals 
Supporting the Egyptian economic development, technological industries, scientific progress, civil society and entrepreneurship 
We also aim to represent Egyptian culture on campus and in Boston 
And the formation of a community for Egyptians at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Boston 
We support these goals through many activities 
We have given you a glimpse of it through the leaflet that we gave you when you entered the hall 
But we will be happier if we can communicate with you, and to always inform you about what we organize as a student union. 
Therefore, we are present on all social media 
For more information about us, follow us on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube 
If you want to support us, we welcome your donations. Email us and we will show you more details 
We promise you enjoyable and exciting activities 
A small word on behalf of the Egyptian Students' Union at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
I would like to make it clear that we, as a student group, do not belong to any political orientations 
The Executive Council and the members of the Union have politically different opinions, but we maintain our friendship, and we continue to represent our country with all our heart. 
On behalf of the Federation, I would also like to thank Professor Chomsky for his kind acceptance of our invitation, we are really grateful 
Special thanks to Professor Nazli Shukri, which I will present in moments, and she will present Professor Chomsky, for her gracious acceptance of the Department of Dialogue and Questions. 
A huge effort was made and many volunteered at this event, so allow me to thank the Executive Council and the members of the Federation 
Without you, this event would not have succeeded in the way we see it now through the use of various methods of marketing or technology, and also your leadership in organizing. Thank you. 
I would also like to thank members of the "Egyptians in Boston" who answered the call to help us seriously 
You interviewed a lot of them as you entered the hall 
We are grateful for the audiovisual sector at MIT, Campus Campus Activities, MIT Police 
And the financial support from the big event fund that we got to partially support the costs of the event 
Finally I must say, it is a great honor to welcome Professor Chomsky, and to present Professor Shukry, and we are very happy for your presence. 
Professor Nazli Shoukry is a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
Her research focuses on the sources and consequences of international changes with a focus on international cooperation and conflict 
She is the designer and director of "Global System for Sustainable Development," the online multilingual knowledge system 
She is the principal investigator of the multi-year, multi-disciplinary "International Cyber   Relationships" project between the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University. 
She is also the founding editor of the Global Environmental Consensus series from Dar Ben, Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Publication, former general editor of the journal Review of Political Science. 
His newest book is called "International Cyber   Relations." 
Please welcome Professor Shukry with me 
Friends, colleagues, gentlemen, and ladies 
It gives me great pleasure to present a gentleman tonight, Noam Chomsky 
And the truth does not need to be presented. But the protocol will have to be presented, so I will start introducing it briefly 
And I start by telling you what you already know, a prestigious scientist and political philosopher 
Currently, he is Professor Fakhry (retired) in Language Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he taught throughout his career. 
As most of you know it is famous as the theoretician of "transformational generative grammar." 
In researching what I will say as his introduction, I learned a great deal about "Towards Transformational Generation." 
But I will not share with you what I understood about this science in the presence of the same view here 
A few important points from the MIT's view that Professor Chomsky is "Professor of the Institute," 
He won this title in 1976 
This is the highest honor a professor can obtain at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for his professional and scientific bid. 
Also for what it provided to the MIT community 
He has received ten honorary university degrees from institutions around the world 
He is the eighth scientist most mentioned in scientific references for a very long time 
He is clearly one of the most influential opinion scholars alive in the world 
Before I leave for the platform to Professor Chomsky, let me suggest what the "rules of the game" are for our evening 
Please keep the questions very brief so that we can cover as many questions as possible 
The second point is that the question is only one if you do not mind until we can proceed smoothly 
Thank you, and I leave now the platform for Professor Chomsky 
The fact that I am standing here in front of the large number of attendees in this large hall may be misleading so let me dispel any false impressions 
I am here to open the dialogue 
I do not claim to have a deep understanding of the notable events that have occurred in Egypt in the past few years 
I follow them closely as much as I can, but I am not looking for them deeply 
And most of the most important sources in Arabic have no access to them 
Another reason for my personal hesitation 
It is that I find myself in an amazing mismatch with some of my closest old good friends in Egypt 
People who always respect their opinions, and follow their activities with great admiration 
I will try to explain why in my introduction 
I will first give a quick review of the most important events that I am sure you are familiar with 
Beginning in January 2011, the uprising or some call it a revolution 
That happened when the Tahrir Square was occupied 
Which generated a series of impressive events that led to the fall of the US-backed dictator and many other accomplishments 
Political life has been dynamically opened, and many opportunities have been well taken advantage of 
Freedom to join organizations, exchange, speak 
And one of the very important accomplishments that was not published heavily here, except in the specialized literature 
Are the rights of workers 
Egypt has had a militant and active labor movement for many years outside the official frameworks 
There was a formal union, but it was often inclined to control the workforce rather than work for them 
But outside the structure of that institution there was an active labor struggle taking place 
It was almost accelerated ten years ago when the new liberal programs were established as vigorously as everywhere, the world, including them here 
They had typical results 
One of them was that they were praised by international financial institutions, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the US Treasury and many economists 
They had numbers that looked good 
But under the numbers they had typical results we have familiar with here 
The sharp rise in equality 
Very high concentration of affluence 
Eliminate social support systems 
Population decay, severe repression, unlimited corruption, usual results around the world 
Which led to the uprising almost everywhere 
In Latin America she led a fascinating liberating movement in South America from 500 years of Western domination 
What began in the Arab Spring in Tunisia and Egypt was partly an uprising against the imposition of the cruel neoliberal regime 
Combined with the staunch opposition of the United States, which is heavily backed 
And there were great achievements in workers' rights, very quickly 
Initially, the labor movement was not directly involved in the uprising in the occupation of Tahrir Square 
But she started to participate in a simple time 
It gave her a huge fan base 
The general strike was one of the most important factors that imposed on army leaders (the junta) to remove dictator Mubarak 
An independent unit was created for the first time, outside the framework of Sharia frameworks 
This broke the monopoly of the country's trade unions 
The participation of the workers' movement in the uprising added social and economic demands to narrow political goals and made great achievements 
Minimum wage hikes, new unions, and much more 
The researcher who covers most of this is (Joel Penon) from Stanford University 
It is strongly reviewed and illustrated as a major achievement 
And that was more hidden 
It is to give human dignity and a voice to people who were oppressed and marginalized and had no voice 
All of this was causing concern to the United States and its allies 
They do not like these developments 
This was precipitated by studies of public opinion in Egypt at that time 
Egypt and the rest of the Arab world 
It was done through American polling agencies 
Of course, they are known to the elite planners and elements who are not mentioned to the United States in the media 
Or hardly mentioned 
But these studies are exciting, and they help to understand the American position regarding the developments that took place 
American official positions 
In Egypt, at the time of Tahrir Square's occupation, polling took place through one of the major American polling agencies 
They found that a large percentage of the people, approximately eighty percent, find that the greatest threat they face is the United States and Israel 
They do not like Iran in the Arab world 
But like elsewhere, Iran was not considered a threat. Ten percent could consider Iran a threat 
In fact, the opposition to US policies was very strong in the people 
So much so that the majority in Egypt believed that the region would be safer if nuclear weapons were developed in Iran to balance the power of the United States and Israel 
If you have a functioning democracy, the most popular opinion will influence the policies 
And it is very clear that the United States does not want to implement these policies 
And, as usual, the fear of democracy has directed most of US policies in terms of suppressing information to the public here, as well as political measures 
This is actually normal 
There were elections, and the Islamists won, mostly the Muslim Brotherhood 
They have been the best organized groups for many years 
They were illegal most of the time under dictatorship 
But they were effective, and the organization enabled them 
One of the facts that enabled them to win was the elections 
The other thing is that there were many divisions in the schism of the left-wing liberal secular coalition 
Which, in fact, got the majority of votes 
More than half of the Egyptians voted for the so-called revolutionary candidates 
Candidates from those sectors in the presidential elections last summer 
But there were six certified candidates from those groups 
They were parted, so the Brotherhood won easily. And the Salafis played a big role 
They imposed a very harsh regime 
The junta maintained its strong role in dominating society 
The government made limited efforts to share the rule, and they became unpopular 
And in our year, there was a major uprising, the 30th of June 
Large numbers of people flocked to the streets to protest and demand the government's resignation 
Two days later, the military takeover came on the third of July 
This is part of the background 
My personal aspirations and sympathies, in fact also my friends, with the mass popular uprising movement on the thirtieth of June 
But I think they are making a serious mistake in supporting the military coup 
Or many of them denied that a coup had taken place 
He put their faith in the army's commitment to defend what they call the people against the Brotherhood 
This is a term to be avoided 
The people are deeply divided 
You almost don't like the Brotherhood or don't like their behavior, but they do exist 
They are a large part of the population and cannot be eliminated 
So the reference for the people indicates that there is something very misleading in the comments 
And their belief that the army will move to establish a secular democratic regime is mistaken in my view 
I think this is highly unlikely 
Most likely, the army will do whatever the army does anywhere 
And historically in Egypt as well. It will be imposed and has already imposed a brutal and cruel regime 
Their goal will be to consolidate their power through the political system and also to support their control of a fundamental economic empire 
They will destroy those who disagree with them, underestimate civil and human rights, and this is already happening 
My unhappy expectation is that my liberal, secular, left-wing friends who welcomed the army 
They will soon be their victims, just as they did in the past, and it is beginning to happen now 
One of the best global correspondents with knowledge in the region, Patrick Coburn, recently wrote after returning from Egypt 
Egypt is on the verge of a new dark age, with the generals setting the goal and drawing close to ending it 
With ten retired generals and two police chiefs from Mubarak's era appointed as temporary governors 
Egypt is effectively under military rule 
Of course, there is great support from Saudi Arabia, and other elements who have appeared to react from the Islamic world 
The West prefers them to the Brotherhood 
The United States, like Britain before it, tilted overwhelmingly to support the most radical Islamists in opposing national secularism for understandable reasons. 
They do not like the Brotherhood specifically, but that is another matter 
Saudi Arabia and the Salafists are considered the most extreme side 
It is possible, Coburn predicts, that this will lead to a bloody civil war 
Joel Benin (Egyptian labor specialist writes that the security forces after the military takeover) 
They quickly crushed my struggle, I quote him, at the Suez Canal 
In the Suez Canal city area which, not by chance, was at the forefront of the revolutionary forces that forced Mubarak to step down from power 
Whatever the popularity of the army at that moment, the workers are now confronting an authoritarian, empty, hostile state that is hostile to their rights and aspirations in public. 
I think it is true 
As I said, there are real gains, and they may be continuous, but they are in danger 
And I think the danger is very serious 
There are now two main hotspots of power, one is the Islamists and the other is the army 
And they (the army) are now in the lead 
With strong support from left-wing liberal secularists 
As I said it is wrong 
Two weeks ago, a new initiative was launched calling itself the Revolutionary Road Front 
Al-Ahram newspaper describes them as a new initiative against the Brotherhood and against the army, which was launched to achieve the goals of the revolution 
It has well-known political figures, activists, leaders of the workers and others 
The speaker at the press conference in which they declared themselves was Wael Gamal, an impressive leftist economist, whom I met two months ago in Egypt. 
He writes and says at the press conference: It has been two and a half years since the revolution began 
The Egyptians did not realize their dreams of building a new republic that would provide them with democracy, justice and equality 
Millions took to the street twice 
Once in January 2011 to topple the Mubarak regime, which was based on corruption and repression 
And again in June 2013, until Mohamed Morsi withdrew by force after losing legitimacy 
As a result of the Brotherhood's attempt to monopolize political life and rebuild a repressive regime 
Quoted from the pyramid: The goal of the front is to work to redistribute wealth and achieve social justice 
Fighting the formation of a repressive regime, achieving equality between citizens 
Defining the path of transitional justice and adopting foreign policies that guarantee autonomy 
If this is achieved, it will ensure the United States opposes it 
Is this possible? I don't know, I hope so 
I think it is the best hope now to save Egypt from what could be the darkest periods of its history under military rule 
Thank you 
So, if you allow me, I will, stay there 
One brief comment, then a question 
My comment is related to the role of youth 
I don't know how best to name them 
Generations are much younger than those who are older 
Moving, in the early stage 
They are a more browsing generation, more passionate, more exposed to global thinking, and connected in many ways to communication 
So the structure of that age group should be taken into account in the dynamics of events 
The question I have, and depending on your response, I may have another question to follow 
And is there any situations that make you think it is reasonable, or acceptable? 
I will not say that it is good, but acceptable, that there will be military intervention and a military coup? 
Are there any modes ... ok 
You can imagine modes 
But I think there will be a huge burden to prove these situations by anyone who defends a military coup anywhere 
And specifically in Egypt, the ugly history with the army 
And that, by chance, went on during Morsi's tenure 
He also continued after that, crushing the Suez sit-in is an unhappy example of this 
I will be the last to be a supporter or endorse anything good about any army 
But there is an aspect that we have not really touched upon 
I will just comment, and will not ask until we can proceed 
It is that we have seen a steady progression of law and order and any type of police protection 
Although there was not much of this, the indication here is that when a citizen carries his own weapon 
And when there is secret circulation of weapons for legitimate self-defense 
So (the reviewer) at least says, that this is an indication of the erosion of the social system 
I consider this to be unjustified 
But if there are no institutions that provide the least degree of protection to citizens other than the army 
So it is difficult to reject them 
But how is their situation legalized to make it a temporary matter and how are they expelled after they fulfill their role is another question 
At that point we can direct questions to Professor Chomsky 
thank you so much 
If the criticism of the Morsi government and the Muslim Brotherhood is largely legitimate 
What would be the alternative way for the people in Egypt to respond to their fears and feelings of insecurity 
And is it possible that Morsi made a political and strategic error in his acceptance of the policies of the neoliberal economic system to which I have referred? 
Linked to this is a mutual friend of ours who helped found "New Partners in Health" near us here in Cambridge 
He is now President of the World Bank, Jim Kim. Can you comment on the role of institutions such as the World Bank in this ongoing scenario? 
These are two different questions 
It is a fact that the Morsi government completed the neoliberal programs 
Whether or not this is wrong depends on your point of view 
It was a mistake from the point of view of the people because those programs hurt them 
Otherwise, if he had not taken them, the United States and its allies would have moved very quickly to support his overthrow 
Because that is what they require to accept a ruling regime, and it was a weak system, and that is why it happened 
As for Jim Kim, a good friend, an old friend of mine 
He took the presidency of the World Bank with two cautious eyes, hoping to change his direction 
We will see to what extent he will be able to achieve these goals 
I don't personally criticize him for taking this position, I don't think we should do this 
It is possible to say that I will be separated from all institutions because they are extremely repressive and ruthless, and this is a possible situation 
But another position is to try to find a way through them to alleviate their worst actions and effects 
This started to happen, and with the International Monetary Fund as well 
For example, the International Monetary Fund withdrew from the trilogy, which imposed a strict austerity program, mainly in southern Europe 
The International Monetary Fund has withdrawn 
And it has already come up with studies that discuss and demonstrate that austerity programs under recession are the worst ever 
Well, the IMF economists were hiding this, and I am not criticizing them for this 
As for the first part of the question, about the alternatives available to the people 
First we must take care, not the people 
They are a faction of the people who oppose the Brotherhood and the Salafists 
We do not know what the percentages are 
One of the most knowledgeable analysts of the "Krish" estimates that maybe a third of the people support the Brotherhood and others like the Salafists and even to the most extremist parties. 
But they are divided, and the question is what can others do? 
Well, there are some answers 
It also mentioned that in the presidential elections, last summer they were divided into six candidates 
They had the majority, but they were busy fighting each other 
They did not form a coalition that could have won the presidency 
There were other elections after that, which were not perfect at all, and there are many problems with them 
But they were relatively open elections in an appropriately open society so they could participate in this 
And take a parliamentary path to topple the Morsi regime 
Part of the reasons why I don't, I think 
They were not sure that they were able to take this path at all 
However, we do not agree with our analyzes, the army's call to do this for you does not improve security 
It really drives what we have seen 
First, real massacres, the Brotherhood and hundreds of those killed, crushing sit-ins in key areas, and implementing the system we expect from the army. 
I am sure you have seen the newspapers this morning 
A long report on the leaks of the Military Council discussions, internal discussions under Morsi 
When their strengths were limited in limited measure, they were subjected to at least a public examination 
The discussions led by the new leader were designed to find ways to resist the fact that they are under close scrutiny 
And that their economic empire and their political power are overcome in limited and shrinking ways 
I believe that the coup is an attempt to ensure that this will not happen 
I hope I'm wrong, but I very doubt that it will be my friends who will suffer from their support for this act 
I hope that the next question will be brief and a single question 
Hello Professor Chomsky, my question is 
Do you think I am what it is called (stable countries) may be satisfied with itself, and do not expect such revolutions 
Do you think I am what is called stable countries may be satisfied with themselves, and do not expect such revolutions 
Do you think I am what it is called (stable countries) may be satisfied with itself, and do not expect such revolutions 
Can revolutions like this happen anywhere in the world? 
If you mean Western governments, the countries of the world differ everywhere 
Western governments are not satisfied at all 
But they do not have the power they had before 
There are many, and I am sure you know, there are many rumors circulating in the region 
In Egypt and in fact in the entire Middle East region, about the great power of the United States 
And it manages everything 
In the two parts of the split in Egypt, there are accusations that the United States supports the other side 
Manages and manipulates everything 
And the same stories are told in Syria 
And it is far from the truth 
The United States, and more than its allies, have limited ability to influence what happens, some influence, but it is limited 
And not as it was before when they could hold military coups and so on, this time is largely over 
But they are not satisfied, they have their goals 
The United States, for example, is very concerned about the interests of its major allies 
Its main allies are the Saudi dictatorship and Israel 
The two are strong supporters of military rule 
So yes, the United States is for this and for other reasons will continue to support military rule 
Not because it caused the coup, it did not, but it supports the result 
Specifically, if the military government continues to establish the policies it started from attacking independent labor movements, weakening rights, etc. 
This is what the United States naturally supports 
The reaction to the polls you mentioned is a good example 
In fact, to move on for a moment, because we have to be concerned with ourselves 
It was very exciting to watch the leak of a reaction to what revealed the situation in the Arab world 
WikiLeaks issued documents showing that Arab dictators 
Some of them gave very strong support to the United States for Iran 
If I read today's papers, they will write enthusiastically about how the Arabs support the harsh position of the United States against Iran 
In fact, the reaction was so extreme that a number of leading commentators in the United States and Britain 
Jacob Halpern here, and Janan Rahman from the Financial Times in London 
They started joking about how it appears that the CIA is managing WikiLeaks 
Because they issued information that strongly supports US policies 
There is a marginal comment here, that they were referring to the positions of dictators 
The attitudes of peoples are radically different 
But for people who despise democracy, they find that what people think is irrelevant 
The important thing is the dictators, and if they support us then everything is fine 
If people think what I have told you, this has nothing to do 
This is what they see inside 
So yes they are watching, and they do what they can do, but what they can do has limits 
Thank you Professor Chomsky for speaking today, and thank you, the Federation of Egyptian Students, for holding this event 
I want to read you a quote and see how your response will be to General Hugh Shelton's ex who said 
General Sissi put an end to the new Middle East project 
If Morsi had not been overthrown by General Sisi, Egypt would have been another Syria, and its army would have been destroyed 
This is a baseless expectation 
As I mentioned, there were opportunities within the parliamentary system to continue to operate 
There were, without doubt, threats, and there was repression, much of it coming from the army, from the army itself, under Morsi's rule 
But they have not retreated from their cruel and authoritarian behavior 
In fact, you can see it in the leaked report this morning and in their actions 
So yes they were there, but there were opportunities and I did not find any indications that it was going to turn into Syria 
Actually, I think it's probably the opposite 
I doubt that Patrick Coburn was correct in his conclusion as I mentioned 
The army's seizure and dark age foreshadows it and the harsh and strict blocking of the Brotherhood, which is a large part of the people 
Or whatever you think of them, it could lead to a bloody civil war 
This is what may lead to the perception of a situation like Syria or perhaps worse, but I do not think that there are real indications of that before 
Sir, in the past two or three years people have seen the Muslim Brotherhood and the army in power 
Based on this, do you think that we will get a break from political Islam for about ten or fifteen years? 
If this is the case, is the western model of democracy the best path for Egypt and the Middle East countries to modernity and development? 
Do I think democracy is the best path? 
The Western model of democracy 
What is ... the western model of democracy is totally counter to democracy. We should be honest about this 
The anti-democratic elite in the United States is also being applied locally, and we can talk about it 
But if you mean the theoretical application of the Western model represented in propaganda and thought 
Yes I think this is a good model 
But the axes of power in the West and elsewhere do not want this. They want it here and do not want it in Egypt 
Is it the best model, yes I think so 
So I always think he doesn't get the attention 
I must mention that nothing is new to this 
To those of you who want to know more, look at history 
The United States community is very open, and therefore they have an unusual gateway to internal layouts 
It is not used a lot but it is there 
An example of this, more than fifty years ago, 1958 
President Eisenhower, these are articles that have long been declassified 
President Eisenhower asked his staff for an internal discussion 
He asked: Why is there a hatred campaign against us in the Arab world, not from the governments that support us, but from the people 
This was amazing, the same time in 1958 
In a short period of time before Eisenhower, he had intervened to drive Britain, France and Israel out of Egypt 
It was believed that this would lead to support from the people of the Arab world 
But on the contrary there was a hatred campaign 
At the same time, the highest planning bodies of the National Security Council issued an internal document detailing developments within the Arab world 
And they said that there is awareness in the Arab world. These are almost quotes, perceptions in the Arab world 
The United States supports strict and dictatorial dictatorships and opposes democracy and development 
And we do it to make sure we control energy sources 
She went on to state that this realization was accurate, and it was, and perhaps is the right thing to do for us 
So yes there is a hate campaign, and this is repeated over the years 
You can remember that some of the events of 9/11 were President Bush having a pathetic speech through which he asked why they hate us 
He said they hate us because of freedom and so on 
And some of that shortly, the Pentagon had a research study 
A research institution (the Council of Science at the Pentagon) carried out Watteau's analysis of Bush's speech 
They retold what the National Security Council said in 1958 
They do not hate our freedom, they hate our politics 
They hate our policy that underestimates democracy, support shrinking development and support harsh and strict regimes because of our interest in controlling their resources 
There is a lot of information between the two that says the same thing including polls 
And if this will be a good model, yes I think it will be, not only in the Middle East, but everywhere. this too 
I said in an e-mail dialogue with Austin Mckayle that there is a bill of details presented by supporters of the June 30th 
Varying credibility, but I did not see anything to justify calling the army to topple the elected government 
No matter how flawed the election, or whatever post-election politics are objectionable 
My question is why do you think the bill of varying detail has credibility 
And why cannot the people overthrow the government if the elections are defective or the post-election policies are objectionable? 
Are you only against military intervention or do you think that the desire to topple the government was premature? 
Let me repeat what I think I understand, that I have not heard most of the talk 
If you want to topple the government, I think this is legitimate first, this is very legitimate 
As I said, my sympathies and friends are with the June 30 uprising 
But is the best way to do this is to summon the army to topple the government and establish a military dictatorship? 
No, I don't think this is the best way, it was ... 
If there is no other means at all, there is a major attack on the people 
You can imagine a situation in which it might be reasonable to ask the army to intervene 
But I do not think any of this was real in Egypt 
Why did you say that the bill of detail has varying credibility 
I have said that the bill from the details submitted by June 30 supporters has varying credibility 
No, I didn't say that at all 
The bill, details provided by supporters of the June 30th, was mostly very credible 
I think the accusations against the Morsi government were very real 
Very accurate, probability not every word, but basically correct 
But the question is, if there is opposition to the government from a large portion of the people, it could be the majority 
Is the correct mechanism under these conditions to support a military coup that will establish a more ruthless government? 
What do you think about the alternative? 
The alternative is to pursue the opportunities that were not followed from the past several months in the presidential elections 
The liberal, secular, leftist force, not composed, had the majority of votes 
But they were busy fighting each other until they divided the votes between six parts 
This provides opportunities 
They overcame the Faisalian conflicts of this sector and applied to participate seriously in the open and parliamentary system of government 
Defective but open 
Indeed, some of the main threats to this regime, even under Morsi, were the army, or the junta 
Thanks, my name is Dan Lawrence and I work with "The Books of the Revolution" and "The Revolution Newspaper" 
I wanted to read a brief quote from Bob Avakian, who was the head of the Revolutionary Communist Party and had a comment 
The essence of what exists in the United States is not democracy 
But the imperialist capitalist system and political structure strongly enforce the imperialist capitalist system 
What the United States publishes around the world is not democracy but imperialism and political structures to implement that imperialism 
It seems to me that the situation in Egypt is an ideal example, as you find it on the one hand as reactionary fundamentalists and on the other side you find the army 
Which is part of the government that was supported and funded by the United States for thirty years 
And I would like to explore this with you in terms of what is involved in bringing down the government 
The quote from President Bob is a much harsher version than I was saying, I think it's a much harsher version 
I mean, I don't think the United States, I think it is an exaggerated picture of the United States and what it does, the world 
But there is a real element in it, in fact it is like what the National Security Council said in 1958 and we shouldn't go to Bob Avacian for this. 
The rest of the question, if I understand it correctly, suggests that the United States was somehow responsible for establishing Morsi's ruling regime and military rule thereafter. 
I don't think it's true 
The United States strongly supported Mubarak until the last minute 
In fact, US policy came from the accepted rules of the game 
It is curious that commentators, the media and even researchers have not decided what is clear 
There is case after case where the United States supports a favorite dictator 
At some point it becomes impossible to continue to support 
Because perhaps the army will turn against it, as was the case in Egypt 
And at that point there are rules for the game 
What you do is declare your love for democracy and make sure that the intellectuals repeat it 
The dictator gets stuck, sends him somewhere, and in Egypt he was sent to Sharm el-Sheikh 
Then you try to establish the same system 
This happened so much that it became a joke 
Smooze, Marcus, Deville, Soeharto, Maputo 
It is a kind of routine 
So yes that's what they did this time 
At least there is stability in principle 
Yes, it is almost permanent firming 
It is a very rational way, very simple, there is no reason to be deceived 
This happened so much that we should laugh when we see her again 
But that was not the way it was presented 
This is what intellectuals do, concealing all this, from themselves and others 
But to believe that the United States brought down Mubarak is a mistake 
They supported him, just like other cases 
They did not impose the Brotherhood's government, they won because they were better organized, much better 
They were active during the dictatorship 
Let me tell you a personal story, it is a personal story so it is not a big story 
I was in Egypt about 20 years ago, for a while, I studied at the American University 
While I was there I spent a lot of time with educated activists, a certain group was somewhat left-wing 
Really good people, good friends, Syed Ahmed and others 
Good, brave people who fought hard and many of them spent years in Nasser prisons torturing, very dedicated people 
These were the left. Where did we meet? We met on a boat in the Nile 
If you know anything about Egypt, you will know what this is 
They have those river boats in the Nile for very rich tourists 
And they had a friend who owned one of them 
The riverboat gave them food and we sat in a corner of this thing and ate fine food, and we talked about how to carry out a revolution in Egypt 
This was the left 
After that, I met a group of people who called themselves Islamic scholars 
They are in fact Islam just like me. One of them was Coptic, and the other was the former editor-in-chief of the Socialist Party newspaper 
But they declared themselves Islamic scholars 
We met in a small room somewhere 
We talked and explained what they were doing, and I think they were accurate in explaining them 
They were trying to work in the slums, setting up clinics, small shops, organizing people and so on, and this is what they were doing 
Left intellectuals were having a fine dinner on river boats 
It was not difficult to see who would win. This happened in the whole region 
This is a personal story, but in reality this is happening in the whole region 
And the Muslim Brotherhood won for this reason in the first place. The United States did not do this 
And the United States did not bring them down. The United States was very happy with Morsi's rule 
This system was largely doing what they wanted 
I think they prefer military rule, partly because major allies are very supportive of him 
Also partly because it applies very strict repression, such as crushing the sit-in in Suez 
But this is my assessment, we do not have internal documents about this, so it is an impression 
Thanks a lot for doing this 
And I just wanted, your previous comments touched a little on what I'm going to ask about 
With the first revolution in January 2011, do you think the seeds of the current failure were laid in it because the revolution was not complete 
They toppled Mubarak and Parliament but did not get rid of the judiciary, which was also part of the Mubarak regime 
Just like the current generals, they were all part of the Mubarak regime 
And you see this in Mubarak's trial 
Yes, he was convicted, but everything used to convict him was disposed of in preparation for appeal 
Which reveals that this system was preparing itself for a future victory in the first place, and this is what we are seeing now 
They planted those seeds, they knew that the first elected president would fail largely due to countless problems 
Also, because, as has been said before, a lack of security equals a lack of stability 
The army was very complacent in providing security, even the police forces, the police were not doing their job 
Yes, this was at a level that suggests that the downfall was institutional 
They wanted security failure. Until any government fails if it came and was not part of the system 
My question, then, do you think this is a delicate scenario and how Egypt is moving forward 
How will the next revolution happen, overthrow all branches of government and establish a true political democracy 
I think you are very correct regarding the fact that the army retained its power under Morsi, many of which 
And he reduced some privileges but not many, they were very happy with the security situation 
The police withdrew, and you actually saw what happened on the day of the coup 
On the day of the coup, police returned to the streets, with petrol 
Before that, you could not get gasoline for your car 
Saudi Arabia poured tons of money, and the Gulf emirates 
And it became clear, if not clear, before 
There is a lot of effort from the army and the very opposing forces in the Arab world, mainly Saudi Arabia and the UAE 
To try to prevent any ruling regime from operating, they hate the Muslim Brotherhood 
After that, they re-established stability under harsh military rule after it got rid of the parliamentary opposition 
This largely happened, I think 
But the answer to is not by supporting the army. This makes the situation worse 
What is the answer? My impression is that, as I said before, there are many opportunities to pursue the unification of the deeply divided secular liberal forces. 
This is a large group that has many differences, but they are kinda close to each other. They could have met together 
When I was in Egypt two months ago, I met several political leaders of these factions 
And it was very clear that they did not want to cooperate with each other 
They were more interested in fighting each other than doing anything about the Morsi regime 
But this could be resisted, and I hope that this front announced recently 
Which I quoted at the end of my speech, and that have very good people 
You may be able to solve these conflicts, and form a united movement 
They will be able to advance if the parliamentary positions are still permitted by the army, and they may not be permitted 
The point here is that we must remember that democracy, parliamentary participation, was called a democracy in that case 
Bargaining and negotiation include surrender and otherwise and some of them behaviors 
There was not much experience in Egypt's contemporary history to learn how to overcome these and other divisions 
Thanks Professor Chomsky, I have a small question, about the alternative, too 
In the year of Morsi's government, we saw that the Muslim Brotherhood was not different from Mubarak's rule in terms of political freedom 
In terms of economic policy 
The people, I think, found themselves between the former dictator and the current dictator 
You must choose between a dictatorship that grows and one that actually falls 
Alliance with the army would be my best choice, let me disagree with you 
Because this year we saw how they used their men in all local administrative positions 
As governors for almost half of Egypt's governorates, ruled by the Muslim Brotherhood, this was in preparation for the upcoming elections 
So they were preparing for a new dictatorship with evidence, I think 
So if I could choose, I would choose to be allied with the army again 
The one who actually falls, who answers to reformulate himself with force again 
First, I would suggest recasting what I said, not the people that should have chosen, it is a section of the people 
And who you belong to, and who I sympathize with, but it is not the people 
A large part of the people support the Brotherhood, and another sector supports the Salafists, the most extremist 
You cannot deny being because you don't like them 
They exist, they are important, they are organized, they are rooted in the people 
In fact, they were so strong that they were able to win all the parliamentary elections that took place 
Partly because of the failure of the secular liberal-left opposition. But they did it and they are still there 
It might have been crushed, killed, and destroyed, but they are still there. They are part of the people 
So to paraphrase your question, what sectors could have 
First, I do not agree with you that the ruling regime of Morsi was really a dictatorship and authoritarianism like Mubarak's dictatorship 
There were real accomplishments, achieved by the intifada, which they called a revolution if you liked, I was subjected to some of them 
There was greater freedom of expression, freedom of publication, meetings, group freedom 
It was a very strong and active political atmosphere and was not there before 
There were some real achievements. Concerning workers' rights in particular 
The formation of the first independent union, and in fact many unions and this is not a simple development 
The improvement was very low, and the minimum wage was very serious 
Things were happening and were not happening under Mubarak, and they would not have happened 
There were opportunities for political action, for example, in previous presidential elections 
Which could have been achieved for the next time, if pursued 
But given the real situation, what should the part of the people you belong to have done, and in reality I, we associate ourselves with it, what should they have done? 
I think, what I felt was what I suggested, they should have resisted 
They work hard to resist factional differences, find a way to work with each other 
Participate in the opportunities that were available, and try to reach a parliamentary result that would have allowed them to implement their programs 
But I think the worst thing to do is to summon an army that will crush those opportunities 
Hi sir, I want to refer to 2011, when the army gained control after Mubarak, why did you not call this a coup, this is number one 
When the army took over after Mubarak? 
Yes, this was in 2011, the army intervened and formed a transitional government at the same time as those that are happening now, and no one called this a coup. 
It is one question, please only complete as part of the sentence, from the first question, and ... etc. Otherwise, no 
Can i say? It is very, very simple. Why do we sacrifice Morsi between the United States and Egypt? Why is Morsi so important to the United States? 
Let me stop this, and focus on the first question. The first question is important 
I'm sorry, what's the question? I've heard Part 1 - Yes, I don't understand Morsi's question but it violates the rules here 
Why did not we call it a coup in 2011 
So why was this not a military coup? 
Because it was similar to bringing down Marcus, or Smoze, as the army realizes at the last minute that they will not be able to preserve their dictator 
They send him to a safe place, then give the government to a beloved government 
This is not a military coup. It is a decision of the army that we cannot preserve our dictator 
The best thing we can do at that moment is to subordinate ourselves to a civilian government. This is completely different from a military coup 
Thank you for being here, Professor. My question is 
What is the relationship between extremism and social repressive actions in the era of austerity 
In other words, how Egyptian social action supports extremist ideas, for example, Sayyid Qutb's imprisonment has given rise to extremist ideas 
Like the positions of the Salafis or the positions of the Saudis? This is what you mean by extremism? 
I call them extremists too, but what is my extremism depends on your point of view 
Mostly, they see us as extremists 
It is not an exact term, it is a term that reflects your personal attitude 
But yes, from the Arabs 'point of view, they are extremists, but what is the question? 
This dictatorship ended here, okay? 
On the thirtieth of June there are thirty million people on the streets 
The majority of them want to bring down Mubarak and want the same results of the January 25 revolution 
I do not support the military coup in any way but what you thought would have been a solution to this situation on this day 
On the thirtieth of June? First I will be skeptical of the numbers, as is the case with independent viewers 
But there is no doubt that there were many people on the streets. There was a massive popular uprising 
The right movement at that moment, in my opinion, I'm going to repeat, is to use this driving force 
To resist the destructive divisive, partisan divisions of the liberal, secular sector 
And before us we place a united opposition, which will participate effectively, as the opportunities were clearly available 
It is not the summons of the army that will quell all this 
In fact, remember that the army itself was responsible for the crackdown under Morsi's ruling regime 
Getting them is not a reasonable step 
I have to say what I said in the foreground, my personal friends, good friends in Egypt, people I really respect, who differ very sharply with me. With what I said, so I say it hesitantly, but that's how it looks to me 
Do you think it is possible for the leftists, the most secular part of society, to work with Islamists in the future? Or at least tolerate each other? And if not, what would be the scale of the problem? 
At least at that moment, as far as I see now, there do not seem to be any opportunities available for this. Who knows what might happen in the future? 
I look at Latin America, a different position, but this was taken as a model 
For centuries the Catholic Church has been, in fact, since the fourth century, the Church of the Persecuted 
The church that supported autocracy, power, violence, etc. 
In 1962 with the Vatican 2, this changed. The Vatican 2 was an effort under Pope John XXIII 
An effort to re-establish the Gospels in the Catholic Church 
It was a radical act because the Bible is a radical document, and this is why Christians persecuted the first two centuries 
Try to present the so-called (preferential option for the poor), the Gospel message 
It was ingested in Latin America by priests, nuns, laymen, peasant organization, etc., and what happened? 
The United States went to war with them. A severe war started against the church 
A long series of murders and dead bodies, many of them martyrs of religion 
Part of this was the overthrow of parliamentary governments and the establishment of dictatorships 
Brazil, Uruguay, Chile 
Massacres in Central America in the 1980s 
In 1989, six leading Jesuit thinkers were killed at the university in El Salvador 
By an armed battalion trained by the United States 
Newly graduated from training at the John Kennedy Counterinsurgency School in North Carolina 
Following the orders of the army, the highest leadership is to kill Jesuits when there is no one around them 
This was a war against the church 
Two days ago another step was taken 
The current right-wing bishop of El Salvador 
He dissolved the Total Legal, the church's legal office during the heresy period, when they tried to return the Gospels 
There was a research agency of the El Salvador Total Legal Church that collected information about homicides, atrocities and so on 
It was resolved two days ago by the bishop, and I trust that with US support, the war is still going on 
Is this permissible in the Islamic world? Possible, and will have the same response 
Professor Chomsky, thank you for joining us today, and thank you for a life full of giving for social justice and political activism. And thanks to the Union of Egyptian Students for making this event possible and opening our mind to your thoughts 
My question regarding an environmental issue in Egypt 
At the end of a year of Morsi's rule, he tried to unify the incision of public opinion by confronting the threat that arises from the limited use of the Nile and its entrances 
What are the possibilities that future governments will face to reconcile swing public opinion on a unified issue such as the use of the Nile? 
And also use it to achieve their political interests 
This is a very important issue. In fact, war was imminent with Ethiopia because of the dam at the source of the Nile 
This remains a living issue 
I don't know, you can say something, I have no idea how this problem can be solved 
I think that is a very difficult problem 
There are other ways how to address these issues 
One of them was suggested by a MIT student two years ago, I forgot his name 
But there was a student in the mechanical engineering department here, some of you might know it 
An Egyptian student worked on a project to develop a very cheap, very easy solar energy device 
It is basically a small group of reflectors, made of materials that Egyptians can use to build it themselves 
He did not require the import of modern technology equipment, at least according to his message 
The professor who worked with him was a practical solution, Egypt, as the truth is all of North Africa 
The air is clear, not badly polluted, much sunlight 
He estimated that if this were to spread throughout the country and in North Africa 
They can have enough energy to export to Europe, including themselves 
This is another direction for development, is this doable? 
Go to them, the mechanical engineering department here and ask them what they think, why would they give him doctorate degrees for this idea? 
My question has more to do with the main idea, from the point of view of mobilizing young people, military coups and in addition to the veiled intervention of the West 
Do you think that there are any similarities with Iran and the capabilities of the government and the resistance, or do you think this has become impossible with Egypt 
Can you repeat the question, but slowly? 
From the point of view of the youth crowd, the military coups and the veiled intervention of the West 
Do you think that there are any similarities with Iran and the capabilities of the government and the resistance, or do you think that this idea has become impossible with Egypt 
Any idea? - The idea of   resistance in general - 
Comparing Egypt and Iran to the resistance 
It is a completely different structure 
Egypt in the past two years has been somewhat open to regional standards 
With the exception of Tunisia, it was the most open country, but it is now closed to military rule 
Iran is another story, it is under harsh priestly rule 
Egypt is not under priestly rule, it is a ruling against priesthood, but it is very cruel, but it still has opportunities 
The past elections were limited, and every candidate for the Iranian elections must be examined by the Council of Religious Men 
So you cannot nominate anyone, which is of course unbearable 
But it should not surprise us at all, as we have a similar system 
In the United States, every candidate has to be examined through his ability to focus the use of private capital 
If you can't raise billions of dollars, you are not a candidate 
So we do not have a council of clergy to examine the candidates, we have "Golden Sacks", "GB Morgan Chase" and "Brotherhood Cook" to examine them 
This is a mistake in both cases ... but something happened here ... the people participated and the elections took place 
The result was somewhat surprising 
The most reformed candidate (not stiff, but the most) won very easily 
There are some changes 
People in Iran, or at least I can communicate with them, are very happy with them 
There were more opportunities than those in Egypt, and they were pursued, or at least it could be traced 
But will opportunities be available in the future? we will see. This depends on what the military council will allow 
Thank you, Professor. The role of social media has been analyzed in events in Egypt, and also throughout the Arab world. What is your analysis of the impact of social media, and has its influence been amplified? 
Do you want to talk about this topic? Do I answer? She is the expert in this field, so I shouldn't talk about it, 
Obviously there was an effect, how much influence? This is not clear in my opinion 
For example: There was a stage in which Mubarak closed the internet 
In an attempt to prevent the use of the Internet to organize activities and so on, this did not stop the activity, but it took another form 
In fact, it took a very impressive form, through direct communication methods 
So yes, they are useful means, but I do not think they are revolutionary means 
Many of the uprisings occurred without dependencies before using the Internet 
It can be used in an effective way, and it can also be used in ways that we know, as a means of control and control 
Take a look at what Snowton revealed 
None of the power systems, companies or countries, will use any technological means that they can obtain to try to control their internal enemies ... the people. 
We see it very big here 
So it is a double-edged sword, and this is a reality for all technology, it can be used for repression, it can be used for editing 
Many people in Egypt now think it is time for the current ruling regime to change the direction of foreign policies 
And to change the path to the east, and to establish a strong relationship with Russia and China as was the case in the sixties 
When there was a strong relationship between Egypt and the Soviet Union 
Do you think this is happening? Will China be a great ally of Egypt in the next ten or fifteen years? 
China certainly has interests in the region, but at the present time it appears to be commercial interests, and this is true, as the whole region 
For example: One of the results of Qaddafi's fall in Libya is the exit of tens of thousands of Chinese engineers 
Those looking for oil and others were investing there and replaced them with Westerners 
Something could happen in Egypt 
I do not know of any indications that China has major interests in investing substantially in Egypt 
Egypt does not have major sources like it was with Libya or the Congo and so on 
Thank you, Professor, 25 June 2011 The Police Day was in Egypt and it was also, we can say, that it is a turning point and the revolution, where the greatest gathering of forces opposing the regime happened 
Slowly repeat the question 
I wonder if you think that the sixth of October, which will be the day of the armed forces in Egypt 
It represents a similar opportunity for people who are dissatisfied with the government 
Not only the votes in favor of Morsi, but for everyone who does not agree with the current regime, the crowd 
If you think this is a turning point, contemporary events 
Within two days? - Yes, this Sunday. 
I don't know about any indicators, maybe you know, if there are people who follow blogs in Egypt, or newspapers in Egypt in Arabic, they can have indicators, but I did not see anything. 
My understanding is that it is through a second hand, and I could have understood it wrong, and the second side has the right to clarify 
There are indications that the illegal Muslim Brotherhood could make their presence felt again by slowing down the effectiveness of the system 
But I have not heard anything about violence 
It is very unlikely that October 6 will pass without anyone noticing 
All the indicators that I have seen are what I mentioned, the path of the revolution path, which is growing from the third field 
There was an informal development before this, there were two fields 
There was Tahrir Square, and it is now most of the army 
And there is the Islamists field, where they organize themselves 
There was a third square, and there were many of these, and now they have formed themselves into a united front 
It covers a wide range of activists and groups 
I don't know how far they will go 
Personally, I admire their people and their politics, but I don't know how much popular support they can garner. 
First I want to thank you for coming to speak on this topic 
My question deals with the division of the people, and how do you see the cooperation between the Islamists and the secular left as unlikely 
I am wondering if you see any way for us to start closing the gap so that we reduce the insecurity and daily violence that all Egyptians suffer regardless of their political orientation. 
Is there a possibility in Egypt that competing blocs will come and cooperate? - Yes, only to reduce insecurity. 
I would like to believe this, but I think the direction in which events are headed is closer to what Patrick Coburn described 
On his way to a bloody civil war 
What you are suggesting would have been very welcome, and there are always possibilities, but I don't see anything happening in this direction. 
Can i ask you a question? Do you see anything optimistic? Absolutely? 
Yes, I think the cause for optimism are the remaining achievements of the Tahrir Square uprising 
Including what I mentioned, once again: a political atmosphere full of vitality, empowering the people 
What Joel Benin highlighted, is giving the people a sense of dignity and having a voice 
The solid achievements are mainly partly political participation, which is a real achievement 
But partly the labor movement, which I think is very important 
Establishing the first institutional break-up of the Mubarak regime, was the establishment of the first independent union of Egyptian trade unions, and this is important 
Before this there was no officially recognized independent union, and now this monopoly has been broken 
Since this event, there have been many important labor activities in the major centers 
Major textile centers, industrial centers. Suez 
This is why the army put them firmly on them, but they are still there 
In fact, I believe that one of the most important workers leaders, Kamal Abbas, is part of the path of the revolution 
I don't know how many others are involved, there isn't much evidence 
But I think these are continuing achievements to date 
Can you move forward from there? I think this is optimism 
Thanks Professor, my question is broader 
We have seen that in Libya there was a civil war to move from an autocracy to democracy 
What we see today, the new regime, in Egypt the army entered, and in Syria we saw a civil war 
My question: Regarding autocracy / dictatorship, is there another way to democracy that does not include civil war or military intervention? Is there an ideal way other than what we have seen so far? 
Could there be a democratic uprising in the Middle East without military intervention? 
And the Civil War, the dubious ways we have seen so far have brought more harm than good, is there a more perfect path? 
I will put the question in a different way 
Could there be a movement towards democracy with military intervention? 
I guess maybe not. Military intervention will prevent him 
There were steps forward without military intervention. In the original uprising in Tahrir Square 
The only military intervention was to determine that they could not support their dictator for much longer 
So they will send him to Sharm El-Sheikh, with support from the United States 
And attempts to return a percentage of the force, this is not military intervention 
Unfortunately, the army was not tamed or controlled, and now they have gained strength again 
But wherever the army interferes, I think it will always be a step back 
But there was progress in Egypt, and I think some of it remained, it was threatened, but it remained 
Tunisia has the same story, Ennahda, the ruling Islamic party has retreated in the past two days 
Actually they seem to allow open sharing, and I think that's a good thing 
In Syria, what started as a democratic uprising was crushed with fierce violence 
It became a malicious civil war, which is what drives the state to commit suicide 
This should not happen 
In dictatorships, the petroleum dictatorships of the United States and its allies 
Saudi Arabia in particular, there were small efforts to pursue the Arab Spring, very small 
So they called Friday, (the day of rage) but this was crushed so quickly that people in Riyadh were afraid to take to the street 
In eastern Saudi Arabia, where most of the oil is found, the Shiites are also concentrated 
There were continuous uprisings, severely suppressed with the support of the United States 
And also in Bahrain, and not much in other countries 
These are the most stable 
The ruling religious-military regime was able to crush steps in the direction of the popular uprising 
But this will not last forever, and this is not the only case 
Indeed, the Arab Spring began in a place rarely discussed 
Western Sahara, the Arab country, the last colony in Africa, is under United Nations legislation 
It is supposed to go through the decolonization stage 
And what happened is that when I took steps towards decolonization, I think in 1975, it was invaded by Morocco, because they want it 
They began to send many Moroccans to try to flood the local population 
Cruel repression and war, similar to Palestine in some way, on the other side of the Arab world 
In October 2010, I think, there was an uprising in Western Sahara 
The city of Khayyam and the capital are in efforts to resist imposed weapons 
The Moroccans crushed them very quickly 
The Sahrawis, the indigenous people, took this difference to the United Nations Security Council 
He is responsible for the decolonization of the last colony 
It was banned in the Security Council by France, a pro-Moroccan, with US support 
But this was the first intifada, then the Arab Spring 
Is this done Not necessarily, similar questions arise in Palestine, and it is also a colony 
This is our last question 
Thank you, Professor. My question will be regarding Hamas 
Why is there a growing propaganda against Hamas in the Egyptian media recently? 
It exceeds the levels that existed in the Mubarak regime 
What was the role of Hamas in Egyptian politics during the period of the Morsi regime? 
Propaganda against Hamas? Yes. 
And publicity against Palestine in general under the current military rule - yes - 
This is so amazing, it was not great under Morsi, there were some hopes and expectations 
Under Morsi, there will be an openness to Gaza 
Because Hamas is a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood 
So there was an expectation that there would be an opening to the border, but it was very little 
I was there last october, and the borders were tightly closed 
Somehow it opened, so it was easier for people to cross 
But the requirements were very severe for the flow of humanitarian aid such as medicines 
Gazans' dependence on tunnel economics was still 
There is a lot of tunnel at the border 
Shortly after, Morsi ruled that he went further than Mubarak to flood the tunnels with sewage, to try to block them 
It was a kind of biological warfare, even Mubarak did not do this 
There was very little openness, and now that the army is in power 
Now what you described, fanatic propaganda has become very amazing against the Palestinians and enthusiasm 
And with all the fairy tales of how Hamas was carrying out terrorist acts in Cairo and Sinai 
There is no reason for this to happen, even if they did, and they cannot 
I am not sure why this is happening 
I doubt it is an attempt to rally the people against something 
An external enemy linked to the Muslim Brotherhood, they are a branch of the Brotherhood 
We would like to thank Professor Chomsky and Professor Shukry 
It was our pleasure and we will see you in other events and thank you
