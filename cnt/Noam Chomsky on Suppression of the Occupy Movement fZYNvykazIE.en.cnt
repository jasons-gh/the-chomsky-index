I'm sorry that I can only be with you
today in spirit the Occupy movements
have been a remarkable success they've
changed the national discourse they've
introduced crucial concerns that had
been hidden into public view not least
they've created communities of mutual
support than solidarity as something
extremely important in a atomized
society like this in fact one sign of
their success is the nature of the
repression it's pretty clearly
coordinated some places quite harsh and
vicious an indication of success and
concern naturally we have to resist the
repression support and defend those who
are its victims but there are some
things that we all know in our bones
almost too obvious to repeat Power
Systems don't just quietly fold their
tents and go away saying thank you they
try to preserve their power but whatever
means they can so repression is
inevitable and the best way to defend
oneself against repression is to move
forward in this case that means to
engage the 99 percent not just as
observers or sympathizers but as direct
participants in a project of historic
importance first to reverse the shameful
and destructive course of the past
several decades and then to move onward
to developing the kind of society and
urine in the world with the cooperation
of plenty others of others around the
world
that can be the basis for a decent human
existence that's a hard task it's not
going to be accomplished quickly it's
going to take a lot of long-term
dedicated effort with regression
progress and the requires serious
commitment that's a hard but essential
task and you're the people who's who are
responsible and able to carry it out so
that's a historic mission that I can
only admire you from being at the
forefront of it
