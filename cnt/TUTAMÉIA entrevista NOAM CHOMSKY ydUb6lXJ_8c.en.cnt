much for being with us today it's an
honor to receive you in our home studio
here's a foul and on skis
I believe it's the most important
intellectual in the in the world
well as affirm
activist and I would like to start
asking you about your trip to Brazil the
day after tomorrow we are going to visit
presidential Ummah in in Curitiba and in
prison and I won I would like to ask you
why you decide to make this visit and in
what's the what's your view on this on
the situation about Lula well my wife
Valerie and I were invited by actually
her friend
Celso Amorim to participate in the
conference on democracy and
the polarity the subtext of the
conference was the attack on democracy
in Brazil of which the imprisonment of
the law and the his exclusion from the
election as a prime example I've
actually met those I spent some time
with him back in the late 90s 20 years
ago was quite impressed this is before
he was elected I continued to be
impressed by much of what he did while
he was in office along with my rim
they propelled Brazil to the center of
the world stage it became perhaps the
most respected country in the world
there were valuable domestic projects
there were serious flaws but much
achievement and I have no serious doubt
that he should be the next president of
Brazil would be best for Brazil best for
the world given the role that they Rizzo
played and under din in the world seemed
during his period and as president so we
were Valera and I were quite pleased to
be invited to the conference and felt
this was a good time to both observe
firsthand things that are happening in
this crucial period but also to do what
we can to support the claims to justice
and democracy in a crucial in Brazil
which is of central significance for of
course Latin America but in fact the
whole world so this engine era came to
attempt was called democracy under
attack do you think democracy is an
attack to do today both in Brazil and in
well there is a significant decline of
democratic institutions of their
legitimacy is being challenged their
functioning has declined this has been
in fact underway for 40 years though
there was a significant change in
general socio economic policies taking
shape in the 1970s escalated under
Reagan and Thatcher the shift to what
are called somewhat misleading lead
market-oriented policies business first
policies which have had a fairly
standard effect throughout the world
differs in different countries but
pretty constant so for latin america it
meant to lost decades of development
under the severe structural adjustment
programs that was there a revival during
the the last 15 20 years in several
countries Brazil most prominent among
them which reversed the regression to
some extent but it's now back in force
and in the West in the United States in
Europe this has been very very striking
and so just take the United the United
States the most powerful state in the
world by a longshot but then its most
striking in the United States so just
take a look at the bare facts since 1980
rural wages for have actually declined
so they're less now than they were in
1979 at the same time salaries in income
of corporate executives as escalated by
about a thousand percent
the policies are designed quite
specifically to concentrate wealth
increase corporate power free of
financial institutions to change their
role in the economy drastically we
should recall that during the first
decades after the Second World War it
was a period of within the state
capitalist economies of their greatest
growth period in history and fairly
egalitarian growth so in the United
States the lowest quintile did about as
much as the highest went there were also
the extension of in Europe it's called
the tanto colonias great 30 years Nonna
in the United States it's called the
Golden Age of capitalism actually state
capitalism this lead this was
accompanied by substantial gains in
popular rights and the growth of popular
activism by the 60s it became late 60s
became quite significant the large parts
of the population were entering the
political arena leaving the state of
passivity and docility which is supposed
to be their role according to standard
democratic theory the general population
are supposed to be what are called
spectators they're called the ignorant
and meddlesome outsiders they don't
belong in the political arena this was
the watch while the responsible people
serious people who run the show that was
challenged in the 1960s and Atlantic and
it was accompanied by a militant labor
action so in the late 60s and early 70s
in the United States but in Europe
elsewhere two workers were taking we're
engaged in serious strike actions which
were not just aimed at wages and
benefits but it also at control of the
workplace that becomes a serious threat
to the rulers to the private rulers of
the economy the people who Adam Smith
called the Masters of mankind you know
the people who owned the economy closely
linked to the state of course of the
world there was also a decline in the
rate of profit which is considered a
very serious threat so across the
spectrum by the early seventies you
could see a reaction developing much of
it quite public in fact it was called
even a crisis of democracy too much
democracy we have to have moderate what
was called moderation in democracy
people have to return to their role as
passive observers not try to participate
in government this is from the liberal
side on the right wing it was much
harsher but it was common across the
spectrum consequence of this hold they
were also serious problems in the
organisation of the international
economic system the Bretton Woods
structure collapsed and so on so all of
this converged into a change of policies
in order from the point of view of the
masters of mankind in order to write the
balance so that power shifted back where
it's supposed to be in the hands of
private sector closely linked to state
power that's what's happened over the
past 40 years in Europe it's was
austerity programs for which there was
no economic justification were designed
quite explicitly to achieve this goal
actually
fine study of this by an economist mark
Weisbrot who rates quite a lot about
Brazil and Latin America but as of he
did an interesting study in Europe
socio-economic policies are taken away
from in the structure of the European
Union they are no longer in the hands of
the national states meaning people don't
participate they're in the hands of the
Brussels bureaucracy the troika the
European Commission which is unelected
the IMF obviously unelected and the
world and the central bank Weisbrot
studied every year there are
negotiations between the troika and the
individual governments to set policies
and he investigated these and found
something very interesting at what he
found is that explicitly the policies
were designed to reverse the social
reforms and social democratic policies
that had developed during the previous
period and though economic reasons just
get rid of these policies in return
control to the sectors that are
according to the ideology supposed to
rule then that had so that's your Europe
and the United States was the same we're
now seeing quite similar things in Latin
America as is in the eighties in fact
but all of this leads to amass the great
mass of the population is angry
resentful frightened one of the major
policies has been to create precarious
existence separate people from one
another that was Margaret Thatcher's
famous slogan there's no society
as I mentioned the other day she was
actually paraphrasing marks without
knowing that when he condemned the
authoritarian rulers of Europe in the
mid 19th century for trying to turn
society into a sack of potatoes isolated
individuals who could had to face
concentrated power alone without
structure and organization so and this
is quite explicit so for example when
Alan Greenspan who head of the Federal
Reserve who sort of organized the
American economy he testified to
Congress about the achievements of the
economy and said straight out there
based on what he called growing worker
insecurity as he pointed out even when
unemployment employment is high very
little on a employment late 90s he said
workers are just too intimidated to ask
for benefits and wages which is very
healthy for the economy if you're an
economist you understand this is healthy
for the economy because if wages and
benefits stay down there's no threat of
inflation the financial institutions can
prosper and though he didn't mention
that profits can be high which is what
counts so this is the structure that's
developed and of course it's led to as
wealth concentrates it automatically
affects political power for perfectly
obvious reasons don't even go into them
they're too transparent so you have a
decline of democracy and people are
aware of it they know that they don't
have to read academic studies to realize
that they're just not represented in the
political system in Europe it's
transparent because the major decisions
are up there and the Brussels
bureaucracy in the United States about
80% of the population
and polls for the last thirty years in
fact have said that the government is
run by a few big interests looking out
for themselves that's the general
population right the left it's it's
supported by serious academic studies
which simply compare people's attitudes
with the votes of their own
representatives and they're uncorrelated
for the majority of the population the
lower seventy five eighty percent their
own representatives pay no attention to
their constituents they listen to the
voices of the donor class because they
have to know and what they don't have
side effects it means that if you're
elected to Congress first thing you have
to do is start amassing support
financial support for the next election
because elections are pretty much bought
you can predict electability just by
looking campaign funding but what does
that mean about legislation well what it
means is that the staff of the Congress
congressional representative meets with
corporate lobbyists who big law firms
you know a lot of power and they but
they basically write the legislation
literally and the representative signs
it of age has nothing to do with the
attitudes of the population so you get
of course the decline of democracy which
is intended and considered good because
it's overcoming the crisis of democracy
of the 1960s the crisis was too much
political participation so the decline
of democracy is a favorable result it's
returning to the norm in fact if you
look back at the studies in the early
70s which are revealing the most
interesting of them which was really
as a book called the Christ the crisis
of democracy which is liberal
internationalists from Europe the United
States and Japan three centers of
Western capitalism and their yeah
they're very straight to know that they
didn't expect anyone to read it in fact
the simplest started being read and was
withdrawn for publication but it's it's
it's quite an interesting book these are
this is basically the Carter in the
United States it's the Carter
Administration Carter was a member and
his whole administration was drawn from
this it's that sector of opinion kind of
you know the kind of Center the liberal
center of opinion and in the discussion
they look back nostalgically to the
Truman years when as they put it trauma
was able to govern the country with the
assistance of a few Wall Street lawyers
and financiers and then there was no
crisis of democracy because that's the
way it's supposed to be so we're going
back to that and that's favorable except
for the population so what happens is
people are angry and they're
disorganized the unions have been under
severe attack Thatcher and Reagan as
soon as they came in their first acts
were to try to destroy the union's
Reagan even for the first time called in
scabs which is illegal in just about
every country and of course he did
manage to break the the union that he
the public union that he was attacking
with scabs and then it was quickly
picked up by private corporations who
did the same thing that won't go through
the details but there were a lot of
moves have been made under Clinton as
well to undermine unions so people are
left alone that is a sack of potatoes
and they react and
antisocial ways basurin so clearly Umbra
he introduced a self-pitying list in the
Presidium my instinct elaborate words
traveltura professor Raj English hey
Gabrielle toms common types pasando
traditional East gouta metro to tour a
leatherback geometrical abhorrent
questions commentaries in chocolate I
see apart space on girls you don't know
that in the beginning you said that we
are here in Brazil in a very crucial
moment a very special moment you talk
about democracy now we are talking about
elections we are having an election in
just a few days some say say that the
brazil was a victim of cope that was
planet ordered there is US interest in
this scoop because Brazil is a very
resourceful country Colossus has
Petrobras it's a very rich country and
it it is it's known as you said some
days ago that with a marine Brazil has
become a very important player in the
international scene in order to escape
from the influence of the United States
do you believe that we are having here
United States cope in Brazil what what
you were leaving what's why we are in
this so-called crucial moment first of
all it's absolutely true that jointly
the early part of this decade did a
century up till a couple of years ago
Brazil was in the lead and creating what
could
could have been an independent self now
that had been attempted before of course
back in the 1960s the al-khattab you
know was leading a new ik new
international economic order a new
information order there were the
Brazilian economists were in the lead in
this in fact and that was considered a
very serious threat it was beaten back
very strikingly with cross the board in
the in the West all of that was attacked
the very striking exam the new ik
international economic order was just
immediately beaten down nope none of the
powerful one of the permit any of that
it would have been a developmental
system for the South to become you know
to escape from its backwardness and use
the immense potential that it has to
become a leading part in the world
system that was intolerable very
striking was the reaction to the
proposal for the new international
information order this was in the
nineteen seventies early eighties the
countries of the south and which Brazil
had a leading role at the time were
trying to break through the monopolies
near monopoly on information by the main
Western mega corporations that control
the international economic system and
this this was portrayed in the West as
an attack on freedom because it was
going to limit the power of the
concentrated monopolies to control
everything there's a concept called
libertarianism which is the most
reactionary thing imaginable it's what
it amounts to is private power should
rule everything what's called
libertarianism because then people make
free contracts like if you're starving
you'll be willing to take a job for 10
cents an hour
of free contracts or that's liberty and
the information order meant that the few
concentrated kind of the oligopoly that
fundamentally controls international
information shouldn't be challenged so
it was a huge attack in fact UNESCO
which was the scene in which this was
being enacted was bitterly attacked the
u.s. in fact withdrew from it and
stopped supporting it under the concept
of attack on freedom this was across the
board the liberal press took the same
position we cannot permit a challenge to
the near the oligopoly of information
control and that was beaten down the
then comes the neoliberal period the
Reagan Thatcher up to the present which
aims to restore the traditional system
in which as they put it
the Liberals put it Truman was able to
govern the country but with the help
with a few Wall Street lawyers and
financiers no no problems they were
quite as equated people should really
read that they talked about this is the
Liberals I'm talking about the
right-wing was much harsher liberals are
always more interesting because they set
the kind of limits on discussion you can
go this far not a millimeter farther
we're the outside limits they were
concerned with what they called the
institution's responsible for the
indoctrination of the young that's the
universities schools and they're not
indoctrinating the young properly and
they have to be made harsher more
disciplined it's the beginning of the
period when you start getting a very
sharp rise in tuitions so that students
are burdened if you maybe somebody goes
to law school and wants to be a public
interest lawyer but you come out of law
school with a couple hundred thousand
dollars in debt and you just compelled
to work for a corporate law firm
to survive and once you're inside that
system you become integrated into it
and your original ideals decline and
you're out to make money for the
corporations
it's a disciplinary system that's so
this better and dr. nation of the young
and the business model has been imposed
on the universities in the United States
for example the public funding of
colleges and universities is very
sharply declined which means that
they're basically survive on corporate
funding and high tuitions and so on all
of this is restoring proper
indoctrination of the young the across
the board this was I mean we have to
understand that class warfare is taken
very seriously by the rulers they're
basically Marxists for the values
embroidered
the values are inverted but they
understand very well and this is very
sharp in Brazil where class hatred is
extreme I mean I didn't I've got to
learn more about this what I've learned
from hilarya my wife but it's pretty
amazing to see now that's bad enough in
the United States much more extreme here
I think so and just plain hatred you
know the idea that somebody like Lula
who didn't go to college and doesn't
speak Portuguese properly should be
allowed to speak in public is just
totally unacceptable how can we tolerate
this those people are supposed to be the
servants not not the rulers going back
to the which called the coup I think
that's a large part of the basis for
Brazil is highly in egalitarian
traditionally it is a very small
sector of highly concentrated wealth and
enormous poverty which and as you said
it's a country with very rich resources
this should be one of the richest
countries in the world Columbia is the
same for the Gulf in fact the nominee go
back a couple centuries that Caribbean
was the center of wealth for the world
in fact it's the source of Europe's
wealth they were draining resources from
the Caribbean in fact if you look more
closely it's quite remarkable go back to
the beginnings of British and French and
Dutch imperialism eighth 17th century
the richest parts of the world were
Bangladesh in Haiti countries which are
now the symbols of total unbelievable
poverty that Haiti was the richest
colony anywhere about 20% of France's
wealth comes from just exploiting
Haitian wealth when the British got to
Bengal it's no Bangladesh they couldn't
believe the wealth and opulence and
advance of the progress for how advanced
the civilizations were in fact China and
India were the commercial industrial
centres of the world and the Western
Hemisphere got enormous wealth well pip
realism took care of that verted things
but going to Brazil but it also
instilled in the elites of the colonies
the same conceptions sharply and harshly
so if you compare say Latin America with
East Asia in the last 50 years if an
observer from outside would have
predicted that Latin America would grow
and develop in East Asia would be
backwards that here's where the Latin
America is where the resources are the
lively population rich culture and so on
it's the opposite and if you look
closely and see why East Asia you take a
look at imports in East Asia capital
goods targeted investment East Asia see
South Korea Taiwan accept that
investment but they targeted it for
their own developmental programs there's
no capital flight the rich are under
control they pay taxes that are under
control in South Korea of during its
developmental years you could get the
death penalty for capital flight compare
it to Latin America the rich spent their
money in houses in the Riviera
you know don't pay taxes sent their
children to fancy colleges and they have
no responsibility for the country
imports are luxury goods capital goods
there's no target and investment you
sell off your own what's develops you
sell to somebody else so in fact it
ought to be
what was once expected the so-called
Colossus of the South instead it just
doesn't develop it began to under the
during what's called the pink tide you
know the early years of this century it
was not at Brazil as I say it was in the
lead and organizing the voice of the
South picking up from the failures of
the 60s and the 70s which were beaten
down but it went well beyond that there
were institutions that began to develop
leguminous or Selleck you know of the
BRICS which began to move towards
independence and that was a shocking
development for the United States for
the United States Latin America has
always been called the
it's the Secretary of War put it under
Roosevelt our little region over here
which doesn't bother anybody we control
it and now the United States was
virtually being expelled from the
hemisphere if you look at the
hemispheric conferences in Cartagena you
know Panama 22 2010 through 2012 the
United States and Canada were isolated
the conference's could not reach the
usual consensus agreement because the US
and Canada wouldn't agree the issues the
main issues were first admitting Cuba
into the hemisphere in which all the
countries wanted but the u.s. refused
and the other strikingly was the drug
war or the the victims of the drug war
are latin america the source of the drug
wars in the United States both the
demand for drugs and the supply so if
you look at the arms confiscated arms in
Mexico large majority come from the
United States where I live in Arizona
you can walk into a store and show you
walk out with five of assault rifles
which you can give to the guy from the
Mexican cartel and happily takes them
across the border you know so the supply
of arms and the demand for drugs is in
the United States and it's Latin America
that suffers in many all sorts of ways
so the countries of Latin America right
the left including the right wing you
know president of Guatemala
want to just move to the sensible
position of decriminalizing drugs the
United States will not accept that has
to be criminalized for many reasons for
one reason because in the United States
it essentially restores something which
is very crucial for the United States
slavery the country was built on slavery
in the post-civil war period
a form of slavery was restored
incarceration which led to a slave labor
force we're now back to that under the
drug war the large majority of method
under since Reagan the number of people
in prison is just skyrocketed now back
in the early eighties in the United
States incarceration rates were roughly
at the level of Europe a little higher
but within the spectrum now they're five
to ten times as high mostly blacks black
males Hispanic males usually a very high
percentage are things like victimless
crimes you know somebody found with you
know too much marijuana or something put
into jail can't pay their way out and
stay there for years this this whole
combination of and in fact if you look
at the 2016 election a large factor in
it was simply white supremacy Obama was
hated you know the idea that a black man
could be in the white house was like a
person who can't speak Portuguese
properly being president of Brazil
that's just not tolerable and in fact
about probably 25% of Republicans
literally think that Obama's Antichrist
it's very religious country remember
very religious and but but this was just
I mean he his election he was didn't do
very much she was in fact a business
were added political figure well
internationally was carrying out the
terrorist action of the drone program
but didn't matter he's the wrong type of
person we can't have him there and
everything one of the central policy
commitments of the Republicans is to
undo anything that Obama did
doesn't matter wat because this was just
intolerable and you're seeing the same
in Brazil it's very similar when Tamar
says okay let's destroy the country
because of the we have to undo
everything that was done so no
investment you know nothing for
education and anything that was done by
the progressive government we just undo
it pretty similar in the United States
if you look at it so going back to the
question of the coup I don't think the
United States organized it it no longer
has that kind of power it's not the
early 1960s when the US could actually
prepare the coup of 64 and then strongly
support it when it took place you it and
then throughout the whole hemisphere you
know it wasn't just Brazil but that's no
longer possible the US has been it's
very powerful but nothing like the
earlier years so it can be supportive of
what was a kind of soft coup in Brazil
but I don't think you can say that it
implemented not that it wouldn't have
liked to but it just doesn't have that
power anymore and I think these are
largely internal Brazilian problems
which are extremely serious they go way
back the source of the inequality the
lack of development the failure of them
there were periods of developmental
programs under Vargas and others but
didn't didn't really stick the result of
the coup they could benefit the United
States the US companies are you know for
instance a royal sex you are not as it
used to because now there's a competitor
China China which has higher trade
the United States does in the early
post-war period there were no
competitors the you know it's just round
the show now Latin America's somewhat
more independent and there's an
independent economic force in the world
not like nothing compared with the
United States but it's significant and
for Brazil and Latin America was very
important it absorb I'm going to in fact
harmful for Latin America because it it
kind of induced policymakers to turn to
the easy choice of exporting primary
resources and importing cheap
manufacturers which undermines the
economy it sort of works for a while but
it's not going to be a way to develop
the same thing happens in Venezuela the
end of the Chavez years which showed
lots of progress but the Venezuela was
still about ninety-five percent the
dependent on oil exports you cannot
develop an economy that way and
Venezuela like Brazil could be a rich
flourishing economy as agricultural
resources could be a manufacturing
center instead of just exported oil and
exported capital the enormous export of
capital plenty of corruption which goes
along with that that kind of model and
you said whatever your vision on the
election what do you what do you see
where we in Brazil now for some days
where you see the election process it
will be fair to be you think that the
military could intervene some people are
saying that if if PT wins the election
could be another kind of coop do you
believe that it's possible I think it's
possible but what looks likely at this
point just judging by the polls
is that we Flula barred from
participation both soon ro or maybe
somebody else who they'll put in his
place at the last minute I mean I don't
know what thinking is going on inside
his party but it's conceivable that
they're just holding on to him in the
hospital till the last minute and then
somebody will be put forth to try to
take you know that they exploit his
unfortunate popularity but they'll
presumably get the plurality of the
votes then comes the second round and if
the the optimal situation I don't know
if it'll happen will be if the other
parties like monsieur gomez odd odd
unite somehow in the second round and
try to prevent bolson ro victory which i
think would be very dangerous or Brazil
whether that will happen or not I don't
know Brazil back in track well the
election wouldn't be enough it could
stave off the worst in fact that's the
most that we can hope for at this point
I think then come facing the real
problems what what is it that has
prevented Brazilian growth and
development over the years and there are
deep problems there the class hatred the
sharp inequality the lack of programs
for serious programs of development the
you know the focus on the export of
primary products and import of cheap
manufacturers all of these things have
to be reversed that so those are serious
internal problems there were steps
towards it but not sufficient and you
know it's true that outside forces like
the United States will be
supporting programs that I think we
agree are harmful for Brazil but that
doesn't overcome the fact that it can be
and must be not changed from within that
began to happen during the early years
of the century and it's been aborted for
now but has to be picked up and go on
which i think is possible the resources
human material are there can again yet
after all the recent past gives you an
indication of what can be achieved yes
yes you used the word Colossus that
Brazil had in the first years of this
century under the Lula government it
started to to go to the path of being
colossal and wanting to get a reaction
from the powerful yeah that's you know
but can you very gain its position yes I
think so
the real as I say the the resources both
human and material are still there in
fact they've been there for a century
it's a matter of picking up facing the
challenge and overcoming it which is not
impossible there's been plenty of
achievements over the past years many
you know it's a much more civilized
world than it used to be and that's not
gifts from above that's constant popular
struggle goes on all the time you
mentioned a poll that was made about
Gallup I believe so
asking people once who was the the worst
for democracy the major enemy or the
more interesting story and I will add
that a question that Laura had had asked
asked us to ask you about a very broad
question about the future of capitalism
general futures yeah
first of all that we should bear in mind
that capitalism is a bit of a myth and
we don't really have capitalist
societies now we have state capitalist
societies and the state has always
played an essential central role in in
development and extension of the
capitalist system so that goes back to
England in the 17th century and all the
way through the history of development
but let's just take the recent period so
take today's high-tech economy it takes
say your iPhone if you take your iPhone
and you take the technology in it and
take it apart turns out that almost
everything comes from the state sector
the GPS was developed by the Navy the
electronics was developed in military
labs you know everything of the computer
that's in front of you
the computers began to be developed in
the 1950s actually in large part in the
lab where I happened to be working it
wasn't until 1977 that Apple was able to
produce a computer that could be
marketed for profit that's after about
30 years of research and development in
the state sector now suppose we had
capitalist societies but one of the
principles of capitalism is supposed to
be that if you invest in something
especially if you invest they make a
risky costly investment over say 30
years and there's some profit that comes
out supposed to go back to you but our
system doesn't work like that
it goes to Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos the
public pays the costs through various
devices no University labs and so on and
then after many years something has
handed over to private corporations and
they make the profit Sam with the
internet the beginnings of the Internet
or in the late 1950s actually in same
lab where I was working at MIT that
began thinking about the internet and
that developed over decades under the
within the government system meaning
taxpayer support finally around 1995 the
public made a gift simply a gift to
private corporations to say okay you
guys can have the Internet that we
developed now we have the half a dozen
huge mega corporations which run the
Internet
it's a public public gift you know and
in fact across the board that's the way
it is be the same if you go back to the
19th century when the what was called
the American system of production
developed kind of amazed the world you
know mass production quality controlled
interchangeable parts and most of who's
developing government armors that's
where you can do experimentation you can
you you can make investments for the
long term for private corporations don't
do that they want to make profit
tomorrow you know not invest for what
might happen in 30 years ago and that's
in fact the entire history of
development of what we call capitalism
and its current function if you look at
the present that take the people who are
saying we have to have a small
government and devote ourselves to the
market and just look at how they live
there are huge public subsidies
government subsidies to every major
sector of the economy
agribusiness energy finance they're all
heavily publicly subsidized but that's
ok that's a proper function of the
government just not pensions and
security and health and irrelevant
things like that so that's what's called
capitalism but it's a very specific
specifically shaped and designed form of
capitalism so can that survive well it
should certainly shouldn't survive
I think that can be changed in fact the
public wants it to be changed
so again if you take a look at the
United States is a very heavily polled
society mainly because business wants to
know what people think that it's
important so we know a lot about
people's attitudes the one thing we know
is that across the spectrum people want
much higher taxes on the rich the taxes
keep going down in fact those results
usually aren't even reported that of the
even people who you know are considered
very right-wing Tea Party let's say if
you take a look at their actual
attitudes they're more or less social
democratic people say yeah we want a
very small government but we want more
expenditures in health and education and
support for people who can't feed their
children and so on but just small
government but all the things that a big
government does in fact even attitudes
on things like foreign foreign aid or
very interesting like in the polls about
foreign aid everyone says it's way too
high we're giving everything away to the
undeserving foreigners when you ask them
what foreign aid should be this is about
ten times as high as it actually is you
know because it's these are the results
of extensive propaganda systems which
indoctrinate people into having certain
conceptions you know everybody's
stealing from us the poor are taken away
you know the government's of putting the
poor in front of us
immigrants are flooding the country that
takes a immigration a huge concern about
immigration in the United States you
know Mexican rapists and criminals
almost half the immigration is from Asia
educated trained to people who are being
brought in to help develop the high-tech
economy it's about 40 percent of the
immigrants it's not what people start
here you know yeah what they hear is
something that doesn't exist
you know Mexican criminals but it's a
pretty much the same in Europe so for
example in fact very striking I
mentioned the other day the latest
elections in Europe were in Sweden a
couple of weeks ago which which again
the right-wing did get a much higher
percentage in everyone wanted which is a
frightening development but there was a
careful study of the rise of the right
in Sweden and what it showed was very
interesting and generalizes turns out
that the rise of the right in Sweden was
before the wave of immigrants it was a
reaction of people who were basically
cast aside by the abandonment of the
social democratic policies as the
government including the Social
Democratic so-called Left began to move
towards a so-called austerity programs
you know people know the mass of the
population is left out some people do
fine you know they get rich elites as
they're called so what most of the
people see is well those guys up there
are doing fine and I'm left out so I
object and I'm gonna respond by voting
for the nationalist xenophobic Tea Party
that was before the wave of immigrants
once the immigrants come in they serve
as a convenient scapegoat and so it's
their fault it's not the fault of the
corporation's up there we don't see them
in Finland where the same study showed
there's the same rise in the right-wing
parties but almost no immigration if you
take a look at the United States it's
quite interesting the 2016 election
there been extensive studies of why
people voted for Trump and almost all
the studies say it's racism and sexism
which is not false but the question is
why did these attitudes emerge and if
you look back they emerge from people
who were left out who have been
stagnating for 40 years even worse
wages declining benefits declining
organization declining those are
communities that are ripe for a
demagogue who can blame everything on a
scapegoat a racism is there undoubtedly
misogyny is there xenophobia is there
and it comes out of the bottle when
people are angry and resentful and don't
know where to turn to for explanation
for their plight I think the source of a
lot of this is simply the neoliberal
policies of the last generation which
were designed they're not a law of
nature you know they're designed to have
certain consequences which they have and
one of them is leaving the mass of the
population as what's sometimes called a
precariat people living precarious
existences no security pensions aren't
coming no organization we have nowhere
Osaka potatoes we're gonna look for
somebody responsible and the easiest
place to look as people are even more
vulnerable than you are and so it shows
up in these dangerous antisocial
attitudes the decline of democracy is a
consequence and in fact a desired
consequences of the policies that were
instituted they overcome what was called
the crisis of democracy too much
democracy so now yes we've succeeded in
reducing the crisis of democracy and
with the consequences that follow from
that you talked about yesterday
the one that in the States they asked
about what would be the worst enemy of
peace democracy well that's two
different questions
not unrelated I mean I think the
greatest threat to democracy is simply
neoliberal programs which have the
consequence of concentrating power and
private corporate hands which
automatically leads to a decline of
democracy and we must bear in mind that
that was what was intended by the
liberal sectors who were concerned about
the crisis of democracy when theme
militancy and activism the 60s were just
engaging to many people in the political
system so the decline of democracy is
not a failure it's a success now if we
ask about the threat of world peace that
comes this very interesting poll we
mentioned last night
the major gap a polling agency the
us-based Gallup corporation that does
Studies of international opinion every
year they ask all sorts of questions
lots of information one year 2013 this
is under Obama incidentally and not
Trump under Obama during the period when
open 2013 Obama was still regarded as
some sort of great hope for peace they
for the first time they asked the
question which country is the greatest
threat to world peace and the answer was
so startling that it was never published
in the United States never reported the
answer one Gallup never asked the
question again incidentally the answer
was well the United States by a large
margin
there was no way behind the United
States in second place was Pakistan with
much lower spore than that's misleading
because there's a big in the end of it
they probably all regarded Pakistan at
the top so it's basically the United
States if you ask the in the United
States there's an answer Iran North
Korea those are the threats but an
international opinion that they're not
in the man
barely mentioned hardly even mentioned
the in fact Iran is mentioned by a low
percentage the same percentages Israel
approximately but basically it's the
United States which is the threat so
there's a threat to world peace the
world understands it the United States
is in kids it's unthinkable you know I
mean you can you know you can't say that
you can't even think it it's so
outlandish actually it's quite
interesting the there was one newspaper
in the United States that did report
this poll it's a Murdoch tabloid a
right-wing Murdoch tabloid the New York
Post and the way they reported it was to
say look how crazy the world is it's and
this is not the right-wing that I should
stress this is mainstream liberal
educated intellectual sectors just like
the crisis of democracy book was you
said this system will not survive like
this how I can't
yes impossible for a reason we haven't
discussed there are two huge crises
growing one of them we we know about the
nuclear threat if you look at the
history of the nuclear age it's an
absolute miracle that we've survived if
there was time we could go through it
but case after case of dozens of times
sometimes by accident mostly by
accidents sometimes by reckless acts of
leaders became literally within minutes
of terminal destruction literally some
of the cases are shocking when you look
at them and miracles don't continue so
sooner or later will manage the destroy
ourselves
of the other is global warming which is
very serious I mean if the foot use of
fossil fuels continues that anything
remotely like the present level but the
end of this century let's say we might
see sea level rising six to ten meters
you can just imagine what that would
mean plus what we already see severe
weather droughts hurricanes typhoons all
escalating and it already has big
effects like the the Syrian war for
example at one of its roots is a
unprecedented drought nothing and
hundreds of thousands of years of
history huge drought surely the result
of global warming which drove peasants
off the land into the cities no way for
them to survive it creates a kind of
kindling which any Sparkle set off it's
part of the background for the conflicts
that arose the same happened in dark for
the huge drought drove nomads into the
agricultural areas there's also ethnic
conflict there they're immediately led
conflict and confrontation ended up with
big massacres these things are not are
not just future we're living with the
beginnings of them you take a look at
Bangladesh which is mostly a coastal
plain the sea level starts rising that
what's going to happen to hundreds of
millions of people
if the glaciers keep melting and the
Himalayas the already meager water
supply in South Asia is going to be
severely threatened and there right now
there are several hundred million people
in India who literally do not have
potable water we're taught in Pakistan
it's going to be even worse I mean we're
talking about the
fate of hundreds of millions of people
in the near future the rich may think
they can escape by going to a mountain
somewhere but that's not going to happen
so and the policies that are being
pursued are to escalate the problem
that's not just nothing that it's not
just Trump I'm take the big banks you
take a look at the JPMorgan Chase huge
banks they know exactly what the
consequences are and they're increasing
their investments in fossil fuels that's
the nature of capitalism capital and the
as I said it's we have a mixed form of
capitalism but there is a market system
underlying it somewhere and an
imperative of the market system is that
you try to make maximal profit tomorrow
and you disregard what are called
externalities the things that are not
charging and if you don't do that you're
out of the game it's part of the
structure of the system so Jamie Dimon
who's smart guy head of JP Morgan Chase
understands perfectly well the
consequences but nevertheless is
compelled by the logic of the
institutions to maximize the threat to
his own grandchildren he may not like it
maybe on the side he gives money to the
Sierra Club environmental groups but as
functioning within the system they're
destroying the possibility for organized
life that is nothing that you can put
band-aids on this is much deeper none of
course the Trump administration that's
it's just the by far what we ought to
have big headlines in the newspapers
every day saying these guys are trying
to destroy the possibility of organized
human life and if you think about it
honestly there's been nothing in all of
human history to compare with this
not a Atilla the Hun not Genghis Khan
not Hitler horrible as they were they
never tried to destroy organized human
life this is something new it that
there's a word to describe it an evil
doesn't capture it it's insanity doesn't
capture it because it's not insane its
plan unconscious and part of the very
logic of the system in which they work
now of course with Trump and his
associates they're trying to extend it
make it worse that's not part of the
logic of the system you could the system
could function with no palliative
efforts to Obama in fact was doing and
most of the world is doing not enough
but at least something but it's a very
deep problem it's like class hatred in
Brazil this is deep you can't put a
bandaid on it it's fundamental things
that have to be dealt with
how about resistance resistance the the
movements against capitalism against is
those things believe that's it's the
encouraging part of the story so the
most popular political figure in the
United States by a considerable margin
is Bernie Sanders which is kind of
unthinkable in the framework of American
political history it's never happened in
American political history that somebody
like Sanders could become even notice
let alone become the most popular
political figure in the country now just
think of what happened here's a god you
have to recognize that American
elections are literally bought you can
you can predict the outcome of elections
with remarkable precision simply by
looking at campaign funding executive
and Congress
as goes back well over a hundred years
here's somebody who entered the campaign
virtually unknown no media support
barely mentioned if the media mentioned
that they just made fun of him you know
no support zero from any of the funders
no corporate support support from
private wealth he even used what's in
the United States a kind of four-letter
word the United States I suppose the
only country in the world outside of
maybe some dictatorship where you can't
say the word socialism no let alone
communism but it's just unspeakable you
know it's the it's it's literally a
four-letter word yeah then he called
them he said he was a socialist
socialist really means New Deal Democrat
the founder but but with all of that he
came very close to winning the
nomination for the Democrats are for
Hillary at that time no no not not in
the after the nomination yes but that's
not for Hillary that's against Trump
that's something quite different she was
awful but if Sanders had been able to
win the nomination frankly I don't know
what would have happened because the
Republican propaganda machine which had
not been directed against Sanders and
which is huge corporate back fantastic I
would be directed against Sanders and
what you'd start hearing is things about
this atheist Jew communist wants to
destroy everything a ton of stuff like
that
he probably probably couldn't have
withstood it but so it's kind of
unpredictable but that's what certainly
would have happened that and how people
would react to that you really don't
know it's hard that you can see it in
right now the attack on Corbin I mean
there's an enormous fear including the
labor point you know the old Labour
Party the Guardian you know the idea
that you might have a political party
that actually represents the general
public and its interests and suffering
people abroad and is led by a decent
human being
that's totally intolerable so you have
this enormous attack of the kind you
can't defend yourself against like
anti-semitism since you say somebody's a
Holocaust denier and anti-semite you
know there's no defense basically and
it's just across the board a huge attack
on Corbin and the Labor Party and that's
the kind of thing you would have seen if
Sanders in commenting you know they pick
it a little differently but anti-israel
you know all this huge propaganda which
he is so familiar you can just make it
up but since there's a lot to overcome
but what the Sanders campaign show then
what the Corbin success shows is that
you do quite a lot of these Sanders and
Yanis varoufakis just came out with a
joint declaration varoufakis it's very
important I think over is a very
smart interesting guy they have
he he's the center of this new political
organization diem25 which is in fact
running candidates transnational
candidates for the European Parliament
and ultimately for in the Greek
elections and later other ones which is
a kind of a counterpart to korban and
Sanders and they've are FACA Sanders
declaration a couple of days ago is you
know it's not radical it's calling for
sensible multipolar and then Liberal
Democratic Institute in the Europe to
preserve what's good about the European
Union and to overcome the series flaws
is same in the Western Hemisphere
and things like the obrador election in
Mexico or another example so I think if
you look around the world there's a
little just plain level of activism
mainly among young people it's quite
surprising striking I think it's much
higher than almost it's ever been except
for a few few brief moments like 1968
there's a brief spike but this is
lasting so I think the basis is sort of
there if it can be brought together and
organized yeah talking about hope we
interviewed Zapatero
and Massimo D'Alema and they and they
said that that if a progressive
candidate is elected in Brazil Brazil
and Mexico can make like an axis that
would change the balance of power
yeah that's pretty close to what was
happening ten years ago with the rise of
Louis or breaks and particularly Selleck
which never really got off the ground
but that was a very important
organization because it excluded the
United States and Canada it's the first
time
the history of the hemisphere that an
organization was created just for the
countries of other than the Colossus of
the north was kept out and it was
showing up in the discussions at the
hemispheric meetings there was a real
basis for it then I get this very sharp
reaction to beat it back so no uno sore
barely functions you know and but but
this the background is there it would be
picked up again international not
international communist anymore but
international progressive movement
that's what's needed and that's what the
center's very focus for was calling for
and I think there's there's a basis but
these things don't happen by themselves
takes energy and dedication commitment
just like anything else getting rid of
abolitionism was fought for hundreds of
years before you can finally get formal
ending of slavery the women's rights
goes back hundreds of years you know
these things are not easy to achieve
message to Brazil message I don't feel
I'm gonna talk about how much I enjoyed
spending time with in twenty years ago
now I think he ought to be the next
president of Brazil and how it
completely outrageous these judicial
decisions are in fact is take it look at
it I mean even if every charge against
Lula was correct which is very
questionable but just let's say they're
all correct so he was given an apartment
which he never lived in so on okay
twelve years in jail for that that's a
coup you know there's such a gross
miscarriage of justice I mean you know
but by any standards certainly by
Brazilian standards I mean how many
apartments does Cardozo have around the
world for example you know it's but by
any standards this is a radical
miscarriage of justice even if you
accept the validity of the charges which
raises many questions in themselves you
know but so you know that's I I think
this is obvious it doesn't take any deep
understanding to reach these conclusions
so hot brazilian people should do about
it well it's in their hands to overthrow
to over common can be done number
they're not trapped
you know well thank you very much thank
you very much it's a very small turkey
