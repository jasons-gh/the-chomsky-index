in Latin America support for military
action was the lowest the highest in
Latin America was about eleven percent
in Venezuela and Colombia the lowest was
two percent in Mexico the essential fact
that lies behind this was described
quite simply by carlos salinas who
directed government relations for
Amnesty International for many years
with particular concern for Latin
America what he said is that Latin
Americans know better than perhaps most
people that the US government is one of
the biggest sponsors of terrorism and
they know it from firsthand experience
of course it doesn't follow that
innocent Americans should be slaughtered
by terrorists gangsters nor did anyone
suggest that but neither should other
people and the facts are not forgotten
elsewhere let's move to another part of
the world where happens is was a few
weeks ago dear bekheyr in southeastern
Turkey this is the same sort of
unofficial capital of the Turkish Kurds
that's 10 or 15 million people they had
they have suffered horrendous atrocities
in recent years some of the worst
atrocities of the 1990s several million
refugees tens of thousands of people
killed hundreds thousands actually of
towns and villages destroyed much of the
countryside raised in yerba cure there's
nobody knows how many but maybe hundreds
of thousands of refugees in the region
right nearby outside the city walls and
living essentially in a dungeon huge
dungeon under terrific repression I
where did that come from well came from
from us we paid for it and the if you
take a look at arms transfers to turkey
turkey was a major ally of course
strategically placed in the Cold War and
near the Middle East so it always got
heavy flow of us arms it shot up however
as soon as the counter insurgency
operation against the Kurds began in the
mid 80s remained high escalated in the
90s more or less as atrocities escalated
peaked in 1997 in the single year of
1997 turkey got more arms than in the
entire Cold War period up to the counter
insurgency combined in fact turkey ended
up being the biggest recipient of us
arms in the world outside of Israel in
Egypt not for Cold War reasons as long
after the Cold War and not for reasons
having to do with the Middle East but in
order to slaughter and repress its
domestic Kurdish population well in gr
bekheyr as everywhere there was harsh
condemnation of the September 11th
atrocities but they don't overlook what
I just described as easily as we do
let's move a little bit south to Lebanon
and the Palestinian refugee camps there
are two there was strong condemnation of
the atrocities but it was mixed many of
them remember in fact everyone remembers
the murderous invasions through the 90s
supported strongly by Clinton again
hundreds of thousands of refugees
hundreds of people killed and they're
very few who could possibly have
forgotten 1982 when the invasion killed
about 20,000 people half destroyed
Beirut none of this was in self-defense
that's at last being quietly conceded in
the United States at least in the case
of the 1982 war the first recognition
that I've seen is in a recent column by
James Bennett in the New York Times
January 24th call him on another topic
but if you look in it he says he's there
Middle East correspondent he says the
goal of the 1982 invasion was to install
a friendly regime and destroy mr.
Arafat's palestinian liberation
organization that the theory went would
help persuade Palestinians to accept
Israeli rule in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip that's quite accurate
it was in fact 20 years ago already
openly called in Israel a war two for
the wet for the occupied territories and
it's quite important these facts were
reported extensively in Israel 20 years
ago they've previously been accessible
here only in dissident literature of
course all of this was carried out with
the decisive military and diplomatic
support of the Reagan administration
well all of these things are extreme
cases of international terrorism if not
the more severe crime of aggression the
major war crime but let's give the
benefit of the doubt to Washington and
assume that it's only international
terrorism it surely satisfies the
official US definition of terrorism
which was formulated at the same time
the early 80s that is the calculated use
of violence or the threat of violence to
attain goals that are political
religious or ideological in nature you
go back to James Bennett's description
of the US israeli invasion of lebanon
fits that case that definition precisely
furthermore by far the more most extreme
acts of terrorism international
terrorism in the region in those years
the 1980s were either us initiated or
us-backed and that included the peak
year of international terrorism 1985 was
picked as the peak story of the year
these facts are misrepresented here in a
most astonishing and revealing way I'll
come back to it if you like but the
facts are quite clear you may recall
that President Reagan's special envoy to
the Middle East who was more or less in
charge of all of this was a gentleman
named Donald Rumsfeld who's now running
the military component of the current
war on terror Reagan's ambassador to
Honduras who supervised the
international terrorist operations for
which the United States was condemned by
the World Court as John Negroponte II
who is now running the diplomatic
component of the current war
run terror at the United Nations this is
hardly ancient history it bears rather
directly on the current phase of the war
on terror that was declared by the
Reagan administration 20 years ago when
it took office with much the same
rhetoric as today and was and the same
personnel and was conducted in ways that
may easily be forgotten here but are not
forgotten by the victims you can do a
little research project to see how well
they're remembered here by just seeing
how often any of this is brought up in
the reams and reams of paper that have
been devoted to the war on terror in
September 11th and that's an interesting
insight into ourselves the most
important topic we can learn we can
learn more about the current phase of
the reedy clared war on terror by
considering how the current
international terrorist atrocities are
regarded right now not ancient history
like the 80s but the current ones well
in fact there is scholarly this just a
lot of scholarly literature now on
terrorism big topic and in it there is
some reference to the 1980s so if take a
look at say the journal current history
and december good journal devoted to
terrorism they discuss scholarly
articles discuss the eight mentioned the
80s as an era of state-sponsored
terrorism in which the United States
played a proactive role against
terrorism meaning international terror
international terrorism sponsored and
run by the United States is a action is
proactive attack is a proactive role
against terrorism or will would have
appreciated that in Turkey in april two
thousand the State Department issued its
annual report on international terrorism
and it singled out turkey for I'm
quoting for its positive experiences
encountering terror it also picked out
Algeria for its positive experiences one
of the worst terrorist states in the
world
and the third one that had positive
experiences with Spain as bad as those
two but hardly very pretty either so
they had positive experiences in
countering terror by carrying out some
of the worst terrorist atrocities of the
mid and late 1990s with crucial us
support that was reported on the front
it was the lead story in The New York
Times reported by Judith Miller who's
their specialist on these topics with no
comment about what it meant in the
current scholarly literature our war on
terror I'm quoting has no better friend
and ally than turkey thanks to the
capabilities of its armed forces
demonstrated in its anti terror campaign
okay if Malaysia vich were an ally he
would not be standing before an internal
court for facing war crimes cha trials
rather he'd be praised for the success
of his anti-terror campaigns and he
would be chosen to lead new ones and
much like Suharto's one of the great
killers and torturers the late twentieth
century he was praised in the mainstream
as a moderate who's at heart benign as
the blood was flowing and he was hailed
as our kind of guy by the Clinton
administration shortly before he was
overthrown by popular rebellion actually
the US ambassador in Pakistan is using
the same words for Pakistan's dictator
today
