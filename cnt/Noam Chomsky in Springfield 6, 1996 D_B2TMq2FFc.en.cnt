my name is Michael and busey and I'm a
board member of arise for social justice
and also a member of the New England
Central America Network that's two of
the organizations that you have to thank
for putting this together
but also here at Springfield College the
Newman community the office ministries
and New Horizons in Haiti you know some
people said that we couldn't draw a
crowd or fill a hall in Springfield for
noam chomsky that there wouldn't be
enough
I know that most of you are here for one
reason only and that's to hear mr.
Chomsky give his analysis of power and
what's happening in our community and of
course that's a big reason we're here
but we have a number of other reasons
for hosting this event in Springfield
also one of them is because this is a
fundraiser and you will hear more about
that as the evening goes on but really
the main reason that we wanted to have
this event in Springfield is because we
want a chance to keep building on the
sense of community and a sense of
movement that we feel here in
Springfield and in western s we want a
chance to start developing a really good
analysis of what it will take to have
social and economic justice in this
country and we want to build unity here
because we are part of a movement even
though we may not always realize that
I'm struck that most of us in creative
writing classes have been told that when
we're writing a paper we need to get rid
of the passive voice so we're used to
speaking about the movement we have to
remember that you don't have a movement
without moving without going someplace
and that's what we're doing but
sometimes we don't realize it we can get
very myopic we can get very
short-sighted we can think well we're
working on our issue we're working for
our constituency and we don't always see
how the different parts of the movement
connect each other for you people are
science fiction fans sometimes it's
almost as if we're each in our own
little dimension we're really standing
right side by side with each other and
were separated only by the smallest
moment of time or awareness to realize
that we are connected with each other
but sometimes we do
and and we get that sense of feeling for
me I think one of the times recently
when I'd really thought that we were
part of the same movement was during the
Gulf War and I saw Springfield and
Western Mass infect come together and
organized in a way that I haven't seen
de round many other issues student
groups African American groups social
justice groups like arise low-income
groups you name it and we knew that what
was happening in the Gulf affected us
and we really understood when the war
was going on what it was all about
unfortunately when the war changed focus
and I won't say ended but when the war
changed focus we lost our focus when the
war switched to an economic front
instead of a very obvious body count
that we could see on the media every day
well it seemed as if we weren't needed
anymore if the desire for unity sort of
dissipated and yet we still have an
embargo in Iraq against Iraq that's
causing devastating loss of life for
people in Iraq we have our own veterans
who are crying out for media attention
as they try to deal with the Gulf War
Syndrome but because the battle is on an
economic front it doesn't seem as real
to us even and the same thing happened
in Central America when the troops
pulled out and it became an economic war
instead it was harder to see and the
same thing is happening here in this
country but we tend not to notice that
and yet we have to trust our ability to
accomplish this task of unity and
being in the same movement and I do
believe that we can do that for many
years when I struggled to be a part of
the movement for social justice
primarily within the peace movement and
the anti-nuclear movement but I never
really felt like I was building an
analysis that worked toward unity and it
wasn't actually until I started meeting
and organizing with my own peers and
started coming from my own experience as
a low-income person as a woman and as a
single mother and working with other
people like myself that that analysis
started to come and one of the first
things we did was learned to ask the
question who benefits from our
oppression and once we started getting
some answers to that question then we
could ask the next question who are our
allies in the movement who do we have
social justice and economic justice in
common with who do we need to work with
and come together with and this really
came full circle for me when I had a
chance to go to Nicaragua in 1993 and I
remember being very moved by the depth
of the commitment and struggle of the
Nicaraguan people and I said to one of
the organizers there what can we
possibly do in the u.s. to make a
difference in Nicaragua and what I was
told was you go home and you work for
social and economic justice in your own
country you turn up the heat you demand
social and economic justice and by doing
that you will help us here in Nicaragua
to achieve the same so our job is to
build those connections and to do it at
home that was a really full circle
feeling for me if we're going to build
movement and really see ourselves as
part of a movement you who are here
tonight need to be connected to
everything that is what's happening when
you walked in these doors the different
community groups the organizations like
cafe habitat which is providing organic
coffee and at the same time a livelihood
for homeless people American Friends
Service Committee if I start naming all
of them I'm bound to leave someone out
so I won't do that but it's very
important for you to go out and be
connected with those groups otherwise
it'll be a little bit like them going to
a wedding for the food and forgetting to
stare I'm here the sense of
community and commitment to community
that that we would ordinarily bring to
that event now I don't want to be right
people too much this when I look around
this room I see a tremendous number of
tireless social justice activists people
from our community who've worked very
hard together all I want to say is that
history is on our side but only if we do
the right thing and the right thing is
happening here as much as anywhere else
that it might happen so I thank you for
coming I'm going to turn this over to J
Franco and don't forget don't leave
without signing a petition for freedom
for leonard peltier signing a letter to
get Mumia abu-jamal and a new trial and
making every possible connection that
you can make because we're the movement
words that right here Thanks
[Applause]
I think there's some room in this aisle
over here if they'd like to sit there
we'd also like to invite people to sit
up on the stage if they'd like they can
come up on the stairway over here
there's more room up here
are there still more people in the
hallway now
just push those out of the way all right
this way you can sit there if you like
oh please barb God Gail watch have a
seat right though
okay good evening I'm Jeff Frankel a
senior at Springfield College and a
pre-law student delighted to be part of
tonight's lecture program and also
delighted to have been chosen as the
student was to introduce our guest
speaker this evening why am i delighted
a person like our guest speaker dr. Noam
Chomsky is one who has the intelligence
knowledge and the ability to articulate
in such a way to influence us all for
those who are open to his vision and
perspective in life he challenges the
college student in the academic alike
and his or her future views on man and
society dr. Chomsky is a man who has
helped shape my views and I hope that
this part of my education will make a
difference in my future law school
studies the Newman community of
Springfield College the office of campus
ministry arise for social justice and
the New England Central American network
proudly present Noam Chomsky this
evening professor Chomsky will be
speaking on the topic bringing the third
world home
this topic has been very close to the
heart of dr. Chomsky his lecturing and
teaching for the past several years have
been designed as one of challenge
intellect and hospitality he is
identified by most people who have heard
him speak and all who have read his work
as one of the most inclusive people in
our culture dr. Noam Chomsky has a very
distinguished position on the staff at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology as a full professor in the
department of modern languages and
linguistics MIT is neither the beginning
nor the end of dr. Chomsky's life or
work he has a great passion for
transforming the world in which we live
in he has it from he is a tremendous
advocate of truth justice and honesty he
settles for nothing less than integrity
of word and spirit
dr. Chomsky did not arrive here tonight
at Springfield College without a
fantastic amount of preparation two
people have done an exceptional amount
of work to bring him here our Reverend
dr. Leo James hor of the Office of
campus ministry at Springfield College
and logan patrick from a rise for social
justice in the new england Central
American Network we thank father Leo hor
and Logan Patrick for their generous
energy time and commitment to social
justice Noam Chomsky was born on
December 7th 1928 in Philadelphia his
undergraduate and graduate years were
spent at the University of Pennsylvania
where received his PhD in linguistics in
1955 during the years of 1951 to 1955
Noam Chomsky was a junior fellow of the
Harvard University Society of fellows
while a junior fellow he completed his
doctoral dissertation entitled
transformation analysis the major
theoretical viewpoints of the
dissertation appeared in the monograph
syntactic structure which was published
in 1957 this formed a more extent this
form part of a more extensive work
entitled the logical structure of
linguistic theory circulated in
mimeograph in 1955 and later published
in 1975 professor Chomsky joined the
staff at MIT in 1955 and was then
appointed full professor in the
department of modern languages and
linguistics now called the Department of
linguistics and philosophy between 1966
and 1976 he held the Ferrari P Ward
professorship of Modern Languages and
linguistics
in 1976 he was appointed Institute
professor during the years of 1958 and
1959 dr. Chomsky was in residence at the
Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton New Jersey in the spring of
1969
he delivered the John Locke lecture at
Oxford in January of 1970 he delivered
the Bertrand Russell memorial lecture at
Cambridge University in 72 the Nehru
Memorial Lecture in New Delhi and in
1977 the Huizenga lecture in Leiden
amongst many others professor Chomsky
has received honorary Doctorate degrees
from the University of London University
of Chicago Loyola University of Chicago
Swarthmore College Delhi College Bard
College University of Massachusetts
University of Pennsylvania Georgetown
University Amherst College and Cambridge
College he is a fellow of the American
Academy of Arts and Sciences and the
National Academy of Science in addition
he's a member of many other professional
and learned societies in the United
States and abroad he was also the
recipient of the distinguished
scientific contribution award from the
American Psychological Association dr.
Chomsky has written and lectured widely
on linguistics philosophy intellectual
history contemporary issues
International Affairs and United States
foreign policy his political works
include at war with Asia for reasons of
state the political economy of human
rights volumes one and two rules and
representations radical priorities the
culture of terrorism necessary consent
in the powers and prospects amongst many
others Noam Chomsky is obviously a very
prominent linguist and political
activist his impact on the field of
linguistics has been profound and
lasting changing the focus from a
concern with methods of classification
to a search for explanatory principles
the appearance of a syntactic structure
is initiated a fundamental shift in the
emphasis away from the limited
perspectives of empiricism
which he donated to American linguistics
and social science to an investigation
into language and universal grammar as a
uniquely human mental faculty with its
own biologically determined structure
and principle as a social critic and
political activist dr. Chomsky a
libertarian socialist is acknowledged to
be an articulate and persuasive critic
of United States foreign policy a
fundamental aspect of his critique is
the crucial role that US academics and
journalists play in their manufacturing
consent his writings in this area
include books on the Vietnam War called
American power and the new mandarins on
the Middle East called mobilizing
democracy the changing role in the
Middle East and on terrorism and Thai
the culture of terrorism again I am
delighted to welcome dr. Noam Chomsky to
Springfield College as guests of all of
us
please welcome dr. Noam Chomsky
if my voice sounds a little hoarse
that's because I've been talking to a
magazine called the optimist which is
sort of appropriate since all those what
I say may have a rather gloomy sound to
it it's really intended to be optimistic
and I hope that that strain underneath
doesn't get suppressed by description of
the facts as they look to me which is
well could be taken to be gloomy the
basic features of contemporary society I
think are captured pretty well and
clearly expressed clearly well
understood within the business world for
example in a recent issue of the
Barron's
Journal which discusses what it calls
plausibly capital's clear subjection of
labor for the past 15 years now the
basic reasons for capital subjection of
labor globally they're also pretty well
understood the one crucial factor was
the breakdown of the the dismantling
really of the post-war Britain woods
economic system by Richard Nixon back in
the early 70s and that meant breaking
down eliminating the system of regular
regulated currencies that had held since
the Second World War and that was a
major factor in a huge explosion of
unregulated speculative capital
unregulated financial capital the scale
has been was accelerated by
technological developments which made it
very easy to move a speculative capital
very fast from one place to another and
in complicated ways all of this has
turned into an extremely efficient
weapon against social policies that are
designed to stimulate economies were to
use public
funds for public interest and that was
well understood by the mid-1970s so in
1978 the presidential address at the
American economics Association by a
well-known American Nobel prize-winning
economist James Tobin he discussed even
at those early stages pointed out that
this extraordinary explosion of
financial capital was if left alone was
going to drive the world towards a low
low growth low wage high profit economy
and in fact he proposed some mild reform
measures which might have controlled
that it's called the Tobin tax slight
tax on speculative transactions just to
slow down this destructive economically
and socially destructive operation it
probably would work it's been on the UN
agenda and the agenda of a number of
states since that time it's never gotten
anywhere because the people who run the
world would prefer to have things work
the way they are working and one can of
course think of much more far-reaching
changes than this one it's commonly
alleged that the that there's nothing
much you can do these are kind of forces
of nature the global economy is out of
control and so on one just has to
subject oneself to this kind of world
that's there's no evidence for any of
that the this is mostly propaganda and
one shouldn't be trapped by it into
impotence and inaction the economy today
is no more globalized than it was in the
first decade of this century if you
measure globalization by foreign
investment or trade or financial
transactions or any other measure
relative to global to national to to
productive actual product which is of
course the relevant the relevant measure
what's more the International economy
the flows of trade and invest
and so on are very localized there
within overwhelmingly within three major
areas Western Europe United States and
Japan and their immediate surroundings
those are all areas where political
action meaning action by populations
through functioning governments could
well control the effects of the quite
destructive effects of globalization
that's and it's precisely because global
because public control is possible that
there's a tremendous propaganda
offensive to convince everyone that it's
hopeless and you might as well just
submit to it and it's also for that
reason that actual social policy during
this period of capital subject clear
subjugation of labor actual social
policy has been geared to two very clear
objectives one of them is to use the new
weapons that are available to try to
impose on the industrial societies
themselves something like a kind of a
third-world structure that's what I mean
by bringing the third world home the
third world structures are pretty
standard any third world country to go
to has more or less the same character
and there's a small sector of extreme
wealth and privilege often phenomenal
it's often amazing to see there's a
large majority of the population who
live in various degrees of something
ranging from barely tolerable to
suffering to total misery and there's
another sector of the population that's
that is essentially superfluous for what
for wealth creation and they have to be
eliminated or removed in some fashion
and there are various ways of doing it
either death squads or send them out
into the slums or into the countryside
or the hills or whatever our way of
doing it is
different we're more civilized society
so we throw them into jail at a rate
that is unheard of in any in any
industrials in any society in the world
in fact the only country that's even
close to us it's China at the moment I
were way beyond any industrial society
the rates going way up increasing even
faster went more than tripled during the
1980s is going up even faster now and
it's completely unrelated to crime this
is a way of dealing with this purplish
population as you instead of kind of
what they call social cleansing in parts
of Central America where you send out
the death squads it's and it's one
aspect of the bringing of the
third-world home well that's one part of
social policy the other parallel track
and this is worldwide is to try to do
something to undermine the threat of
democracy which makes sense because
functioning democracy could
significantly modify not only social
policy but the institutions on which it
rests
so therefore the threat of democracy as
always has to be countered and various
ways to do this in third-world countries
you often do it by military cooze brutal
terrorists military crews of which the
United States says initiated and
supported plenty over the years for this
reason in countries like ours the way to
do it is to transfer power more and more
away from parts of the from institutions
which could be influenced by the public
as say the federal government could be
to transfer power away from them to
unaccountable private tyrannies that's
what corporations are there are pure
tyrannical organizations of a kind that
would be called totalitarian in the
political realm and they're basically
unaccountable except for weak regulatory
systems which are being dismantled
so if decision-making can be transferred
over into the hands of unaccountable
private tyrannies the threat of
democracy is very much weakened and
that's a another strand of social policy
dramatically obvious
in the United States and England and in
fact the other countries influenced by
them like New Zealand and Australia and
to some extent and to a lesser but
noticeable extent elsewhere in the
industrial world as a result of the
globalization which is not out of
control but uncontrolled which is
something quite different
a difference that should be borne in
mind well going back to that article on
Barron's which is the main you know one
of the main business journals it warns
that the glory days may be coming to an
end it refers to what it calls the
aggressive campaign of labor in the
United States to secure a so-called
living wage and the sudden grassroots
push for guaranteed for a guaranteed
bigger piece of the pie and the
occasional electoral successes that this
is already met and there are even bigger
threats to which I'll come back well so
maybe these wonderful days of capitals
clear subjugation of labour and bringing
the third world home and destroying
democracy maybe that's not going to look
so good a couple up down the road that's
something to worry about I'm now talking
from within the business community from
other perspectives something to applaud
well let me say that the most important
thing to bear in mind I think and the
one message I'd really like to leave for
you to think about is that we've been
through this over and over again before
I don't mean you and me I mean modern
history's been through it over and over
before that's very much worth
remembering when you think about what
lies ahead and what we can do about it
and let me just mention a couple of the
major moments in which this has been
true the most important one the classic
one was in the early part of the 19th
century early Industrial Revolution when
the the what are now called neoliberal
ideas the ideas of classical economics
the intellectual tools the
being used to justify and structure the
policies that I've been talking about
when these tools were forged that's when
David Ricardo and others four created
the basis for the modern science of
economics which according to Ricardo was
established with the certainty of the
principle of newton's principles of
gravitation and which demonstrated some
fundamental truths one fundamental truth
that it demonstrated was that solicitude
for poor people is misplaced
you only harm the poor by trying to help
them and so therefore you've got to stop
this you've got to stop this and treat
people with what's nowadays called tough
love
meaning kick them in the face because
that's what's really good for them as
the science of economics demonstrates if
you do anything else you're really
harming and those of you have been
through proper courses understand how
you spell this out and prove the
theorems and so on the other point that
had to be made was sort of a mixture of
a moral one and a scientific one and
that is that to try to convince to
demonstrate to people the elementary
truth that they have no rights in
pre-capitalist societies people had a
place like in a feudal society everyone
had some kind of place it's like an
organic structure of some kind the place
might be lets say a rotten place but you
had some place and you had a right to
live in that place and the system was
set up to you more or less maintain that
but the new science had demonstrated
that people have no rights
certainly no right to live they have
only the rights that they can obtain an
unregulated the labor market and if you
cannot survive on the basis of selling
your labor power in a free labor market
then you have a couple of choices one
you can die another you can go to a
workhouse prison and a third go
somewhere else that was the advice given
by him of--this and Ricardo and others
can't survive on the labor market go
somewhere else
of courses is like the 1820s you could
go somewhere else this country for
example was being cleared of the plague
of a native population and as they were
removed you could go here and the same
was true of Australia and so on so you
could go somewhere else and in fact the
peak period of immigration to the United
States relative to population was around
1850 as people were going somewhere else
under the pressure of the policies that
had put them or was trying to ram down
their throats that they had no right
well that's by the 1830s it looked as if
these policies had in fact won in
Britain they had been established in law
and there was a sense among the rulers
you know the basically the business
world that they had reached the end of
history everything was perfect they had
achieved something like perfection
everything was now great the there was a
little one fly in the ointment however
that is that people are stupid they
cannot seem to understand the principles
of the science and the consequences that
follow from it and they got this funny
idea in their heads that if we have no
right to live as you claim then you have
no right to rule and in fact what got
started was for years the British Army
was involved in putting down riots and
disruption he then starts labor
organizing chart ISM the socialist
movement and so on really threatening
well there was a reaction to that
fortunately the science is flexible and
it discovered that people do have a
right to live and you get a change and
you get the foundations of what later
became a kind of social contract and you
know the roots of what became welfare
state the capitalism and later years
well that was one moment one of those
moments when it looked as if the end of
history had been achieved everything was
perfect the rules of the science were
established but people somehow disrupted
it and broke it down and you turn
move to something else later in the
century it looked as if order had been
restored and once again there was a good
deal of euphoria about the establishment
of the right thinking with the
consequent consequence of the kind I've
mentioned but there were people who
disagree one of the ones who disagreed
was a very very famous artist and
designer William Morris who scandalized
in a public audience at Oxford in the
1880s by announcing that he was a
socialist and he went on to say that he
understood that it was the received
opinion that the current devil take the
hindmost society was perfection and that
finality had been reached in it and it
would never change and if that were true
he said civilization will die but he
just he said despite the fact that this
opinion is held by the most learned men
he refuses to believe it and he turned
out to be right popular struggle
continued finality and perfection hadn't
been reached in forty years later the
major figure in American labor history
Eugene Debs was also right when he said
essentially reiterated Morris's words
and another period of euphoria Debs
didn't happen to do it from a public
forum he did it from a jail cell where
he had been sent by Woodrow Wilson
because you didn't have the intelligence
to perceive the magnificence of Wilson's
idealistic wars but again it's proved
correct the gay 90's in the united
states just a century ago were such a
period a very brutal period in which it
seemed that the capital subjugation of
labor was total and there was no
democratic threat and no threat of
public organizing same was true of the
Roaring Twenties
and that was a period when
capitols clear subjugation of labor was
celebrated and the received opinion was
that this is finality and perfection and
it was achieved in a in what labor
historian David Montgomery at Yale calls
correctly a most undemocratic America it
was achieved by very brutal means state
violence and others but again it proved
wrong the 1930s there was large-scale
public activism and organizing and
pressure and finally the United States
which is the business run society par
excellence was driven more or less into
the mainstream of industrial society was
compelled to adopt social measures the
New Deal measures which in fact had been
achieved even in highly autocratic
European societies long long before
well again today what we hear is that
perfection and finality have been
reached in the devil take the hindmost
society all the same stories that have
been repeated for you know 170 years in
a cyclic fashion and there's no more
reason to believe it now than there ever
has been to believe it in the past and
that I think is the major thing that we
learn when you look at the history you
know since the beginning of the
Industrial Revolution well right now may
1996 is a quite a good moment to have a
close look at these things in particular
at the state of American democracy and
to ask where we are and what we can do
we've just been through the primaries
we're now moving on to the presidential
campaign and it's kind of interesting to
look at what at the primaries and see
what was there and what was missing it's
interesting distinction there were
things that were there and the primers
one thing that was there a plenty was
media coverage huge publicity another
thing that was there was money in fact
more money but there was only one
nomination contested remember not to
like
ninety-two nevertheless far more money
was spent in these primaries than in the
preceding ones despite the fact that
there was only one can't one nomination
contested so that's what was there
plenty of plenty of coverage plenty of
money more than ever before there were
also some things missing one thing that
was missing rather strikingly was voters
and the apart from the New Hampshire
primary where stunning 25 percent of the
electorate showed up in the other 11
primaries in which Robert dole won the
candidacy participation ranged from 3%
to 11% anyone with about a million votes
over the whole country that was noted in
the press which also noted the political
commentator The New York Times that such
voting as did take place in New
Hampshire and elsewhere was pretty
apathetic voters didn't seem to care and
they some of them showed up and made
some moves but in any event whatever was
going on it didn't seem to interest the
public very much a second thing that was
missing is missing is much of a
difference between the two candidates
who emerged from the process they're
both moderate Republicans both in
basically sort of inside the beltway
government insiders have been all their
lives and both representatives of the
business community not of the most
fanatic type but of the less fanatic
type so moderate Republicans and that's
been understood since from the beginning
by the by people with real power and
authority so a couple of months after
Clinton's election of the Wall Street
Journal had a lead article kind of
reviewing his performance
I was very upbeat it concluded that it
pointed out that Clinton had come down
on the same side as corporate America on
every major issue I quoted top CEOs
corporate executives of major
corporations we're very happy about his
performance described it as bed
an improvement over Reagan and Bush
that's they The Wall Street Journal did
find a few things that actually one
thing in this article that they thought
wasn't perfect there had been a
government regulation about recycling of
using of recycled paper or something
like that and they thought that was kind
of overdoing it radical but apart from
that he was just about perfect and an
improvement over Reagan and Bush well a
year later the business community
discovered in November 1994 that it
could do a lot better and by September
1995 Business Week main business journal
described the Engrish Congress as a
milestone for business never before have
so many goodies been showered so
enthusiastically on America's
entrepreneurs and given that kind of
servility to private tyranny the kind of
service that Clinton could perform
wasn't very impressive
and as a result support a lot of support
that by no means all of it shifted over
to these guys who were showering the
goodies when Brown was Ron Brown was
died in the plane accident a couple of
weeks ago The Wall Street Journal had a
headline which said that Brown had
worked tirelessly for US industry but
got little support from business in
return which is true they could do even
better so even though he was a tireless
advocate of the industrial of the
business community that wasn't enough by
1995 then the political system had
improved over 1993 and in 1996 business
now doesn't has to choose between two
leaders
one of whom consistently comes down on
their side and the other one
is the other end of the spectrum is
total sir bility to corporate power so
that's the spectrum in 1996 the Business
Week article reviewing this situation is
headlined back to the trenches meaning
they're showering goodies on America's
entrepreneurs in an unparalleled fashion
but it's not enough the feeding frenzy
has to continue so back to the trenches
and then comes kind of an interesting
wish list every element of which
satisfies the two properties I mentioned
before either transfer it involves
transfer of power to unaccountable
private institutions tyrannical
institutions to undermine the threat of
democracy or else they involve transfer
of wealth to try to bring to the United
States the structure of a third world
Society in effect or they do both as
many do so if you look at the measures
proposed run through the major ones the
primary one is regressive fiscal
policies for example elimination of tax
on their cutback of tax on financial
gains which are about half the income
for the top 1% of the population then
dropping off very sharply that's not
it's called tax cutting but of course
it's tax shift because it means somebody
else picks up the burden if the top 1%
doesn't pay on half of their income
somebody else is paying so it's a regret
it's a tax shift too from the very rich
to the poorer sectors of the population
the point is not to stimulate investment
that's Cantlie the reason for several
reasons one is that the country is just
awash in capital a huge amount of
capital around the profits that going
through the roof adding even more
putting even more money in the pockets
of the same rich people isn't going to
stimulate investment
what would stimulate in bed
is exactly the opposite stimulating weak
demand by putting more money in the
pockets of poor people but of course
that's the wrong move for social policy
for obvious reasons so a point number
one is cost is tax shifting regressive
fiscal measures which impose more of the
burden on those least able to pay and
benefits the super wealthy well the
second major measure that's advocated is
deregulation which again is a kind of
cost transfer so for example if you cut
down regulation of say toxic waste
disposal that does increase the profits
for industrial polluters but there's a
cost the cost is immediate in increase
in sewage and water rates and longer
term in health costs and of course the
unmeasurable costs transferred to future
generations but that's a regressive tax
ship that's a shift of it's a shift of
costs from the very wealthy to the poor
so the same kind of measure as a 19 do
with efficiency or anything like that
it's just shifting burdens tort reform
is exactly the same for obvious reasons
the health care reforms as they're
called instantly all of these things are
called reforms but whenever you hear the
word reform you should reach for your
pocket and make sure your wallet is
still there reform is a technical term
which means a particular kind of change
the kind that's advocated by the
powerful so for example Mao's Great Leap
Forward or Stalin's collectivization or
they're not called reforms they're
changes but they're not reformed so
reform is a propaganda term that means
the kind of change that is advocated by
the people who are in a position to
articulate their demands so turning on
the health reforms reforms should always
be with quote health reforms again are
very substantially a cost transfer
operation the there's a very respectable
group called the national leadership
coalition headed
by 2x presidents Ford and Carter
bipartisan coalition they estimated
recently that the current proposed
reforms amount to a hidden tax they
called it which they estimated at about
ten billion dollars a year in in in
decreased wages and increased premiums
now of course this is a highly
regressive tax that is it takes a far
bigger bite from poor people than from
rich people and other aspects of the
reform they also estimated that the same
reforms will increase the number of
uninsured by an additional eight million
by the year 2002 over the 54 46 million
already predicted as a result if as
things increase which again is a
regressive cost shift very regressive
one the same is true of the other
measures like closing public hospitals
or ensuring that decisions medical
decisions are not made by patients and
doctors but by pointy-headed bureaucrats
and insurance officers who have to
authorize things in advance knowing
nothing layer and layer of bureaucracy
plenty of costs but the costs are being
paid by the poor and being transferred
away from the rich or even turns into
income for them so health reform is
looked at economically as very largely a
cost shift operation and I think that's
correct same is true of things like what
are called the cutback of subsidies for
public services so for example New York
City in the state have cut what they
call subsidies to mass transit subsidy
is another funny term kind of like
reform it's odd to use the term subsidy
for the use of public funds for public
interest but anyhow that's called a sub
subsidy so they cut back the subsidies
to mass transit which has the obvious
effect namely it increases subway fares
and bus fares and so on well you know
who takes the subways and the buses
that's just a tax and this a regressive
tax same is true of the cutback
funding subsidies as they call it for
public education say public colleges and
so on that just decreases the services
increases the costs for the people who
use them which is just another hidden
tax the same is true of a major program
of in fact this is one of the driving
elements of the whole program which
Clinton and the when Clinton said it
Clinton and the Republicans agree on it
it's devolution that is removing of
decision-making power from the federal
to the state level it's what Clinton was
talking about when he says the year of
big government is over well what's the
point of that so it takes a block grants
and given to the states to administer
instead of the federal government what's
the point of that well it's called power
to the people and but that's pure
cynicism it's just a measure for taking
power away from people the the point is
the driving force behind it is that the
state governments are however the public
maybe involved in them they're just too
even middle sized business operations
can compel state governments to do what
they want so for example the same day
that the New York Times ran a big op-ed
on the philosophical difference between
those who want power and the federal
government and those who want power to
the people by block grants to the states
the same day The Wall Street Journal had
a story headlined what fidelity
investments wants fidelity investments
gets it described a threat by fidelity
which is the biggest financial company
in Massachusetts a threat that unless
the state of Massachusetts meaning us I
gave it even more showered even more
goodies on it they would simply move
across the border to Rhode Island where
they can sort of kick them in the face
and tell them to do what they want so of
course the conservative governor of
Massachusetts agreed and now even more
benefits are being given by taxpayers
the fidelity Raytheon did the biggest
manufacturer did the same thing around
the same time and in fact
businesses of that scale or even much
smaller have enough clout to get state
governments to do what they want I take
somebody like say GE or Microsoft to
push the federal government around in
the same way and therefore by moving
decision making and grants and so on
down to the state level you can be quite
sure that by various measures tax
measures others the money will end up in
the hands of the rich not in the hands
of the poor it's harder to guarantee
that when things happen at the federal
level and the same is true of every
other decision so a devolution is just
as a very natural thing to support if
you want to make sure that that actual
decision-making power is not in the
hands of people but is in the hands of
private tyranny that's exactly the
consequences it will have and so on
across the board well the Business Week
message back to the trenches that goes
out to the 23,000 corporate lobbyists in
Washington that's up from about 365 in
the 1960s before the big assault on the
population began the current assault the
number of corporate lawyers has
increased about the same proportions
these are part of major programs since
the early 1970s to overcome what was
called the crisis of democracy that is
the threat of democracy which developed
in the 1960s as usually apathetic and
passive sectors of the population forgot
their proper place and began to try to
enter the public arena that called a
crisis cause what was called a crisis a
democracy which has to be overcome by
restoring them and making sure that
power stays in the proper hands as with
another move towards perfection and
finality that same issue of business
week had a small item in the back which
said the following it said workers still
taking it on the chin with the share of
national income devoted the wages
hitting a post-war
well that's another step towards
perfection along with the milestone for
business showering goodies on America's
entrepreneurs and this right now is a
good time to have a look at that April
as many of you may know is the month
where the business magazines do a review
of the state of the economy and the
preceding year the state of the economy
from the point of view of business so
Business Week has its annual top 1,000
issue talks about the top 1,000
corporations fortune has its fortune 500
issue reviewing the top 500 corporations
they just had them and they were the
last couple of years they've been
running out of adjectives to describe
what's been happening you know dazzling
and stunning and so on have already been
used about the only one left for this
year was spectacular
Business Week describes its top 1,000
the headline as 1995 was one for the
books that most valuable corporations
increased in value by about 35% it's a
straight year of double-digit profit
growth doing particularly well are the
ones that are on the public dole like
aerospace which the public funds but it
becomes private profit their profits are
up 22% with a 5 percent increase in
sales and a 1 percent decline and
employment so that's really good another
part of the economy is just booming some
of the best corporations are those that
sell temporary workers like manpower
incorporated in Kelley their sales are
going way up
that's good that's part of creating
what's called a flexible labor market
that doesn't have such rigidities as
knowing when you go to sleep at night
you're going to have a job the next day
or you know
benefits or you know healthcare and that
sort of stuff which any good economists
can explain to you harms efficiency so
that's going way up real wages meanwhile
our flat probably a forty year record
the Census Bureau just came out with its
latest figures they now run through
nineteen ninety four that's the latest
data and the decline the decline in
median income from say 1989 to 1993 had
already been estimated about seven
percent right through a recovery which
is why I was interesting a big recovery
that stayed the same through 1994 so
eighty nine to ninety four seven percent
decline right through the recovery any
and that just extends what's been
happening through the eighties the
inequality has reached records
so both the Census Bureau and the RAND
Corporation recent study showed it's
long been unique in the industrial world
there's also unusually low social
spending spending on social benefits and
that has led to the highest poverty
rates by far in the industrial world
England's trying but they not quite up
to us
the OECD the organization of the rich
countries just issued a report pointing
out that the poorer sectors of the
population are significantly worse off
in the United States than in Europe
although it's a far richer country and
with unparalleled advantages again apart
from Britain which is called the success
story of Europe here for that reason
kind of a model that others should
follow well heading the list for the
Business Week top 1000 is General
Electric it describes their phenomenal
thirty two billion dollar rise in value
last year so they're right at the top of
the list again 38 percent of their
profits come from financial services and
another 38 percent come from Overson 38
percent not another come from overseas
General Electric of course has always in
in the last half-century been the
beneficiary of very substantial public
subsidies it's one of the top military
contractors and it's doing just terrific
these smaller players are also doing
pretty well for example if you go into
local bank of Boston office you can pick
up the handout for customers which
describes their incredible achievements
last year record profits for yet another
year such enormous profits that they
they're becoming one of the biggest the
biggest bank in Argentina one of the
biggest ones in the Southern Cone and
they quotes their chief economist as
saying that the economy is in excellent
shape has low growth high profits and
wages are as he puts it restrained which
is a kind of a nice way of saying that
they're continuing the decline since
this period of capital's clear
subjugation of labor began back around
late 70s 1980 the latest nobel
prize-winning
Prize winner in economics Robert Lucas
was interviewed by the Wall Street
Journal a couple months ago and he said
we're doing great and have been for a
long time the economy is just terrific
that's not an entirely original comment
that other people have said the same
thing for example general made it g the
neo-nazi ruler of brazil during a period
of an economic miracle when brazil had
achieved the status of what was called
the latin american darling of the
business community and the business
press thanks to ample use of terror and
torture and so on he pointed out that
the economy is doing fine but the people
aren't well a little more honest and
lucas but the same point so the united
states is also on its way to becoming an
economic miracle like brazil and mexico
and others like it even haiti which was
going to become the Taiwan of the
Caribbean a few years ago if you
remember that far back well let's turn
to another aspect of the current scene
namely attitudes I was a very heavily
polled society you know a lot about
public attitudes and they're interesting
over eighty percent of the population
now believes that the government is even
functioning that is the way the question
is asked that the government works for
the few and the special interest not
from for the people that's a question
that's asked every year on the Gallup
poll for a long time it ran at about
fifty percent saying that it shot up to
82 percent in the early 90s same
percentage described the Econo the
economy as inherently unfair same
percentage say that workers have too
little voice in public affairs and
economic and other affairs
more than 70 percent say that business
has too much power and is benefiting
more than consumers from deregulation
about two-thirds say that the American
Dream is getting harder to reach and in
what Businessweek by what Businessweek
calls a stunning majority of 95 to 5%
those are these are incidentally figures
you almost never get in polls by 95 to
5% of the population believes that
corporations should sacrifice profit for
workers and communities that really sent
the fear of God into them
well these such analyses of public
attitudes are perfectly consistent with
what you see at the primaries clearly
and they do suggest a certain conclusion
but it's not the conclusion that has
been drawn so for example the reporter
on business reporter who reported four
years ago that the the polls that came
from he reported a talk by the head of
the Harris polling organization which
pointed out that people were describing
that 83% of the population was
describing the economy as inherently
unfair with the rich getting richer and
the rich getting poorer
his analysis of that is that people are
angry at politicians
and want more power to the people not
more power to the government that's kind
of an intriguing description of the
observation that 83% of the population
described the economy as inherently
unfair but that interpretation / versus
that may sound makes a certain amount of
sense if you accept two basic principles
which indeed are the basic principles of
the propaganda system one is that the
government cannot in it's just
impossible for the government to serve
public interests
the government cannot be of work for and
by the people that's out of the question
and secondly the principle that private
power does not exist even though the
fortune 500 control of about two-thirds
of the domestic economy and much of the
world economy private power doesn't
exist so if you believe that like the
government is necessarily an enemy and
private power doesn't exist then you can
look at the conclusion that says
eighty-three percent of the population
thinks that the economy is inherently
unfair and these other observations and
the conclusion you draw is that people
are angry at politicians and they want
more power to the people not to the
government and there's a picture that
lies behind this the picture is a
picture of the social world is as one
with a conflict the government is the N
is two sides the government is the enemy
and on the other side is the people who
live together in harmony
and the people include the sober working
man his loyal wife maybe now the job
itself the hard-working business
executive who's toiling 18 hours a day
for the common good the friendly banker
who's looking for people to give money
to and so on all living together and
harmony working together and and the
whole thing kind of only disrupted by
big government which is the enemy and
then by kind of outsiders who disrupt
who are unemployed
riffraff like labor organizers and other
people like that well actually that is a
picture that's a picture that's been
crafted quite consciously by the public
relations industry and the entertainment
industry and a good deal of the popular
intellectual culture consciously crafted
from the 1930s when business was
terrified by the passage of the New Deal
legislation and described the business
press talked about the hazard facing
industrialists and the rising political
power of the masses and called on doing
something to overcome this and launched
a huge propaganda campaign really took
off after the Second World War
based precisely on these images which in
fact have persisted right until today in
the entertainment industry and
television and the business a good bit
of the culture and if you accept that
and that if you take that framework well
the conclusions that I just described
they're not not totally irrational well
it's kind of a tribute to the propaganda
system that when the dam finally broke
in 1996 and a quite cynical demagogue
was able to use a class conflict theme
for personal efforts of personal gain
picking up and mutilating traditional
attitudes of the left when that finally
happened there was great shock and alarm
it was kind of interesting to look at
the New York Times had a magazine story
which said that Buchanan has opened the
second front in the class war before
that he said the author said people had
been angry people people had been
expressing their anger in an approved
fashion in the first front of the class
war that is they were targeting welfare
families immigrants and beneficiaries of
affirmative action but now it seems
they're discovering something else
as investors owners you know even class
conflict I mean really exotic features
of the contemporary scene which hadn't
been noticed before but which these
strange people are finding and that's
kind of that's the second front in the
class war and now we've got some real
problems well years that had been tuned
to a little different part of the
spectrum could have made the discovery a
little before maybe twenty years earlier
and when for example it might have heard
the head of the UAW Doug Fraser
president UAW denouncing business in
1978 for fighting a one-sided class war
against working people the poor
minorities the defenseless and even many
in the middle classes could heard the
same message twenty years earlier in the
1950s when there still existed a rather
substantial labor press about eight
hundred newspapers reaching twenty
thirty million people a year before it's
been sort of wiped out by the fact that
the resources are all located elsewhere
same message fighting the offensive of
corporate America and indeed long before
all the way back to the origins the
Industrial Revolution but that's if
you're listening to different voices you
know not the ones that you're supposed
to listen to if you're well educated
Newsweek had a response also they were
where they were concerned that we're
entering a new blame era and the
articles pointed out are Co editorials
that people are confused and misguided
they don't understand this complicated
new world and misguided people that says
always look for malign forces to explain
their own failures and miseries
it used to be Catholics Jews and
immigrants now it's corporate executives
top-level managers investment bankers
and other movers and shakers and deal
makers in the burgeoning business
universe which ordinary people just
don't understand so they are
scapegoating these innocents just as
they scapegoated Jews and immigrants and
blacks in the past which kind
understandable but unfortunate went on
to say that it used to be
that people blamed big government for
their economic woes which is the right
thing like blaming welfare mothers but
now they're shifting their anger to big
business which is dangerous and it says
only the foolish would ignore the signs
and talks to its constituency
corporations are saying it's necessary
to become more responsible corporate
citizens the way the population thinks
by 20 to 1 or else there may be real
trouble notice this is just the usual
cycle now repeating standard cycle now
repeating exactly the comments I quoted
from Barron's earlier still it's
extremely interesting and very revealing
to look at the range of options that's
considered now that harmony has been
disrupted by misguided of misguided
public scapegoating these nice guys and
cynical politicians so now we have a
broader spectrum and the spectrum ranges
between two extremes one extreme says
that corporations the rulers the
corporate rulers should ruthlessly seek
profit period and the others say that
they should be more benevolent autocrat
that's the frame of reference
that's the spectrum and then you take it
your stand between those two extremes
well there are some things missing here
too so for example missing are the
thoughts of say Thomas Jefferson who
warned about what he called money in
corporations and banking institutions
which if allowed to develop he said
would undermine the democratic
revolution and return the country to
absolutism or alexis de tocqueville
a couple of years later who like other
people whose roots were in the
Enlightenment regarded equality of
condition not equality of opportunity
but equality of condition he's a
classical liberal and that was taken for
granted like Adam Smith and Jefferson
and others equality of condition was
something that was an essential feature
of adjusted society and essential for
democracy his topic
and he warned that the of the rise of
the manufacturing aristocracy in the
United States which he said is one of
the harshest that has ever existed I
said if they in fact get free reign that
will mean the end of democracy and a
condition of permanent inequality in the
United States or people like say John
Dewey America's leading social
philosopher in this century who made
similar points he said it's pointless to
talk about democracy you can't talk
about it seriously as long as you have
what he called a futile istic business
system meaning private power for private
profit running industry finance media
commerce and so on under those
conditions of Industrial feudalism
democracy can't really exist
politics will only be the shadow cast by
big business over Society so one has if
one anyone who believes in democracy
wants to have to dismantle Industrial
feudalism and move towards industrial
democracy by simply dismantling all
these structures which are illegitimate
totalitarian structures those are ideas
to go right back to the origins of
classical liberalism right through to
today they were standard in the working
class press 150 years ago not far from
here around these Eastern Massachusetts
where people were struggling against
what they called the new spirit of the
age gained wealth for getting all but
self that's the devil take the hindmost
Society of perfection which they
regarded as degrading and destructive of
dignity and freedom and culture and they
were not pleading with the new
manufacturing aristocracy to be more
benevolent they were simply denying its
legitimacy altogether they were denying
at any right to be either harsh or
benevolent held as did the whole
tradition that those who work in the
mills should own them and that they
should not be nicer to communities and
workers but rather they should disappear
like other
structures and democratic forms should
decide how to use and distribute
resources not plead with the autocrats
to be a little more benevolent well all
of that that is all I should say is
absolutely pure straight mainstream
America as American as apple pie all
without the benefit or harm
anyhow you look at it as radical
intellectuals just authentic American
tradition and absolutely part of the
real core of American history I haven't
been talking about exotic figures you'll
notice the but it's all missing all gone
the spectrum is much narrower the
spectrum now is we asked whether the
reigning autocrats should act more
kindly to their subjects and at the
extreme there are proposals that may be
public policy ought to bribe them to be
more benevolent by you know benefiting
those don't aren't so extreme and their
corporate greed
well if you look at the discussions of
its as well you know there are these
people with these strange radical ideas
we should bribe the autocrats to be more
benevolent but that's not welcome to
corporate America I'm quoting a recent
think piece on this and the Boston Globe
that's not welcome to corporate America
and Congress who are committed to free
markets to balance competing interests
that explains why Congress is in is
increasing the Pentagon budget which
transfers funds from the public to high
technology industry and in fact that's
it has been its major function since the
1950s which is why one of the reasons
why it doesn't Pentagon spending doesn't
decline in fact it's going up
despite the disappearance of the
Russians but that doesn't interfere with
the fact that they're all committed to
free markets to balance competing
interests and we can go on and on all of
this has to do with something else that
is as unthinkable as the idea that
private autocracies are illegitimate a
truism right through
mainstream American history but it's
also unthinkable that private power is
not committed to free markets in fact
never has been what it's been committed
to is something quite different what you
might call you know really existing free
market doctrine which is fine for you
you know but not for me except for
temporary advantage
I need the protection of the nanny state
that has been the major the unwavering
position of free-market enthusiasts ever
since the doctrines were developed in
the early 19th century the and it's
right it's not just the United States
it's everywhere so there was a recent
study of the top 100 financial top
hundred transnationals in the fortune
list of transnationals top hundred of
them it turned out that all 100 had
benefitted from the state industrial
policies of the country in which they're
located meaning public support subsidy
of one kind and twenty of the hundred
had been safe from total destruction
simply by public bailouts when they got
into trouble that's the top hundred
transnationals most of them are American
but it's all over the world of course
well there's no need to explain all of
this sort of thing to people like saying
grits or the Heritage Foundation or the
Reaganites they've understood it quite
well which is why for example the
Reaganites massively increased in fact
doubled protection for clothe basically
closed off the American market to
prevent allow and and provided public
funds to allow the steel industry and
the semiconductor industry and other
major industries to survive auto
industry and they in fact introduced
more tariffs more protective measures
than all preceding post-war
administrations combined and it's not
necessary to explain it to Newt Gingrich
who's
happens to be the country's leading
welfare freak he brings more federal
subsidies to his
rich constituents in Cobb County Georgia
than any suburban county in the country
outside the federal system or to the
Heritage Foundation who plans the
Republican budget and is calling for
increase in the Pentagon budget
understanding perfectly well how this
system works for them
the lessons are all clear it's the
public who's not supposed to understand
just as it's not supposed to understand
that there might be some something
outside the spectrum of pleading with
the autocrats to be more benevolent or
just saying well you know ruthlessly
seek profit let's go back to the
primaries and take another look at what
was missing which is again revealing in
more detail one of the striking things
that was missing in the primaries from
the very beginning was Phil Gramm that
was noticed by The Wall Street Journal
which pointed out that Graham's
well-funded campaign was the first one
to collapse and it also pointed out that
he this is kind of striking because he
was the one presidential standard bearer
for the congressional Republicans but he
was wiped out instantly despite the fact
that he was well funded and was making
all the right noises The Wall Street
Journal called this the cruelest irony
of the campaign another Wall Street
Journal article pointed out that Newt
Gingrich and the contract with America
were uh Nall most unmentioned in the
primaries well none of this will come as
any surprise to people who've been
following public opinion polls public
opinion studies in 1994 when the
Congressional Conservatives won the
great revolution about 60% of the
population
wanted social spending to increase by
about 6 to 1 the population wanted
Pentagon's opposed increase of Pentagon
spending in contrast 60% won at social
spending to increase well that they did
exactly the opposite Clinton's first
response to the elections with the
increased Pentagon spending and start
cutting social spending and the
congressional Republicans just
I did it and so it's continued right
through since 1994 over overwhelming
public objection so it's not through
surprising that the politicians students
they had to leave the Beltway and face
what Alexander Hamilton once called the
Great Beast and with the public soon as
they had to do that they dropped their
agenda like a hot potato that's no cruel
irony but just simple realism as is the
fact that they're still pursuing the
agenda while nobody's looking again as
before no irony just realism the most
dramatic example of this pointed out by
a number of commentators was the budget
remember that just a few weeks before
the right before the primary started the
biggest item the most important item in
the world was balancing the budget it
closed the government a couple of times
the only discussion that was going on
was as to whether we ought to do it in
seven years or maybe a couple of months
longer but that the top priority must be
balancing the budget was unquestioned
all of a sudden politicians have to face
the Great Beast and there's no more talk
about balancing the budget disappear
quickly Wall Street Journal had a
headline saying that the voters
apparently have abandoned their
obsession with the budget with budget
balancing their obsession with budget
balancing was strong opposition to it
under any realistic conditions as had
continually been pointed out right
through this whole period
well again though cruel irony the but
simple realism to be honest it should be
mentioned that some percentage of the
public did share the obsession of both
political parties with balancing the
budget namely 5 percent that was about
the 5 percent of the public thought that
balancing the budget was the highest
priority exactly the same percent felt
that homelessness was the highest
priority but the 5 percent who thought
that balancing the budget was the
highest priority happened to in
business leaders and business we ran a
poll of CEOs which came out with a
conclusion American business speaks
balance the budget that was their
conclusion and when American business
speaks the political class listens and
the commentators report and so on and if
misguided people thought that they
opposed balancing the budget under
realistic conditions as they were
telling people taking polls if they
really thought that they could say tune
in to NPR the ultra liberal source of
knowledge and insight where all things
considered explain to them that
Americans voted for a balanced budget
and wanted the budget balanced even at
the cost of education cutbacks and
health cutbacks and so on that's exactly
contrary to the polls which consistently
were saying the exact opposite well
again it's not surprising that all this
stuff falls off the screen as soon as
it's necessary to face the great beast
in the public arena even if most of them
are staying home the standard story
since 1994 in November 94 has been that
the Gingrich free-market enthusiasts are
pursuing the poll-driven contract with
America in our pluralistic democracy
because that's the way it works it's
been obvious from the beginning that
this is total fraud at least anyone who
looked at the polls and now it's we
don't argue about it anymore because
it's conceded at least in the business
press the the delete the pollster for
the Gingrich pollster you know from the
guy who does the polls for them Frank
Luntz is his name he gave a press
conference in which he was asked you
know how come you keep telling us that
your polls show that the public supports
all ten parts of the contract when the
polls we look at say that they posed him
and he said look he said we're not we're
not when I give you the numbers saying
you know this is the percentage that
favor thee you know these items in the
contract with America I'm not talking
about their
they're content I'm talking about the
slogans in which they're packaged so the
way it works he explained is that we
take focus groups and we ask them you
know what like take say health we ask
people what would you do you want the
health system dismantled everybody
doesn't early you know even reduced no
everybody hates it
but you ask people do you want the
health system preserved and strengthened
and made viable for the next generation
and then everybody thinks that slogans
fine
so as we proceed to dismantle the health
system we call it preserving and
strengthening the health system for the
benefit of the next generation and
that's what I was telling it's the
slogans they like the packaging not the
not not the substance substance of
course they oppose well okay since the
point is now conceded we don't have to
debate it anymore
the only thing we should notice is that
all of this is extremely natural in a
business run society that is a society
based very extensively on manipulation
and deceit what's called marketing and
that's what it is it's the creation of
artificial wants the you know the
marginalization of people the you know
changing their attitudes and so on and
that's not a small amount incidentally
the latest academic study I've seen
estimates that about a trillion dollars
a year spent in the United States just
on marketing
it's about 1/6 or 1/7 of gross domestic
product being some a lot of that
straight propaganda and the point of it
is also explained very frankly the
leading manual of the public relations
industry back in the 1920s incidentally
written by a good roosevelt kennedy
liberal and much respected says that
what he calls the conscious and
intelligent manipulation of the
organized habits and opinions of the
masses is the essence of democracy and
it is the responsibility of the
intelligent minorities to carry out that
manipulation yeah that's right and
that's echoed by leading wilsonian and
other intellectuals and
indeed is the essence of democracy as
understood and under those conditions
with huge amount of effort going into
marketing and what's called the
everlasting battle - for the minds of
men who must be indoctrinated with the
capitalist story and so on I'm quoting
business leaders when that is the
guiding principle and democracy is
considered the great threat it's not too
surprising that you should have what I
just described well there's nothing new
about this maybe something new maybe the
scale is new or maybe the brazenness of
all of it but you know even here one
begins to wonder so when the Reaganites
we're talking about free markets you
have to assume that this was
tongue-in-cheek I mean it was so obvious
that they were undermining market
principles but in their domestic
policies while ramming them down the
throats of anyone defenseless over
Caesar at home that the commentary on
this hard to imagine that it was serious
but you know by now one begins to wonder
actually so let me take a couple of
recent examples now and with this The
Wall Street Journal had a lead article a
couple of weeks ago in which it compared
the business it talked about various
states and the different strategies
they're taking to become more business
friendly and to attract entrepreneurs
and it picked as its example to States
as lead story pick Virginia and Maryland
and it talked about you know the
slightly different strategies and
described them and so on and compared to
said Virginia is doing better you know
better strategy more business-friendly
well actually turns out when you look it
wasn't Virginia in Maryland
it was the suburbs of Washington some of
which happened to be in Virginia and
some happened to be in Maryland and the
suburbs of Washington the states had
indeed picked different strategies for
the suburbs of Washington state of
Maryland decided had took a gamble that
thought the big growth area for the
suburbs of Washington would be in the
biology based industries which are
funded by the National
of Health and you know other federal
agencies that pour money into biology
based industry Virginia on the other
hand had staked its bets on the
traditional cash cow the Pentagon system
so therefore was focusing on high-tech
industry telecommunications you know
information processing and so on and
that it turned out to be a better
decision they had made a better guess
about the choices facing entrepreneurs
The Wall Street Journal pointed out and
the choices facing entrepreneurs turn
out to be which public funds to loot and
Maryland made a bad decision because
more public funds were being poured into
this other sector of the economy so
Virginia is the winner and this in
creating a business friendly environment
in this way the that's gone too far
Affairs leading International Affairs
journal current issue has an article by
Dean of the Kennedy School at Harvard
who points out that the American
diplomacy has a new weapon which hasn't
been given enough enough you know hasn't
been recognized enough a force
multiplier he says that's the attraction
of the American of American democracy in
free markets many spells it out cold war
investments enabled us industry to
dominate telecommunications information
processing and other emerging
technologies so how did cold war
investment through that well by public
fund and in fact and the public funds
that were that are in fact a subsidy to
industry presented under the guise of
security and that is conscious deception
we know that from the public record back
to the 1940s when the Truman
administration pointed out that the word
to use is not subsidy the word they use
is security when you want to have the
government intervene to maintain
advanced sectors of industry which as
the business press made clear simply
cannot survive in a competitive
unsubsidized free enterprise economy so
the government has to be the savior but
under the guise of security
not subsidy so what we're learning from
the Dean of the Kennedy School is that
it's a tribute to democracy in markets
when the public is tricked into
subsidizing the rich under the guise of
security great tribute to markets and
democracy companion article by a Boston
international lawyer points out says
that the road to market reforms
discusses a right-wing libertarian group
that discovered that the road the market
reforms is Silicon Valley and Route 128
and it goes on to talk about their
entrepreneurial values and their
universities and so on unmentioned is
the fact that both of them crucially
depend on huge public subsidies through
the whole Pentagon system including the
OE and NASA and so on
well what all this just illustrates is
that the concept the free enterprise has
simply come to mean that the public pays
the costs and the public assumes the
risks anything goes wrong then you get
the bailouts and that's free enterprise
as long as the profits are privatized
and as long as you can and then quite
naturally you want to shift
decision-making in the from the public
arena where maybe the public could
influence it over to the private
tyrannies where they can't influence at
all well that's kind of you know that's
pretty much the essence of public policy
in the ideology behind it I'll give one
last example from the liberal New Yorker
where Thomas Cassiday writes a pretty
good or has pretty good article he also
discovered you know the woes of the
American middle-class how they're
suffering and he goes on describe it
pretty accurately and then ends up
saying it's nobody's fault
it's what the free market has decided
and it's infinite and mysterious wisdom
and then politicians have to wake up and
just accept the fact that nothing can be
done about what or what amount the laws
of nature and he even mentions a couple
of corporations in this study in fact
three dimensions three corporations
McDonnell Douglas Grumman and Hughes I
mean all paradigm example
of publicly subsidized private profit
corporations that demonstrates what the
free market has decided in its infinite
and mysterious wisdom which makes about
as much sense as when Clinton announced
his grand vision for the free market the
future too much applause in a hangar of
the Boeing Corporation picking Boeing as
the chief leading model of the grand
vision of the free market future I mean
couldn't pick a better example of a
corporation wouldn't even exist unless
the public was pouring public funds into
it you take a plane somewhere you're
flying a modified bomber including the
metal metallurgical metallurgy and the
avionics and everything else well or
takes a newt Gingrich whose favorite
example of free enterprise is Lockheed
you know this one is even more extreme
because that one was actually bailed out
it was going to collapse but the
Reaganite supported funds into it
salvaging okay that's free enterprise
well again none of this stuff is
particularly new the British were
playing the same games before the United
States even came along imposing free
market rules by force on India which be
industrialised it while heavily
protecting their own markets and
contracted constructing a very powerful
state which is how they industrialized
same policies were followed by their
former colonies as soon as they
liberated themselves and so it goes on
up till the present and as I mentioned
perfection and finality have often been
proclaimed in the course of in the
course of all of this
always wrongly well there with all the
sordid continuities and they're really
ugly I think it's still possible to
perceive overtime significant if slow
progress so popular struggles today to
reverse these tendencies and move
forward they start from much higher
ground than they did say in the gay 90's
or the Roaring Twenties or even there
years ago today you don't have to try to
gain workers rights or social security
or medical some level of medical care
you have to protect it okay that and
advance it that's a big step forward and
state the violence that's used to
suppress popular struggle is
considerably lower than it was in the
past that can't it cannot be mobilized
as it was in the past and so on popular
attitudes have changed they start from
somewhere else well that's progress and
there's no more reason than there ever
has been in the past to believe that
somehow we're constrained by mysterious
and unknown laws not just decisions that
are made in human institutions decisions
that are subject to human will as is the
existence of the institutions themselves
as has always been true in the past
[Applause]
[Music]
hi I'm Logan Patrick with a New England
Central America Network in a few moments
we're gonna let you ask a few question
I'm going to turn it over to them and
they're going to be able to take your
questions for dr. Chomsky thanks guys
we're gonna have a brief question and
answer period because of the time it's
just going to be short Gail and I are
going to go out into the audience with a
microphone so dr. Chomsky can better
hear you
[Music]
first thing I would suggest is that you
take a careful look at the facts because
they've been very much misrepresented
there are some good academic studies of
them starting with the nation at risk
study of the Reagan administration back
in the early 80s there's been a steady
falsification of the record about
American education in fact it has plenty
of problems but most of what said about
is indeed fabrication there's a good one
good recent academic study that came out
too surveying the evidence the reason
for the fabrication is quite obvious
it's part of the effort to undermine
support for public education by making
it appear as if it can't fit it can't
work so therefore we've got to move over
to some privatized system which will be
just like privatized health reform or
any other deregulation and so on private
transportation in a way of subsidizing
the rich at the expense of the poor so
point number one is have a look at the
facts the fact that they appeared in was
a USA Today or some US News and World
Report that's not sufficient take a look
back and check what they actually say
what they actually say as far as I'm
aware is that the that there has been a
steady increase in the success of the
public education system and it's more or
less you know you get what you pay for
essentially it's the United States has
more of the population
attending school at the higher levels
way more than most countries and has
worse much worse education than other
industrial countries at the lowest
levels just as no daycare centers and so
on and you get the effects of that that
you would expect but the answer is I
think it's clear what the answer is put
more public resources into what's needed
by the public mainly education I wish I
remembered the name of the book that I
have in mind but if you if you're
interested in if you drop me a note I'll
give you the reference no can't remember
the name got one
I
[Music]
that's a big question and I'll only try
to say a couple of words about it and as
far as the Indian in the the the big
debate in India now is whether to
proceed with what are called reforms
that is structural adjustment
neoliberalism opening up the markets you
know kind of like here should you
proceed with what are called reforms and
this is called some new departure for
India in fact it's not a new departure
it's about three centuries old a good
part of the reason why India is India
and England is England is that these
reforms were rammed down India's throat
by the British in the 18th century
Britta from 1600 1800 right Lee right
about then India was the world's leading
manufacturing center and not just
textiles but I was producing for example
as much iron as all of Western Europe
and India was you can argue about
whether India would have had an
industrial revolution or not you know
nobody knows enough to say but what we
do know is that India was impoverished
turned into a poor agrarian society and
the industrialized by the imposition of
neoliberal reforms while England
protected its industry massively had
huge tariffs against Indian imports and
in fact wouldn't even let the insist of
force of British goods into India and so
on and that continued right through the
laissez-faire period well those are big
factors in why the countries are
different in fact if you ask why it's
it's even interesting to compare the
United States and India it sounds like a
funny comparison until you look more
closely and you find that it's not funny
at all the same years as the American
Revolutionary War 1980 1775 to 973 1775
to 1783 in those same years England was
fighting a big war the anglo-maratha war
in India it's hard for Americans to
remember this but the Revolutionary War
was kind of a sideshow
as far as England was concerned it was
big international war going on
between England and France and other
major countries and for England one big
piece of it was an Indian another big
piece here right at the same time they
were mainly fighting France and in India
local it was a standoff with a local
military force though England later
conquered India here England for what
kind of reasons was compelled to the
part and the United States could then
follow the same course that England
followed the United States became you
know the leading developmental state the
very high protective tariffs state
intervention crushed everybody in its
way very much as England had done and
ended up being an industrial society
India couldn't follow that course so the
New England textile industry around the
1820s according to the few studies by
economic historians not something people
study much apparently about half of it
would have been destroyed instantly if
they had dropped the protective tariffs
when the railroad boom came along at the
end of the century the United States in
the policy required that you use
American steel blocking
cheaper and better British steel India
could have produced railroad say
locomotives in fact Bombay was producing
locomotives perfectly competitively the
bridge wouldn't allow it
rich forst British steel in the India
and so it goes so you get a big
difference well that's neoliberal
policies the question whether they ought
to be instituted today is you know you
have to judge it on its own merits but
there's nothing new about it it's
through there's three centuries of
Indian history that bear on the question
and much else as for elites well you
know it's not a hundred percent of
course but the overwhelming position of
attitude of a leets is like everywhere
they are in favor of and that's not
surprising they benefit from them just
as here so for example when reforms are
instituted here say people at my income
level benefit I'm sure without checking
that I gained economically from the
Reagan years
well median real wages were going down
just because of you know where people
like need stand and the income level the
health reforms will presumably have the
same fact taxes for the wealthy will go
down services for the poor will also go
down and the costs will be transferred
over to the poor so it's and so it goes
across the board so it's not there and
that's the way it's been since the first
such experiment was carried out in India
in 1793 you know the permanent
settlement which had exactly the effect
of enriching the land owners and local
elites and devastating the domestic
population well the fact that elites
supportive is not terribly surprising
and they typically have tended to do
that not just in India and in the United
States but all over the world they tend
the support that people tend to support
policies which will benefit themselves
so yeah one of the effects of structural
adjustment and neoliberalism and all the
way back to the 18th century is that the
people who are designing the experiments
invariably come out very well and that
includes the intellectual elites who
justify them on the other hand the
experimental animals who incidentally
don't sign consent forms they typically
take it in the chin you know they may
some they may gain incidentally but
that's not the goal and often they
suffer well that having been said you
know not a lot is understood about these
matters there really aren't isn't honest
economists will tell you most of the
factors in economic development just
aren't understood so for example about
two-thirds of the rise and per capita
income in the United States over the
years that's the best studied case about
two-thirds of it is attributed to what's
called the residual which means what we
don't understand at all
you know and that's the best studied
case so one has to approach these things
with a certain diffidence nevertheless
there are historical lessons and I think
you can draw some conclusions about them
you have to look at it in terms of the
present contingencies but I don't think
the general not
Universal but general attitude of a
lease is terribly surprising if you ask
who's gonna be gained who's gonna lose
same as here how's India changed in the
last year as well you know significantly
so for example domestic production
domestic manufacturing in the last few
years one of the effects of the reforms
just in the last few years has been it's
been it's brought in a lot of foreign
investment the so-called reforms plus of
course why investors like it but it's
not productive investment it's mostly
speculation and what else there is is
taking over the commercial market so you
get American brand names all over the
place well that instead of Indian
produced manufacturers which are just as
good you know that's no contribution to
the health of the economy it's great for
the for the Western investors and the
local elites who are associated with
them the ten the advertising has shot up
in India in the last couple of years a
huge boom in advertising the ten leading
in the Indian advertisers are now
subsidiaries of multinationals meaning
they're basically foreign advertisers
and they do exactly what you'd expect
they advertise they use their huge
resources to advertise Western brands to
try to undercut Indian brands and you
see that all over you know you see that
and you can't miss that as you Walker
you know I mean at least if you're if
you're if you're part of the
overwhelming majority in India who are
too poor for this to matter well fry
they don't see it and but if you're part
of the what they call the middle class
is you know that little sector that's
supposedly gaining from the reforms yeah
you see it and there are a lot of other
changes like that The Wall Street
Journal had an interesting article there
was one today and there was another one
a couple days ago on the current
election that's going on which more or
less tells the story they what they said
is people in India have gained from the
reforms but the voters don't seem to
understand that they're in
voting for the party that brought them
the reform some another confusion of
these stupid people who have been so
confused since the 1820s when they
failed to see the obvious how much you
gain when other people are enriched and
you get poor really hard for people to
get that through their head somehow and
it's showing up again in the elections
but there's a lot more to say you know
in these a big complicated rich country
and a little bit of it even a little bit
I understand would take a long time to
discuss better than winning the raffle
what several things call themselves that
which one do you mean the militia
militia type patriot movie yeah because
there are others do okay
[Music]
well I don't think they're like being
run by the CIA or anything like that I
think they're kind of very spontaneous
you know coming out of things which
first of all have their roots in
American history and have their roots in
the current scene
it's the militias are just in this
so-called Patriot movement is just one
ask notice first of all that their
slogans are very much like what the
whole propaganda system has been trying
to remedy our heads for 50 years the
government is the enemy and private
power doesn't exist okay now it's
obvious why big corporations who are
fighting the everlasting battle for the
minds of men would want that to be the
picture you have if the government is
your enemy and you can let's say when
people when 83% of the population think
the economic systems unhear n't leon
fair that's supposed to mean
they're angry at the government if you
can take that view then those who run
the private institutions are quite
well-off there's no threat of democracy
they can run things peacefully the
people are demoralized and the normal
weapon the normal methods of democratic
participation to gain social ends are
excluded so it makes good sense for
corporate propaganda which means most of
what we see in here makes a good sense
for it to be trying to stress the
message that the government is the enemy
and that and destress in fact eliminate
from sight the fact that private power
exists government is the enemy everybody
is in harmony that's been the message
well the militias just take that a step
further you know they kind of take it to
its logical extension yeah okay
government's the enemy let's blow up the
Federal Building okay so in a sense
they're kind of hearing the
indoctrination and taking it literally
well it also has deeper roots in
American history but apart from that
remember that it's just this is a very
culprit in society the militias are cold
and they're only one and by
means a major one the civil society has
pretty much collapsed in the United
States um people are isolated they're
atomized they they don't believe in the
political system and they don't take
part in it
they don't organize in other ways the
unions are very weak which have been the
leading democratizing force in most of
modern history this kind of constructive
civil society has been very much
demolished it's kind of striking to
compare the richest country in the world
the United States with the poorest
country in the Western Hemisphere namely
Haiti which has where you know peasants
and people in the slums and so on did
construct and have sustained amazingly a
very lively vibrant civil society with
grassroots organizations and unions and
all sorts of things and had an effect I
mean they got their own president into
office well that conception of democracy
has been knocked out of people's heads
here we could do well to go to the
Haitian slums and try to learn something
about what democracy is but here it's
kind of it has been very much dissolved
people feel lonely isolated atomized you
know me and the tube they don't do
anything with anyone else the normal
methods of interchange and constructive
action like for example unions or
political organizations barely are very
weak by comparative standards well how
do people react to that well one of the
reasons ways they react is people just
don't give up you know they form other
ways of associating and the other ways
of associating are often extremely
irrational so the United States is a
deeply fundamentalist country if you
look cross culturally you know at the by
and large a fundamentalist commitment
you know like it's a literal belief in
the devil you know or belief that the
world has created 10,000 years ago that
kind of thing that the beliefs of that
nature tend to decline as
industrialization increases
industrialization education as long as
they increase those beliefs tend to
decline and it's a pretty close
correlation the United States is off the
spectrum it's like a poor devastated
peasant Society after
the Black Plague or something at in its
level of fundamentalist commitment and
that's an overwhelming fact like half
the population thinks that the world was
created ten thousand years ago no you
just don't find that anywhere in the
world you know and there's all sorts of
cults of this kind there on the left -
like a very large part of the left is
deeply immersed in completely mad ideas
about weird conspiracies as to you know
who killed Kennedy or something or what
the Federal Reserve is doing or
something like that I mean these are you
know strange cults that do arise in
devastated societies they were true of
Europe after the Black Plague for
example and we find a lot of that in the
United States I think that's a
reflection of the dissolution of
functioning civil society and
constructive ways of responding the
militias are just one piece of it and
they happen to be picking out the major
theme of the propaganda system you can't
say they invented it that's exactly what
people are told all the time yeah
government's the enemy you can't do
anything through the political system
because it's your enemy so therefore let
us we and run the private system let us
run everything and don't bother us okay
it's essentially what they're doing
they're not inventing it they're just
exaggerating something that has been the
primary theme of propaganda for 50 years
and doing it in a way which you can kind
of understand in a dissolving society
where there's plenty of other and in
fact much bigger and more I think more
dangerous cults development well you
know all of that can be reversed it's
happened in the past and it's been
reversed unions were much worse off in
the 1920s and they barely existed and
then in the 1890s I mean I didn't they
exist they were being you know people
trying to organize we're simply being
murdered by security forces fact that
went on into the 1930s here okay things
are better than they were no but it can
be recovered the way it's been recovered
in the past that's why we live in a
better country than the
was sixty years ago much better than it
was a hundred years ago
okay keep doing but I don't think the
seems to me the militias are kind of
like a fringe of a much broader
phenomenon
I mentioned the positive one we're way
better off than we were 30 years ago
like takes a takes a health care okay
in the 1960s that's not long ago the
problem was to try to institute some
limited measure of of health service for
the general population we didn't have it
okay now we have something you know it's
like it's not the kind of yes but well I
don't agree with that did you compare
Europe it's just you know it's their
different dimensions like if you compare
it on the level of health care yeah
we're going nowhere if you compare it on
the level of say individual freedom I
think we're way beyond them all right
can take say something take an
institution takes a university okay
since we're two College American
universities aren't comparably better
than any others in the world not only do
they bring in way more people a much
larger part of the population goes to
college and university but they also get
you know better a better education it's
kind of striking when you teach in an
American University
you know when if you compare students at
the high school at the graduation from
high school level the ones in the United
States aren't at the same level as the
Europeans and Japanese compare them four
years later they're at the same level no
we're not just doing that I mean we're
doing a lot of things that's right so
European working standards are excited
from England or better that's one
respect in which there are things to
gain in the United States but there are
plenty of respects in which the United
States is better you know you there's no
it's not like there's a you know it's a
list and and but the point the relevant
question is how do we stand as compared
with where we were okay and we're a lot
better off in the 1960s for example
that's it take something like protection
of freedom
speech I think it's terribly important
to thing the United States is just way
better than any other country I know of
in this respect and that was mostly one
in the 1960s up until the 1960s we were
pretty much like Europe there was no
real guarantee for freedom of speech
that was one in the course of the civil
rights struggle if you look back at the
Supreme Court rulings the same is true
of lots of other things can I make one
last optimistic comment let me mention
something that's pretty recent which you
know which doesn't get talked about much
and it's relevant to the appeal that was
just made the Central America solidarity
movements in the United States in the
1980s are something which never existed
in Europe in its whole ugly vicious
imperial past and present and never
existed in the United States until the
1980s namely large-scale massive public
movements way beyond anything in the
1960s deeply rooted in the mainstream
which were actually engaging themselves
in the lives and struggles directly
participating of people who were under
attack from the imperial power I mean no
one in Europe ever dreamed of that nor
was it dreamed of here during the
Indochina Wars but it was pretty
straight it was pretty common in Main
Street America you know very mainstream
American society in the 1980s well
that's a reflection of extremely healthy
elements in American society and culture
and they shouldn't be denigrated
[Music]
[Applause]
I'll always see how the different parts
of the movement connect each other for
you people are science fiction fans
sometimes it's almost as if we're each
in our own little dimension we're really
standing right side by side with each
other and were separated only by the
smallest moment of time or awareness to
realize that we are connected with each
other but sometimes we do break through
and and we get that sense of feeling for
me I think one of the times recently
when I've really thought that we were
part of the same movement was during the
Gulf War and I saw Springfield and
Western Mass in fact come together and
organized in a way that I haven't seen
de round many other issues student
groups African American groups social
justice groups like arise low-income
groups you name it and we knew that what
was happening in the Gulf affected us
and we really understood when the war
was going on what it was all about
unfortunately when the war changed
focused and I won't say ended but when
the war changed focus we lost our focus
when the war switched to an economic
front instead of a very obvious body
count that we could see on the media
every day well it seemed as if we
weren't needed anymore
if the desire for unity sort of
dissipated and yet we still have an
embargo in Iraq against Iraq that's
causing devastating loss of life for
people in Iraq we have our own veterans
who are trying out for media attention
as they try to deal with the Gulf War
Syndrome but because the battle is on an
economic front it doesn't seem as real
to us even and this
anything happened in Central America
when the troops pulled out and it became
an economic war instead it was harder to
see and the same thing is happening here
in this country but we tend not to
notice that and yet we have to trust our
ability to my name is Michael and Busey
and I'm a board member of arise for
social justice and also a member of the
New England Central America Network
that's two of the organizations that you
have to thank for putting this together
but also here at Springfield College the
Newman community the office ministries
and New Horizons in Haiti you know some
people said that we couldn't draw a
crowd or fill a hall in Springfield for
noam chomsky that there wouldn't be
enough people
I know that most of you are here for one
reason only and that's to hear mr.
Chomsky give his analysis of power and
what's happening in our community and of
course that's a big reason we're here
but we have a number of other reasons
for hosting this event in Springfield
and also one of them is because this is
a fundraiser and you will hear more
about that as the evening goes on but
really the main reason that we wanted to
have this event in Springfield is
because we want a chance to keep
building on the sense of community and
the sense of movement that we feel here
in Springfield and in Western Mass we
want a chance to start developing a
really good analysis of what it will
take to have social and economic justice
in this country and we want to build
unity here because we are part of a
movement even though we may not always
realize that I'm struck that most of us
in creative writing classes have been
told that when we're writing a paper we
need to get rid of the passive voice so
we're used to speaking about the
movement we have to remember that you
don't have a movement without moving
without going someplace and that's what
we're doing but sometimes we don't
realize it we can get very myopic we can
get very short-sighted we can think well
we're working on our issue we're working
for our constituency and we do invite
people to sit up on the stage if they'd
like they can come up on the stairway
over here
there's more room up here
are there still more people in the
hallway now
just push those out of the way all right
this is you can sit there if you like oh
please barb God
of my time
okay I want to have a seat right though
okay good evening I'm Jeff Frankel a
senior at Springfield College and a
pre-law student delighted to be part of
tonight's lecture program and also
delighted to have been chosen as the
student was to introduce our guest
speaker this evening why am i delighted
a person like our guest speaker dr. Noam
Chomsky is one who has the intelligence
knowledge and the ability to articulate
in such a way to influence us all for
those who are open to his vision and
perspective in life he challenges the
college student in the academic alike
and his or her future views on man and
society dr. Chomsky is a man who has
helped shape my views and I hope that
this part of my education will make a
difference in my future law school
studies the Newman community of
Springfield College the office of campus
ministry arise for social justice and
the New England Central American network
proudly present Noam Chomsky this
evening professor Chomsky will be
speaking and I do believe that for many
years when I struggled to be a part of
the movement for social justice
primarily within the peace movement and
the anti-nuclear movement but I never
really felt like I was building an
analysis that worked toward unity and it
wasn't actually until I started meeting
and organizing with my own peers and
started coming from my own experience as
a low-income person as a woman and as a
single mother and working with other
people like myself that that analysis
started to come and one of the first
things we did was learned to ask the
question who benefits from our
oppression and once we started getting
some answers to that question then we
could ask the next question who are our
allies in the movement who do we have
social justice
economic justice in common with who do
we need to work with and come together
with and this really came full circle
for me when I had a chance to go to
Nicaragua in 1993 and I remember being
very moved by the depth of the
commitment and struggle of the
Nicaraguan people and I said to one of
the organizers there what can we
possibly do in the US to make a
difference in Nicaragua and what I was
told was you go home and you work for
social and economic justice in your own
country you turn up the heat you demand
social and economic justice and by doing
that you will help us here in Nicaragua
to achieve the same so our job is to
build those connections and to do it at
home that was a really full circle
feeling for me if we're going to build a
movement and really see ourselves as
part of a movement you who are here
tonight need to be connected to
everything that is what's happening when
you walked in these doors the different
community groups the organizations like
cafe habitat which is providing organic
coffee and at the same time a livelihood
for homeless people American Friends
Service Committee if I start naming all
of them I'm bound to lead someone out so
I won't do that but it's very important
for you to go out and be connected with
those groups otherwise it'll be a little
bit like going to a wedding for the food
and forgetting to say oh I'm here
the sense of community and commitment to
community that that we would ordinarily
bring to that event now I don't want to
be right people too much.this when I
look around
room I see a tremendous number of
tireless social justice activists people
from our community who've worked very
hard together all I want to say is that
history is on our side but only if we do
the right thing and the right thing is
happening here as much as anywhere else
that it might happen so I thank you for
coming I'm going to turn this over to J
Franco and don't forget don't leave
without signing a petition for freedom
for leonard peltier signing a letter to
get Mumia abu-jamal and a new trial and
making every possible connection that
you can make because we're the movement
where where it's at right here Thanks
[Applause]
I think there's some room in this aisle
over here if they'd like to sit there
we'd also like
