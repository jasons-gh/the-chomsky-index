Chomsky professor at MIT author of over
a hundred bucks world renowned linguist
and political thinker and activists
gnome I wanted to ask you about the IAEA
the International Atomic Energy Agency
tentatively announcing plans to discuss
Israel's nuclear weapons program for the
first time ever Israel the only nation
the Middle East with nuclear weapons but
the country has never officially
acknowledged that it has them talk about
the significance of this yeah that's a
great brief there's another interview
coming but it's quite significant the
year that must be less september-october
the IAEA passed a resolution calling on
Israel to openness to join the
non-proliferation treaty p.m. to open
its facilities the facilities to
international inspection now the United
States and Europe tried to block that
resolution but it passed anyway and
immediately afterwards the Obama
administration informed Israel that it
could deny it this was not reported in
the United States as far as I know in
the press with one exception the
Washington Times and the second is paper
in Washington now that's quite
significant these are if anyone is
interested in nuclear nonproliferation
it's very important to the force it's
compel countries to join the
non-proliferation treaty there are three
non signers at the moment India Israel
and Palestine all developing nuclear
weapons with the assistance of the
United States
and the u.s. is protecting them from
inspection it goes beyond this there are
a heavier there are nuclear weapons
through this free zones in several parts
of the world already except that they're
not implemented fully because the US
won't allow it most relevant one here is
the African Union it called for did
finally agree on nuclear weapons free
zone but that includes an island the
island of Diego Garcia which the US uses
for official for bombing it's one of the
main bombing centers for the Middle East
and Central Asia but also for storing
nuclear weapons and Purdue clear
submarines and in fact it's used for
those purposes is being beefed up by the
Obama administration then you support
systems for nuclear submarines the
United States is now sending additional
a new buttock or bunker busters huge
bombs aimed at the penetration of course
there anybody ran but they've just been
sent to give Garcia this is these are
all threats against degranon violation
of Security Council resolutions that I'm
afraid we'll have to stop another
country going two minutes okay well
thank you very much for joining us Noam
Chomsky MIT professor again denied entry
into the West Bank to give his lectures
