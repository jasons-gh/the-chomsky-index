now take the British in American
University's student demands a so-called
no platform so that for example Germaine
Greer
if you've denied a platform to speak
because my views on transgender people
what do you think about that practice I
very much opposed to it I've been
subjected to it myself I'll be exact oh
I'm in four years I if I wanted to talk
on the middle-east and an American
University I had that police protection
up until a few years ago I'm in the
airport security if if a meeting was
even allowed attacks on the attempts to
remove the tenure of professors and
invited me to talk that's much more
extreme than what the students have been
I mean I'm posed what they're doing but
it's a minor coordinate I think we
should really have open platforms and
universities there should if students
don't like something that's being said
they can stay away but we should
recognize that that's a very minor part
of it the major part is the closing off
of options for people who are critical
at the dissenting side from the
overwhelming consensus at the university
outside the middle east is a very
striking example this it's only changed
in the last few years but literally up
until about I'd say ten years ago if I
was giving a talk on the middle east of
my own University I'd have to have
police protection other there were times
when the police would insist on walking
me back to my car because of information
they'd picked up about threads and
nobody ever protested this this was
considered fine but the heckler Peter
did not affect the hecklers veto did not
prevent oh sure they broke up meetings
there were meetings that were literally
broken up by hecklers and nobody ever
protested that I didn't either it's when
students begin to
we're in that direction on the other
side that the protests begin now I'm not
defending what they're doing but we
should put it in context the context is
that preventing speech that is critical
of the major consensus is never
participant so in short we accommodate
that the guiding principle for
university should be there's basically
the widest possible Reagan exactly I
mean just as in my own reading I read
right across the spectrum and that's
what students should be exposed to
