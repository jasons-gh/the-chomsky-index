you just one second so thick push your
good deeds try I don't think the artist
is the hold on the start line okay so
I'd let's say I'm over it up and snow
and the with people are doing direct the
Sun is fated to live the rest of his
life Ronnie in prison less than delicate
did the best we can take seriously these
statements I US armed individual who has
threatens who follow this miserable
traitor who dared adult above it with
his thermos doing to the citizens in the
world the following up at the end of the
earth through apprehended and punish him
for these misdeeds and there maybe we'll
take it seriously including remember
monsieur they think the morning very
serious
saw recently with the disgraceful
episode of the official plan of the
Living President Evo Morales slime from
Russia back to Bolivian and European
governments trembling in fear of a
master refused to allow his playing
eaten editor airspace and we did lunch
line with you the technical problems in
the end a security forces presented to
search her ass violation of elementary
diplomatic protocol but when the master
commands subject so they know all of
course the Latin American countries
bitterly contested who were they
actually Latin America's probably the
only place they the only place on earth
very soon could be bro the slave safe
possibly get there then said 4matic to
start over South American past decade
has broken pretty much free from Western
nomination the last century or more that
feeds us domination that's that her son
500 years is a mismatch what you said
for our spin it's now one of the few
regions of the world relatively safe
from us prevention Russian and that
should have showed up in the in the case
of the capitulation of European
governments who Washington's threats and
the Snowden case that another cases too
it was the setting from society working
out of study of the rendition conditions
knows it's the maybe one of her test
scores of course working capture
somebody nobody and said him often press
on a murderous brutal dictatorship creme
to be tortured so that maybe you can
abstract some information from that's
where the dishes were never an issue and
the study had to do with which countries
participate that well most of your
participated the middle east of course
as for the resent be tortured in syria
egypt under who are so on and that most
of the rest of the world but was one
reaches the world that refused to
participate in us from ordinary torture
namely South America and that's
remarkable in fact EE requirement for
one reason because until quite recently
fifty years ago abundance of nerve
button are altogether was considered
backyard but we don't have to worry
about but not it on the other reason was
remarkable doesn't get its best of
course is the during of your being
minute Latin earth was under us control
and domination one world center support
not by accident there's a relation
between those facts well that changed
the chosen things can change and
actually the prospects were and so he
may not be entirely Lee one reason is
that the father sports worm is a
substantial growing all over the world
that's one reason why his collection of
her record glass though this image it's
imaginable that it might even change
government
action at the moment it's not clear
which govern that it can inspire similar
actions elsewhere another positive sign
is that the editors of New York Times
surprisingly to me the call for amnesty
or so that's a welcome step but is still
closed for sure what should be done
amnesty is surprised it's not for
meritorious actions highly meritorious
actions in this case Snowden was
actually carrying out the highest duty
of the participant of the democratic
society namely revealing to citizens
what their elected representatives are
doing to them doing to others now the
owner of course claims that they visited
on the right about the government's have
a right to keep it urgency and the
reason that's given for that is security
there's a number of reasons to be
skeptical about that reason one that
justification but one reason is that
it's reflexive cost whenever a
government is caught doing something
true between the immediately is dirty
since the excuses predictable it carries
no information even the technical sense
who can be disregarded that amount
anything nevertheless it's worth looking
into it to ask well what the kana
security is really being chained massive
surveillance program and ask when
Snowden's revelations were released to
know he's out there
have the MSA said the 54 the terrorist
actions were prevented by the NSA
surveillance cafe so that's an
achievement under questioning he later
is 12 and under investigation was highly
to do so one of the namely one person
had sent about a thousand hours to
Somalia in the movement allegedly Paris
fruit that's the toe yield so far in
security of these huge massive the
surveillance programs of the review
which is said not so unusual the claims
of security the in growth pretty quickly
with one investigation now it is a major
thesis of the theory of international
relations the Germans seek to save our
security and that sounds plausible on
the service method it is but it's a
little unclear we have the first test
who's your leader they permitted safe
who's very your governments committed
who would maintain and safer one
possibility is that they're committed as
surety of the state for public scrutiny
and that's actually quite true actually
the secrecy associated the NSA
surveillance is an example and their
reasons for it sometimes
nice clearly so the professor of science
and government at harvard university
sandwich political scientists and one
even once pointed out quoting that the
architects of power in the United States
must create a force that can be felt but
not seen however remains strong when it
remains in the dark exposed to sunlight
it begins to evaporate that's the point
for those of you who are going to be
diplomatic service the doorman that
smell remember and power is going to be
battery if it's exposed to some one of
the way that we sewed expose and these
operations the sunlight and as they
secrecy is a the illustration of
Professor Huntington's insightful
observation another possibility of
parking during stay our population
another kind of security the significant
is the security of domestic power
centers in the West that means the
corporate safe primarily their security
is quite important and that secured from
the inquiry an investigation by the
other there are many examples of that so
just ate right now there are two huge
crate Ruiz under negotiation right now
athletic free greedy Pacific Partnership
military green the enormous scope of the
car being conducted in secret as the
trade agreements if we are of course not
complete secret of their not secret from
the
hundreds of corporate lawyers lobbyists
to arraign in detailed provisions of the
tree and that suggests a very likely
outcome to the limit extent of know
anything about it the expectations are
confirmed this menacing wikileaks of
release some documents and some material
from the trans-pacific partnership it
was the section on both intellectual
property and legible property refers to
a device that to extort from the public
massive comes to increase the huge
profits of corporations so intellectual
property property means that had
restrictions of the absolutely
unprecedented China this to the fast in
England the United States and other
countries with never develop the state
were involved in that Rob was not both
robbery huge the very high patent
restrictions are particularly for
industries like pharmaceutical industry
which makes huge process thanks
primarily to the monopoly pricing power
that it's granted by these simple free
trade treaties of course the
pharmaceutical industry claims that they
need those huge profits for research and
development a freer ambassador always
working for the death of the public
course prophecy distance down both their
nephew analyses
us this favor Taylor I pointed out
whatever money where I am kind of knows
because we can see buildings artists
owners my mom around us a large part of
their research development on the public
sector was like where I am I think
that's why they're surrounding the
repose of the general public research
that's a very substantial for and type
is Baker pointed out that the rd unfocus
actor was increased by Merced has put me
of course and the pharmaceutical
corporations were compelled and sell the
product on the market through the issue
saving summer but a first reduction of
prize so there that can't be probably
that's the part that was leaked and the
none of this should be of any surprise
that's exactly the outcome date when
agreements are crafted in secret by it
were obvious for lawyers and the
government's that disappeared it Rangers
in fact if you look these are countries
goal to certainly not free trip trees as
they're called very expensive for
patients don't such funds of engine and
watch party doesn't even have do three
these are proverbially investor rights
prints the public is an irrelevance and
as some money it says they have to be
kept apart those ways ago she shoots are
very fancy well text coupons security
security the state from its own citizens
and security of powerful domestic forces
within the state crumbs for me by the
wrists of by the general society and
there's a third kind of
curity this dirty the population is
what's called the national interest or
something like that defensive common in
use so the question is is that if I
Prairie the government well is happily
run through lots of examples starting
with the defense alleged offense from
terror and why not through this
population from instant destruction the
record is acquaintance quite significant
are not familiar with it I'd urge you
look into it and I think it shows that
quite definitively the security of the
population is none of my concern with
reference they regularly in consistently
act in ways which knowingly will
initiative only above which will enhance
state power and enhance the power of the
domestic constituencies have those in
which powers concentrated that's an
important topic is the type of through
here I think the inclusion is that farce
curations earn skirting the general
population is not a high priority is
awesome willingly sacrifice a securing
the state from scrutiny from the public
is a very high priority for the reasons
that the president mentioned and
security of a powerful domestic sectors
corporate sector in the West the SS
extremely high where are they you see if
the current investment ricin Doshi
ations that fly on this label is free
trade agreements and in many
of space well let's go back to where you
are Alaska I confess about not sure what
the duties of the wrecker are but there
is no doubt that the British
universities face quite serious project
you may have seen a series of articles
and the London Review of Books by seven
Collini who ran through the program's of
data that camera the government with
regard to the university's these
retentions of what's been happening
since Thatcher this is the new liberal
salt on population later thought it is
general conclusion which I think the
point will argue is that the government
is dedicated to turning first great
universities in the third great
commercial enterprise I think that's
pretty much true something similar true
in the United States though it's not
streamed and there are some sort things
on continent in this period of what you
should call a new liberal soul and those
protect the integrity of the educational
institutions in this new era is not
going to be a small test and I
understand that there are local issues
and questo as well particularly issues
of but guarantees a fair employment
conditions for the more vulnerable
workers in the institutions and others
I'm sure you know a lot more about these
matters than I do understand that
information to be distributed in the
auditorium well just include and we can
only hope that the actions that a youth
in one
undertaking the combine this said those
of many others around the world who will
permit to Edward Snowden to undertake
the responsibilities of the wrecked ship
University and to live his life of a
thief freedom and the claim that he had
quite certainly deserves
whilst is woken whole day on dragging me
out
you
