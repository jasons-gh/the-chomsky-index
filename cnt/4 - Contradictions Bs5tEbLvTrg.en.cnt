you mentioned that these movements of
the social movement speaking or have
their origins in themselves and then are
gradually moving north points in the US
and Europe is there not for fear that I
is this especially in Europe that these
old ideologies cannot adapt to this
diversity and this decentralized type of
functioning and will in fact once in the
northern context try to sort of pressure
themselves of course I sauce on the side
I mean if you really look at it in
detail there are plenty of problems both
in the south and the north there's a lot
of dictatorial control so the control
over the world Social Forum meetings and
activities in Brazil in India is heavily
influenced by centralized groups in
those countries to the extent that
participant open don't know what's going
on things are being decided somewhere
and you don't exactly know where the
European component which is much the
French base comes from a highly
authoritarian condition French the
French left is an extremely
authoritarian tradition in its entire
background and secretive so you know and
they're pulling a lot of strings in the
background but it was quite understands
in fact the friend of mine who was on
the directing committee committee the
direct it was sort of organizing the
meetings that told me
hear that it was like being in the
Politburo but not knowing who was in the
Kremlin i mean the orders were coming
from somewhere and they somehow had to
adapt to them and they themselves were
imposing structure and the book will be
participating didn't like it because
they're mostly much more libertarian in
the European sense and it didn't want to
be controlled so there's plenty of
internal contradictions there you can
see the Workers Party in Brazil them I
mean so kind of a mixture of mast
popular organizations and plenty of
authoritarian control that's one of the
problems they're having right now I'm
shizzle so all the traditional problems
are there in disappears and these are
kinds of struggling to try to maintain
the structure of a really participation
which is free and entirely democratic
within the framework of history of
authoritarian domination and just
tendency stores I mean any you who are
active in groups small groups or large
groups know that there is just unnatural
tendencies you just have to resist of
course centralization of control and
authority there are certain people who
are going to be interested in and
willing to take on responsibilities and
make decisions and others are busy here
not interested enough or whatever and
verbs can tend towards a highly
authoritarian your credit control and
those are just tendencies you've gotta
constantly be aware of and overcome when
you have two huge international
movements like these of course risks
there it's not so much ideological you
know because Steve there is no
ideological center but there is a there
are several control centers and they're
pretty X your and quite disruptive to
make people pretty unhappy and right so
those are problems that have to be
overcome in these and if they're not
overcome they may destroy it
