that's only a small part of the system
things have to be done for the rest of
the population
- that's being marginalized but they're
not going to be marginalized by telling
them lies about foreign policy because
because just as you say they don't
believe most of what they read there's
just a kind of a general populace
skepticism along with this sense that
the government has run by a few big
interests looking out for themselves is
the sense that the media are probably
lying to us
so for most of the population the media
system is I think a different one it's
not just the case that it tries to
entertain them
it tries to entertain them through means
which will intensify attitudes that
support the interest of a leech so you
want for example going to get some cases
take the emphasis on professional sports
not the sounds harmless but it really
isn't professional sports are a way of
building up jingoist fanaticism you're
supposed to cheer for your own team I
just to mention something from personal
experience I remember very well myself
when I was I guess a high school student
sudden revelation you know when I asked
myself why am i tearing for my high
school football team I don't know
anybody on it if I met anybody on it I'd
probably hate each other you know why do
I care whether they win or some guy a
couple blocks away wins well you know
and then you could say the same thing
about you know the baseball team or
whatever else it is this idea of
cheering for your home team which you
mentioned before that's a way of
building into people irrational
submissiveness to power you know and
it's a very dangerous thing and I think
it's one of the reasons it's such a big
it gets such a huge play I wonder if you
can envision a time when people like
myself again been naive people in this
world can again take pride in the United
States and is that even a healthy just
wish now because it may be just hunger
for pride in our country that makes us
more easily manipulated by the powers
that you talk about
I think you first of all have to ask
what you mean by your country now if you
mean by the country the government I
don't think you can be proud of it and I
don't think you could ever be proud of
it or it could be proud of any good it's
not arrogance and you shouldn't be
States or violent institutions the the
government of any country including ours
represents some sort of domestic power
structure and it's usually violent the
states are violent to the extent that
they're powerful it's roughly accurate
you look at American history it's
nothing - right
