yes I can you okay one second let me see
what I can ok can you can you speak
enough yes no yes can you hear me yes
can you hear me
yup perfectly perfect amazing to the ID
sorry I couldn't hear with you the set
pardon wait were you saying something
yeah they didn't ask for the ID this
time okay well okay so let's begin
yes okay the video just froze okay it's
working now
so my name is Hamza I enlisted in from
XE college in Pakistan it's an honor to
have you professor Chomsky we know that
you're a world-renowned linguist and
political commentator so effectively
there what I want to have as
conversation is that we create a certain
amount of discourse within our society
that's related to both political
philosophy as well as at the end we'll
have a tangent into linguistics as well
right so right now one of the issues
that Pakistan is famous for in terms of
what it's facing is religious extremism
particularly from radicalized as long or
politicized Islam so you being an
individual who's known for advocating
secular causes as well as having an
approach that's political Anarchy
particularly anarcho-syndicalism what I
would say asked for is that how is it
that in your viewpoint an
anarcho-syndicalist approach could be a
response towards the religious extremism
that exists within our society how could
we boil that down into political
activism moving to any form of an
anarchist society is a long
complicated affair doesn't happen in an
instant
we live in a very different kind of
society it's like trying to move from
feudalism to capitalism it didn't happen
in a day what you can't write what one
can do in fact is follow the suggestions
of one of the leading figures in the
early stages of the movement mikhail
bakunin and as he put it tried to
construct the germs of the future
society within the present one so for
example if you establish a community
which observes democratic participation
in its organization when its budget and
its functioning which can be done and in
fact is done that's a small element of a
manifesto
owned and managed enterprise is another
example and some of these incidentally
have reached an enormous scale so the
huge one in the Basque Country in Spain
it doesn't call itself anarchist but
it's basically literally huge
conglomerate mondo gong with
worker-owned democratically participated
participation inside industrial
hospitals schools housing and very
successful even in the capitalist market
and many other things can be done like
that and out of them you can an
expansion to a much more free and
democratic society that overcomes the
slave like worker aster
all right present society so for example
one thing that can be done in the United
States that's even within the laws is
this provision called Aesop's es Fe
which allows workers in an industry in
an enterprise to buy shares in the
enterprise maybe using their pension
funds if they do this to an efficient
efficient extent they essentially take
over the company they can become the
majority shareholders they can estate
workers control they can decide on what
should be produced and so on well that's
these things are being done to a certain
extent a few they don't you usually call
themselves anarchists but they're moving
in that direction
there's a look up some of the things
that are happening there's an
organization called the new systems
project which tries to organize and
integrate many efforts of this kind
cooperative owned enterprises localism
and so on let's really requires a basic
change in consciousness so people today
take for granted that it's that your
life is fulfilled if you get a job a
decent job but what's a decent job that
means that for most of your waking hours
you're a slave you're under the control
of a totalitarian institution that has
more control over you that Stalin did
install and when you could go to the
bathroom or who you were allowed to talk
to what clothes you have to wear but
that's what it means to get a job at the
early stages of the Industrial
Revolution workers bitterly resented
this and fought against regarded it as a
fundamental attack on their human
dignity and human rights
over time it just gradually came to be
sort of common sense just accepted in
here and ask one question wouldn't you
say that this sort of dynamic that
exists of individuals working at
particular said ours don't you think
that's something that contributes to a
certain amount of productivity that we
need for the consuming of the goods that
we have okay could you say it slowly
yeah so if we are working in what you
describe as slave-like conditions do you
not think that said working ours
contribute to productivity which
otherwise would not exist or productive
in a capitalist enterprise does
capitalist enterprises waste an enormous
amount of time and cost and simply
supervising workers making sure they do
what they are supposed to do you will
then a what was that when it's a
democratic institution people do
organize and decide what to do and then
do so what do you think is basically the
incentive for these capitalist
enterprises to keep people working and
said ours and in set ways well there is
a capitalist ideology which claims that
what people really want to do is just
lie and look at the sky and they have to
be forced to work somehow but every one
of us knows that that's totally false
I'm creative work on the Iran initiative
was one of the greatest things in life
let me just take some working guy who
works in general moral planters and he
works like a slave all week
whoo he can do right now no do nothing
he goes and give his garage builds
machines something else
Lancer Gordon does something lady writes
a book people want to do something from
childhood people are basically
inquisitive creative they want to do
something that matters that sort of
driven out of their heads in the
educational system and the general
cultural system they were kind of
trained that what you have to do is go
to the shopping mall and see if you can
buy something but that's not the highest
golden life for a free human being
artisans they pride in their work they
want it done right if if a woman in
Pakistan somewhere we's rugs who wants
to do it the world they even feel that's
not the point you want an artistic
project product that's what unions are
like so I don't think there's a problem
with incentives
that's capitalist mythology all right so
for the common individual if they want
to bring about some sort of revolution
or some sort of change of the sort that
challenges the capitalist enterprise and
along with that also comes in to clash
with the religious ideals within a
society so how do you think that an
individual ought to go about doing that
and not put themselves or their family
members at risk depends on society
Pakistan it's extremely the power of the
religious authorities we control even
the control of consciousness and belief
I leave religious authorities not just
for I had to break out of that it's
quite a battle I can't just do it
overnight it took I mean even to say
overcome slavery
took centuries visible period of time
when like most most of human history it
was considered perfectly natural with it
there to be slave it was believed that
there couldn't be higher civilization
unless category of people were slaves so
you go back to classical Athens or Rome
which were sort of models of free
society but what there are some there
but that basic belief was it should be a
free society for elites who could spend
their day wandering around the central
Athens and they didn't discuss and
meanwhile somebody else does all the
work otherwise you couldn't have a legit
I took a little time to beat the
people's with now it sounds good test
if I were to draw parallels between the
example that you used of slavery right
one thing that we saw was that there was
of course protest from those who were
slaves but there was also a certain
amount of action I was taken by those
who were essentially the masters or the
rulers now similarly in our society
right now with currently caught fuel
actuals or few political leaders who are
teachers essentially who are trying
utilizing the privilege that they have
to try to create a sort of top-down
approach where they unite workers do you
think that that leads to a certain
amount of hijacking that if a rich
individual comes and tries to give voice
to the poor do you think that that leads
to the rich essentially hijacking the
struggle of the oppressed class somebody
who comes in and tries to give
leadership to the poor yeah from
Professor if you come in as
if you come in from the privileged
classes depends how you come do you come
to participate and offer your own skills
and abilities and privilege not to be
used by the community where do you come
in to dictate to them what they should
do but what they should believe these
are very differences and what do you
think is more likely to happen
in such a scenario do you think a person
from a privileged background coming to
effectively need the masses do you think
that would adopt a dictatorial sort of
regime a prospective can happen that's
what happened the Bolshevik Russia for
example look at 1917 the very
revolutionary society a lot of worker in
peasant activism at four
Soviets workers councils and communities
lively that's basically democratic
socialist society I'm after lemon took
over it's all crushed what turned out
was just the most one of the most Adi
socialist societies in the world old so
it doesn't have to happen
it's possible for people to come in and
participate so for example a this
wonderful woman in India University I
went to live in a poor village in
Rajasthan where she's working there I
think it'd be 20 years he's been living
in poverty with helping them which he
can do with the skills and advantages
that she was there are plenty of people
to do this
I mean they don't get known in history
but for example during the u.s. wars in
Central America in the 1980s
Jones or thousands of people from
ordinary American life but many of them
from church roots went to live with the
people who are under attack and to try
to help them and give whatever
protection a white face gives and help
them only resist oppression but build
some bed of lives watch some of the
nobody remembers any of their names they
don't enter history but it makes a big
difference
so in Pakistan one issue that we face is
that obviously education and students
have a strong role to play in developing
the consciousness of our people but the
issue that we face is that when our
professors try to reach critical
thinking they face two types of issues
one issue is that they encounter a
student body that's radicalized which
doesn't want to accept their ideas
because they think they're too free or
they fall into the realm of sin and the
other issue that we face is from
authorities which do not want students
to develop critical thinking in order to
keep the massive body passive an example
of this was an individual known as a
model II John who you also lent support
to once he was thrown into jail now once
he was kicked out of the university that
he was teaching at because they believed
that he was somehow creating more of a
hey walk rather than creating critical
thinking so how do you think educational
institutes ought to go about this or
what role do educational institutes play
in general know what they ought to do
what they ought to be is fostering
people like that offering opportunities
fostering creativity independence
students faculty and so on
easy to say or to achieve those are
sparkles it has to be taking place in
service with boys example somebody spent
his life in this it's not easy
struggle so over here one final question
with regards to political ideology would
be that we recently had a woman's March
and it was something that was criticized
for several reasons one reason that it
faced would one acquisition it faced was
that it's elitist and the other one that
it faced was that it's sort of well it
was going against what they called the
norms of society so how do you think
that any sort of narrative especially
within the time of social media could be
created and do you think that or at
march or the woman rights March could be
merged with other ideologies such as
Marxism because a lot of their demands
revolves around saying things like we
should not be taking loans from IMF you
think that that's the right thing to do
there's no general answer you have to
look at the specific cases if a loan
comes from IMF with conditionalities
that require subordination of the
country to foreign domination then you
don't take it if a loan comes from say
the World Bank to counter the growth of
AIDS in the country I think that can be
very helpful in Africa in fact such
loans have virtually eradicated major
aids of attendance so fine this is
coming foreign affairs purpose you don't
exist
can't be a general rule about these
things you have to look at each
particular case find out what's the best
way or often what's the least bad way
all the options are negative with some
are worse than others that's the world
in which we live it's always been true
it's been true of every campaign in
history abolitionist campaigns which
that went on for a century okay so now
let's move on towards the other thing
that you're famous for which is
linguistics so you're known as the
founder of the universal grammar theory
or the language acquisition device a few
questions that I had about that was
firstly when you talk about the language
acquisition device it's moved on from
there to go outwards what's known as the
language acquisition support system and
could you draw a difference for us with
the pursue what's the difference between
the two and which one do you lie on or
rely on more or lean towards more only
to language acquisition device and
language acquisition support system
what's what so language acquisition
support change well the language
acquisition device I think the way that
it was going about was that it doesn't
necessarily need a lot of triggers from
within society for language to develop
but I think these are just descriptions
of different things right the language
acquisition device is not you take a
look at its definition right it's it's
an abstract description of what takes
place in the process of language
acquisition it doesn't describe the
mechanisms by which it takes place a
person isn't I think it's it's not a
what it says is that here's what happens
in language acquisition you start with
innate a system which has built-in
structure it gets data fed into it it
ends up with a soup in another state and
we can abstractly study what's the
relation between those two states the
initial state before any data came in
the final state after the data came in
when he get very interesting results
that way we discovered the nature of the
initial state what had to be in it
studying you have to take a look at the
interactions between the infant and
people in the environment to what extent
is the motor is mother's voice matter to
what extent to peers matter other things
like that but these are just different
topics one is the abstract study of what
has taken place the other is the
investigation of the mechanisms by which
it takes place so there's no choice it's
one they contribute to each other ok so
another question that I have is related
to the development of language in terms
of its evolutionary history so most
people say that language to allow for
effective communication
you've been somebody who's leaned more
towards saying things like that it
willit
for the understanding of inner thought
or for comprehending one's own thoughts
what made you draw that sort of
conclusion or become a minority in the
linguistics in the community for holding
such a view well I can't
subscribe this in a minute it's there's
extensive work on the nature of language
we chose that the it's just its basic
design is for expression of thought it
can be but need not be externalized in
one or another sensory modality it's
usually speech in just as well be sign
could even be touch sound has some
advantages but these are not intrinsic
to the nature
when it turns out that when you look at
it closely whenever there is a conflict
between the theory of generation of
thought and communicative efficiency
communicative efficiency is always
sacrifice it's not not a driving element
and in fact the very design of language
grants to structures that are difficult
for communicating harm communication
that takes something as simple as
ambiguity like flying planes can be
dangerous to me neither the floyd claims
claims the floyd kind of thing arms
communication could it make theory of
the language the simplest rules were
expressing so it just gives us results
and there are many such cases so if you
look closely at it turns out that even
externalization to a sensory modalities
and secondary to in language and
communication even more so because it's
based on the externalization and the
belief that language evolves for
communication is just a dogma the calm
from the assumption that we must have
evolved animal communication systems but
that's just a religious dogma no reason
to believe that all that we know about
language evolution is that about 200,000
years ago modern humans emerged
different species and we have good
evidence that language was already
implanted in them it wasn't very long
after that the in evolutionary time
25,000 years not very long after that
human groups began to
separate and in fact they're scattered
in different parts of the world is no
contact have the same language travel
must have been there before they
separated so it seems to have come about
along with its modern humans animal
anything some and in fact there isn't
any evidence for symbolic behavior
usually the appearance of humans so all
the evidence seems converging saying
that when modern humans appeared who did
precursors one of the differences that
something changed in their brains which
implanted this system which has
properties that nothing else has there's
nothing at all let's just misunderstand
their dollars so to last final questions
one thing is that how much of a role has
Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysts in
general such as Jeff Locke are have
played in your understanding of language
has there been any influence from these
figures none whatsoever
when I was your age I was interested in
social analysis really interesting
looked into it I think there is nothing
there I mean it may be and apparently is
a useful therapeutic technique I mean I
know people who have gained from working
with the psychoanalyst somebody who was
able to get them to bring out things
that were hidden in the history of
thinking so it kind of works that's fine
the shaman's work in indigenous cultures
that's fine
when you try to ask is there any
theoretical content I did there's as I
say I was seriously interested in one
time thought it was exciting and so on
my own view is you just can't find
serious intellectual substance so there
is this one concept of Freudian slips
where you mean to say one thing but you
end up saying another and the other
thing that you say they say reveals dirt
is inner hidden desire so do you think
that holds any weight in terms of that's
certainly true which would be your
experience so yes there is there are
things like that we can look to them and
ask why we did it but I don't it doesn't
seem to me anything much I mean you
mentioned inner speech before yeah but
the fact of the matter is when you study
if it's lies speech that we're just not
making noises from but what's going on
internally is very different from what
we call the inner speech and there's
good evidence for so one last question
which is simply but we know that you
wrote an essay where you pointed out why
you felt that BF Skinner's approach
towards language is something that you
didn't necessarily agree with and one
thing BF Skinner's you have Skinner yeah
absolutely vacuous and you pointed out
the poverty of stimulus as one example
as to why you don't agree with it right
so could you just tell us what that is
however your stimulus is something
reason you world trial it's you can
demonstrate that they know a great deal
that they have never experienced I'm you
can see it even with the meaning of a
simple word you have to ask yourself
what's the real meaning with a simple
word like tree or River or so on
first about turns out to be very complex
so children learned that on two
exposures and tell them anything about
the meaning so it's all junk
there's of course you have to experience
tells you something like I don't speak
of we're doing for example because I
didn't have that experience but it turns
out that the languages say we're doing
English are fundamentally very similar
at the core make you pronounce a couple
things differently you pronounce the
word for tree differently the word order
was a little bit different few things
but at the root when you start looking
at the nature of the language see and
that fundamental content of language
simply can't be learned by now we have
very detailed careful statistical
studies of the total linguistic input to
it two or three year old trial and you
don't even get many cases of two words
in sequence and it's very impoverished
what is known is that's furthermore
we're constantly even young children are
constantly creating new expressions
which are part of the length which have
maybe never been used before certainly
nothing than their experience the idea
is that everything is just the rim home
biases
doesn't the ground and when people try
to do it to a spinner did it totally
falls apart as you can see by just
looking at the elementary exam they
still believed by many people it's magic
so that's not I'm not expressing it
consensus view but since you asked me my
opinion and I think it's my boy okay
well thank you for joining me today was
incidentally also my 21st birthday so
anyway this was kind of like a birthday
present to me so thank you so much yeah
