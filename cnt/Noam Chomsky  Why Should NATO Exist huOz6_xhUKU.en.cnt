I just want to know if you've any
thoughts some recent NATO actions whose
recent NATO actions and the protests
coming up at the 60th minute of a
conference and now you're speaking to
that counter conference could be you
give so many talks I can't remember on
the NATO conference well I mean the
obvious question is why should they
exist in fact you can ask questions
about what I should ever have existed
but now why does it exist I mean the
theory was whether you believe it or not
that it yeah defensive alliance against
potential Soviet aggression but that's
the basic doctrine well there's no
defense against Soviet aggression so
whether they believe that doctrine or
not that's gone now when Soviet in
collapsed there had been an agreement
recent agreement between Gorbachev and
the u.s. government have been the first
Bush administration the agreement was
that Gorbachev agreed to a quite
remarkable concession he agreed to let a
united Germany join NATO a hostile
military alliance now it is remarkable
in the light of history history of the
past century Germany alone had virtually
destroyed Russia twice and Germany
backed by hostile military alliance
centered in the most phenomenal military
power in history and that's a real
threat nevertheless he agreed but there
was a quid pro quo namely that NATO
should not expand to the east so Russia
would at least have a kind of a security
zone and George Bush and James Baker as
Secretary of State agreed that NATO
would not expand one inch to the east
Berbatov also proposed a nuclear-free
weapon zone in the region but the US
wouldn't consider that okay so that that
was the basis on which then shortly
after the Soviet Union collapsed
well Clinton came into office what did
he do one of the first things he did was
to back down on that promise that expand
native to the east that's a significant
threat to the Soviet Union to Russia now
there's no longer any Soviet Union it's
at the significant and not surprisingly
they responded by beefing up their
offensive capacity not much but some so
they rescinded their pledge not to not
to use nuclear weapons at first strike
NATO had never rescinded it but they had
and started some remilitarization with
Bush the aggressive militarism of the
Bush administration as predicted induced
Russia to extend further its offensive
military capacity still going on right
now the when Bush proposed missile
defense systems in Eastern Europe pull
dramatic Slovakia that was a real
provocation to the Soviet Union I mean I
was even discussed in us arms control
journals that they would have to regard
it as a potential threat to their
strategic deterrent meaning as a first
strike weapon
and the claim was have had to do with
Iranian missiles but forget about that
so and they take say it's pond Obama
Obama's national security adviser James
Jones former Marine counted on his on
record as favoring an expansion of
native to the south and the east further
expansion of NATO and also making it
basically an intervention force and the
head of native of the Shepherd he has
explained that NATO must take on
responsibility for ensuring the security
of pipelines and sea lanes that is it
must guarantee NATO must be a guarantor
of energy supplies for the West well
that's kind of an unending war so do we
want NATO to exist do we want that to be
there to be a Western alliance
no authority Alliance that carries out
these activities with no pretense of
defense well I think that's a pretty
good question I don't see any reason why
I should any more than this there
happens to be no other military alliance
even remotely comparable but if there
were one I'd be opposed to that too so I
think the first question is what is this
all about
why why is there why should we even be
debating NATO is there any reason why
should exist
