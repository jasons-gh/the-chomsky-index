okay welcome all NYU students and
students around the world my name is Ed
rats velovsky deputy opinion editor at
washington square news on behalf of wsn
Thank You professor Chomsky for doing
this interview I also want to extend a
special thanks to the Liberal Studies
program for their support and to my
fellow student Alice Sholto Douglas for
her collaboration in the project and
technical assistance today despite the
impending blizzard and a cold professor
Chomsky has generously obliged to
readjust the schedule for this interview
for which we are incredibly
indescribable grateful before I begin
with the questions I just want to note
for the viewers that professor Chomsky
is the eighth most cited scholar of all
time joining the rings of Plato
Aristotle Shakespeare and forth so on to
my first question and this is a topic
that specifically concerns me as a
student since the start of the Occupy
movement many protesters have put
matters concerning rising tuition costs
and student loans among the top of their
demands during her campaign Jill Stein
provocatively compared student debt to a
modern form of indenture and you have
expressed a similar view arguing that
student indebtedness is a technique of
indoctrination and control could you
please elaborate on that well the first
question that arises is whether there's
an economic necessity for student didn't
come in North to tell students what the
numbers are right it's overtreated
dollars be on credit card did so is it
desert economic
education were their number of ways of
testing that so for example we happen to
be right next door to a poor country
Mexico quite good university system it's
not doesn't have all the things we have
its poor country but very high quality
high level of instruction I've taught
there have been there it's free the that
wasn't attempt by the government some
years ago ten fifty years ago to raise
costs slightly led to a national student
strike the country was practically
closed down and they backed off in fact
last time I was there about two years
ago there was an administration building
that was still occupied but students
from the student strike long before it
been turned into a community center
that's Mexico for country just then the
West in our northern border and Quebec
where tuition is higher than magnuson
and the rest efficient but it's not at
our level there wasn't attempt by the
government a couple of months ago to
raise the tuition there was a student
strike in Quebec joined by much of the
population that it led not only to
backing off on that proposal but I
didn't change in the government a lot of
changes and protests against the liberal
policies and much more there are rich
countries that have a very high level
educational systems among the highest
are Finland and Germany to both free if
you go back in American history they go
back to that I teen 50 as a much poorer
country did than it is now but my
tuition was exactly free but it was
pretty close to it under the GI Bill a
huge number of people with the school at
government expense
meaning the tuition essentially very low
fees I mean I was a student back in the
40s at an Ivy League college and tuition
was about a hundred dollars maybe
equivalent of 800 today or something
well these comparisons suggest very
strongly that there's no real economic
reason for a high student didn't so we
have to them ask what it's doing well it
is part of a much more general process
over the best generation essentially 30
odd years there's been a major assault
on the population basically the
neoliberal Europe that's one of the
reasons why there's now a slogan that
one percent 99 percent we're back to
levels of inequality that malaya stand
history before the first of prison what
and the Great Depression there's been
economic growth during these years but
it's overwhelmingly going into very few
pockets that's by now latest figures I
saw there are 400 people in the United
States who have as much wealth more
wealth effect than the lowest hundred
eighty million wages and have pretty
much grown very slowly more or less
stagnated for most of the population and
sometimes declawed well meanwhile
there's been enormous wealth going to a
tiny percentage of the population from
the 179 percent imageries
may be right it's more like one-tenth of
one percent if you look at the way that
graphs actually work and that's led to
lots of continents it's not a economic
necessity like it's not happening in
comparable countries that it's having
there are a lot of other effects so for
example the OECD the organization of the
affluent countries the develop all
developed countries they just did a
study of social justice in 31 OECD
countries the US was 27th of right above
Mexico and yet remember this is the
richest country in the world with
enormous advantages that no one else
says there are other studies of infant
mortality maternal health lots of layers
and the night this is way down at the
bottom of the rich countries around 20th
21st which is just totally scandals in
fact the health care is a remarkable
case we have about twice the per capita
costs of other rich countries and
relatively poor outcomes in addition to
tens of millions of people dying every
year because they don't have insurance
the new program will dig into that a
little but lower near where it should
for people who are worried about the
deficit which they shouldn't be it's
declining it's not that serious the
deficit would be raced if we had
healthcare system like comparable
countries and the and the reasons are
not terribly obscured it's the only
prior jali privatized the lightly
regulated system in the world so it's
highly inefficient with the huge
administrative costs advertising the
profit for
the private companies use salaries a lot
of waste cherry-picking all kinds of
things the food in fact there are a
couple of parts of the US system which
are owned and run that one is the VA
system Veterans Administration and
that's kind of like European countries
about the same level of costs and
efficiency the Medicare which is
government-run it is much more efficient
than the privatized system the costs are
going up it was a lot of talk about that
Birdman Medicare but that's because it
has to work through the privatized
insurance system its own administrative
costs and others are quite low in
comparison it's kind of interesting to
look at the proposals that are now being
discussed so one of the proposals for
dealing with the deficit problem which
again is not a major problems banks care
about the population doesn't them
they're right but if you've done one of
the proposals that's being routed around
is that the age for medicare eligibility
should be increased that's quite an
interesting proposal for one thing it's
going to class basis professionals
white-collar workers and so on then to
live longer then truck drivers and
construction workers and people doing
hard manual labor so as you move up the
level which Medicare eligibility comes
you're essentially arming of the poor
working people benefiting the more
wealthy educated sector but even more
interesting than that it's the fact that
raising the age is a move from a more
efficient system to a less efficiency so
it's actually more costly but the way
cost is measured and that's just
ideological
economic necessity if costs are
transferred to individuals that are
considered costs it's only if it's the
business that then it's a cost if it's
the government it's a cost because the
rich don't like to pay taxes and the
business of course what stuff profit so
if you can find a way to transfer costs
individuals that's called savings but
you came up here today on the train the
train from New York to Boston it takes
about the same amount of time as when my
wife and I took at sixty years ago if
you were any European country here
almost any country we've taken the third
the time probably and that's a cost but
suppose to you not a cost damn tractor
to the to the government and it's the
same if you know I had to fly yesterday
for some talks a lot an airplane in
order to save money for the private
carriers they don't circulate air well
the cost of that too like what you're
hearing you know move the costs of not
circulating errors at certain places
eases so if somebody on the plane I was
cold everybody's up the cold the flu or
something but that's a course that's
dresser to individuals and therefore it
doesn't count you don't count it and
when you
your efficiency except this is happening
at the universities to as the
university's get more corporatized
there's been a key during this period of
sharp rise in tuition it not for
economic reasons i think has also been
an enormous increase and ratio of
administrators to the faculty couple of
studies of disaffection Ginsburg
well-known sociologist has a book on it
called the fall of the faculty discusses
the sharp rise in number of
administrators and the tendency to have
professional administrators the
university's used to have administrators
from the faculty it took off for a
couple years and went back but a lot of
the Edna trees are now more
professionals there people come from
business schools you know they have a
business school mentality and you have
to keep the you have to look at the
bottom line we have to save money have
to get what's going fishin see and they
use the corporate economic model of
efficiency so if the costs are less for
the institution it's more efficient for
example if you can reduce the proportion
of faculty to teaching by getting temps
you know low paid teachers like say
graduate students who have low salary
will have low salaries no benefits if
they can take over the work of highly
paid fat faculty that's efficient it's
not efficient for the students they're
not giving the simple
of the education surely that's not good
for the graduate students either but
that's cold efficiency well all of these
things is a lot more like this all of
this going on in parallel as part of
them the whole deal liberal onslaught
which is a that's very harmful to the
population very beneficial to the the
Masters the super-rich they're doing
fine like after they cost the latest
financial crisis and the big banks the
perpetrators of Richard never bigger
never the corporate profits are the
reaching records and bonuses are huge
and so on the population suffers but not
then this relates intimately some things
that occupy is doing so among the I
don't want to go on too long should
continue well among the Occupy concerns
are the things like going to affect one
of the projects that's coming up is
called occupy the economy deal with the
tremendous concentration of wealth which
carries along with it the concentration
of political power that's almost
reflexive cost of Elections skyrockets
if depend on rich donors corporate
builders ends up kind of controlling the
political system which is shredding you
know you can see it very clearly go
through some of the details and going
after that is a critical point yes so
what kind of actions should we students
for example at NYU pursue obviously we
need to organize and create student
groups addressing these issues that you
have outlined but what other more
specific tactics would you suggest so
that we can go beyond merely
communicating this message about debt
a form of entrapment and indoctrination
and move to demanding substantive change
of some sort you could look at the model
of other countries mm-hmm for example
the ones on our words the Mexico and
Quebec the protests in Mexico remember
was a protest against a small increase
in essentially free education but it
swept the last part of the country
didn't go back to drew in the large part
of the population it was tied to
concerns of many other people it's not
just the students or suffering through
this this attacker of the population is
much broader that's why you have a
situation in which like what I described
what you all know the kind of stagnation
or something like it for a large party
for the majority of the population while
there is growth especially from the core
of people it's much worse for the black
population the wealth was almost wiped
out by the last recession and if the if
the student movement and in many places
the United States do historically the
student movements have been kind of in
the forefront of large-scale social
change so for example be the changes in
this country they've done a lot of
progress in the country in the last 40
years or so a lot of it came from
student initiative I take the civil
rights movement but has been a civil
rights movement nevers for a long time
but one major spur to it was from 1960
when small group of black stood and said
in a lunch counter kicked out arrested
fertilized and others came pretty soon
you had that student nonviolent
coordinating committee
buzzes students from the north coming
down I wasn't all story but it was the
cutting edge of what became a mass
movement that achieved some goals not
all but some goals the women's movement
a lot of it came from young women
organizing consciousness-raising groups
pressing demands on it spread the
environmental movement has a lot of it
has come from student activism no longer
person but they hunting word movement it
was very clear was mostly students and
this is true of many other cases in this
country and elsewhere so the students
can become kind of a galvanizing force
not just for their own personal concerns
of you know I don't want to be in debt
for the rest of my life but because it's
part of a general social pro supporter
the general attack really is an attack
on the population and should be possible
to link up with other sectors that are
suffering under the same attack in
different ways let's say people weren't
for the minimum wage of the minimum at
there was a time during the period of
growth significant growth in the country
50s and 60s when the minimum wage pretty
much track productivity that started to
separate about you know 30 plus years
ago if the minimum wage had kept up with
productivity probably two or three times
as high as it is now well that means
people working at the minimum wage are
paying the costs of the wealth of the
one tenth of one percent and when you
pull down the minimum wage you pull down
always these are all broad issues that
the student movement can help galvanize
look for illumise what do you make of
the increased professionalization
and specialization among undergraduate
departments in universities by
professionalization I mean that the
curriculums are under more and more
pressure to respond to the demands of
the market such as getting a job etc in
addition and in in tandem with this in
some respects it seems that there is a
great push to make some fields seem as
much as exact Sciences Sciences as
possible for instance the humanities
seem to be under great attack because
they do not produce tangible outcomes
and assessments that can be fit onto a
balance sheet determined by market logic
what should happen to traditional
humanities disciplines from your
perspective given these patches that's
whether we want to live in a civilized
world really i mean the wealth and
richness of life doesn't come from
having more gadgets in your hands it
comes from literature arts decent
society decent human relations many
other things that don't have you can't
put a number on marketization of life is
another form of destroying it okay this
was well understood by the working
classes in the early ages of the
industrial revolution in fact all
through their modern history you go back
to the 19th century this is quite good
scholarly studies of it the British
working classes you know in dickensian
england wasn't very pretty I had a very
high level of culture but they were
reading contemporary literature what we
call classics now and the studies
compare the
proletarian culture with the Philistine
ism of the aristocratic culture the same
in the united state we go back to the
early industrial towns right around the
year in fact eastern Massachusetts the
young women from the farms were coming
into the mills were bitterly condemned
the fact that their culture was being
destroyed they'd be turned into tools of
production in an independent women an
irish artisan and upset blacksmithing
boston get a little money would hire
young boy to read while he's working a
mac and remember it went on into the
1930s my you know as kid my family
mostly underfoot working-class mostly in
New York that something to love them it
never really had much formal school a
couple of years maybe but they were
going to Shakespeare plays and the
talking about the Budapest string
quartet discussing the latest debates
and psychoanalysis human before you
settle in every possible political
movement other words working class
education and which incidentally a lot
of quick good scientists and
mathematicians participated that was
work written for workers education that
were workers education programs lot of
it run by the unions and so on but most
a lot of that's been eaten out of
people's heads but could be restored now
that's a decent society if you go back
to the 19th century labor press which is
very interesting it barely condemned
industrial society of us turning people
into taking away their freedom their
independence their integrity as human
beings in fact a wage labor in the
midnight
century was considered basically the
same as slavery the only difference was
it was temporary the fact that was such
a popular position there was a program
of the Republican Party in the mid 19th
century was program of the Knights of
Labor the huge never went that was
formed in fact there was an interesting
slogan that was emphasized by a lot of
working people the slogan that describe
what they called the new spirit of the
age that they're trying to ram down our
throats the new spirit of the age is
gain wealth forgetting all but self
that's 150 years of massive efforts to
try to indoctrinate people to that
belief but it's so inhuman and silage
that just doesn't work except at the
periphery but that's marketization of
every aspect of life as part of this
it's infected this is it but it's if you
look at the college's the state colleges
in the country a lot of them are
actually reducing in order to preserve
the Prophet profitability no look at the
bottom line are actually reducing
expensive programs with our jobs like
they're reducing engineering computer
science and nursing because they're
expensive but they happen to be the
programs with jobs and turning to
cheaper programs and as you say the
humanities are kind of marginalized you
can't put a number on developing
creative writers or individuals who can
enjoy it could appreciate and contribute
to the arts and general culture and that
that's it very harmful effect on the
society altogether this is inside what
kind of society do you want to live in I
think these are among the reasons why
the u.s. ranked solo didn't say general
social justice that's what that mr. um
and in a recent public forum with Angela
Davis a veteran activist as well you
reiterated one of Martin Luther King's
juniors most famous statements that the
arc of history is long but it bends
towards justice and of course it takes a
lot of people to bend the arc down as
well but my question is what role do
universities serve in a just or
democratic society universities ought to
be the place where as many people as
possible let's say the GI Bill we have
the opportunity to develop their
creative capacities their independence
their joy of discovery their our ability
to work with each other to achieve
socially desirable social ends that they
can figure out a student's our
University they're really the freest
time of their lives they're out of
parental control they don't yet have to
devote themselves to putting bread on
the table for a lot of freedom and
opportunity and that's the point of the
University actually going back to Mexico
poor country a couple of years ago there
was a leftist mare in Mexico City he
actually opened the University in Mexico
City which is not free but has open
admissions with support for students who
aren't quite up the academic standards
and it's pretty impressive that was
there
Rock students talk to faculty that's
just what he University ought to be used
to be able to be open to a cute are they
open to the community and draw people in
just like what evers education programs
did but these opportunities ought to be
available to everyone but they're the
forefront of creating the opportunities
for a decent society in which the same
person I want to live and I'd like to
shift to a different topic in in light
of Barack Obama's second inauguration
what is your opinion about the role of
the left in the United States it seems
to me that there is an effort among the
Democrats specifically to depict the
president as a victim of capitalist
mashi nations is this effort and mistake
should the left in the United States
hold Barack Obama more accountable
accountable to what there's no
indication that he has any intention or
ever had any intention or interest in
the bringing about progressive changes
is basically a moderate Republican mmm
in fact you know it's it's commonly said
now that the moderate Republicans have
disappeared republican party's a party
in fact it's what the governor bobby
jindal called them a couple weeks ago he
said we're becoming the stupid party
thank you off the spectrum would but
what happened to the moderate
Republicans there now mainstream
Democrats he knew Democrats Obama fits
pretty well within that spectrum but he
came into office 2008 with a huge
popular support and the country was
going into economic tailspin I do not so
the first thing you had to do
was an economic to deal with the
problems well take a look at who he
picked he picked people who had created
the problems you were called the room
invoice in other words they were at the
forefront of deregulation of you know
building the big banks of the providing
the government insurance policy which
encourages risk younger the
too-big-to-fail policy and so on these
are the people who are picked and there
are other highly competent economist's
including the nobel laureate know people
like see Stiglitz or Krugman and many
others that they weren't they were never
invited in fact the business press
bloomberg news business journal actually
reviewed the appointments when they were
made an interesting article about the
went through each person who was
appointed and ended up concluding that
half of these people shouldn't be on an
economic team they should be getting
subpoenas we mean they're the ones who
are the perpetrators of the crisis that
were now in that gave it away pretty
quickly and he came in Obama with huge
labor support and the labor movement had
a few serious requests good right ones
one of them was FK you know karjuk
ability to whom has been a big huge
attack on unions and they wanted to go
back to a rational way of organizing
which most workers wanted differently
Obama promised it but forgot about it
right away same on health care because a
majority of the population the favored
of some kind of rational national health
care system there was one residue of
that
the obamas program public option which
gave away with about two-thirds of the
population supporting the United States
is I guess the only country where
there's legislation that bans the
government from the goji any drug prices
the drug prices are way higher than else
room the way I found out in one poll on
that which found that about eighty-five
percent of the population was opposed it
made no effort to deal with him I mean
the you know claim was well I can't get
it through Congress and so on but the
president's a lot of power can appeal to
the population be a leader there have
been president did do that but you have
to want to do it or be pressured to do
it by large-scale popular movements and
you you often associate justice with
democracy or democracy with justice
working in conjunction together however
some may argue that the concept of
justice and the concept of democracy are
the antithesis of each other in other
words the protections of personal
liberties and majority rule are not
compatible NYU professor of politics
escali pastino argues that by using the
word democracy to encompass a broad
range of things the word loses any real
value and this can have a detrimental
effect when we want to make substantive
change happen how do we resolve this
paradox I think we resolve at the way
Aristotle didn't hmm go back to the
first major book um political theory
Aristotle's politics he dealt with he
was dealing with Athens sneeze day and
he was talking about free men you know
people not slaves not women but he
discussed various kinds of political
systems decided that democracy was maybe
the least bad so that's what we should
prefer nobody pointed out as a real
problem with democracy the problem is
that if the voters if one of everyone's
free to vote the ones were enfranchised
the poor will use their voting power to
redistribute the property the rich in
other words to achieve justice and of
course we don't want that he had a
solution but first should notice that
Madison races Satan problem in the
Constitutional Convention that he was
talking about England model they're
thinking of and in the Constitutional
Convention he discussed the fact that in
England if everyone had the vote in
excluding the people are not allowed the
boat like women pretty litter everyone
had to put they would the poor would use
their voting power to carry out what we
call management these are mostly
agricultural societies and that's not
just so Aristotle in Madison faced the
same problem as the professor you're
mentioning conflict between democracy
and justice and had opposite solutions
Aristotle solution was to reduce
inequality hmm and he proposed what
amount to welfare state measures you
know on a C scale our scale communal
meals you know things like that that
would reduce the level of inequality and
then you wouldn't have the poor the
masses of the take away the property of
the rich and Madison's solution was the
opposite we should reduce democracy mmm
and that's the way our system is
constructed you look back at the Madison
system the constitutional system power
was to be in the Senate Senate of course
was not elected remember powers in the
Senate which is Madison exclaimed
constitutes the wealth of the nation of
the more responsible set of men those
who sympathize with property owners and
their right the executive was mostly an
executive at the time so part in the
hands of the wealthy there is a house of
representatives and that's more
democratic that was then isn't now that
for all sorts of reasons but and that
had much less authority in power but was
democratic so we and the nor their
devices defection eliza's the population
and so on well the population didn't
really accept that it was a radical
population we've not been this long
struggle through American history to try
to the achieve the justice within the
democratic system and it's a bitter
class war that goes on all the time
we're now in a fury it less roughly
generation with the class worse turned
sharply and favor of extreme wealth so
you normally have the distribution of
wealth that I described but it also has
immediate consequences for effort
democracy and their num good work in the
political science and professional
political science studying attitudes and
policy and the correlation between them
we have a lot of information about
public opinion extensive bowling quite
good poles and the basic result that
comes out of the kind of gold standard
work
once Larry foretells and others is that
about seventy percent of the population
this essentially disenfranchised the
lower seventy percent and wealth and
income but their attitudes of no
influence on policy and as you go up the
income level you get slowly more
influence when you get to the very top
essentially get what they want well it's
a kind of democracy everyone's allowed
to push a button or something it's this
is nothing like a functional democracy
and that's probably one of the main
reasons why a lot of the population just
doesn't bother voting that it tends to
be the porter port nobody's really
investigated it but probably it's just
an intuitive understanding it than make
any difference I wish I bother and when
you get to the house of representatives
it's quite interesting but that began in
a constitutional system is a word
democratic part of the government not
the opposite some of the last election
2012 the Democrats got a considerable
majority but a small a small minority of
the seats for all kinds of reasons
including legislative gerrymandering the
role of money in the pot politics this
very good study but Thomas Ferguson to
the main political scientists who
studied the role of money in elections
and he's found that in the last
congressional elections there's almost a
perfect correlation between the
percentage of the camp funding that
candidate receives and the probability
of the candidates being elected to the
ticket see Republicans and you look at
the proportion of funding they received
as it goes up were elected almost a
straight line
the presidential election you know it
was over two billion dollars this time
now there's a lot of talk about how
money didn't work because you know
Sheldon Adelson's not a hundred million
dollars and didn't get what he want
that's not true everyone got who funded
got what they want the candidates who
were in office thanks to the huge
funding our beholdin to the funders they
are the ones who what their positions
effectively and if they want to stay in
office they're gonna have to go back to
them so that means they have to do what
they want wasn't a big surprise that
Obama when he came in 2008 a huge
support for the financial institutions
attorney to shining their shoes doing
what they thinking so let's get Cesar
Democratic nor just and the point you
made about voter apathy I think a horror
apathy the point you made about that I
think it resonates a lot especially with
students in universities such as anyone
you there's not only voter apathy and
why you to vote in general elections I
think there's just apathy about what
students can do within their schools to
demand some kind of change for example
NYU is considering its next huge massive
expansion plan it's called 2031 and of
course tuition is going to keep on
rising but virtually students are
completely not involved in the
decision-making process faculty as well
not are not involved very much so the
administration is making moves and it is
expanding and the students sort of
feeling well there's nothing I can do
about it I don't have a voice therefore
there's nothing I can do well it's kind
of drilled into our heads from childhood
there's nothing we can do but it's all
too big I think that's one of the
reasons for the crazy gun culture in the
country
a lot of people feel look I gotta defend
myself from cry from the government from
power or some head so get a gun mm-hmm
it's not my government like I can't
organize with other people in food right
actually an interesting reflection of
this is the attitude 30 taxes we become
a kind of a thought experiment and
imagine a functioning democracy mm-hmm
what would people feel about taxes well
April fifteenth would be this
celebration we're getting together to
fund the projects that we decided on
whom what's better than that right here
it's a it's a damn morning mmm because
some alien entity you know big thing out
there is hovering over us and it's going
to steal our money from us that's an
indication of how low the conception of
demography hmm it's substantially
because it doesn't bring about justice
mm-hmm if you want people to feel the
function of democracies but have to lead
to test out you all right very kind of
them yes and professor Chomsky think you
very much think you have a very tight
schedule ii of a call thank you for
making this section 401
