gnorm chumps kids here he is a political
activist he's a writer and his professor
at MIT he is written exclusively and
lectured around the world on linguistics
philosophy and politics he is widely
credited with having revolutionized
modern linguistics he is the author of
numerous books including American power
in the new mandarins and also 9/11 here
is hegemony our survival his newest book
I am pleased to have him on this program
for many reasons including the fact that
I get more emails about please have mr.
Chomsky on this program than anyone can
ever imagine how do you explain this
phenomenal connection between you and
certainly an audience of people who are
user-friendly with the internet it well
I think people who are there's an
enormous number of people who are
involved in a informal disorganized
activist dissident culture and they tend
to make their own connections outside
the major institutional channels which
are not not hospitable to them and the
Internet has been has become a major
form of interconnection organizing not
just in the United States everywhere I
mean in South Korea for example they
recently elected a president using the
internet for organizing and
communication and getting around the
strong opposition of the media and the
concentrated power to the popular
candidates which I would be very wired
up society a broad way and I think as a
higher penetration is South Korea
perhaps more than any other country
except Singapore it's happening everyone
that takes a Indonesia when the support
the dictatorship was overthrown in 1998
a lot of the organizing a lot of it was
student activism and they it was very
harsh brutal Society but they did
succeed through internet
interconnections to organize political
actions demonstrations
other activities and it was a major
factor leaving of leading to the
overthrow of the dictatorship
well Howard Dean I suspect would say
that one of the primary reasons you've
been able to get to this demanding
position in the Democratic race for the
presidency is is the internet allowing
in both to communicate and to raise
money yeah
it's had um it's a sort of a can also be
a lethal instrument but legal in what
way well I'm sure you get I don't don't
want to guess how many emails you get
better you can be yeah it can be
overwhelming I've done a lot of material
books are that one of the problems with
the internet I mean it's the good part
of it is it's free and open right
exactly of course that has a downside
that means that things go up that have
no review and they are you know
supporting the clock 10 o'clock this is
they clog the system and so it's a
mixture but it's it certainly has been
an extremely effective way of allowing
people to participate actively in in
even in everything from industrial
societies very repressive society so
take say the world Social Forum which is
a huge enterprise 100,000 people last
year it's mostly internet organized
there's just no other means of
intercommunication among highly diverse
people most of them are somewhat you
know out of the power centers in their
own societies and this provides them a
means of organizing exchanging
information interaction that gives an
access to a far wider range of sources
of information and analysis than they
would get by picking up the newspapers
at the newsstand and major effect do you
think regimes around the world ought to
be frightened of the possibilities of
the internet I'm sure they are including
our own government since the the
internet was like most modern technology
came out of the state system right they
were very a lot of the economy relies on
a dynamic state sector the internet was
developed in the Pentagon or somewhere
well it was the actually places like MIT
came
came out a Pentagon funding and event
the Advanced Research Project agency
depending on about early 60s and
remained inside the state system until
the mid 90s I think 1995 it was
privatized and since then it's changed I
mean it before that it was considered
the effect was called usually an
information highway after that it's
mostly called the e-commerce right and
the character of it changed but there
has been a lot of concern in power
centers all over the world that it's
just too free and open and the question
is how can you shape it and modify it so
as to lead people in preferred
directions no away from say organizing
the little Social Forum but yeah exactly
what for example the Chinese doing about
it do you know and China I think
internet access is quite restricted is
what I thought and highly censored I
don't know how much even limited access
there is but it's a very hard medium to
control exactly no one people have
access they can do all sorts of things
so the the means of controlling it I
that are being considered as far as I
understand are mostly trying to lead
people in particular directions so that
you when you enter an internet portal
you know you'll be sort of drawn off
disability here about that way and
therefore you'll have the are they
opening up it'll take you somewhere and
the idea is you'll have to use you know
energy and initiative and commitment and
what you're looking for or if you want
to go and the in the direction is less
preferred by power centers which is it's
a terrain of struggle right now there's
a lot of pressure from popular and
activist groups to make it leave it
entirely open not controlled if you were
if this would be your last day on earth
not that far from well you're 475 yeah
yeah
would would your would you like what's
said about you to be your political
arguments or your contribution to the
theory of linguistics
they the honest truth I really don't
care
you know I'm I'd like to see people
follow up on the things that are
interesting and important than
productive and forget about the things
that were Byways and mistakes and so on
but if I my name is attached to it or
not what would you characterize as most
important in your judgment if you are
well I mean I played a certain role in
reshaping the fields concerned with the
human intellectual faculties cognitive
sciences in particular linguistics some
of it has been extremely productive not
me it's cooperative enterprise and
that's often running on its own right in
the political domain and right I would
like to see people energized participate
thinking for themselves not
subordinating themselves to systems of
discipline and propaganda either in the
structure of life and there's play of
that or in the doctrinal domains so if
people can be can come to use the
capacities that they in fact have and
the opportunities in fact have to
overcome systems of authority
illegitimate Authority domination
hierarchy free themselves think through
issues for themselves not the way
they're taught to conform and do
something about it
that's the best legacy I can imagine as
I said you and you said that I know
nothing about linguistics it one of many
subjects I know nothing about but
especially linguistics if there is no
one question in the air in that whole
realm though that you would like most to
know the answer to no I like everyone
I've known personal quirks yes there are
some questions which are big mega
question that there are mega questions
which are on the border of research you
can't really they're little beyond what
you can study very much you can take a
pick away at them but
well one kind of question which is a
sort of a personal obsession is that if
you look at any biological language is a
biological system as part of error it's
like our immune system or visual system
just something humans have it's highly
specific to humans they don't seem to be
any counterparts elsewhere in nature
you're in New York because of our mutual
friend Edward Sayid - passed away
several month or so ago correct yeah and
you tell me what you tell me just
because you're here your sense of what
would you most want to say an
appreciation of him
well Edward was an old friend we're very
close friends three years we had a lot
of mutual interests we've maybe culture
music politics culture politics mainly
mainly political interests including his
prime concern also a major concern of
mine beliefs but a much broader
questions of justice freedom oppression
which he was much involved in me too and
our paths often crossed and then it was
just a close personal friendship
actually he had arranged I've never
talked about this much but back in the
guess it must have been around 20 years
ago or 25 years ago he began arranging
with meetings between high officials in
the Palestine Liberation Organization
when they were visiting New York
meetings with friends of his who were
sympathetic to the Palestinians critical
of PLO to see if there could be some
constructive discussion to suggest ways
in which they could change what they're
doing to achieve results which would
make more sense for the people involved
and I was involved in some of those
meaning he think I'm out of no have to
say you know what do you think of the
Geneva Accord that they've been current
Geneva Court yes exactly well it offers
better scenario though it's it's a great
improvement over the camp
David proposals which were completely
unacceptable by the Palestinian yeah
they made no sense you know in Jakarta
said that today they on a recent
appearance on this program really well
he's quite right and as soon as you look
at a map of what was proposed you see
that was absolutely unacceptable when it
broke up the others I've talked about
percentages and so on that didn't mean a
thing if you looked at the actual maps
that were discussed which unfortunately
we're not easily available in the United
States that should have been but they
weren't as soon as you look at the maps
you see that what an effect it did was
break the West Bank into three pretty
separate Canton's
so these were night it was territories
well they were technically contiguous
but only way around the edges I had to
go from Bethlehem to Ramallah you're
going to go way to the east and Lee so
the three effectively separated
territories all again effectively
separated from a little part of East
Jerusalem which is the center of
traditional center of Palestinian
cultural educational commercial
existence and it was a kind of a bantha
Stan situation as was discussed in
Israel at the time and that and of
course it was all separated from Gaza
well you know it's actually the meaning
of that was described by Barak Creek the
president barak chief negotiator Shlomo
venom II and later violence yeah and he
was the negotiator at Camp David and he
had he was an academic and shortly
before he entered the government he
wrote a book about it in Hebrew in which
he said the goal of the whole Oslo
process and leading to this that would
be what he called a permanent
neo-colonial dependency the Palestinians
would be a neo-colonial effectively
modern colonial dependency permanently
and in fact that's what the proposal was
and it couldn't work however after the
Camp David proposals broke down this is
now September 2004 September 2000 that's
when the current
father started but negotiations
continued and the made some progress in
January 2001 there were meetings in Taba
which led to a informal meetings but
with fairly high-level people on both
sides and they've made considerable
progress towards a more acceptable to
state settlement but it was too late
then because the Israelis were into
their election they were into the
election campaign and prime minister
Barak cancelled the meetings and after
Shirin was elected and the violence
began to escalate they were never picked
up everyone soon dies him too that they
were never continued however it turns
out now we've learned that contacts did
continue and the Geneva Accords that you
mentioned are the results of these
continuing contacts and they are they
make considerable progress beyond the
Taba the day before is hammered out by
Yoshi Belen and other Israelis and Khan
in over two years with Stadion supposed
and who's I'm not sure in part may have
been part of may have been members of
the Palestinian Authority or not I don't
know they some had been but all are
close to it I mean there is close to the
center of Palestinian Palestinian don't
have state so 11 informal authority but
they were as close to the central part
of it as the Israeli negotiators were to
the Israeli NGO in fact probably closer
you're further late it was I didn't have
much to say good about Yasser Arafat nor
did I know to you fact we were very much
in accord about this for a long time
some of the real disservice to the
Palestinians well it's a I don't think
one can say that exactly why is that
because he's also a symbol with without
him as a sample of mileage a statement
I'm asking so look he remained a symbol
of Palestinian nationality struggle
refusal to submit that's important right
I mean whatever you may think of him
personally just serving the role of
enabling people to resist harsh
oppression
probable destruction which was the goal
that's significant whatever you think
about his particular decisions and
choices and of those they're a mixture
so I I wouldn't I mean I was always
harshly critical you look at what I
wrote in the sixties it was critical
nevertheless there's there's a strain
which was on the right track so in the
mid 1970s Arafat did recognize that the
settlement would have to be to state
political settlement there was a
Security Council resolution debated in
January 1976 which was supported by the
PLO they publicly supported it which
called for a two-state settlement on the
international border with full
recognition of Israel's rights to peace
and security and so on and so forth that
was a good resolution
unfortunately the u.s. vetoed that and
then there was a process for a number of
years in which our effect in his
complicated way of which there's much to
criticize nevertheless one theme that
ran through it was trying to press for
such a settlement it the reason Israel
invaded Lebanon in 1982 was to try to
prevent these negotiate these efforts at
diplomacy to continue in fact they said
so publicly the it was an invasion to
secure the wizard and the invasion of
lemon yeah we should swear the palace
mihaylo restaurant at best and they
wanted to destroy the that it was called
and by the high command in fact a war
for the West Bank we have to stop the
negotiations which and the diplomacy
which was becoming an embarrassment and
let's get back to terror they are
happier with that and this continued for
some years and it's a sort of a mixture
of corruption terror violence bad
judgment and a continuing drive towards
what has to be what on the entire world
recognized must be some kind of
political settlement along the roughly
along the international
border with two states along 63 borders
subsea 77 1 roughly with some
modifications how do you actually I
should add and we should be willing to
recognize this the main reason this has
not taken place is that the US has
blocked it for 30 years
Alan laterally alsa well as I said it
vetoed the 1976 resolution vetoed
another Security Council resolution in
1980 that is a stuff Israelis are in
depend on it well you know we could
argue about exactly why but that he did
it
Israel didn't like but they could never
have blocked it if the US had impacted
meanwhile much more importantly the u.s.
provided means the diplomatic military
and economic support which enabled
Israel to continue slowly integrating
the territories effectively within
Israel the big settlement programs the
infrastructure programs and they can't
do it without us support and that's true
right this minute they could not they
can't do it without us support and they
know it your support in terms of in the
international community or us supported
at the UN for example very low in other
words you're suggesting there without
the US the overloon looming possible
veto at the Security Council or in some
other way that there would be some kind
of one every block
the size of a 90 economics and of Arab
reaction militarily without the u.s.
they can't stand the no small country
can stand alone against the unified
international community it's just
impossible there all kinds of ways of
stopping them and they need the economic
support in the military so that's a nice
segue to Iraq but I want to come back to
other things well you know and Israel
has been has become actually goes back
before 1976 the in 1971 that's where the
real split between the United States and
the world begins on this in 1971 the
president of Egypt the new president of
Egypt that presents Sadat offered Israel
a full peace treaty in return for
withdrawal from Egyptian territory and
said nothing about the West Bank nothing
about the Palestinians
full peace treaty recognizing
incorporating the main UN resolution 242
so the right to live in peace and
security and so on and so forth
everything nothing about the refugees
just in return for withdrawal from
Egyptian territory Israel discussed it
they knew that it was impossible we have
internal records and others actually
Yossi Beilin wrote a his doctoral
dissertation was in Hebrew about
revealing a lot of the records and discs
abba 'not records and other discussions
about this but it was also in the public
record now they had discussed the
question should they accept it now they
had a choice and it was a fateful choice
the choice was to accept peace with
Egypt it's the main military force which
would essentially end the military
conflict there were no other major Arab
military forces so accept peace with
Egypt have a still retain control of the
occupied territory they have to do
something about it because it was
another table wasn't on table and
integrate themselves somehow into the
region that was one choice the other
choice was to insist on expansion and
the crucial expansion at that time was
not the West Bank
it was northeastern China Egyptian
territory they wanted to expand into
northeastern Sinai and there were big
developments they are driving veterans
out of their homes and their billing
city in fact an old Jewish city and
northeastern Sinai that was a choice
that if they made the second choice as
they did that entailed dependency on the
United States because there was going to
be a situation of permanent conflict and
that was the choice that was made I
think was a very bad mistake but my
impression was and I'm again my
impression was that that in fact when we
had the agreement between Egypt 1978
yeah well it's like a Saturday the
agreement was it that these writers
withdrew and there as incident and in
fact Arrow Cherone came in and cleaned
up the settlements well no in in
northeastern China right yeah but it
seemed right about that all correct
the but that's only half the story by
1977 what the what happened in 71 is
the offer was made Israel rejected it
the crucial question is what would the
United States do well there was an
internal debate in the United States and
it was won by Henry Kissinger whose view
was as he described that that we should
keep to what he called stalemate meaning
no negotiations just work she was
opposed to an agreement in 1971 between
Egypt and Israel yes he would have led
to the withdrawal from the Sinai exactly
once again
now the reason at the Sun and be over of
diplomatic relations between the two
countries yes and that decided the
matter this is which you know the way
the u.s. goes sort of determines what
happens it's just but well no powerful
now when that led to a war Sadat III yes
he kept saying look if you only throw
from the Sinai there's going to be a war
nobody believed him
nobody took it seriously when the work
it word did come in 73 and it was a huge
shock it was close named for Israel
after the u.s. ended up earlier alert
after at that point
Kissinger recognized that you can't but
Egypt isn't a basket case you can't just
dismiss it then he began his shuttle
diplomacy and it goes on up to Camp
David finally said I 879 and at that
point so that uh the US and Israel
agreed to an offer that Sadat had
presented in 1971 but the new one was
harsher from the point of view of Israel
in the United States than the original
would have been better off except at 71
rather than the one was dividual from
their point of I judge honor said Jimmy
Carter yet they didn't see but in 71
there was nothing about the Palestinians
by 1977 the Palestinian issue was on the
table and the US and Israel had to
accept an order an offer which
recognized in some fashion Palestinian
national rights which they didn't want
to do I mean I think they should have
done it so I can't say it's worse but
they didn't want it now it's interesting
that this is described in the United
States as a diplomatic triumph in fact
it was a diplomatic at tast Rafi if that
had been accepted in 1971
Jimmy Carter was here several days ago
and he certainly thought it was the
diplomatic trying he probably doesn't
know the history I mean he should have
asked him whether he knows what happened
in the background well if I'd had this
interview before I wouldn't know it's
all on the public record you know what I
mean but that but you know this is one
of the many things we have to learn
about and if we want to make to gain
some understanding of what's really
happening there so when you ask
questions about say our I thought you
know unfortunately all this has to come
in okay fair enough uh but what's
interesting there I mean let me make
this point I spoke to someone about you
today and he said the following to me
someone who many views you would
recommend you would what agree with some
not he said me that after company your
mind the quality of the mind and
contributions you had made he said that
what you had done is turned American
exceptionalism on its back and that
you're for all those who believe in our
conception you had believed in exactly
the opposite whatever that is and let me
stay with this question on the other
hand there are people who have asked you
look if you have such strong feelings
about how wrongheaded American policy
has been why don't you leave the country
of frequent sort of thing is thrown at
people with critical frequently and you
always say I love this country
right I mean it's a very interesting
question let's let's try it on some
other country you know it's sometimes
easier to think about things clearly if
we just nettles okay now let's go back
to say our the beginning Soviet Union
right I mean the Russians would have
been delighted to have the dissidents
leave the country if soccer I wouldn't
William come West they would have
plotted what does it make sense to ask
soccer why don't you leave at the Soviet
Union I mean I know that's what you said
I'm not asking that question I'm asking
maxing that question the framing the
point that you've always said the
framework in which the country of the
question should be understood right it's
assuming that you can't have it and you
stay and fight for values because you
love the country and you know it and you
think that the country ought to
of up to these values and they're cut
you don't you can't rank countries ABCD
countries up all sorts of properties
there's a culture there's a society
there's modes of interaction and so on a
lot of the things that are simply
achievements now it takes a protection
of free speech it's unique in the United
States there are a lot of great things
that have been achieved there are a lot
of rotten things that have been done if
you can write if you have any concern
about the country meaning its people its
culture and so on you want to save and
extend and amplify the achievements and
modify the menu would protect no free
speech high up on that list of area
that's not the only one okay but tell me
more and then we'll come to some of the
criticisms because that you have made
about American imperialism and the like
see that's so we have to make a
distinction between state power and a
country the different things I
understand the different but it's often
not distinguished if you criticize state
policy you're not criticizing it I
understand that too I mean we first
unfrequently when you're traveling
around the world as I do you know people
say I love you know American just have a
policy I hate the policy if it's we're
responsible for the policy it's a free
country we can't say you know I don't
have any responsibility for the policy
because we do we may not know about it
but then we should find out about it and
if we decide we don't like it we should
change it in fact take a look at the
question we've just been discussing to
state settlement about two-thirds of the
American population supports the
international consensus on this and long
which is they ought to be a two-state
solution not roughly the 67 borders and
it's kinda you look at the polls
I mean polls will you find roughly
two-thirds of the population saying yes
I support that and roughly the same
proportion says the US ought to become
more involved in the diplomacy people
don't know that that's contradiction the
reason that that policy has that program
has not been achieved is because of
consistent
US intervention to prevent it from being
achieved and that continues at this very
moment in fact okay it is a free country
we've got a lot of freedom that means we
had people have the opportunity to dis
cover its work it's not going to come
easily that's where the internet is
going to have the opportunity to
discover the relevant facts and
background which should show them that
their position is contradictory they
must come to understand what the US
government role has been over the years
and preventing the outcome that they
want do you believe do you in the end
then if in fact accept the premise that
people get for the most part in our
democracy people get the government they
deserve no no you don't know and you
because you'll all let me finish because
you believe the political process is
corrupt and it's not it suits what look
see what everybody says look to me I
know they say if you guys like it's not
that simple right
I mean it's not that there's robbery and
stealing of elections there is a
distribution of power internal to the
country enormous disparity of economic
and other power and that influences
everything that happens in dramatic ways
so many issues simply don't come up in
election to the haves have more power
than to have nots in their overwhelming
you're able because I didn't really look
closely elections they restrict
themselves to issues on which the
population they eliminate issues where
the mass of the population opposes a
lead opinion systematically and the
populations awareness again I'm sorry
well let's take a concrete case okay the
year 2000 election saying among the
issues that were highest in concern to
the general population are things that
roughly relate to the so called trade
agreements so deficits overseas
investment that transfer of jobs you
know lots of topics like that did the
right at that time there was a plan for
a an International Hemisphere conference
at Quebec hemispheric summit three
months later which was intended to
extend the NAFTA type agreement to the
whole hemisphere now that's it these are
issues of enormous concerns right
did it come up in the election no now
there's a reason why it didn't come up
in the election and it's consistent on
those issues the public tends to oppose
policies on which there is an elite
consensus and therefore it doesn't come
up in elections
well that's whether it's like I said I
mean let me just make sure I understand
how do you stand yourself on the map to
agreement I agree with the general
population I think if you go with your
Lobby whose view is critical critical
for a cause
because it's the wrong agreement if you
go back to 1990 10 years ago and the
NAFTA agreement was coming along there
were serious critical analyses of it
which were in favor of the north
american free trade agreement but not
this one the analyses came from the
labor movement they came from Congress's
Research Bureau the office of Technology
Assessment pretty much the same analyses
said yeah a North agreement the North
American economic Rinne be a good idea
but this one is designed and as
effectively an investor rights agreement
it privileges rights of investors and
lenders at and it marginalizes the
rights of people and what are you've
already done there were you worried
about the loss of jobs and those kinds
of issues that became a political
football on unions essentially were
opposed to that's the story that's not
true not in other words you're saying
that then they they mislead us when they
made that argument no that Union did not
make they never made an argument that we
were opposed because they obviously
mentioned that but the labor movement
had an official position it was produced
by the labor Advisory Council along
detailed analysis and it was a very
sensible position it was never given it
never entered the media discussion it
was never given any publicity the labor
market the labor movement was accused of
crude nationalism the setting the other
thing it was not their position their
actual position never made it to the
public agenda and and the same is true
of Congress's own Research Bureau which
had a rather similar analysis yes in
favor of NAFTA style agreement but not
that one it's kind of interesting that a
few days ago the Carnegie Endowment
released an a now
of NAFTA say fairly critical analysis it
was reported in the press making some
proposals to how it should have been
done and those proposals though they
didn't say so happen to be very similar
to those that were proposed by the labor
movement and Congress's research we were
10 years ago but didn't enter the
political discussion was not mentioned
in the media for example well this is
only one example of which there are
numerous ones basically saying that what
you argue is that people are not getting
the information they need to make wise
choices they aren't you
nor in fact are they given the choice
they aren't given the choice it's also a
20-mile anova where the two parties
nominate in an election know that they
have but the two parties represent
essentially the same concentration of
interests of economic power the United
States is essentially a one-party state
it has two factions of the business
party in fact one of the leading one of
the leading political science analyses
of the nature of the u.s. party system
by a fine political sciences the you
know receive Massachusetts Tom Ferguson
is what he calls the investment theory
of politics investors get together to
invest the control you let me ask you
this let's take two or three countries
with you and I know okay we have two
parties in the United Kingdom right
we're the Tory part of the Labour Party
is would you say the same thing about
them - essentially it depends went right
today what today today it's today it's
close to perfect and frame of their
advance you have you have a Socialist
Party and a you know the chirag all's
party essentially the same I mean they
don't know not up not a whole lot of
differences there may thirty five
regulars but we can explain in Spain we
have Socialist Party and well I'd say I
would suggest we take is any different
in any of those countries in terms of
how much difference is there are because
let me restaurants up there let me make
this re with you and just get there
essentially in most countries the battle
in politics is for the center is it not
in most places now that doesn't mean
that that's simply not true whether
there are countries that have a much
more lively democratic culture so let's
take a country that has a really lively
Democratic culture much more than we do
like Brazil okay Brazil is a rich
potentially rich important country in
Brazil something just happened recently
which should humiliate us big it's a
real lesson in democracy in Brazil
popular movements Matt large-scale
popular movements which has been
developing over 20 years reached the
scale
where they were able to elect a populist
president over the opposition of highly
concentrated capital and media
concentration we can't even dream of
that well that's a functioning
Democratic culture let me let me stop
you for a second we just get a couple of
questions in number one I asked that
question recently of Garry wills was
here you know why haven't we seen in the
United States more success by a powerful
coalition essentially coming from the
left but but not necessarily defined by
what the conception traditional
Commission was might be of the left of
Labor and re-poll we have black and
white Ranson what was it the last time
number of times we saw it with certain
sixties that's where the Great Society
programs come from we saw it in the 30s
that's where the New Deal comes from and
in fact this is a battle that goes back
to the origins of American history you
know the original constitutional
framework the wave matters author the
Great Society programs was Lyndon
Johnson that's right and he reaped the
programs are not initiated by leaders
that's a serious misunderstanding those
programs were initiated primarily by
people who actually many of them who'd
served with FDR see that's a serious
misinterpretation I believe of the way
the political system works leaders may
sign their names and they may push
programs but they do it because a
popular constituency is compelling them
to do it that's the way changes take
place I mean if there's a large-scale
popular movement and there are pressures
there will be somebody will say I'm your
leader you know all the since you've
made been silent in this the programs
that came out of the so-called Great
Society were the result of popular
ferment
and activism and changes that were
taking place significant changes that
were taking place in the 1960s which
very much democratize the society and it
led to these programs since then there's
been an enormous counter-attack from
business sectors trying to beat it back
and that's the course of history you
know that it's the same with the civil
rights movement of the same with the
liberal but let me let me make this
point balance got a lot of other things
and I want to say that we were 42
minutes in we're doing an hour with you
and I want to invite you back because
inevitably people are going to say to me
you know you could have gone for two or
three hours in min of them you know or
they will say you interrupt you too much
or they say a lot of other things and I
do want to hear from you and you know
many people many people so Lyndon
Johnson you know as a man who had was
too beholden to economic interest in
terms of how achieved his own wealth and
in terms of a whole range of things
whether it was brown rude in Texas or
whether his relationship with a whole
lot of institution but you were saying
that he responded the way he did to
Great Society programs having to do with
medical care having to do with poverty
having to a whole range of issues and
responded and civil rights pressure
because the public pressure was a master
of Jonathan and I'm willing to argue
with you that Lyndon Johnson responded
in part because that was where his heart
was and his sense of legatee in terms of
what had enclosed him and and secondly
he'd some of the things that John
Kennedy responded to he saw his
opportunity in history in a sense to
show that he could get these things
enacted because that was his principal
skill so we're not disagreeing about
different topics but you're the topic
that you're talking about it's
individual personalities so the
individual personality Lyndon Johnson
was going on in his mind the topic that
I'm talking about is how popular
movements develop create their own
programs press for them finally often
get somebody to initiate them those are
different question and I mean honey does
I me agree with you actually I mean I
look with great interest in what's
happening in Brazil and I know it's
happened here that's that's why why do
we have freedom of speech the freedom of
speech is not in the Constitution it's
not in the Bill of Rights in fact up
until the 19th it's not
up until the 1960s in fact the legal
battles about freedom of speech are
mostly in the 20th century and there was
no real legal protection for substantial
freedom of speech actually until the
sixties in the 1960s the Supreme Court
finally first in the course the civil
rights movement then later in the decade
finally realized a level of legal
protection of freedom of speech that to
my knowledge doesn't exist in any other
country and if a large part of it grew
out of the activism just to understand
you because I want to go to some things
that are often attached to you and bring
great controversy to you other than
freedom of speech what else do you think
it is is part of what America you know
represents yeah represent is well it's
about American like what a lot of things
I like that are great about American
life for one thing we have compared to
other societies there's very little in
the way of a kind of a caste system so
people would interact independently of
social position is there autocracy there
is in certainly in terms of policy
formation that's overwhelming but we're
talking in terms of personal interaction
are you does it matter whether you're
this is your what you'll do or that's
what you do
well these interactions among people
informal interactions are in my view
much healthier in the United States than
other societies that I know now those
are important facts about a culture my
freedom speech is not just a matter of
law it's a matter of being internalized
you know realizing understanding that's
my right I'm going to defend it that's
important and the same is true of other
rights actually the United States has
become a much more civilized society
since the 1960s just in our recent
lifetime cause do you think well because
of popular activism
let's take women's rights was that an
issue 40 years ago no environmental
issues do they exist forty years ago no
let's take something like opposition to
aggression and violence but that
attitudes and that have changed enormous
Lee I mean when John F Kennedy attacked
South Vietnam as he did in 1962 direct
attack
fascination of zoomable now when the
u.s. accepts that they're supportive I
mean so little there was so little
opposition to this that no one even
knows what happened but if you look back
at the record the historical and
documentary record it's not
controversial in 1962 Kennedy sent the
US Air Force to start bombing South
Vietnam they did it in South Vietnamese
planes with Vietnamese markings but it
was US pilots and us equipment thin
cover he authorized the use of napalm he
started the crop destruction programs to
keep food from the indigenous rebels
women he started driving the Williams
but I got look this is a war was there
any purpose no okay now that's changed
but let me also maybe somebody wasn't
significant look I can tell you because
I was directly involved well you've got
you to know you because of your position
to me I couldn't get four people in a
room to talk about I you I don't say you
argue about it was but this is important
about the country it was four or five
years before a significant popular
movement developed opposing an
aggressive war against another country
let's fast forward to today right in
this year there were huge popular
protests before the war was officially
launched that's a tremendous change in
conscious and why do you think I changed
it because of the six is because of you
won't we because as it breathes it gets
wider and stronger and the change took
place because a lot of people work very
hard to make it change place the same is
true of civil rights of women's rights
of environmental issues and so on
well that's the way change has happened
and what it says one thing happened in
Brazil the popular movements developed
that way not by some leaders saying I
agree I do agree with you on that I'm
not arguing that but the interesting
thing about Brazil now you know which is
a worthy of a program here and he is
somebody that I'd like to I've heard him
speak and with lightness see him at the
table is is he's running he is
disappointing some of his followers
there because of some positions he's
taking having to do with the rainforests
and other issues you know why why
because there are you know so much about
everything
check it see this right now I'm not
trying to persuade you like no here's
what I think and I think if you
investigate this way you'll find I over
the last 20 or 30 years in part as a
reaction to the Democrat democratizing
tendencies of the 60s which were
worldwide
right they were dramatic here but also
elsewhere there's been a backlash part
of the back let's taken many forms one
of the forms it's taken is international
economic Arrangements which are
virtually designed to undermine
democracy
well these what's called in the rest of
the world neoliberal arrangements here
it's called free trade but it's not free
trade the array of international
arrangements that's sort of formalized
in the World Trade Organization those
measures if you look at them are it is
well understood that they undermine
democracy one of the first measures that
was taken in the early 70s initially
here but then everywhere was the free up
flow of financial capital I get you I
need to move on because like a few
minutes that's my boat just once
I won't try to explain anything but let
me just say that if you look at these
arrangements you'll find that they
undermine democracy and they place
countries in a stranglehold in which
they cannot follow the policies of the
overwhelming majority and that's what's
happening in Brazil and that's why
that's disappointing it's okay I know
I'm alone I talked to someone else
knowing that you were coming and they
said you know I was in each I was in the
Iraq recently recently and I meant no
Iraqi who said the war was a mistake
lots of them in the idea of overthrowing
Saddam even now and and many of them
wished the United States would leave
many of them have terribly disappointed
upset opposed to the way things are
going but this person didn't meet anyone
he tell me how you feel about the use of
American power in overthrowing Saddam
was it because it violated your own
sense of international law was it
because that we didn't have
wasn't a um an issue people answered
question because the assumptions are
wrong okay go ahead the United States
was not in favor of overthrowing Saddam
Hussein in fact George Bush made that
explicit said he sorry nobody right a
third summit a couple of days before the
invasion started bush and Blair were
there and they issued a declaration in
which Bush said even if Saddam Hussein
and his family leave the country we're
going to late anyway and in fact that's
consistent with a long-standing US
policy you're you're right that every
I'm sure every sane person in Iraq one
of your rid of Saddam is saying is like
I have 420 meters just like we all have
a murderous tyrant right why is he there
why wasn't he overthrown or to ask
another question why do the majority of
Iraqis the Lord when Iraqis are at with
the published polls Iraqis are asked
who's your favorite foreign leader the
favorite foreign leader of Iraqis
accorded the us-run polls is President
Chirac of France who was the symbol of
opposition to the invasion George Bush
is far below layer even less below
nevertheless the same polls show say
yeah we're glad to get rid of Saddam
Hussein well if we want to think about
this we'll be able to figure out what's
happening sure they would like to get
rid of Saddam Hussein they would have
liked to gotten rid of him years ago I'm
in 1991 they want did you rid of him but
the u.s. supported Saddam so that he
could crush the rebellion which probably
would have ever thrown him and we know
why I'm not sure they support him so
that he could they authorized him they
effectively authorized him to crush the
rebellion sure that they're many pits
what but you got let's look back at
least let me to make one point is that I
mean it clearly was a mistake in 1991
who was it in the city it sure it was
allowing him to allow him to arch the
rebellion stay as I do too did George
Bush Snickers mistake no did Thomas
Friedman of the New York Times think it
was mistake I can't speak for George
digit Thomas tree well did the New York
did the press think it was a mistake
let's take a look back and look at the
allow him to imitate helicopters and be
able to crush take a look at the
analysis
the analysis and exec asked to who had
asked to rise up let's take a look as
the analyses at the time that's what we
should be looking at the you know you
can read it in say the New York Times
most important newspaper in the world
their analysis was Alan Cowell their
Middle East correspondent that much as
we dislike the atrocities there's an
overwhelming consensus that Saddam
Hussein offers more hope for the
stability of the country stability the
kind of technical word stability the
country then the people who are trying
to overthrow in other words we'd rather
have him than the people are trying to
overthrow in Thomas Friedman maybe they
were Thomas Friedman who was a
diplomatic cars chief diplomatic
correspondent wrote the best possible
solution for the United the best
possible world for the United States
would be an iron-fisted military hunter
ruling Iraq the same way Saddam Hussein
did much to the South sure of this
electrometer sure he does mean using the
torture in losing the technique yes then
why did he say it well but he may very
well have believed that was a neighbor
way he must he may very well first of
all I'm leery of speaking for anyone
like this right George Bush or Tom
Friedman but he may very well have meant
that that Iraq because of whatever fears
he had they would break up the
balkanization of a robber and therefore
he needed it Tito let's say array of men
let's say or up and then see that means
that from the point of view of US policy
makers and US commentators it wasn't a
mistake I think it was a mistake you
think mistake but they didn't write the
the analysts and the policymakers
thought it was right
well I preferred and then let's look
like that you the neocon so you final so
much fall in there did not think it was
a mistake we don't know the I mean they
were they willful wits of the world
probably don't know like it was let's
take a look at the Kotwal overthrown
suppose I mean they've been driven by
overthrowing Saddam since 1991 you'll
agree with that won't you no I don't
that they hadn't been driven by the
notion it's just too narrow question
let's take a look at the Wolfowitz s of
the world okay he has a record right
right his record is for example strong
support of General Suharto
who is exactly 30 served in Indonesia
and afterwards up until 1997 a couple of
months before so heart that was
overthrown he was still praising him so
hard there was a mass murderer probably
worse than Saddam Hussein he came into
power killing couple hundred thousand
people he ran a regime of vicious
torture and oppression he invaded East
Timor practically destroyed it
his torture and massacres were going on
right to the end of his rule Wolfowitz
was praising him because of his
contributions to the growth and
development of Indonesia actually so it
served as ambassador to Indonesia this
started when he was in the State
Department with responsibility for Asia
Southeast Asia in particular went on was
in he was in as ambassador to Indonesia
and it continued through his post
government service and he was D when it
will give away one example as under his
watch as State Department high official
in the State Department with
responsibility for Asia the Reagan
administration under his watch supported
a whole range of murderous dictators
like Chun of South Korea support him up
alone but that began make sure they were
done and I'm not sure when he came into
what he didn't run out whole South
American administration which is your
point exactly whole series of merck
administration's supported a whole
series of leaders in South Korea
absolutely and Wolfowitz was responsible
is in charge almost in charge in a
second-in-command State Department right
up to the end Marcos and the Philippines
another let me know they're all kind of
thick stories being concocted about this
now but I would urge people to go back
to the original record and see what
happened all right
this book noam chomsky hegemony or
survival America's quest for global
dominance we'll talk more about all
these issues with him and others I thank
you for coming great as you can see the
program thank you very much thank you
for joining us we went the hour more to
be said tomorrow night
Tony Martin is here and others see you
then
you
