people who hear the books actually
invent new books I think are generally
students and intellectuals and it seems
to me one of my concerns and I expressed
it to you before is the huge split
between the intellectual left the petty
bourgeois intellectual left and the
workers whose concerns him to be very
different now and there is a huge
difference you see for example in in
many countries when you complain about
the far right
well the far higher does actually get
the workers vote in many places using
overwhelmingly and the people who vote
on the left then to be you know
intellectuals teachers students and so
on so there is a big split there is a
sort of a strange situation there I'm
speaking for my own experiences mostly
the United States and I and England the
other place where I'm often I don't to
some extent I agree but I don't think
it's as sharp was that I mean I speak to
trade union groups they're working
people they've read the books my own
background from childhood was with my
family was a working-class mostly
unemployed working-class in the 30s very
literate high literary culture many of
them never even never went past
elementary school but they were going to
Shakespeare plays discussing the latest
concert of the Budapest string quartet
reading Freud and steckel and debating
fine points of Psychiatry reading of
course all the left literature that's
pretty typical of working class culture
and it goes right back to the 19th
century you go back to the 19th century
it was both in Britain in the United
States and it was also true of the
radical workers and in France and
Germany they had a high level of
intellectual culture yeah that we're
reading serious material in fact part of
their condemnation in their own they had
their own working class press it was
quite Lively the presses in the United
States for example it was written by
then Irish artisans from Boston or young
women from the farms who went into the
textile mills and one of their
complaints was that the industrial
system was destroying their intellectual
culture in fact one of the major
activities of left intellectuals in the
1930s was to reach out to the general
public with science mathematics high
culture workers education a lot of that
has declined but it doesn't have to
disappear and I don't think it totally
has disappeared I mean a lot of the you
know the mail I get and the people who
show up at talks or the people without
much you know people by now everybody's
going to high school at least as
distinct from my own family but without
advanced degrees that people are just
interested it's I don't disagree with
what you're saying there is a dish more
of a break than there oughta be but they
don't have to be and I think it can be
overcome
