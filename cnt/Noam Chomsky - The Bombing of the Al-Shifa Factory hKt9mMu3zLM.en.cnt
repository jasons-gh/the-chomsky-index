the point is you bomb anybody you want
to let's take 1998
so it's before it in 1998 - here's
another thinker not allowed to say in
the United States or the West it leads
to hysteria but I'll say it in 1998
Clinton the major pharmaceutical plant
in the Sudan okay that was this is the
plaintiff using most of the
pharmaceuticals and very veterinary
medicines for a poor African country
that's under embargo can't replace him
was that going to do it's obviously like
killing no numbers of people in fact the
u.s. bought an investigation by the UN
so we don't know of course you don't
investigate your own crimes but there's
some evidence so the German ambassador
who was a fellow at Harvard University
and to to Sudan wrote an article in the
Harvard international review and which
he estimated the casualties in the tens
of thousands of deaths the researcher
for the head of the Near East foundation
very respectable foundation of the
National Director that fueled work in
Somalia in sue then he did a study and
he came out the same conclusion probably
tens of thousands did right after the
bombing within weeks
Human Rights Watch issued a warning that
there's going to be a human name
humanitarian catastrophe and give
examples of aid workers being pulled out
from areas where people were dying at a
fast rate Sean I can't mention this any
mention of this it brings the same
hysteria
as opposed I think the bombing of the TV
station so mentionable it's a Western
crime and therefore it was legitimate
we're not I mean just suppose that al
Qaeda
blew up half the pharmaceutical supplies
in the US or England or Israel or any
country in which people live human
beings not ants people
the reaction of a nuclear war but when
we do it to a poor African country
didn't happen not discussed in fact the
only issue that is discussed worth
discussion is whether the intelligence
was correct when it claimed that it was
also producing chemical weapons that is
the only question mention anything else
the usual hysteria and tyrants
this is a very disciplined Western
intellectual culture is extremely
disciplined and religion you cannot go
beyond fixed bounds
it's not you know it's not censored it's
all voluntary but it's true it's not
generally not pillory societies like
this in fact a major if the third world
countries are different so it takes a
turkey half third world
I mean Turkey the intellectuals the
leading intellectual now best-known
writers academics journalists artists
and they not only protect atrocities
like the Kurdish massacres they protest
them constantly but they're also
constantly carrying out civil
disobedience against you
I participated with them sometimes on
the little publish and banned writings
which referred it present them to the
prosecutor's office demand to be
prosecuted that's not a joke you know
facing sometimes that they are sent to
prison that's no joke
you
