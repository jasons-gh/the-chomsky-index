you mentioned global warming so it's
very interesting the way that's
portrayed in the media it's portrayed as
if there's two sides we have to the
objectives of fifty percent for each one
side is like ninety nine percent of
scientists or the other side is Rush
Limbaugh Sarah Palin Jim Inhofe three
guys that they have contrarian isms in
the science minute so we give them equal
time and then house the ordinary
citizens gonna figure it out actually
the New York Times had a front-page
story a couple days ago about the
interesting controversy that's taking
place between climates scientists and
what they call meteorologists and the
people who appear on television to tell
you it's not random are and they differ
so how's the ordinary citizens gonna
figure it out well you know you don't
want it first of all it should be
pointed out the exactly three sides
there's not - there's the mainland the
mainstream scientific consensus and
there's two groups that of denialists
that one of them is the one that's given
equal time senator Inhofe Rush Limbaugh
with this another one which is very
significant major groups of scientists
who think that the mainstream analyses
are nowhere near grave enough there's
very serious where from an MIT just came
out with a big study there scientists
saying the reality is far worse than
what's predicted well they're not part
of the debate okay so what's the
ordinary citizens going to do well it's
not gonna become a climate scientist but
you know the choices in this case are so
transparent that it doesn't take a lot
of work to figure it out I mean what's
the chances that
the overwhelming majority of the climate
scientists are all over the place
either the ones who say it's very grave
or the others who say zhing worse as you
claim what are the probability that
they're wrong and Russian applause right
it's it's not a hard decision you don't
have to be an expert there's another
point to be made about all of this if
you try to think through the
cost-benefit analysis suppose the people
who deny it are correct and you do
something about it
okay you've spent some money doing
things you probably should have done
anyway you know like more renewable
energy and so on but the total cost does
it cost you something I suppose on the
other hand that the consensus is right
if you don't do anything human species
is probably down the drain okay those
are the costs you have decimate that's
not particularly subtle
