well let's take a look at the Internet
the internet was developed for about 30
years completely by the public it all of
the the software the hardware you know
the satellites I mean everything about
it was completely within the public
domain the packaging systems all these
new designs in fact they don't the only
part that wasn't created by the public
in the United States was created by the
public in Europe the basic ideas for the
world wide web came out of CERN you know
the International laboratory in Geneva
which is again a international
government laboratory that's virtually
the whole story after about 30 years of
this just right now last two or three
years it's handed over to private power
so yeah Bill Gates it was difficult
parasite kind of watching on the outside
absolutely no interest now wants to take
over the internet and is heading to do
it and the private power is not being
secret about what they intend to do what
they want to do is take this system
developed at public expense initiative
of India's technology and so on and use
it for two purposes one purpose is for
what's called an intranet that is to
carve out big pieces of it which are
simply used for purposes of corporate
transactions so if General Electric
wants to have no interactions between
its office and you know New York Zurich
or wherever they are you know andand and
so on they'll have this closed system
with firewalls that you can't break into
it and that will just be for them and
similarly for other big corporations
other major private tyrannies
so that'll be a large part of the public
system and the rest of it is supposed to
be used this kind of like a home
marketing service to try to turn people
into passive consumers you know
you and the tube that's the social unit
on which society is constructed so you
don't have to worry about interacting
thinking people doing really bad things
like those folks in the slums of
port-au-prince couple years ago but
they'll people will be passive and
obedient and hooked on consuming for
themselves not caring about anyone else
and then you really won't have to worry
much about the Dane the threat of
democracy which that's the idea
meanwhile massive propaganda and the
ideological institutions cultural search
of teaches you all sorts of mantras and
so on and so forth that's pretty much
the way the story works I think at any
point where you look at it in detail so
anyhow my suggestion is take this
slogans and look at them you know take
them apart see what they actually mean
when you look at them in practice where
do they work where don't they work how
do they work what are the results I
think you find a picture that's very
very different from the conventional
