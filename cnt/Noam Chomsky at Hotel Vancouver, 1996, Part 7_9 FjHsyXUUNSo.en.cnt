going off as well and recently the
Secretary of Labor in the US and the
minister of industry in Canada have both
made well fairly tapping tepid comments
about the the conduct of corporations
laying off workers when their profits
are skyrocketing and I just want to hear
your comments on that well first of all
a officers at least of it I mean for
about 20 years now nah wages wait is
that in the ice again I only know the
detailed figures for the United States
and Europe I don't know them for Canada
but in the United States at least let me
talk about that I don't think it's much
different here around the early
seventies wages started to stag real
real income started to stagnate and by
around 1988 started decline so if you
take the median wage you know half below
have booked it's been declining fairly
steadily since around nineteen eighty
that continued right through the Clinton
recovery the Clinton years the recovery
was in fact the growth was faster than
during the Reagan years but it was
unprecedented and that wages kept going
down so I think something like the
preferred number ninety five percent or
so of the family some very high number
lost family income from 89 1989 mundra
sessions but through 1993 which is after
the recovery and it's the last year for
which we have figures and it's probably
still going down for what they call
unskilled workers which means like 70 to
75 percent of the workforce they've lost
about twenty percent or so of income
since about nineteen eighty that's the
core of this you know angry voicemail
phenomena and so on what you can in to
peeling to for college graduates wages
started going down around nineteen
eighty-seven after the
effect of the Reaganite social changes
hit and they're still going down so
there's so laughs is one aspect of it
but the other aspect is just a general
collapse a general attack on working
people across a very broad spectrum and
at the same time corporate corporate
profits are just uh no breaking all
records if you read fortune and Business
Week and so on they can't even find the
adjectives anymore to describe how
stupendous and dazzling and so on it is
last year if your fortune has every
fortune magazine of the big business
magazine every what may has an issue
devoted to the fortune 500 the top 500
corporations and last the one last May
was really pretty pretty impressive I
mean they couldn't get over how
fantastic was fourth straight year of
double-digit profit growth you know
fifty four percent profit growth last
year they expected to continue after
four years of it so the country is just
flooded with capital you know it's not
lean and mean or anything like that
absolutely flooded with capital more and
more narrowly concentrated well for most
of the populations either stagnation or
decline well layoffs is one aspect of
that that happens to be hitting the
newspapers now but it's pretty small
aspect of the whole picture well that's
you know these are the results of very
definite social policy back starting in
the early 70s pretty powerful new
weapons were placed into the hands of
private Erinyes what we call private
business which is just big totalitarian
institutions basically unaccountable
ones and they got a lot of new weapons
to beat people over the head with and by
what the main one being the huge
explosion of financial markets which was
just an extraordinary and scale and
that's had an enormous effect I mean I'm
give you some of the numbers if you like
they're really mine
the effects were already understood by
the late seventies pretty well
understood that this was going to drive
down growth rates concentrate will lead
to a kind of low-wage low growth high
profit equilibrium but that's the only
part of it the another aspect of it is
that there is now tremendous pressure
from invest from financial markets you
know big money managers which have huge
amounts of capital in their hands and
can move it around very fast one effect
of contemporary telecommunications is
you can take say the whole new york
banking system and put it in tokyo ever
sucked every every day you know so you
can use the financial markets over there
and make a little more money and then
using over here and make a little more
money i mean that's why you have it
takes a MIT you know science engineering
school their corporate recruiters to
come around every no may-june to try to
pick up the smart guys in the science
and engineering the ph DS last year
twenty five percent of them are from
Wall Street corporate recruiters they
were going after math and physics PhDs
these guys don't know anything about
Wall Street but they're smart guys who
know how to work out complicated scams
that will enable you to get a tiny bit
more profit by you know some intricate
device in speculative markets that's
having a huge effect on the
international economy and the domestic
economy for example it's forcing it's
forcing corporations to move towards a a
manager a guy who's doing the actual you
know the guys in a management position
in a corporation to say the CEO or the
guys in the board of directors it's
forcing them to look for a very
short-term profit because if they don't
go for a very short-term profit there's
going to be a rapid exit of capital to
somewhere else which is getting
short-term profit and that's having it
probably has worked it out yet but
there's a general assessment that this
is having a very harmful effect on the
economy altogether just as the rapid
transfer of that's the enormous growth
of capital that's used for speculation
against currencies is also having a
tremendous effect it moves towards it
attacks any any any country even a big
country like the United States that
tried to injure it stimulative measures
capital would flow out of it really fast
because this capital does not want
growth what they want to stable
currencies and growth can threaten
stable currency so they want low growth
stable currencies no inflation
tremendous profits and wages going down
and at home you're getting pressures
against the immuno private enterprise
never does much long-term planning but
whatever there is this pressure against
it because you want to make sure that
you have high profits the next quarter
or else you want to lose the capital
that can move around very fast now so
these things are having big effects and
they started around the early seventies
and have been expanding ever since and
there are others you know what they call
globalization you know the huge there's
been a considerable escalation of trans
Nationals and so on and so forth and in
different ways than in the past they're
doing different things than these two do
they always been around but all of these
are putting very powerful weapons into
the hands of private power and they're
using it to try to
unravel the social contract that has
been established after lots of struggle
they attack on labor incidentally is
part of it so in the United States as
you know unionization has gone way down
but it isn't a large part of that is I
don't like the term conspiracy and I
don't use it much but this is real
conspiracy there was a state corporate
conspiracy in the 80s very blatant state
corporate conspiracy to destroy unions
now corporations have always wanted to
destroy unions but they were but state
power in the 80s essentially authorized
it and pretty openly the only place
where I've seen really good reviews of
this is in the business press which are
very frank about it businessweek for
example at very good stories about it
how the government basically hold the
private sector from the early 80s
they're simply not going to enforce the
laws so do what you like you know and in
fact the number of illegal firings of
organizers shot up I went up by like a
factor six or something the number of
the corporations were told that OSHA the
safety and health organ office of safety
and health but something or other you
know the government office that looks
after safety and health standards would
simply not enforce standards and in fact
the number of days the number of working
days lost to injury went up by about
fifty percent very quickly and that's
across the board illegal firings the use
of it has been technically legal in the
United States since the late 30s to use
permanent replacement workers United
States may be one of the few industrial
countries where this is even on the
books but it's after the Wagner Act was
packed in a past 29 35 which sort of
good for the first time gave workers the
right to organize that they had an
interested
every other industrial country Supreme
Court very quickly undercut it within a
few years and technically allowed the
right to hire permanent replacement
workers which is much worse than scabs
notice but the balance of forces we
