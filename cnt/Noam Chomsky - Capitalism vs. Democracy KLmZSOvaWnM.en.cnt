we have to decide first what we mean by
capitalism and what we mean by democracy
if we mean by democracy that citizens
have a equal share in participating in
determining decisions that affect the
society then capitalism in any form is
inconsistent with democracy because it
radically in most formal I should say
there is a form of capitalism which
could be consistent with democracy it's
the kind that Adam Smith advocated
at Adam Smith was in favor of equality
they call it a vacuum in fact one of his
main arguments for markets is that under
conditions of pure Liberty they will
lead to equality it's not a good
argument but that was the argument if
that could happen which it can't then
you could say yes possibly it's
consistent with democracy otherwise
capitalism's and really exist any form
of really existing capitalism that's
likely to exist it will have sharp
inequalities it's based on hierarchy
domination production for profit not
need accumulation from accumulation of
capital deprivation of others the
subordination of people who have to sell
that are they were in order to survive
and of course that's going to translate
automatically into any political
arrangement which will yield one or
another form of plutocracy we happen to
have a pretty extreme form right now so
but so for example right now in the
United States about roughly 70% of the
population lower seventy percent on the
incomes Gill have no influence
whatsoever on policy influence increases
slowly as you move up the scale at the
very top the question doesn't arise
because they've set the policy so
that's it's it's democracy in the sense
you're allowed to push a button every
couple years but it's a choice between
factions of a business party with
extremely enormous disparity of
influence over policy you can see that
very clearly you can see it's just like
in fact it
what's one the main topics studied in
professional political science compare
polling results on attitudes with policy
so for example that's the big one for
about 40 years now there have been
regular polls asking people what do they
think about tax policy and large
majorities are in favor of much higher
taxes on the rich and on the corporate
system policy does the opposite
direction
and the same is true minimum wage
National Health just by any topic you
look at is a huge divergence and that
simply reflects the fact that capitalism
and anything like the form we have at
least is inconsistent with democracy and
you can see why virtually any quasi
capitalist that arrangement would have
similar problems so the profit of a
conclusion is the opposite of what
Friedman says of course he must mean
something different by democracy he may
mean the right to push a button every
four years
