stakeholder means workers and community
there's no economic reason economic
principle that says they that a
corporation has to work solely for the
benefit of shareholders in fact you can
read the business literature that you
could just as well have a corporate
system in which the stakeholders are the
ones who were involved and the fact they
can move in and take over as happens
when you get the real worker community
ownership there's various intermediate
means like a CO determination in German
enterprises gives the union's a
substantial state part in degree of
decision-making
I'm it's limited but something it's not
community its unions but it can just
well be community you know once you have
worker ownership that workers live in
the community and that already begins to
lead the community involvement through
the families and friends the
associations neighborhood associations
churches whatever it could be so it's
kind of a matter of degree but wherever
you have real worker ownership that's
going to happen so there's a of course
one huge example that's Mondragon which
is both you know I don't want to say
it's utopia is a lot wrong with it but
it's a major very successful
conglomerate production finance
hospitals schools housing and it's a
that's owned by the participants workers
in community
those big sit-down strike it uh Chicago
enterprises Republic windows a couple
years ago conglomerate wanted to close
it worker sat in the finally managed to
keep it now they've taken it over they
were able to the conglomerate of every
multinational whoever it was just want
to get rid of it they they were able to
buy majority shares it's now
worker-owned and I was just in Ireland
recently and there was a big sit-down
strike at a a planet the vita court that
accept miss cold and I when I was there
I was able to meet with the workers who
would led the strike I got a lot of
community support you know people in the
community were bringing food and so on
was some rich businessman wanted to
close it they they kind of they win
everything but they won a lot from the
sit-down strike for them it was a kind
of a victory
