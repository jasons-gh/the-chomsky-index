here in law and disorder we've
chronicled the events of Israeli forces
in Gaza today we're delighted to have
with us Noam Chomsky one of the world's
foremost social critics institute
professor emeritus in the MIT Department
of linguistics and philosophy and the
author of many books today we talked to
him about his latest Gaza in crisis
reflections on Israel's war against the
Palestinians Noam Chomsky wrote Gaza in
crisis with Ilan Pappe one of the
exceptional young Israeli historians now
teaching history at the University of
Exeter in the UK Noam Chomsky welcome to
law and disorder or beauty let's get
right in and tell us why you wrote this
book by you particularly you wrote two
of the major essays in the book
particularly the one that I've focused
on was exterminate all the Brutes about
the war on and Gaza and give us some
perspectives that you give people in the
book around the war on gaza actually
just to be kindly let's start with
WikiLeaks for perfect if icky which
doesn't sound is not very much of
interest in it frankly but one of the
interesting cables is I think the only
one from leading elevated embassy it's
the Clinton and it discusses the Ian
it's giving your sort of talking points
discusses the attack on Gaza that's
what's about and it tells her that
Israel had to attack and december two
thousand eight in self-defense because
Hamas had violated the truce now there's
nine two possibilities either the US
Embassy in Israel is so clueless nobody
even reads the press or else they're
just lying flat out because the facts
are clear and uncontroversial in
december two thousand eight hamas was
calling for a renewal of the truce that
Israel had broken and the Israeli
cabinet considered it rejected it
because they want the bomb and i should
add that's us israel because these are
joint activities and in fact that's what
happened i mean there was a true
established in june two thousand eight
Israel never lived up to it they
insisted on maintaining the siege in
violation of the first agreement but
nevertheless Hamas lived up to it
scrupulously Israel officially
recognizes officially that there was not
a single Hamas rocket until November
forth on November 4th Israeli troops
invaded Gaza that killed half a dozen
Hamas militants it was rocket firing in
response and huge israeli rock and start
firing went on for a couple days and as
usual with casualties were all
palestinian then the first did run out
in december and then what happened is
ways right on us called repeatedly to
even institute more rigorous truce
agreements and is rejected and then us
visual attacked now the fact that you
know this can pass without comment cuz
it caught a lot in fact could go on to
say that the in the whole WikiLeaks
episode my opinion the most remarkable
fact is the absolute contempt for
democracy that's revealed by the
embassies by the State Department and by
the commentators if take a look at the
leaks of the really dramatic week it was
repeated all over the place headlines
articles etcetera is that the way it's
put is the Arabs world wants us to bomb
Iran for you noticed afraid of it rent
well there's a minor point and a major
one the minor point is there of course
just citing the Arab dictators and we
don't know what they think we don't know
how much how the embassy officials
selected or maybe invented what we
wanted to hear which is quite normal but
let's say it's all true they are citing
the Arab dictators
quite brutal what about the Eric
population again either they are
clueless or don't know a thing about the
Middle East or us their line and we have
good studies of Arab public opinion from
mainstream very respectable sources the
brookings institute released its last
extensive colon a couple of months ago
and it has a lot about this it says that
the Arabs do perceive a threat he eight
percent of them see the threatening
threat is Israel seventy-seven percent
see the main threat as the united states
i reran is mentioned way down at the
bottom ten percent see a threat from
Iran in fact they're so opposed the US
policy that a majority 57% i think that
the region would be better off as iran
had nuclear weapons for an hour
intellectual culture what the population
thinks is irrelevant what we care about
is what the dictators think or what can
say they think this is pretty striking
i've seen a word about this neighbor go
into gaza for another second because you
written your chapter i believe before
the Goldstone report came out this is
the chapter in gaza in crisis
exterminate all the brutes and i'm
interested in both your reaction to the
Goldstone report and of course the
state's reaction the u.s. particularly
well i'm kind of ambivalent about it
they did a very good job i think as well
as you can do when you're investigating
a past world you don't have access has
been blocked israel just 11 and y axis
and so on so it did a pretty good job
but it's in here and pretty difficult to
to really demonstrate that the crimes
took place in battle you know that you
can always say well you know heading on
some hamas gunmen wasn't hiding in the
doors and the most critical issue is the
one just discussed it israel have any
right to use force in the first place
any rate scottsville most universally is
Wilshire and then arrive self-defense
that's not the issue of course everyone
has a right of self-defense the question
is you have a right of self-defense by
force and the law and common sense are
quite clear about that you don't have
that right if you have an exhausted
peaceful means in this case Israel
refuse even to try peaceful means and
the reason is they knew they'd succeed
they'd have gone back to a person which
there were no rockets well that being
the case all discussions are relevant
and yeah maybe they committed war cons
and of course of media the attack in
fact I'm sure they did volcom gives good
evidence I mean they basically granted
them a gift if Ezra ones are irrational
what they would have done is welcome the
Goldstone report thank you for agreeing
with us that we were right and justified
in the packing gasm implicitly and then
they were published a couple of thousand
pages which nobody would looked at going
through each detail yeah I think that's
really important i mean the Goldstone
report does not address at all just it
passes over israel and you know why
infinitely ghost himself a long
interview with Bill Moyers which Moyers
asked him what about where they
justified insisted they were justified
attacking they just did it's
disproportionate and that's what most
everything was reported and even the
human rights groups they just granted
them the right to look back and said
well it was disproportionate it's a
little bit like saying that Russian
invasion of Afghanistan is
disproportionate that's not the way we
do we're speaking with noam chomsky
who's just published to haymarket books
came out with Gaza in crisis Noam
Chomsky and Ilan Pappe it's a very very
fine book no you were somebody concerned
with Israel and its fate from the very
beginning when you were a young man just
like Michael and I were visited there in
the 50s and it's been something that's
been part of our lives as we've grown up
and old and it gets increasingly
dismayed what do you tell people when
they ask you what sort of solution
should we look for
one state to state bi-national state
where we at and what can we do Oh in
fact that even do on analytic solution I
agree with any reason to honor would
comparable boundaries excellent woman
Wes and I were in Israel in the early
fifties and we were hitchhiking up in
the north and we happened across the
Lebanese border when Gandhiji came by
and started screaming at us until is the
bank but why have a border cutting the
Galilean half so I'm supporting all of
these proposals make certain good sense
as long as we recognize that you have to
have a way to get there I know of only
one way to proceed if anyone has a
different suggestion we have you here
anyway I know is for the United States
to join the rest of the world and stop
its rejectionist opposition could be
huge overwhelming international
consensus agree to a two-state
settlement in this case is real it has
to go along and then you know there are
details to be worked out with the basic
form of littles very well understood and
accepted overwhelmingly by every
relevant actor except the United States
in this room after that my feeling is
that it would be would come to be
recognized everyone in the former
Palestine mandatory Palestine Jordan to
see the drawing a line through that
territory next absolutely no sense
commercial relations would pick up
social relations cultural relations and
go across the border to the Western
whatever it may be I'm not going to
borders would erode naturally natural
ways actually the way that's beginning
to happen in Europe I'm okay then you
could move towards a bi-national on
Federation of some sort of what people
grow one state and after that you could
overcome the Imperial borders why not
have integration with lemon well now why
is it that the United States defies
international opinion and doesn't go
along some people argue that it's the
Israeli Lobby here others say no it's in
the interests of the ruling elites in
the United States to keep Israel as
their cat's paw I mean what's your view
of why they don't go along it's very
lobbies a strong Lobby no doubt and i
really wish those claims were true as
those claims were true would save me a
huge amount of time and effort haha
literally I could stop spending a huge
amount of time giving talks and
traveling and getting involved in
organizing efforts and the writing and
so on I could just put on coat and a
jacket and tie I've got them somewhere
go to the corporate offices of Intel
mortgage change whatever you know
Lockheed Martin and explain the Chamber
of Commerce and explain to them politely
but their interests are being harmed by
this little lobby that they can put out
of business and five seconds okay then
it would be over that's the tactical
conclusion from the beliefs that's a lot
now the fact of the matter is quite
different I'm the strongest support for
Israeli crimes this coming from the
business world I mean the most avid
supporter of Israel in the media is the
wall street journal and that part of a
pack that's the general of the business
world Republicans are far more extreme
than the Democrats even though Jewish
votes Jewish moaning both malamig we go
to the Democrats there the more extreme
looking business oriented parties um so
it goes across the board I'm an Intel
for example is building its biggest
plant world for new generation chips in
Israel military industry which has a
huge lobby of course the lie to do this
room so for example when we newest when
Obama offers another three billion
dollars worth of jets which will end up
being twice that throw bleep in Israel
does Lockheed Martin
and in fact they loved it ee because
then Saudi Arabia comes along and says
we want something so Obama offers and
sixty billion dollars where it was a
little very equipment that they can't
use in the biggest off sale ever after
then it's just delightful and in fact
the US military intelligence are tightly
integrated of Israel that goes back to
nineteen forty eight I mean there's our
tribal materials and finally beginning
to work one which are is that in 1948
the Joint Chiefs the US military were
very impressed by Israel's military
efficiency I thought this could be a
good base for us power it goes on after
67 it just took off I furthermore after
1967 the intellectual community I just
had a love affair with this room they
love this demonstration that was really
power and you have to remember that was
right at the peak of the Vietnam War
when despite would proclaim now liberal
opinion was very upset about the fact
the u.s. wasn't winning the war and here
came Israel along and it showed how to
deal with ferg world upstarts in
addition to that is related wonder if
service to the United States there had
been there had been an ongoing conflict
between radical Islamic fundamentalism
which the US was supporting the US and
Britain and secular nationalism which
the US are strongly opposing its massive
losses for excited ready of course roll
the oil is it was concerned that's right
secular nationalism might try to gain
control of the oil resources and musical
regional development not for enriching
dictators and the west and foreign
companies and Israel destroyed it
destroyed secular Arab nationalism and
that was a tremendous gift that's when
us-israeli relations really took off in
their current form increased later in 70
when during Black September when the
Jordanian army was slaughtering
Palestinians looked for a while as a
Syrian i intervene to protect the
Palestinians us in wanted voted as a
threat to the Royal monarchies the US
was all tied up and converting it that
could listen Israel mobilized pinned El
period withdraw and the massacre
continued us is really think almost
quadrupled after that one so it
continues your point was driven home to
me when I was over there before the
First Intifada on a National Lawyers
Guild delegation with abdin Jabara we
were investigating the Israelis
snatching secular Arab leaders these
were not particularly political people
in artists and writers doctors snatching
them in the middle of night from their
homes and setting them out into the
desert because these were like secular
figures in the community and they didn't
want any kind of leadership yelling his
way back in France reported hamaso the
early days Israeli used to bus students
from the Islamic universities to pierce
a secretary University breakup student
strike symptoms exactly noam you
mentioned that when we axed about
possibilities for change that the United
States really had to join the rest of
the world with regard to Israel and
Palestine and come down directly for a
solution and when you read now every day
it seems to me that more and more
Palestinian land is just being gobbled
up both in East Jerusalem as well as in
the West Bank and of course we have the
prison of Gaza it seems to me getting
less likely that the United States is
going to do that although world opinion
is is shifted even more in favor of the
United States doing something so what do
you make the current attempt to do
negotiations today of all the stuff
about stopping settlements and well
everything you read in the normal paper
every day would you read the papers I
just say it does it
it's just for article I mean if there
were serious negotiations going on they
would be run by some neutral party and
one side would be the world and the
other side would be the US and Israel
and then that's what the conflict is as
far as the you know what supposed to be
a conflict between the US and Israel
joke it's about expansion of settlements
the first of all Obama's position is
just repeating the wording that we fans
roadmap which is supposed to be the
agreed position on steps should be taken
in the first stage of the road map says
no expansion of settlements even natural
growth Bush needed that fits in fact
more or less his administration's plan
and of oz repeating it but is he going
to do anything about it well we know
which number one he at least composed
some very mild sanctions when Israel was
expanding settlements in ways that he
and Baker them like cut back on Long
general please Obama was asked about
that so he going to do anything about it
if Lee and his spokesperson the press
come from said no this is we're not
going to impose any penalties like
pushing over one did our position is
completely symbolic well that's telling
you mean that I never do what area like
I will continue funding movement the
diplomatic support and the military's
work and so on so do you like in other
words we're saying stop but with a link
makes us go ahead that's traditional and
the mouths of the more extreme
furthermore the whole issue of
settlement expansion is a minor footnote
I mean Israel already controls about
forty-two percent of the West Bank and
in fact in the area that Israel totally
controls area see living conditions are
let's worse than jaza by the
international agencies that have been
looking so yeah maybe it'll expand it a
little more but they've already got
everything they want they can take more
Obama's that just
offer them more in the Jordan Valley
which of course gladly picked up already
keeping Palestinians Adam the issue is
the settlements not expansion there are
legal that's understood Israel
recognized back in late nineteen
sixty-seven they're leading legal
authority theater and they run very
respected international buist advise
them that any settlement in the occupied
territories in violation of Geneva
Conventions curve international
humanitarian law instituted incidentally
to criminalize Nazi actions the Attorney
General in Israel and she comes up here
I he agreed so yes legal Moshe Dayan who
was in charge of the occupied
territories fence minister he agreed to
insurance and violation of law but
countries violate laws will go ahead
which means as long as the master in
Washington condemns it with a wink who
cares that's been underscored by
security council resolutions by the
International Court of Justice and by
the US Justice on the court filed a
separate declaration that he basically
agreed the Geneva Conventions applied to
the occupied territories meaning all
settlements illegal in fact not I is it
illegal but it relates any chicken it's
designed carefully they think it's
designed carefully to ensure that there
cannot be any viable Palestinian
self-determination and that's the Shan
planchar um called it it will leave from
bad to stands like that's an
exaggeration because South Africa needed
the black population and so they they
kind of and furthermore the US and
Israel this is crucial for about 15
years now have been working hard to
separate Gaza from the West Bank that is
in direct violation of the wording of
the Oslo agreements and that's quite a
different I'm done now that's
virtually achieved well all of this
makes palestinian self-determination
almost meaningless as long as the newest
persists and mrs. policy in your book
you refer to the Palestinian Authority
or maybe a boss but the use of the word
Quisling you just explain to our
listeners what that is and why you think
that of the PA it might have been pop a
joke you're right I apologize good
there's something to you know in fact
just take the way they're viewed by the
United States which is what's important
Obama's a point man on the Middle East
is John Kerry it presented to our
relations cream you get an important
speech on this for maintenance feature
from the administration on Israel
Palestine this is the Brookings
Institute he about a year he said Israel
of course it described the United States
as an honest broker I'm trying hard so
on and so forth but putting side these
of patriotic imagery he said something
important he said for the first time
Israel has a legitimate negotiating
partner Palestinian Authority and they
gave the reason the reason is that
there's an army in the west bank run by
a US general keep statements replace the
baton armies but seven sported by the
Jordanian dictatorship and by Israel
will take garden training it and so on
and the army he said was proven itself
very effective and it gives one example
during the Israeli invasion of Gaza the
army was so effective that it put down
any demonstrations in the West Bank in
spirit any sign of opposition to the
attack and general baton himself later
said we were so effective that Israel
was able to take forces out of the West
Bank and send them to send them to
attack gasm what's the right word for
that Quisling Noam Chomsky thank you
very much for being on law and disorder
we urge our listeners to go out and get
the new Haymarket book Gaza in crisis
that gnome wrote along with the great
Israeli historian Atlanta
hey it's a very fine book and people
should have this on their bookshelves
and they should read it and study it so
thanks gnome we certainly appreciate
your being on the show thank you if you
want to hear low on disorder again or
hear a segment you've missed go to law
and disorder org on the web now you
should also go to low on disorder radio
on facebook become a friend and send lon
disorder to your friends through
facebook
