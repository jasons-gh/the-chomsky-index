hello my name is Jason Lee isatis global
peace radio I've got the great pleasure
today of very lucky to have a fantastic
guests who won't show you on those names
mr. lon Chomsky thank you very much for
coming on the on the Global Peace
program now I very much appreciate it
glad to be with you that's great you
know fantastic inspiration to so many
many many people one of the very few
people in my opinion and to to to have
the great courage to actually talk about
the real dilemma if you like that
humanity is currently in and I suppose
we could say has been in for quite some
time in Italy but it's a big subject I
know on what we haven't got a tremendous
amount of time obviously and um I'm all
about as you probably know I'm all about
finding peace I talk about I talk about
ethics morals empathy all the things
that as humanity we seem to be
compromising with an ethical compromises
for me is one of the greatest dangers we
face which is spearheaded obviously by
governments generally with you know
operating without vision and wisdom to a
great degree and not looking down the
timeline to see those feedback loops
which had come in back to to hit us even
though we can't see them reaching
fruition quite yet what you feel about
that could you say a few words about
that subject it's a very alive subject
and it has dramatic implications so
instead of talking about it abstractly
let's talk about a specific case yep
while back of the United States sent
highly trained Special Forces Navy SEAL
was to invade Pakistan to break into the
compound where one of their enemies of
Samba Laden was holed up of a kilt a cup
of people
and his apartment who was unarmed
defenseless wife was with him on
instructions from the White House they
murdered him through his body into the
ocean without autopsy that has obvious
consequences throughout the Muslim world
infected Trude everywhere but it's much
more than that the Navy SEALs who were
sent in there were under orders to fight
their way out if they were trapped they
could have been Pakistan has a advanced
army dedicated loyal army committed to
the offending sovereignty the country
very well-armed after lots nuclear
weapons and if they found him in time
they wouldn't just let them walk out
well the US forces would never have
allowed them to be trapped the whole
forces the u.s. varmints would have been
used to extricate them and it almost
happened very close to happen the chief
of staff of the Pakistani army Joan
kahani was informed that there had been
an intrusion into Pakistani airspace
he's first assumption was it was from
India Pakistan India ends relationship
ordered the air force of his other
forces to immobilize to prevent to
respond to this intrusion meanwhile at
the same time a general david petraeus
commander u.s. regional commander of
kabul afghanistan ordered the US air
force to start scrambling jets get ready
for an action this means we were very
close to war with Pakistan which could
have easily turned into a nuclear war
which put it destroy all I now it's well
understood has been for a long time that
a a major nuclear war
would destroy the attacker even if there
was no response even if first strike the
effects of it would be so enormous
leading to kind of put slow global
manner that probably destroyed the
attacker as well well we were close to
that the Obama administration was
willing to take that chance though there
were other ways of finding and
apprehending bin Laden who remember was
a suspect not guilty of anything that
presumably was responsible for 911 but
that's a little different than
demonstrating it in a court court of law
as has been required by an anklet
American law for 800 years since Magna
Carta but they were willing to risk a
nuclear war and it gets worse the
technique by which bin Laden was
identified in his location has
identified was at CIA operation which
carried out a fake vaccination campaign
in Abbottabad towards the areas of it
the town where they thought he was
that's at the very serious violation of
principles that go back as far as the
Hippocratic oath you know thousands of
years and they cut off the vaccination
campaign in the middle because they
found he was somewhere else which is a
further crime but it goes on in much of
the world third world people are pretty
skeptical about the white men come in
and start sticking things in their arms
and what are they up to I'm not seen it
myself any penny salut and you can
understand it after they have some
experience with the white invaders
commenting things that very pretty so
what are these guys doing coming in here
and
stay a needle in her arm and touch a lot
of work intense people they should
undergo vaccination campaign well this
there happens to be a major there was
it's now ended a major vaccination
campaign in Pakistan polio has been
almost eradicated in the world it could
go the way of smallpox totally
eliminated as the dread disease of
Pakistan is mantra few places where
polio is still endemic very alive and
there were there were UN vaccination
teams working in in Pakistan to try to
overcome and eliminate this dread
disease well as soon as the fake
vaccination campaign was exposed the
fears that people already have were
given a solid basis and soon he went
health he abduct some of them killed you
went had to pull out the whole
vaccination team won the effects were
felt in fact as far as Nigeria also it
is oleo well the estimates are buy us
medical specialists that maybe a hundred
thousand people in Pakistan will
contract polio as a result of this
operation and one specialist on the
University professor added acquainting
to this child sitting in wheelchair
crippled and say you did it you
Americans did and that has consequences
and in fact quite generally the US is
engaged in a terrorist manufacturing
campaign and create errors this is one
of the people who look older as if his
revenge
other examples drinking example right at
time lost marathon bombings pretty close
to young police officer who was murdered
was killed right outside my office on
everyone you're a lot of people here
felt it personally it was a real tragedy
same time about two days later there was
a drone attack ins of in Yemen the
should be recognized that drones they're
presented to us as devices that
surgically eliminate a particular person
it's not true their terror weapons they
terrorized towns villages or regions and
you can see why I mean suppose you're
walking down the street and your
neighborhood then you don't know if five
minutes from now there's going to be a
sudden explosion from some unknown
source that'll kill the guy standing
across the street and every one happens
to be nearer well that's your terrorist
you have to lift it's a major terror
weapon and the drone campaign to a huge
tear I have effects so what happened
after that right at the time of the
Boston Marathon bombing well there was a
drone attack in a village in isolated
village in Yemen most of these we don't
know about but this one we happen to
know about because the young man from
the village was studying here and he
testified to the Senate about it and he
pointed out that there had been the jaw
DS my radical elements in Yemen had been
trying for years to turn the villagers
against
and they'd fail because all these people
knew about the United States was what he
wrote to them and he liked in the United
States bird favorable things but he
added that this one dropped achieved
what the jihadis had failed to several
years now the people I just with you
let's go to home gift it's a error is
generating system and it carries with it
threats as far as the threat of nuclear
war and just gave an example as well as
all kinds of side effects like maybe a
hundred thousand polio victims and man
thankthank you know misis a very good
example and thank you very much for that
but feel always feel very emotional when
when people talk about these things
because I talk like yourself about these
things alone I'm talking a lot at the
moment about so I wrote a piece yes the
other day called i called it kill them
just in case so what we're seeing now is
ethical compromises to such a degree
that it's murder without trial as you
said like with someone like bin Laden
aims only a suspect murder without trial
for the victim and the perpetrators and
it's the same with the drones it's all I
see it it's almost like um you see
someone who think you might who might
get a gun so you kill them just in case
or someone who might be a terrorist you
can i'm just in case and this is
terrorists accusing other people of
being terrorists there's no doubt the
greatest terror threat in the in the
whole world now is israel in the US
there's no doubt i mean they talk about
you know a new nuclear threat from Iran
and meanwhile llave the abuse depleted
uranium as you know and themselves with
wither almost a genocide Jenna soil
effects in Iraq um it's in the law
makers of the law breakers and they're
almost like magicians with amnesia I
think normally they sort of they're like
children and in you create reactor they
can't seem to help but to fight and kill
people and and we're getting used to it
and we're getting used to use to it
that's the problem isn't it
I'm not getting used to it but accepting
it in the most astonishing ways I
thought it was kind of interested in
Simon's shocking to see how educated
liberal progressive intellectuals are
reacting to these things yep so only
towards the more of gin doest chauvinist
end you have for example what ago there
was a drone attack in Yemen which
happened to Cole several little girls
and a well-known American commentator
the rule commentator client was asked if
you can think of something wrong with
this and what he said is it's better
that their little girls should be killed
than our in other words it's fine for us
to kill someone who we suspect may
ultimately on to harm us pentacle is
reserved for us who know maybe we this
the dickless and fine words knows it
ain't your hoses it is incredible uh no
no I think that's the greatest danger at
the moment well as you well know being a
gentleman who talks about what you talk
oh I'm the greatest threat to humanity
at the moment is our own minds I mean
that's a pretty sweeping statement or I
think that's pretty much true because
our minds create and manifest our
thoughts create a manifest most of the
things we see around us be a tin of
beans a you know a block of flats or war
or peace and this is what we forgotten I
think as human beings is that the people
who are running this world and actually
those feedback loops and those
consequences without wisdom of vision
are already like a tsunami is like
kicking a bucket of water it's going to
come back and get us and we only got to
look at what's going on in them in in
quantum and can't Guantanamo know that
they are so possessed with controlling
people and being the top dog is they
won't even allow someone to kill
themselves I'd like to hear your
comments
they want to know anyone injured and
want someone to kill themselves that's
so that's so sort of controlling there
and like you said about people none I
think there's an intrinsic fear of
punishment within most people and that's
why I respect you so much because in
your position you could quite easily not
talk about this you know and I really
respect you for that to actually say as
it is and most people fear punishment
and intrinsic fear of government
punishment if they speak out they'll be
punished and and actually they will as
another thing I'd like to ask you about
is like you know they talk about Assad
being brutal to his people and magic and
this kind of thing and they were had war
crimes against humanity a hladik but I
mean Tony Blair Bush and Obama and these
people Sarkozy they've killed by far
more people than rat clone hladik and
and they're not being tried for war
crimes against humanity so I I'd like to
ask you about Guantanamo what you think
about the white man like you said early
on he certainly speaks with forked
tongue and he thinks he's the top dog is
um it's definitely part it-it's I've
been in South Africa I got shot out so I
know what a part so it's all about in
the 80s so it's that thing that they
just can't help but to keep punishing
people it's almost like they're almost
sadists you know when their sugar those
pipes down people's knows it's almost a
sadistic masochistic symbiosis people
are let it letting them do these things
and I think people feel helpless how how
can people change can you speak it
without a bit numb please well we have
to actually a sadistic is the right word
when you really you have testimony
people who've been through these
experiences it is you know it's just
utterly devastating the one book that I
really urge that people read I think
it's very persuasive by an Australian as
his name is David Hicks he was picked up
in afghanistan by the northern reliance
forces on the ground there were
cooperating the United States he know he
wasn't doing anything and straighten
hitchhiker up there he was picked up he
was sold to the Americans for bounty
they do that and then he was in the
hands of the American army for I think
about six years at first that the Bagram
base in Afghanistan just huge torture
chamber then several years in Guantanamo
he describes it chilling detail the ways
he was treated and it's just can't
believe that human beings can do this
and I think anyone reads it will realize
it's a very credible account and
reinforced by many others know plenty of
evidence of that joint but he also makes
out something which I found rather
striking he says that the American
soldiers who were turning out these
sadistic Mert Alas were terrified of
their captives they had been so
indoctrinated that I regarded the people
they were imprisoned as a superhuman I
said soldiers would come to his cage you
know he's a move chapel and asked him to
perform some of his amazing tricks for
them you know like climb on the ceiling
whatever and if they ever took a
prisoner out shackled you know an tuft
barely moved rapidly destroyed but
mystic torture they'd have to have a
whole whole array of heavily armed
soldiers and police just to make sure
that he didn't that the cap is didn't
turn on him in geo you know he says
really were frightened chief and
directly that that's the result of
intensive indoctrination and it extends
it
Society it's a very frightened society
yep I mean take the gun ultram in the
United States it's pretty interesting
why do people feel they have well for a
lot of people it's is because they are
genuinely frightened of things like of
possibilities like say that the UN will
come and take over the country and
commit genocide or eliminate our
sovereignty or the federal government is
suddenly are break-in and murder control
them these things are beyond paranoia
you know but it's it's not uncommon in
the country next in a frightened country
since its origins which still give this
but now it's taking on a really almost
psychotic form and a lot of it it's
driven by the build-up listeria recall
for example the right before the Iraq
invasion when the bush administration
was trying to organize mobilized popular
support for the planned invasion the
other were all kinds of historical
pronouncements of Condoleezza Rice and
others about how the next thing we see
is a mushroom cloud over New York we got
to defend ourselves from these crazed
Arabs we're trying to all of them want
to kill us order what can we do over
there invade them and terrorizing well
you know that's a win a mood like that
spreads in a country that has
extraordinary power means of violence
that vastly exceed anyone else in the
world and you're in it
you're in a very dangerous situation
you're going to unite dangerous for your
right world I think we are run by said
we're running out of time unfortunately
don't why I said oh god but we are
definitely our condition is where our
conditioning is one of our dangers and
we'll run by psychotic people they've
gone insane there's no doubt about and
it's infectious to the population and
you know I think we've got to trying
them operate some are without government
control over start our own systems or
were in big big trouble we can't rely on
them anymore to test for the future can
we really you know never think through
things for ourselves and federal way out
of these indoctrination system yep
exactly norm exactly now I'd like to
speak to you for another two hours I'm
unfortunately when all the time and I
know you're a very busy man and I'd love
to speak to you again sometime if we
could in them I really appreciate you
coming on global peace radio and thank
you for all your fantastic commitments
of sanity and peace and a nun stability
in the woods and we need more people
like you thank you very very much yes
and I'm very glad about what you're
doing it's really important thank thank
you no thank you very much indeed yine
thank you bye now thank you very much
