I'd like to ask you about something
that's been in the news a lot lately
obviously all the cable channels that's
all they talk about these days is that
is the whole situation of Russia's
supposed intervention in American
elections for a country that's
intervened in so many governments and so
many elections around the world that's
kind of a strange topic but I know
you've referred to this as a joke could
you give us your view on what's
happening and and why there's so much
emphasis on this particular issue pretty
remarkable fact that first of all it is
a joke most in half of the world is
cracking up and laughter the United
States doesn't just interfere in
elections that overthrows governments it
doesn't like institutes and military
dictatorships simply in the case of
Russia alone it's the least of it the US
government under Clinton intervene quite
blatantly and openly they try to conceal
it to get their man Yeltsin in in all
sorts of ways so this as I say for the
it's it's considered it's turning the
United States again into a laughingstock
in the world so why are the Democrats
focusing on this in fact why are they
focusing so much attention on the one
element of trumps programs which is
fairly reasonable the one ray of light
and this gloom trying to reduce tensions
with Russia
that's the tensions on the Russian
border are extremely serious they could
escalate to a major terminal war efforts
to try to reduce them are should be
welcomed that's a couple of days ago the
former US ambassador to Russia Jack
Matlock came out and said you just can't
believe that so much attention is being
paid to apparent efforts by the incoming
administration to establish connections
with Russia I said sure that's just what
they ought to be doing so meanwhile this
one topic is the primary local
of concern and and critique while
meanwhile the policies are proceeding
step by step which are extremely
destructive and harmful so you know yeah
maybe the Russians tried to interfere in
the election that's not a major issue
maybe the people on the Trump campaign
we're talking to the Russians well okay
Kent not not not a major point certainly
less than is being done constantly and
it is a kind of a paradox I think that
the one issue that seems to inflame the
Democratic opposition is the one thing
that has some justification and
[Music]
reasonable aspects to it well of course
because the Democrats feel that that's
the reason somehow that they lost the
election interesting that James Comey
this week said he is investigating Trump
campaign collusion with Russia when it
was Comey himself who could have might
well have been partly responsible for
Hillary Clinton's defeat when he said
that he was investigating her while we
now have learned at the same time he was
investigating Donald Trump but never
actually said that well you can
understand why the Democratic Party
managers want to try to find some blame
for the fact for the way they utterly
mishandled the election and blew perfect
opportunity to win hand it over to the
opposition but that's hardly a
justification for allowing the Trump
policies to slide by quietly many of
them not on a harmful to the population
but extremely destructive like the
climate change policies and meanwhile
focus on one thing that could become a
step forward if it was adjusted to move
towards
serious efforts to reduce growing and
dangerous tensions right on the Russian
border where they could blow up NATO
maneuvers are taking place hundreds of
yards from the Russian border the
Russian jet planes are buzzing American
planes this is something could get out
of hand very easily
both sides are meanwhile are building up
their military forces adding the u.s. is
in one thing the Russians are very much
concerned about is the so-called
anti-ballistic missile installation that
the u.s. is establishing near the
Russian border allegedly to protect
Europe from non-existent Iranian
missiles nobody seriously believes that
this is a understood to be a first
strike threat these are serious issues
people like William Perry the was a
distinguished career as a nuclear
strategist and is an oval alarmist at
all is saying that we're back to the
cities one of the worst moments of the
Cold War is not worse that's really
serious and efforts to try to calm that
down would be very welcome and we should
bear in mind it's the Russian border
it's not the Mexican border
there's no Warsaw Pact maneuvers going
on in Mexico and that's a border that
the Russians are quite reasonably
sensitive about well they've practically
been destroyed several times last
century right through that maybe I think
are focusing on issues which are pretty
marginal there are much more serious
issues that are being put to the side so
the worst of even on the case of
immigration once again I think the real
question is dealing with the roots of
immigration a responsibility for it and
what we can do to overcome that and
that's almost never discussed but I
think that's the crucial issue I think
we find the same across the
so of all Trump's policies the one that
is the most dangerous of destructive in
fact poses an existential threat is his
policies on the climate change on global
warming that's really destructive that
we're facing an imminent threat not far
removed of the enormous damage the the
effects are already visible but nothing
like what's going to come sea level rise
of a couple of feet will be massively
destructive will make today's
immigration issues look like
trivialities and it's not that the
administration is unaware of this so
Donald Trump for example is perfectly
aware of the dangerous effects in the
short term of global warming so for
example recently applied to the
government of Ireland for permission to
build a wall to protect his golf course
in Ireland from rising sea levels and
Rex Tillerson who was supposed to be the
adult in the room before he was thrown
out as CEO of ExxonMobil
I was devoting enormous resources to
climate change denial although he had
sitting on his desk the reports of
ExxonMobil scientists who since the
seventies in fact were in the forefront
of warm warning the of the dire effects
of this accelerating phenomenon I don't
know what word in the language I can't
find one that applies to people of that
kind who are willing to sacrifice the
literal the existence of organized human
life not in the distant future so they
can put a few more dollars and highly
overstuffed pockets the word evil
doesn't
begin to approach it these are the kinds
of issues that should be under
discussion instead what's being there's
a focus on what but I believe our
marginalia so take say the huge issue of
the interference and our pristine
elections that did the Russians
interfere in our elections an issue of
overwhelming concern that the media
first of all if you're interested in
foreign interference in our elections
whatever the Russians may have done
barely counts the ways in the balance as
compared with what another state does
openly brazenly and with enormous
support is really intervention in us
enter elections vastly overwhelms
anything the Russians may have done in
the even to the point where the Prime
Minister of Israel Netanyahu it goes
directly to Congress without even
forming the president that speaks to
Congress with overwhelming applause to
try to undermine the president's
policies what happened with Obama and
Netanyahu in 2015 that Putin come to
give an address to the joint sessions of
Congress trying to call in on them to
reverse US policy without even informing
the president and that's just a tiny bit
of this overwhelming influence so if you
happen to be interested in influence of
foreign influence of elections there are
places to look but that even thought is
a joke in one of the most elementary
principles of the functioning democracy
is that elected representatives should
be responsive to those who elected them
there's nothing more elementary than
that now we we know very well that that
is simply not the case in the
United States there's ample literature
and mainstream academic political
science simply comparing voters
attitudes with policies pursued by their
representatives and it shows that for a
large majority of the population that
basically disenfranchised their own
representatives pay no attention to
their voices they listen to the voices
of the famous 1% the rich and the
powerful of the corporate sector the
elections Tom Ferguson's stellar work
has demonstrated very conclusively that
for a long period way back u.s.
elections have been pretty much bought
you can predict the outcome of a
presidential or congressional election
with remarkable precision simply be
looking at campaign spending that's only
one part of it
lobbyists practically write legislation
and congressional offices and massive
ways the concentrated private capital
corporate sector super wealth intervene
in our elections massively
overwhelmingly
to the extent that the most elementary
principles of democracy are undermined
now of course all that is technically
legal but that tells you something about
the way the society functions so if you
want if you're in terrific concerned
with our elections and how they operate
and how they relate to what would happen
in democratic society taking a look at
Russian hacking is absolutely the wrong
place to look well you see occasionally
some attention to these matters in the
media but very minor as compared with
the extremely marginal question of a
Russian hockey
and I think we find this on issue after
issue I also on issues on which what
Trump says for whatever reason is not
unreasonable
so he's perfectly right when he says we
should have better relations with Russia
being dragged through the mud for that
is outlandish makes Russia shouldn't
refuse to deal with the United States
because the u.s. carried out the worst
crime of the century and the invasion of
Iraq that much worse than anything
Russia's done but they shouldn't refuse
to deal with us for that reason and we
shouldn't refused to deal with them for
whatever infractions they may have
carried out which certainly exists this
is just absurd we have to move towards
better there are a right at the Russian
border there are very extreme tensions
that could blow up any time and lead to
what would in fact be a terminal nuclear
war terminal for the species of life on
Earth we're very close to that now we
could ask why first of all we should do
things to ameliorate it secondly we
should ask why well suppose NATO
expanded after the collapse of the
Soviet Union in violation of verbal
promises to Mikhail Gorbachev mostly
under Clinton partly under first Bush
then Clinton expanded right to the
Russian border expanded further under
Obama the US has offered to bring
Ukraine into NATO that's the kind of
heartland of Russian geostrategic
concerns so yes there's tensions at the
Russian border not noticed at the
Mexican border
well those are all issues that should be
of primary concern the fate of the fate
of the organized human society even of
the survival of the species depends on
this how much attention is given to
these things as compared with
you know whether Trump lied about
something I think those seem to me the
fundamental criticisms of the media
