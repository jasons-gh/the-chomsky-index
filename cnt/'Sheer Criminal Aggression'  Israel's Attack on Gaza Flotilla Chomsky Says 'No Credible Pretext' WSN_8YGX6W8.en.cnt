I read from a press release provided by
the publisher of Noam Chomsky's latest
book the following of Chomsky's words
hijacking boats in international waters
and killing passengers is of course a
serious crime the editors of the London
Guardian are quite right to say that
quote if an armed group of Somali
pirates had yesterday boarded six
vessels on the high seas killing at
least 10 passengers and injuring many
more a NATO task force would today be
heading for the Somali coast it is worth
bearing in mind that the crime is
nothing new for decades Israel has been
hijacking boats in international waters
between cypress and Lebanon killing or
kidnapping passengers sometimes bringing
them to prisons in Israel including
secret prison / torture chambers
sometimes holding them as hostages for
many years Israel seems that it can
carry out such crimes with impunity
because the u.s. tolerates them and
Europe generally follows the u.s. lead
much the same is true of Israel's
pretext for its latest crime that the
freedom flotilla was bringing materials
that could be used for bunkers for
rockets putting aside the absurdity if
Israel were interested in stopping Hamas
Rockets it knows exactly how to proceed
except Hamas offers for a ceasefire in
June 2008 Israel and Hamas reached a
ceasefire agreement the Israeli
government formally acknowledges that
until Israel broke the agreement on
November 4th invading Gaza and killing
half a dozen of Hamas activists Hamas
did not fire a single rocket Hamas
offered to renew the ceasefire the
Israeli cabinet considered the offer and
rejected it preferring to launch its
murderous and destructive operation cast
lead on December 27th evidently there is
no justification for the use of force
quote-unquote in self-defense unless
peaceful means have been exhausted in
this case they were not even tried
although or perhaps because there was
every reason to suppose that they would
succeed Operation Cast Lead is therefore
sheer criminal aggression with no
credible pretext and the same is true of
Israel's current resort to force the
siege of Gaza itself does not have the
slightest credible pretext it was
imposed by the US and Israel in January
2006 to punish pal
stin ians because they voted
quote-unquote the wrong way in a free
election and it was sharply intensified
in july two thousand seven when hamas
blocked a us-israeli attempt to
overthrow the elected government in a
military coup installing Fattah
strongman mohammed dahlin the siege is
savage and cruel designed to keep the
caged animals barely alive so as to fend
off international protests but hardly
more than that it is the latest stage of
long-standing Israeli plans backed by
the u.s. to separate Gaza from the West
Bank these are only the bare outlines of
very ugly policies in which Egypt is
complicit as well by the way the
preceding statement was part of a longer
interview for an Egyptian weekly which
you can read online but the Egyptian
weekly edited this out Chomsky's mention
of Egypt's complicity in Israel's crimes
and largely the press in the u.s. really
isn't better than this along with the
other topics he deals with Chomsky
writes about the presses poor
performance in his latest book hopes and
prospects see this link in the video
