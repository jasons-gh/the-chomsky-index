from the documentary manufacturing
consent a very protracted look at
professor Chomsky speeches around the
world his statements and his social
criticism comes forward now a part of an
interview that bill moyers conducted
with none other than Tom Wolfe the
author who responds to the question that
follows a professor Chomsky everywhere
he goes variously stated it essentially
boils down to who the hell do you think
you are Tom Wolfe this is the the old
cabal theory that it's somewhere there's
a there's a room with the bays covered
desk and they're a bunch of capitalists
sitting around and they're pulling a
string these rooms don't exist I mean I
hate to tell Noam Chomsky this you don't
you don't put it'll Jeff I think is the
most absolute rubbish I've ever heard
well I actually grew that comment I mean
the idea that there would be a high
cabal running things in the country like
the United States is idiotic
now that would say it is like the Soviet
Union it's totally different which is
precisely why I say the exact opposite
what I mean it is what I'm talking about
it's it's it's like saying the
corporation's try to maximize profit and
market share that's not a conspiracy
that's the institutional structure of
the system individual decisions lead to
that consequence of trying to maximize
profit and market share you don't do it
you're out of business that's not a
conspiracy and it's not a high cabal now
why does war forever it was here this as
being a conspiracy the point is that any
analytic commentary on the institutional
structure of the country is so
threatening to the commissar class they
came here the e part of the commissar
class Tom Wolfe yeah I mean you can't
you can't even hear the words so if I
say there is no high cadet all what he
hears is there is a high but don't you
think the reason he can't hear the words
is because he believes profoundly in the
things he's been taught that this is
democracy that there is freedom it's
like a lot of people like myself who
used to be members of the Communist
Party you know profoundly believed in
the ideals and very painfully
let go don't you think they're a lot of
honest people Tom Wolfe being one of
them profoundly believe
he's not a member the commissar class he
just has to deal yeah but you see what
you were then you're threatening you
threaten those see what you're
describing in the Soviet Union is what I
would call the commissar class that is
the people who profoundly believed I'm
sure you know I don't know if language
the average beat look but also all the
way up to the editors of Pravda
if you did if you did an in-depth
analysis with with them how many of them
would be total cynics yeah that's right
because most of them completely believe
that's the way systems work in fact if
you have the way belief systems form
really if you think about it is you know
even though it's from our personal lives
you sort of decide to do something for
whatever reason and then you create a
system of beliefs that justifies it and
says yeah I was right well the end
effect of this is that people who
function within a system of power and
authority whether it's a an editor of
Pravda or a an op-ed writer for The
Times or a concentration camp guard or
you know pick across the board they're
usually quite sincere about it and they
have worked out the system of police who
says yes this is Justin right and I'm
completely free and independent if they
couldn't have that system beliefs they
couldn't continue now the point is when
but I think when you point out that I
agree with you when you say it's a tight
closed system of beliefs it's a kind of
fundamentalism which means you simply
cannot hear critical analysis and it's
interesting to see what in the United
States can't be heard
ordinary institutional analysis which
says this is the way institutions
function in a guided free market system
given the distribution of power without
any control no control you know nobody's
given orders and so on this is the way
it functions because of the way power is
distributed that's much too threatening
to listen to just as it's too
threatening to hear the words the United
States tax a fiat not or the United
States orchestrated the monstrous
atrocities in Central America because
it's because there's their
fundamentalist beliefs involved
