there's an easy answer from the left
from the right the easy answer is rich
liberals on the banks on the media you
know run the government all they want to
do is give away your money to illegal
immigrants and the shiftless poor and
that's an answer that they're setting up
death panels to kill your grandmother
that kind of thing that's an answer I'm
it's totally insane answer but it's an
answer and people want an answer they're
not getting any other answer like
Liberal Democrats aren't telling them
yeah your problems are because of the
policies we've instituted support for
the last 30 years they're not saying
that so they're basically getting no
other answers and you know we know where
that can lead in fact we've seen it it's
it's got have a whiff of late time our
Germany to it where something similar
was happened my feeling this is a big
error to ridicule the demonstrators you
know the tea parties I mean what they're
saying doesn't make any sense
but they're the grievances that are
leading them to say it make a lot of
sense and it's our failure if the only
answers they have are you know the rich
Democrats were giving it away to illegal
immigrants engage and there are also
real prospects if we follow today's
variant of the famous advice of the
anarchist labor organizer Joe Hill
before his execution he said don't mourn
organize and we should be telling
ourselves that don't ridicule organized
