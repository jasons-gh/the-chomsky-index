all of our politicians are bought it's a
machine it's a system and you've
explained it eloquently here how do we
fix it if we get no we can and in fact
if you look over American history
there's been waves of progress and then
regression so the current situation for
example is somewhat similar to the 1920s
in the 1920 the inequality which is
colossal is about what it was in the
1920s there was the labor movement had
pretty much been destroyed independent
thought had been severely repressed by
Woodrow Wilson's Red Scare and other
devices and there were celebrations in
the 1920s about a utopia of the masters
the end of history well you know the
1930s that radically changed there were
popular movements they democratized the
country they created very significant
the government was compelled to create
significant welfare measures and Social
Security labor rights and so on which
greatly improved the country I mean they
weren't perfect but there were
significant improvement in fact the
regulation of financial institutions was
so good that there weren't any financial
crises until these began to be
dismantled in the 70s and 80s and you
take a look at the 1960s popular
movements that then also led to a
significant democratization of the
country the protection of freedom of
speech which I mentioned was essentially
on the wave of the civil rights and
other popular movements women's rights
very significant fact the rights of
ethnic minorities you know these created
a more free and just society and it can
happen again it's not going to happen by
itself sex work dedication effort but
can happen so how do they do it then and
what can we learn from that so we can do
it now well it's not a big secret most
of some of I don't know how old you are
but I went I lived through it you know
actually both of them as a child in the
30s I was very active in the 60s there's
no big secret education or
organization dedication commitment
picking actions appropriate the
situations all of that works you can
look through the details but we can also
sit down strikes in the 1930s
organization of women's
consciousness-raising groups in the
sixties and seventies anti-war activism
I mean all of these things work they
have to be done of course they don't
happen by themselves
