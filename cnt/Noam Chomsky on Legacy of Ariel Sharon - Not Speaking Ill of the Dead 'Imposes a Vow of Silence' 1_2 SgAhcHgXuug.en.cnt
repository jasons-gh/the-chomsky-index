I'm Amy Goodman we begin in Israel where
state funeral is held today in front of
the Knesset the Israeli Parliament for
former prime minister Ariel Sharon he
died Saturday after eight years in a
coma he was 85 years old he'll be buried
in a state funeral today at his home in
southern Israel the US was among eight
countries 18 countries to send
delegations to attend Sharon's funeral
along with Middle East international
envoy Tony Blair and the Russian and
German foreign ministers at a State
Memorial in Jerusalem Vice President Joe
Biden remembered sharona's a
controversial but bold military leader
and statesman when he told 10,000
Israelis to leave their homes in Gaza in
order from his perspective to strengthen
Israel I can't think of much more
controversial as a student of the Jewish
state I can't think of a much more
difficult and controversial decisions
been made but he believed it and he did
it
the security of his people was always
Eric's unwavering mission an unbreakable
commitment to the future of Jews or the
30 years or three hundred years from now
that was Vice President Joe Biden
speaking during Ariel Sharon's memorial
thousands of Israelis came to pay their
respects that is as his coffin lands
state outside the Parliament building in
Jerusalem ministers held a minute's
silence at Sunday's cabinet meeting to
remember their former leader this is
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu casaba the home came in all of
his latest roles as Minister of Defence
as minister of housing minister of
infrastructures Minister of Foreign
Affairs Eric has contributed to the
State of Israel and as much as he could
to the security of Israel and that's
what he did as Israel's prime minister I
believe he represents the generation of
Jewish leaders who rose from our people
with the resumption of our independence
he was tied to the land he knew the need
to protect the land and he understood
that above all that our independence is
our ability to protect ourselves by
ourselves I believe he will be
remembered as one of the prominent
leaders and one of the bravest
commanders in the heart of Israel
forever our el jiron has been one of the
most dominant political figures in
Israel's history involved in each of
Israel's major Wars dating back to its
founding in 1948 as Prime Minister he
oversaw Israel's disengagement from the
Gaza Strip the Gaza withdrawal caused a
serious rift in drones the cooed party
which led to his departure he formed a
new party Kadima which maintained the
Gaza disengagement while expanding
Israeli control over the major
settlement blocks in the occupied West
Bank among Palestinians Iran was one of
the most reviled political figures in
the history of the israel-palestine
conflict he's seen as father of the
settlement movement and architect of the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon which killed
a reported 20,000 Palestinians and
Lebanese an Israeli commission of
inquiry found Sharon had in direct
responsibility for the massacre of over
a thousand palestinian refugees at the
Sabra and Shatila camps in Lebanon in

the world's leading scholars on the
israeli-arab conflict we welcome you all
to democracy now let's go first to the
Israeli historian avi slime your
response to the death of RL sharone what
you feel he should be remembered for a
real Chiron is what is one of the most
iconic and controversial figures in
Israel's history he had deep he was a
deeply flawed character renowned for his
brutality mendacity and corruption
despite these character flaws he is a
major figure in shaping Israel's modern
history he was one of the five most
influential figures who left a deep Park
on modern Israel the first was the we'd
been going on the founder of the state
who in 1949 concluded the armistice
agreements with the neighboring Arab
states the only internationally
recognized borders that Israel has ever
had second was levee ash Cole who isn't
the aftermath of the June 1967 war
presided over the transformation of
Israel from a plucky little democracy
into a brutal colonial power the third
was the Likud leader Menachem Begin who
signed the first peace treaty with an
Arab country
he signed the peace treaty with Egypt in
1979 the force was its hawk Robin the
only Israeli prime minister who went
forward on the political front towards
the Palestinians and he did this by
signing the Oslo accord in 1939
and clinching the historic compromise
between the two nations with the iconic
handshake with Yasser Arafat on the
White House lawn and finally there is
Ariel Sharon who always rejected the
Oslo peace process
who is Prime Minister tried to sweep
away the remnants of Oslo and forge a
new strategy of unilateralism of giving
up on the Palestinians and redrawing
unilaterally the borders of Greater
Israel so his legacy can be summed up in
one word unilateralism acting in
defiance of UN resolutions international
law an international public opinion the
real question is how was I reassure on
and how is Israel today under his
successors able to defy the entire
international community and the answer
to that is that Israel could not have
done it on its own but it has a little
friend and the friend is the United
States of America but that is a
different story we're gonna break and
then get response from professor Rashid
Holliday and professor Noam Chomsky as
