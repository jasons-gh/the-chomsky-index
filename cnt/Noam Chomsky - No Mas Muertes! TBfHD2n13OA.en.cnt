all we hear are these people are trying
to get into our country this is a these
threats are coming from all over the
place why are they coming where are they
coming from so we want this really to be
like a discussion like very organic and
but I'd like to leave it at that part
and maybe have professor Chomsky if you
if you like to talk about neoliberal
policies and stuff like that my main
contribution to this issue is to have
two daughters one of them AVI who you
mentioned is one of the leading
specialists on this topic in fact you
just came back from a couple of weeks in
Arizona with students at the college
where she teaches Salem State and others
doing butter murder monitoring legal
work and Nogales were a lot of
immigrants er people are caught on this
side of the border put into what amounts
to cattle cars and truck through Nogales
and dumped in Mexico on the Mexican side
there's things called court cases but
it's kind of like Military Commissions
doesn't count as a court case another
daughter who just decided he was a brown
student incidentally and after
graduating and working at the American
math Society for a while
decided she wanted to live like a
third-world woman so she went down to
Nicaragua she's been living there
so yes there on the other side they've
mentioned that most of this started in
the early 90s and this is a reason why
it started in the early 90s in fact 1994
the year when Clinton initiated
operation gatekeeper militarizing the
border was the same year that NAFTA
passed and it was understood that by
here that
against large percentage of its profits
from state subsidies thanks to Ronald
Reagan another free-market a possible so
it's going to undermine Mexican
agriculture it's going to drive people
off the land and they also understood
that Mexican businesses cannot compete
with US corporations huge US
corporations which are allowed to which
are granted the right of what's called
national treatment in Mexico
so if say General Motors invests in
Mexico they are entitled to claim the
same treatment as a Mexican company now
that's a right that holds only for
corporations not for people if a Mexican
manages to come to New York and ask for
national treatment if he's lucky he
won't be in Guantanamo but these are
special rights granted the corporation's
among the many that are granted to
corporations well above those that human
beings have and NAFTA enshrined a lot of
them they were also in the World Trade
Organization rules and in the whole
so-called neoliberal framework well
there's another factor throughout the
1980s the US was carrying out murderous
terrorist wars all through Central
America a lot of the people who are
coming are indigenous people from
farther south
what Amala saw these places were
devastated hundreds of thousands of
people were killed
what kind of torture and terror was
almost all due to there have been truth
Commission's almost all the
responsibility of the us-run state
terrorist forces or in the case of
Nicaragua doctor army just a mercenary
force so the in some areas like say the
Guatemalan Highlands Mayan areas it was
real genocide you know I'm the total
devastation
actually there are Mayan communities
around here they keep kind of quiet
because as undocumented immigrants do
and also around
not too well near where my daughter
lives she's working with Mayan groups
that are up there well these people were
started to were fleeing from disasters a
part of it was just the terrorist
disaster of Reagan's Wars part of it is
the neoliberal disaster that is the
imposition of a certain kind of economic
regime which required cutback in state
services that cutback in services for
the poor and the you know local
development and so on an acceptance of
what's called opening up which means you
give up to the highest the biggest power
so like us agribusiness or US
manufacturers who turn parts of Mexico
into assembly plants from which Mexico
gets very little but it's good for the
corporations it's terrible for American
workers but that's not one of the goals
of policy I mean American in the United
States for a majority of the population
real wages have pretty much stagnated
for about thirty years
that's the neoliberal period during the
period of financialization of the
economy here and hollowing out of
production which means you don't stop
production but it's just done elsewhere
you know like Mexico China Vietnam
that's fine for the banks and it's great
for the owners and stockholders but it's
terrible for the population here and
it's much worse for the population in
Mexico in fact NAFTA is one of those
rare treaties maybe the only one which
has actually harmed the majority of the
population in all three participating
countries Canada the United States and
Mexico and of course Mexico worst and in
addition to that comes the the treatise
of the American wars and Central America
all trying to flee the timing of the
militarization of the border is not
accidental and America
the American population was opposed to
NAFTA
so were the Canadians in Mexico we don't
have very good evidence but it looks
like Mexicans were opposed to so this
was not an agreement at least if people
are part of their countries it's called
the North American Free Trade Agreement
some of the only accurate words in that
Fraser North American it was in Mexico
United States and Canada
it wasn't an agreement if people are
part of their countries because they
were posed and it certainly wasn't a
free trade agreement
it has highly protectionist elements and
a lot of it isn't about trade at all
like for example granting national
treatment to US corporations as nothing
to with trade trade is put in there so
you can sort of sell it and free is put
in there to make it sound good but it's
it's a an agreement designed in the
interests of the people who designed it
it's not a great surprise it was
designed by multinational corporations
and the few states ours in particular
that primarily cater to their interests
and sure so they're doing fine after all
it's their treaty but the population is
not and there's actually nothing new
about this I mean these are truisms it
goes back to the origins of
industrialization fecking read about
this and Adam Smith you know we're
supposed to worship Adam Smith they just
about to read him that's too dangerous
the dangerous radical I mean one of the
things he pointed out is that and he was
concerned with England they said in
England in his day 1776 this is wealth
of nations what he called the principal
architects of policy are the merchants
and manufacturers of England and they
Institute policies which make sure that
their interests are well catered to
however Grievous the effect on others
including the population of England
that's not their concern and of course
even worse what he called the savage and
justice of the British in India he's an
old-fashioned conservative who had moral
values
you'd have to be a Diogenes to find one
today but he was a real old-fashioned
conservative he had moral values and he
could see elementary truths like the
fact that policy is designed by those
who concentrate economic power in their
hands and they designed policy for their
own good no matter what happens to
others that's secondary well things
haven't changed that much since 1776 and
now these views are cold you know
radical or Marxist there's some other
bad word but they're just true business
I mean in a free country and learn in
elementary school how else could it work
no it's amazing that didn't work that
way and NAFTA is a perfectly good
example it was designed but now it
doesn't happen the merchants and
manufacturers it's you know financial
institutions and multinational
corporations but the logic is pretty
much the same what happens to the
population is what's called in economics
courses and externality if you've taken
an economics course you know that when
you make a transaction you know buy a
car or something the participants in a
transaction according to economic theory
look out for their own interests and
then they're kind of like side effects
what happens to other people
that's a footnote that's called an
externality you know the externalities
can be pretty large like say the current
financial crisis is an externality when
the goldman sachs and you know AIG and
so on make transactions they look out
for their own benefit they don't pay
attention to what's called systemic risk
the risk that the whole thing's going to
collapse and their right not to do that
because then since they are the Masters
pretty much run the government they can
count on the government to ensure that a
taxpayer bails them out so they should
make risky investments and loans because
they got a insurance policy from you so
yeah that's the way they do it and there
are other externalities which are even
worse of course the people of Mexico and
Guatemala and El Salvador in the United
States their fate is an externality but
so is the fate of our grand
children for example if you take a look
today's polls you know last couple of
days there new polls on attitudes of
Americans towards global warming and it
keeps going down and by now about a
third of the population think that they
believe in anthropogenic global warming
humans have something to do with global
warming it's it's being relentlessly
driven down by a massive propaganda
barrage telling people it's all the
liberal hoax so forget about it
now you know the guys who are running
these campaigns know perfectly well that
the liberal hoax is very real and it
could destroy the lives of their
grandchildren in fact it could destroy
everything they own and in their
personal lives you know decent human
beings they understand that but in their
institutional lives as say executives of
the corporation they have to play an
institutional role the institutional
role is maximize profit and market share
in fact that's a legal requirement and
ignore the externalities well in this
case the externality happens to be the
survival of the species but the logic is
the same the same as systemic risk the
same as Adam Smith's grievous effects on
the population of England
these are inherent properties of market
systems and implement efficiencies if
you like but I'm they're massive well
NAFTA had these effects as anticipated
Flores began in Mexico in the 1980s they
were the result of policies and actually
what happened is the World Bank and the
US Treasury and others had been through
the 70s had been trying to you know
induce you know demand demand there and
insist that third-world countries
borrow like mad from US lenders I say
they were tremendously these are usually
third-world dictators they did what they
were told so they should borrow from US
banks and they did they were hugely in
debt American banks were wildly
overexposed to debt like Citigroup which
is collapsing now also collapsed in 1981
and was bailed out by your parents
that's the way the system works the the
the debt crashed when Reagan came in
actually Carter late Carter early Reagan
and Paul Fokker you know who's fed had
raised interest rates very high to wipe
out inflation in the American economy
well us went into a deep recession its
Reagan recession I bet it pulled out its
rich country on the other hand the third
world countries couldn't there their
debts were indexed to US inflation so as
at the US dollar as it went down they
got huge debts which they couldn't pay
the punishment for that was what were
called structural adjustment programs in
the United States if the rich guys crash
the economy we bail them out but in the
poor countries if the rich guys crashed
the economy the poor build amount it's
called a structural adjustment program
meaning you stopped public services you
know you cut back on support for
agriculture you put all your money into
paying debts and so on in fact the
prescriptions for the poor countries are
the exact opposite of the prescriptions
for the rich countries here when you
have a recession
the government produces a big stimulus
you know it bills out the bankers and so
on and so forth
poor countries the opposite you pay off
your debts you cut back production you
cut back services and you suffer that's
how you pay it off the poor people the
mass of the population didn't they
didn't the debts were not owned by them
you know they didn't have anything to do
with the debts the debts were incurred
by their wealthy rulers but the poor pay
it off it's a racket the racket is known
as the International Monetary Fund the
executive director of it an American was
honest enough to describe it as the
credit community's enforcer meaning if
rich banks here make loans to
third-world dictators and they can't pay
him back then the poor in the country
that borrowed pay our creditors here and
instantly so as soon as the North
American taxpayer they pay off the banks
to make sure that you know they're doing
fine it's just what's happening before
our eyes
it keeps happening regularly it's built
into the system it notice that this is
exactly the opposite of what a
capitalist economy would be and there's
a lot of talk about capitalism which is
mostly a joke I mean in a capitalist
economy if I lend you money and you know
that and I know that it's risky you know
so I'll lend it at a high interest rate
because it might go sour so I make a lot
of money for the interest and if it
turns out at some point that you can't
pay that's my problem not in the
international scene if Citigroup makes a
loan to Mexico and those it's risky so
they high interest rates they get a ton
of profit and then it crashes doesn't
work like a capitalist system they don't
pay for it they don't suffer for it the
American taxpayer bails them out and the
poor in the poor countries have to pay
off the debt by structural adjustment
programs so Mexico was every country
that's been subjected to these
neoliberal
including even us has suffered from it
like growth radically declined other
macro economic measures declined and
pretty obvious why but the rich did fine
just like here we're kind of like a
microcosm of it we're such a rich
country it doesn't have the same facts
but it's basically the same structure
well okay here you have a bunch of
attacks on the country south of the
border the neoliberal programs the
terrorist wars you know the the flooding
of their productive apparatus by
subsidized us agribusiness by major US
corporations they can't compete with
well the obvious effect is this going to
be a flow of people from the devastated
countries to the rich country which is
responsible for it that's the illegal
immigration up until the early 90s the
border was pretty open
it was porous border same people have
done both sides they cross the border to
visit their families and that sort of
thing like other borders it was based on
conquest the United States just
conquered half of Mexico what we call
the Southwest as Mexico that's why the
city names you know San Francisco Los
Angeles are all Spanish names you know
it was Mexico we conquered it and it was
a pretty open border but once it was
clear to the Clinton administration that
there's going to be a flood of people
coming as a result of the policies
they're imposing they militarized the
border that's why it starts in the early
90s and it's gotten harsher and harsher
as the effects get worse and worse the
punishment gets harsher and harsher and
it has an internal effect here it's a
way of disciplining the domestic
population so I don't have to tell you
this huge propaganda here to get people
to blame their plight on illegal
immigrants you know if I don't have a
job and like my wages have stagnated for
thirty years because the Liberals are
giving everything away to the illegal
immigrants now you want to hear this
just listen to Rush Limbaugh you know
glenn beck sarah palin tea parties
that's a good way of making sure that
the people who you're smashing in the
face don't do anything about it
and blame someone else like the nazis
blamed the Jews you know okay we blame
the illegal immigrants and the blacks
they're the ones responsible for what
we're suffering so it's a way of
controlling and disciplining this
population too and it's not that they
didn't know what they were doing they
knew exactly what they were doing you go
back to the top planning around 1990 you
know at that time in the government for
example there was a Latin American
strategy workshop in the Pentagon in
1990 where they were looking over the
long term consequences actually of
us-mexico relations and they decided
that us-mexico relations were great it's
true that Mexico was full of torture and
starvation and these insignificant
things but relations were great but they
noticed one cloud on the horizon the
cloud was what they called a democracy
opening in Mexico there might be a
democracy opening in Mexico which would
threaten the domination of us little
power over Mexico so you had to stop a
democracy opening well one way to do it
was NAFTA that in fact it was understood
that NAFTA I'm quoting now would lock
Mexico into the reforms term reform
doesn't mean reform it means you know
doing things our way that's called a
reform so it would lock Mexico into the
neoliberal programs by a treaty so if
the danger there was a democracy opening
took place there would be anything they
could do about it because it'd be locked
in by treaty okay that's NAFTA you lock
the programs in by treaty and then if a
dangerous democracy opening takes place
well we're kind of protected from it is
this the open thinking it's perfectly
sensible it's
just Adam Smith's truisms applied to the
current period and it shows up in all
kind of ways I mean one of the
interesting ways it shows up is in
American law I mean you know you've when
you were in junior high school you read
the amendments to the Constitution there
was an amendment called the 14th
amendment which says that no person
shall be deprived of Rights without due
process ok no person well that's no good
and the courts have since changed that
law in two ways for one thing they
except they both expanded and restricted
the notion of person so over the late
19th century and primarily about a
century ago corporations were given the
rights of persons this infuriated
conservatives because there was a direct
attack on the principles of classical
liberalism which holds that rights in
here in persons not legal fictions that
are constructed by government laws but
corporations were given the rights of
persons and slowly that meant freedom of
speech freedom from search and seizure
you know on and on and then when you get
to the trade agreements they get rights
way beyond persons as I mentioned so
that's one way in which the notion of
person was changed in fact when the 4th
courts that when the courts dealt with
14th amendment cases was almost all for
corporations
I'm the intent of the people who
initiated it was for slaves to be
protected by it but they're poor and
weak and so on so they had no way of
appealing but corporations are big and
strong so they did and the courts
gradually incorporated them into the
notion of person and now it goes way
beyond just last January the courts
Supreme Court gave corporations the
rights to buy elections you know pretty
open so you can buy elections because
you're persons persons have freedom of
speech and money is speech so you want
to buy election go ahead and do
so that's one change in the notion
person the other change is what do you
do about people like undocumented aliens
well okay the courts have decided over
the years that they are not persons
literally so these people are being
picked up by the border control patrol
stuck in cattle cars if they make it
alive and shipped back across the border
they're not under the jurisdiction of
the 14th amendment because they're not
persons and in fact if you look at
what's going on Congress the two
political parties are sort of competing
with each other to see which one can be
more savage and denying rights to these
non persons who happen to be here
without papers and all of this goes on
at the same time that the courts and
much of Congress is granting more rights
to General Motors than General Electric
and the goldman sachs and so on because
they are persons in fact super persons
well that's our legal system and you
know nobody talks about it because
that's the way power is supposed to
operate and you're not supposed to know
about it you're not supposed to be able
to read the words of the Fourteenth
Amendment because that's too scary you
know so people can scream about taking
our constitution away from us but
they're not talking about this these are
real things and it's playing out in
human lives either way you're describing
very brutally in fact and it's this new
law that's coming through is a real
horror in fact the law that's coming
through criminalizes everybody in
Arizona who looks as if they might be
Latino now they couldn't have been born
here they're parents going to be born
here they have to walk around with
documents all the time I mean just think
how you'd feel if you had to walk around
with documents all the time proving
you're a citizen you know you have to
have them because the police have the
right to stop you if they think you
might not be pure white they were right
to stop you
and demand that you give proof of
citizenship and if you don't have to
have it on you he could be sentenced and
furthermore other citizens
you know the blue-eyed blond ones if
they see somebody walking down the
street and a police it would look Latino
and the policeman doesn't stop them they
can sue the police for not stopping them
and demanding their citizenship so this
essentially criminalizes substantial
part of the population in fact the part
that comes from the country which we
conquered
you know we conquered it and took it and
there's a lot of people there who what
we call Latino and background okay they
are criminalized and as you said this
can easily extend beyond in fact under
Obama it's gotten much worse I mean the
number of raids on to toss out
undocumented immigrants has increased
pretty sharply under Obama in fact it's
about a week or two ago there's a big
federal operation which I think the
biggest one ever which they caught old
huge number of a lot of planning caught
a huge number of undocumented aliens and
shipped them across the border I mean
these can be people who've lived here
since childhood you know families jobs
doesn't matter they're not persons so we
do what we want to them
well that's if we accept it that's the
society we live in
they're kind of illuminating a bit of
the background as to why we're seeing
the border look the way it that is now
that's you know the economic policies
also the political decisions that have
been so let's do that and so we're kind
of hoping to have a bit of a
conversation now about what is happening
on the border how those broader economic
and clinical decisions are as you have
to because it you know playing out in
human life and to kind of describe a bit
more about the work that the work that
we're doing and what we're seeing on the
ground and how this all turns relate and
so we're hoping to kind of open it up
for questions but before we did that I
actually wanted to talk a little bit
about some of the abuse documentation
work that number two says because that
is what Ron Street was doing actually
over spring break
no more desk friends is an alternative
Spring Break program we also operate
camps out in the desert for four months
out of the summer on when the heat often
goes over 110 degrees during the day and
the abuse documentation work is is where
increasingly we're seeing a lot of these
patterns in terms of what's happening
with the raids and also hearing the
stories of the abuses that are happening
in detention facilities and in
short-term custody with Border Patrol so
volunteers with numbered us and with a
lot of other organizations will take you
know when people are deported they come
back over the border a lot of times at
night they'll you know have that medical
care available to them through a phone
call home to maybe tell their family
what happened and it used to be more so
that a lot of the stories that
volunteers were hearing from migrants
that were being deported were the
stories of subsistence farming that was
pretty much undercut by these broader
policies people that had that had lost
everything and had no choice but to come
north to try to take care of their
families
and increasingly now with the abuse
documentation work we're hearing more
stories of long-term residents that had
been living at people that have lived in
the US for 10 11 15 20 30 years maybe
their entire lives aside from when they
were little kids and they came over with
her at their parents who have been
picked up in either these ice braids or
they have been reported to ice by
employers you know if they are asking
for an increase in their wages or
something like that are caught up in the
criminal system and are being deported
through some of the subtleties of
immigration law and arrests that are
reporting also that's that's one element
of it
so profiles where we're hearing a lot of
stories of families that are being
broken up that are being completely
spread apart and people that are trying
to get back into the u.s. to reunite
with with their spouses and their
children and their jobs and the
communities but we're also hearing a lot
more stories of extreme abuse at the
hand of Border Patrol officials and
people in these detention facilities as
well so there's a lot of stories that
even came out of the spring break just
recently of Border Patrol officers
breaking bones of people that they
encounter of pushing people into cactus
but they encounter in the desert of
psychological torture in terms of seeing
if you're picked up and it's very very
hot out there often and then you're put
into a truck crowded with a group of
other people and then the AC is turned
on you're already dehydrated and what
that does to your system people being
forced to sign documents that aren't
translated for them and signing if
they're well having the possessions
thrown away in front of them and so
that's another element that we're seeing
on that kind of is changing this dynamic
to along what's happening on the border
but also what's happening in communities
domestically how families are being
broken apart how people are trying to
get back in to see their family and how
border militarization is is playing a
part in that so I just kind of wanted to
describe a little bit about that because
that's another element besides the death
toll which by all accounts is largely
inaccurate because
a lot of people that go missing are
never found but there's also these
extremely severe abuses that are
happening to people as well that are
crossing in and well most of this is for
you but just one comment on the
incarceration the incarceration is a
neoliberal phenomenon if you go back to
the 1970s before the neoliberal programs
were instituted here the prison the rate
of incarceration in the United States
was approximately the same as Europe a
little bit on the high end but pretty
much the same and a crime in the United
States is pretty much the same as other
industrial countries actually there's
one exception in the United States
homicides with guns but that's because
it a crazed guns gun laws but if you
take that away you know you look at the
rest of crime it's approximately like
other comparable countries and the
prison rate was - now the prison rate is
about five to ten times as high as other
comparable countries not because of more
crime this is a way of getting rid of
the superfluous population it's mostly
black or Hispanic
mostly men and if you look at the
history of african-americans in the end
the reason was that as the economy
started becoming financialized
and you know production gets hollowed
out there just aren't jobs for these
people they're superfluous I mean in one
of our dependencies like Colombia the
way they handle it is by what's called
social cleansing he sent out the
military and the paramilitary and you
murderer okay we're more civilized so we
throw them into prison but the the pop
the incarceration rate has risen
steadily from the late Carter years
through Reagan through Clinton right up
til today as the neoliberal programs
have proceeded so yeah that's another
aspect of it and in fact if you take a
look at the history of african-americans
in the United States I mean we all know
that there was slavery until the Civil
War what very few people know is that
slavery was reinstituted after the Civil
War by criminalization
there was a compact between the North
and the South in 1877 after the
reconstruction was ended which
essentially allowed the south to a
criminalized black life literally yeah
some black guys standing on a street
corner you can arrest him for vagrancy
he looks the wrong way or somebody
claims he looks the wrong way at a white
woman you can arrest him for attempted
rape know that the charge may be $10 but
the system set up so he's in there for
life he has to pay the corrupt judge and
the lawyer and he doesn't have it so
they're in there for life and they
became a slave labor force in fact a lot
of the u.s. Industrial Revolution is
based on slave labor from criminals in
the south what are called criminals in
the south like u.s. steel would go down
there and yeah terrific labor force the
state gives you the work force free you
don't have to pay any attention through
them you if they die you get more it's
an endless supply of cheap labor and a
much of the American industrial
revolution you know steel mines and so
on comes out of that well that went on
until the Second World War the Second
World War
you needed free labor for war industry
so it ended and there was a black
migration to the north and there were
jobs because people had to go into war
industry the huge increase in production
and that persisted through the post-war
period there was a kind of a post-war
boom you know went through the 50s and
60s when say a black man could get a say
a job in an auto plant and get a pretty
decent life you know buy a house and get
a car and so on well by the seventies I
was over the policies changed now we
direct policies towards financial
enriching financial institutions and
stopping productive labor here what do
you do with those people stick them back
in jail where they're in fact again used
for labor forced labor you look at the
whole history of african-americans in
the United States is of a couple of
decades in which there was some sort of
relative freedom
but that talk about the border that's so
if for example if this bill passes it's
very likely that the rest of the country
can see repercussions because it's
succeeding in Arizona we tend to get
like the harshest laws pass another
example for another example of HB 2008
which passed in November which said that
anyone going to the party to Department
of Economic Security they're required to
like show their papers even if they're
only going to pick up like food stamps
for their kids for citizens with these
rights completely entitled to them so we
have a lot of really like crazy
immigration policy that just kind of
resonates from Arizona to the rest of
the country organizers are for try to
get people to understand that the reason
their wages have stagnated for thirty
years they don't have to do with
undocumented aliens and you know welfare
mothers they have to do with fundamental
decisions that are made by the masters
to shift the nature of the economy to so
that its core becomes financial
institutions you go back to say 1970 the
financial institutions you know big
banks and so on and maybe had 3% of
corporate profits and now it's close to
a third and a side effect of that is
something else goes what goes is
production so if you buy a car here
evens the General Motors car was a good
chance it was assembled in Mexico not in
a US plant and these are very concerned
those are the policies that are taking
away sort of more or less the kind of
jobs he can survive on raise a family on
you know and so on they're taking away
those jobs no it's an old process like
New England it used to be the
manufacturing center of the country but
manufacturing was shifted elsewhere back
to the south because labor was cheaper
in fact was
you slave-labor like fertilised workers
so that you know manufacturing declined
in the south and the north okay this is
the same process continuing except now
it happens to be across the borders and
it always was to some extent across the
borders but now it's much more so to
even cheaper labor under even worse
conditions you know you can make more
money out of them I mean China for
example of working conditions are
horrendous that's why there's a labor
unrest all over China no but China has
become kind of like an assembly plant
into which the more advanced economies
of Asia and the United States send parts
and components and high technology and
they assemble it very cheaply for the
you know for Dell and HP and the rest of
them great for Walmart you know you get
cheap goods and working people here or
Suffolk well you know those are the
things that people don't understand it's
not and it's happening right before
their eyes like like it takes the Obama
administration out pretty much owns the
auto industry what are they doing well
they're closing GM plants when you close
a GM plant for example you know any
destroy the workforce you destroy the
community I'm in a lot of these
communities were built by the workforce
and the in the auto industry or other
industries so they're closing GM plants
here at the same time Obama's Secretary
of Transportation Ray LaHood is
traveling around Europe using federal
stimulus money to get Spanish
corporations to build high-speed rail
facilities that could very well be built
in that GM plant but the banks and the
owners make more money out of it this
way well you know people don't
understand those things for example they
ought to be taking over this plants and
you know producing it themselves and
they ought to be you know doing things
like what was happening in the 1930s
there was massive labor unrest formation
of the CIO you know sit-down strikes
that's what led to new
legislation that's got to be organized
people have to understand that it's not
you know there was a nativist movement
then too since all the four of the Jews
and the immigrants and so on that I was
overwhelmed by a an active organized
labor movement well it's not happening
now but it ought to be and that's the
kind of thing that people who have the
kind of privilege that allows them to
work through these problems what are we
bring to people not ridiculing them in
the short term for example I think that
we should be rebuilding our productive
apparatus and D financial izing the
economy the most of the financial
institutions don't do anything that's
useful like when Goldman Sachs say what
they're being charged with now
essentially taking bets making bets
against the rotten securities that
they're selling so that when the
securities fail they'll be insured by
the debt that's CDO so cool I mean
there's no contribution to the economy
from that but it's a way for financial
speculators to get rich as they're doing
so that stuff should all be ended you
know there should be banks that perform
the function of banks you know you want
some money to buy a car borrow some
money for a bank or something that a
reasonable rate okay that's what
financial institutions should be doing
as far as the productive apparatus is
concerned it should be revealed now that
things don't happen by themselves
there's a reason why say the Asian
countries are growing and developing
South Korea Taiwan Japan China to an ik
lesser extent Singapore they have
government programs if strong
governments which establish industrial
policies which target investment and lay
the basis for productive growth now
that's our history too I mean if you use
a computer in the internet and take an
airplane in the
whatever it may be you're benefitting
from the state economy that stuff was
produced mostly in the state sector of
the economy not by entrepreneurial
initiative and consumer choice it was
done in the Universities government labs
and so on under the internet was in the
state system for around 30 years before
it was handed over to private enterprise
so yeah we had industrial and that goes
way back to the origins of American
history you know we have an industrial
system because we were highly
protectionist the state intervene
substantially and production in fact the
case of criminalizing black labor is a
case in point
it provided a cheap labor force for you
know Andrew Carnegie and so on so if you
have a if you have a functioning society
with a strong government and we would
hope a democratic government that's
developing programs of growth and
development for the population well you
can get economic growth if you the
reason why the propagandists for small
government are screaming about it is
because they want people to hate the
government so and that doesn't mean have
a weak state it means I have a strong
state but for the rich but cut back on
you take a look at the truth but the you
know you listen to NPR forget FoxNews
listen to NPR and ask what the
prescriptions are of the experts on how
to deal with the deficit every single
one says we're gonna have to cut
entitlements we're gonna have to cut you
know medical care Social Security and so
on oh you want if it's serious about the
deficit which you should be there are
ways to cut it back I mean half the
deficit is military spending we spend as
much as the rest of the world combined
and military spending that's about half
the debt the deficit the other half of
the deficit roughly is the exploding
medical costs from the highly
inefficient privatized health systems
which has twice the costs of comparable
countries well that's not touched by the
health care
because no matter what people want the
insurance company's gonna make sure that
they're not touched so there are ways to
deal with these things they're gonna
shift power gonna shift power toward the
population and away from concentrated
concentrations sectors of power now
that's in the short-term you know those
are things that you can just legislate
tomorrow in the longer term right I
agree with the workers in the mills and
around here in the late 19th century who
took it for granted that those who work
in the mills should own them
yeah well why should there be private
ownership of the mill in which you're
working and you should have the
industrial democracy just like you
should have it popular democracy
elsewhere that's in the longer term but
you got to start somewhere and there are
immediate problems that have to be dealt
with real ones I was like take say
environmental catastrophe no that's
pretty serious we don't deal with that
when I comes to worry about anything
else
and it's being consciously exacerbated
by inherent properties of the market
system the ones I mentioned not cuss the
CEOs are bad people but because that's
their institutional role to disregard
externalities like the fate of the
species well we better do something
about that or there isn't gonna be much
else to worry about you know you would
assume their solidarity but there really
isn't there's a big disconnect between
like Mexicans who believe that they have
earned the right to come here because
their family was born here and those who
have come here recently like I mean my
family is my family has been in the
United States for like 20 years but even
I see
like and my dad he he even has like some
racism and I think that it comes out of
an attitude of fear because no one wants
to associate with the underdog so it'll
put themselves in any position of power
that they can find it's also one of the
highest paying jobs that you can find
like it's very highly paid but despite
that it's such a stressful job that
there's a really high turnover rate and
as far as Border Patrol in the
organization interacting we've been
dealing with increasing tension between
normal deaths and the Border Patrol
because about a year ago like 13 people
weren't given tickets for littering
because we were leaving bottles of water
in the desert and this this Lake
attitude is still going on but we've had
Border Patrol for example say you can't
do this you can't leave bottles of water
in the desert because you're littering
but ever slash the bottles in front of
us dump them out and leave the bottles
there so it's just like an increasing
tension which we're trying to dissipate
as an organization because we don't we
don't want to have that tension we don't
want to fight we just want to be able to
do our job but there's a lot of like
negotiation that people are trying to
happen like trying to make happen but
it's really difficult because because of
the high turnover rate there are so many
new Border Patrol agents all the time
that it's impossible to like those
relationships and that's actually done
on purpose like as an organization they
don't want Border Patrol agents to build
relationships with anyone in the area
that they're working in and there's a
policy now where they because there's
multiple sectors you know Border Patrol
E throughout the country and we just
operate within the Tucson Sector which
is the the most deadly there's over 50%
of all the deaths that occur on the
border happen in the two
and there's a policy like on the books
to switch people's placements every six
months so you prevent them from
maintaining ties they're like I really
see a lot of border policy and
militarization about breaking up
communities and preventing communities
from organizing together and I think the
racial component of it is a really
strong element and I think that's what
this legislative is new legislation is
also reflecting so thank you for coming
I guess I would like to point out that
no more death always is taking
volunteers like over the summer if you
want to come out and volunteer that's
great you can just go on our website and
the flight
