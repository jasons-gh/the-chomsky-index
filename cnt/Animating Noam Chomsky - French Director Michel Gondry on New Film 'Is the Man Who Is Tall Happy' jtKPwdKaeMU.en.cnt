nermeen Shaikh and I talked to Michelle
gondry last week when he was in New York
I started by asking and how he decided
to make a film about Noam Chomsky when I
was invited at his crude MIT as an
artist in residence several time and I
asked to meet with him because I was
meeting with all sort of teacher and
astrophysics in a neurobiology and so on
and I was really intrigued by mahan
fascinated from his political views to a
scientific work and so I met with him
several time of our maybe 34 years I
like the ayah submit that submitted to
him decided to do an animated
representation of his scientific work so
why is it that you chose to focus on his
scientific work rather than on his more
well known in some circles anyway
political work well I think he's very
exposed it's very presented with this
political work and and I think it's
probably my most important work because
he's trying to save to save rival make a
change in the world but I felt that my
contribution could be a more important
if I would talk about his hands freak
work and as well I always wasn't in half
passion for science even though my
memory is not greater I have problems to
accumulate data but I felt it was just
amazing to be able to meet somebody of
the scale that see still alive huh so
what was it about his scientific work
that you wanted to convey what is it
that you want audiences to understand
about his work we're obviously he theory
and language genetic grandma his
philosophy and the perception of the
world but to me was important that I I
could show his human side because he's a
very friendly person and I think he's
very less than the he lives by his
principal and I wanted to show that to
the audience because I it seems that
they have a distant i did have an idea
of a sort of distance hitter the man and
the insta-tox that so i wanted to convey
that as well as why I'm talking about
his wife all the way he's looking at his
wife is
