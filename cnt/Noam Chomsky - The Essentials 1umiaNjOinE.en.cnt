what I focus on frankly is based on a
very elementary moral principle I
realize it's almost universally rejected
but I'd still like to reiterate it our
prime concern should be our own
responsibilities
we should our prime concern for anybody
should be the predictable consequences
of your own actions I mean it's very
self it's very convenient and you know
to be self righteous and to talk about
somebody else's crimes so you know if
you were a Russian commissar in the
nineteen seventies they'll be very
convenient to concentrate on US crimes
but the important thing to do in Russia
was not that I don't care whether soccer
I've said anything about US crimes what
you care is what they're saying about
their own society and something they can
do about and the same elementary moral
principle applies to us the focus of our
attention should be on what we can do
what we are doing what are the options
for us to try to terminate major crimes
in which we're involved and there are
plenty of them and to mitigate harm and
atrocities elsewhere and there's a lot
that we can do well we have to be
careful about the term American
exceptionalism and for whether it's not
at all exceptional every imperial power
has bathed the same way sometimes worse
so it's just normal and Furio practice
it's called exceptionalism but nothing
about that of course it's called it it's
supposed to be exceptional in that we
have the highest ideals so maybe we make
mistakes but it's always with the
highest ideals that's American
exceptionalism except that too is true
of every just about every imperial power
so when the British were destroying the
world they were always doing it was the
absolutely highest ideals the leading
figures leading intellectuals and people
like John Stuart Mill estimable people
were describing England as
an angelic country beyond anything that
anyone's ever imagined people can't
understand now marvelous we are and so
on the French were the same but hard to
find an exception said that the course
of history may be determined to a very
significant degree by what the people of
the United States will have learned from
the catastrophe meaning of course the
Vietnam War what in your opinion have we
learned from this experience I would say
very little unfortunately at the time I
wrote that which I guess was seven or
eight years ago what I had in mind was
that there are really two different ways
of looking at this catastrophe one can
look at it as a failed venture a mistake
something which was it was a mistake
because it failed mistake because it
failed but perfectly all right if it
succeeded and I think it's probably fair
to say that at least among intellectuals
people who are who write and speak
publicly a letter harsh on the
intellectuals I think that totally
unprincipled - I mean I think the
dominant view is that if we had gotten
away with it a little bit RI but we
couldn't get away with it so therefore
was stupid and their globe we should get
out but you know worse than a crime it
was blunder something of that story now
if that's all that's learned from it I
think I'd know it they've done future
history it will have shown that there
are limits to American imperialism and
your opposition has been on moral
grounds that it was wrong from the
outset although you said your opposition
came 15 years too late well active
opposition came 15 years too late I
think the time for active opposition
should have been about 1950 or a little
later but I didn't become really
actively engaged in opposing the war
until about 1964 65 at that point the
United States was very deeply involved
in what if we were honest we would call
aggression against South Vietnam that's
in fact what it was but I had of course
always been opposed to the war the war
actually began for the United States in
1950 and from 1954 to 1960 the US had a
kind of a Latin American style terror
regime in place
and there wasn't any joke they killed
about 60 or 70 thousand people but there
was no protest
zero when Kennedy took over they
escalated it to a pretty soon it became
a direct the u.s. attack still no
protest I mean through the early sixties
you couldn't get anybody to sign a
petition I mean nobody would come to a
meeting I remember we used to try to
organize meetings on Vietnam some of the
few people student a couple of students
a few others who were interested but
we'd have to put together half a dozen
topics I mean Iran Venezuela you know
six other top and then maybe you get
more people than organizers by the time
by 1965 or 1966 it was becoming a big
issue but protests were met with extreme
hostility I mean take Boston right here
there's a pretty liberal City well we
couldn't have public protests against
the work they'd be violently broken up
these speakers would be saved from being
murdered only by hundreds of state
police and it would be praised that the
protests would be the attack on the
protesters would receive be praised in
the liberal media I remember mine my
wife who had two little girls my wife
and the two kids went to a women's
protest it was you know it's like you're
not throwing stones just people walking
around with children and this was in
Concord it's a suburb quiet professional
upper middle-class suburb and they were
attacked people throwing tin cans and
tomatoes and so on and the that was
considered right
it wasn't until late 1966 that there was
enough of a change so you could you
really had substantial public opposition
and that's five years after the war was
started by then there were hundreds of
thousands of American troops rampaging
around South Vietnam
the word of course extended to the rest
of Indochina and nobody knows how many
people were killed because nobody
counted salmon another interesting thing
about the Vietnam War is we have no idea
what the cost is worth to the Vietnamese
I mean for the United States we know
down to the last person and the big
post-war issue is finding the bones of
American and pilots but nobody has any
idea how many of them he's done you
asked us after September 11 one of your
points we got to look in the mirror we
being America or the West and a look in
the mirror at our own was that a way of
saying look people like bin Laden our
angry at us for good reason by what I
was saying the statement of mine that
you just quoted is a very conservative
statement in fact it was articulated by
George Bush's favorite philosopher Jesus
Christ who pointed out famously defined
the notion hypocrite a hypocrite is a
person who focuses on the other fellows
crimes and refuses to look at his own
that's the definition of hypocrite by
George Bush's favorite philosopher when
I repeat that I'm not taking a radical
position which is just elementary
morality I don't get it Gnostic here and
religious on it but I do want it this is
not religion this is elementary morality
if people cannot rise to the level of
applying to ourselves the same standards
we apply to others they have no right to
talk about right and wrong or good but
even in right and look there's nobody
pure but an argument estimate I know
that the US has committed atrocities
however they did out more brutal regime
the Taliban there wasn't there was David
Warren but he's not a moral thing to do
they did get rid of a brutal regime
there's a celebration
okay fine a little bomb Israel and get
rid of the brutal regime there let them
bomb was Becca stun and get rid of the
brutal regime they say the Taliban but
no they're not the same they're brutal
regimes but let's go back a stage the
goal was not to oust the Taliban that
was not a warring that was a war aim
that was picked up several weeks after
the bombing started okay and let's go
back suppose that we and there doesn't
look like a list a long list of brutal
regimes around the world which ought to
be overthrown but not by somebody
bombing however let's go back to the
late late October when the after three
weeks of bombing when the US and its
British client decided to shift the war
aims to overthrowing the Taliban regime
there was a meeting sponsored by the
United States in Peshawar Pakistan of a
thousand Afghan leaders they unanimously
condemned the bombing and said it was
undermining their efforts which they
thought could succeed to overthrow the
Taliban regime from within the u.s. is
doing it just to show off their muscle
you want to so the question of whether
the overthrow a regime here that arises
and I think the Afghans are right
regimes should be overthrown from within
and in this case it was probably very
likely that that would succeed it was a
small beautiful group highly unpopular
plenty of opposition to it which could
have been organized from within and
that's the way to overthrow regime if we
want to overthrow the regime of
Uzbekistan now a great favor but it
happens to be not very different from
the Taliban the way to do it would not
be the bomb was Beckett's done but to
support internal democratic forces and
let them do it and that generalizes
around the world now Robert Kaplan who
writes about foreign policy I spoke to
him recently about his book war your
politics and I put some of your points
to him he said about the distinction
between the terrorist States and you
call Israel America and the terrorist
States that America calls the Taliban he
said I wish Noam Chomsky had been with
me in Romania in the 70s or the 80s just
one of the seven or eight Warsaw states
with just one of the seven or eight
prison systems with 700,000 political
prisoners adult choice a foreign policy
is made on distinctions the argument
that Chomsky makes has no distinctions
because
a difference between the quantity and
the kind of dictators that America
supported and the quantity and the kind
of things we went in in Kanye's world
for 44 years so let's take his example
of my aunt Ceausescu hideous regime
which he forgot to tell you the United
States supported I supported right till
the end as did Britain so the example
that he gave is a perfect example and
it's a small example because we support
much more brutal regimes but Suharto was
one of the worst killers and torturers
of the late 20th century the United
States and Britain supported him
throughout he is our kind of guy as the
Clinton administration said in 1995 a
horrible atrocity is in fact you know
when he came into office in 1965 with a
coup
the CIA compared it to Hitler Stalin and
now it led to total euphoria in the
United States and Britain a massive
support when he carried out even worse
atrocity comparable atrocities elsewhere
the couple of you know 100,000 people
killed then hundreds of thousands later
full support continued right through the
end of his rule in fact continued past
his rule in late 1999 when they were
rampaging and destroying what was left
of East Timor the US and Britain
continued to support him and I can
continue through the world like this
what cabulance Kaplan says that that
there is a distinction that everyone's
got some blood of their hands but he
says ah we have significantly less blood
because what we are soft imperialist
really state terrorists so like when we
supported his example Ceausescu and
Romania right to the end that's good
how about killing several million people
in Vietnam how about killing hundreds of
thousands of people in Central America
in the 80s leaving four countries
devastated beyond you know beyond that
maybe beyond recovery nor does it
disqualify been that the fact that this
quality that bin Laden is a terrorist or
that say the Taliban or a terrorist
state that fact doesn't disqualify them
from
bombing Washington what disqualifies
from doing that is even as even they
were not maganda they shouldn't do it
Kaplan's can't understand trivialities
the triviality here is that nobody's
compelte right-wing jingoist slike
kaplan is comparing atrocities by
various countries
what honest people are saying this seems
to be incomprehensible is that we should
keep to the elementary moral level of
the Gospels we should pay attention to
our own crimes and stop committing them
this would be true even if we were
killing one person okay and it's even
more true when we're killing millions of
people let's bring it to the bigger
picture than just because it the
question he says we all agree with the
gospel this is nasty
if you leave people alone they'll kill
each other yeah and that's why what you
need was he cause is an organizing
hegemon an overwhelming power which is
always times yeah which is always asking
rights because we and why is it us
because we have the power and we have a
massively subservient intellectual class
of which is an illustration which will
support us atrocities no matter how
awful they are it's real politic that
shows off in another land with his
gospel that he says we forget gospel I'm
talking about the most elementary
morality if a person doesn't understand
that am i right to talk okay
if you don't understand that you pay
attention to your own crimes you have no
right to talk it talks about
Machiavellian version sometimes we do a
bad thing to protect our democratic and
our good institutions and the justices
and how are we protecting our democratic
institutions by supporting mass
slaughter in southeastern Turkey in the
last few years without supporting our
democratic institutions was it
supporting our democratic institutions
not ours but anybody would Kaplan argue
that the nation state has a right to use
any means necessary to protect its
sovereignty oh then then he's justifying
the truth she's saying Milosh if it's
had any other right to anything he
wanted
to repress the customers and Albanians
everything do we needs a Constabulary a
force a central force in this case it's
American America because it's a
superpower to sometimes use unjust means
in the service of just causes what are
the just causes what was the Just Cause
in for example slaughtering Kurds in
southeastern Turkey what was it just
cause I can what was the Just Cause in
supporting Suharto when he wiped when he
killed a couple hundred thousand
landless peasants in Indonesia went on
to become one of the biggest torturers
in the world and then destroyed
slaughtered a third of the population of
East Timor what was it just cause what
was it just cause when we invaded South
Vietnam forty years ago this is the 40th
anniversary of the public announcement
of the u.s. attack on South Vietnam
ending up killing millions of people
leaving the country devastated is still
dying from chemical warfare
what was the Just Cause what was it just
cause when we fought a war to a large
extent against the Catholic Church in
Central America in the 1980s killing
hundreds of thousands of people every
imaginable kind of torture and
devastation what was the Just Cause can
I continue yeah we were the Just Cause
for people like Kaplan is we did it
therefore is it just cause you didn't
read that in the Nazi archives -
everyone has to line up and sing the
Hosanna
- our leaders that's the job of
intellectuals round up the chorus so
they all sing praises to your leaders
while they march in the parade and tell
you how magnificent we are now that's
the historic task of intellectuals no
not just here I would say historic test
I mean let's go back the state of World
War one you know far enough away so we
can think about it what it intellectuals
do during World War one well you know
first thing that happened is 93 leading
German intellectuals published a
manifesto calling on their colleagues of
the rest of the world to support Germany
and it's magnificent to
aim to bring justice and peace to the
world what are the West be your American
intellectuals do exactly the same thing
in fact they all lauded their the
magnificence of their own leaders there
were some exceptions a Muslim end up in
jail
on both sides so in Germany Rosa
Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht objective
were in jail in England
Bertrand Russell objected he was in jail
in the United States Eugene Debs is the
leading figure and US labor in the 20th
century and a socialist presidential
candidate he went to jail for raising my
all the questions about Woodrow Wilson's
war and others were just repressed you
know like Randolph Bourne was kicked out
of all these journals and so on because
they didn't join the parade and
intellectuals are supposed to join the
parade and they do exceptions are so
rare you know you can practically list
them and there are exceptions and there
are honorable ones acting most of them
are in the third world give you put a
few but in the West most intellectuals
are very loyal and submissive why is
there hatred against us there George
Bush's famous question well everyone
knows the answer to this a couple of
days after the I mean they have to
distinguish two things here there's a
category of people called intellectuals
their task is to make up fabrications
that protect power and divert attention
from what's obvious and indoctrinate
people and so on and they've concocted
all sorts of complicated stories about
globalization and you know failure under
the modern world this that and the other
thing okay we and they envy us because
we're so wonderful etcetera etcetera are
we put all that aside that's standard
propaganda let's talk about what is
plainly the case and it is in fact
discussed by serious people like say The
Wall Street Journal so a few days after
the September 11th
The Wall Street Journal - it began
running serious stories in which they
investigated opinions of people in the
Islamic world who they are interested in
what they called money Muslims the ones
with rich ones the important ones so
bankers international lawyers directors
of multinational corporations people who
are right inside the US system who
certainly have no opposition to what's
called globalization effective part of
it who certainly hate in Laden because
he's trying to kill them you know but
who nevertheless agree with much of what
he says and what they say is their
opinions are that the United States
supports brutal and corrupt regimes
which block democracy and modernization
and development they oppose particular
policies like the decisive US support
for the 35-year military occupation of
Palestinian territory which has been
harsh and brutal and relies crucially on
US military and diplomatic support when
you read those papers that Israeli
helicopters and jets are attacking
Palestinians that's total fabrication US
jets and US helicopters which happened
to be piloted by Israeli pilots are
attacking those concentrations that's
what oughta be said Israel doesn't
manufacture helicopters were f-16 and
they understand all that they know that
the US has been blocking any diplomatic
settlement for thank you for 30 years
since about offered one in 1971 it's not
reported here and in the West it's not
talked about much but they know it the
and they know what's going on there they
also know perfectly well that the US and
Britain are carrying out operations
against Iraq which are devastating the
civilian society and strengthening said
on the saying and they also remember as
Westerners like to forget
that the US has NOAA and Britain and
France and Holland and so on have no
opposition objection to have a saddam
hussein's crimes you know that for sure
because they support supported Saddam
Hussein right through the period of his
worst crimes gassing the Kurds unfollow
chemical weapons they continue to
support him very happily he remained a
good favoured friend an ally of the West
which helped provide him with the means
for developing weapons of mass
destruction when he was really dangerous
so they listened when Tony Blair and
Madeleine Albright condemned Saddam
because you know the ultimate monster
even gassed his own people they listened
but they add the words that are excluded
in the West they say yeah he committed
those crimes with your support like a
rather crucial omission which you never
hear from Tony Blair or in the rest but
they are not that indoctrinated so that
you remember that there was elementary
truths and those are other reasons why
if you want there's hatred against us
furthermore there's definitely nothing
new about this anybody who wants to
understand any of it knows exactly where
to go you go to the Declassified US
record us a very open society we have
Declassified records of internal
deliberations from the past all these
questions came up decades ago so in 19th
and had the same answers in 1959
fifty-eight personal year for many
reasons look I'm not talking about
internal record the US so the Eisenhower
administration discussed three major
crises for the United States
one was Indonesia one was North Africa
third was the Middle East all Islamic
countries all oil producers the question
arose whether the Russians were involved
that was dismissed as ludicrous no
Russian involvement
it's just independent nationalism in the
three countries which is the main Christ
then Eisenhower pointed out with regard
to the Middle East
his words approximately he said there is
a campaign of hatred against us not by
the governments but by the people and
that that was an issue that was
discussed no globalisation you know no
they hate us because we have McDonald's
and none of this stuff why is there a
campaign of hatred against us well the
National Security Council have discussed
it is the highest analysis and planning
body and they said the problem is that
there's a perception among the people of
the region that the United States
supports corrupt and harsh regimes which
prevent democratization and development
and so because of its interest in
controlling Nereus oil and they said
it's hard to counter this perception
because it's true and furthermore it
should be true because we should support
those regimes in order to maintain our
control over Near East oil so therefore
there is a campaign of hatred against us
by the people who see that we're robbing
their resources and preventing democracy
and development but you know we can't do
much about it because that's what we
ought to be doing well you know like I
say no McDonald's no and Venus Eyre
magnificence no globalization just
perfectly obvious things the same reason
why there was a campaign of hatred
against England from the people of India
or against Holland from the people of
the East Indies and so on and so forth
now you crushed people under your boot
they don't like it so this campaign of
hatred against in fact what they what
they were discussing internally in 1958
is the same as what the Wall Street
Journal found and
in nineteen in 2001 you know and for the
same reasons because the policies
haven't fundamentally change so that's
so we understand I mean the Wall Street
Journal only was concerned with a lead
opinion if they'd gone down to the slums
of Cairo they would have gotten stronger
opinions but the same kind and more
different ones also because in the slums
of Cairo they wouldn't like the fact
that the wealth of the region is going
to the west and not to the people of the
region the ones who The Wall Street
Journal was talking about are quite
happy about that because they are part
of the ruling elite and they enrich
themselves while the resources go to the
west so they are part of the imperial
system so you get different opinions if
you bother to ask people in those
so-called streets but fundamentally it's
the same so there's a campaign so
there's a bin Laden's messages certainly
resonate some people agree with a lot of
the things he's saying about 80% of
Egyptians for example I say that the
most important issue to them is the
crushing of the Palestinians so when
they hear of bin Laden say they agreed
does not do it they like him or hate him
on the other hand there is a clique of
terror of radical Islamists who were
organized and trained and brought
together by Western intelligence for
their own purposes and I've continued to
do for 20 years just with Havel I said
they were going to do so while some
things are obscure I don't think the
what state does function according to
what you call the minimal levels of
honesty is their stamina generates our
power centers the only thing that
imposes constraints on them is either
outside force or their own populations
so the United struggle criticism
critical dialogue that's exactly why the
intellectuals who were talking about are
so adamant at preventing people in the
United States and Britain from learning
the most elementary facts about is it
possible that if you say no state
functions not English what happens the
United States for example is far more
civilized than it was 40 years ago
just take that March 9th this March
happened to be the 40th anniversary of
the public announcement by the Kennedy
administration that the US Air Force is
bombing South Vietnam it also initiated
chemical warfare to destroy crops
initiated napalm started driving
millions of people into concentration
camps to separate them from the
guerrillas or they knew what they were
supporting this was all public did we
commemorate the 40th anniversary no why
because 40 years ago nobody cared if the
government announces ok we're going to
start bombing another country and use
chemical warfare to wipe out their crops
and drive them to concentration camps
fine not a problem so there was no
protest in their discussion now there's
more proximal yes because the country
has gotten more civilized no US
president today or for the last 20 years
could conceivably do what Kennedy could
do with total impunity 40 years ago and
the reason is because there was massive
popular protest opposed by the
intellectual classes of course who hated
but it did it led to all sorts of things
including opposition through aggression
and violence it also spawned the
contemporary civil rights movement the
feminist movement the environmental
movements and all sorts of other things
and it imposed important constraints on
street violence that's how we got rid of
slavery that's how we got rid of
feudalism that's how it's moving towards
an emancipation from these slowly yes
over over time there has been agonizing
Glee slow progress but very real always
opposed by the states by the
intellectuals who support violence and
atrocities and try to justify them and
try to prevent the population from
knowing about them but fortunately their
control is limited and therefore the
state look like at the end at the end at
the end I think state sort of dissolve
because I think there are legitimate
structures but that's a long time that's
it but the end of the nation state that
you foresee in the vision I don't
foresee anything what I'm saying is that
as long as people ordinary people are
able to free themselves from the
doctrinal controls imposed on them by
their self-appointed betters and mentors
I as long as they're able to do this
they'll continue to be able to struggle
for peace and justice and freedom and
limitations on violence and constraints
on power as they've been doing for
hundreds of years and I don't see any
end to that where it'll end up in the
long run I can tell you where I'd like
it to but I wouldn't even dream about
that
the immediate problem is to free
ourselves from the shackles imposed very
consciously by the kind of people you're
talking about we don't want the facts to
be known and for very good reasons but
if people know the facts they're not
going to tolerate them so they're afraid
to prevent them from knowing you have to
indoctrinate them you have to tell them
stories about how we're really good guys
and if we use violence must be for the
general good because we represent the
course of history you know that's the
job of propagandists for power and
violence and it's the task of
populations to free themselves from
those kinds of controls and domination
your view what's wrong with private
ownership of the means of production we
should not have relations of hierarchy
dominance subordination centralized
control over the means of life people
who give orders and orders to take lies
all that yeah if you have private
ownership of the means of production it
means that first of all the people it's
not just one person it's a institution
so you get like maybe it's a corporation
or private business or something
first of all internally it's essentially
a totalitarian institution almost
necessarily there's a group at the top
maybe a person or a group they make the
decisions they give orders people down
hierarchy get the orders transmit them
at the very bottom you get people who
are permitted to rent themselves to
survive that's called a job wage labor
and you get the outside community who's
allowed to purchase what you produce and
of course they're very heavily
propaganda is to make them want to
consume it even if they don't so that's
nature the system it's kind of a that
was close to totalitarianism as you can
imagine private enterprise works just
the way Milton Friedman says you give
the worst possible service at the
highest possible profit that's what it
means to be in the business if you try
to be benevolent you're out of the
business because somebody undercuts you
so the nature of the system is good in
sight there's a way back to Adam Smith
is to be as mean and rotten as you can
to try to maximize profit and market
fear and give the worst possible service
name with HMOs and everything else the
system is is has unacceptable risk built
into it it's well known among economists
that markets are inefficient from the
narrowest perspective so to make it
simple suppose you and I you suppose you
sell me a car okay we may make a good
deal for ourselves we're not taking into
count the effect on him that's what's
called an externality
and there's an effect if you sell me in
a car a car it increases gas prices
increases pollution increases congestion
and that extends very broadly these so
called externalities could be very large
now in financial institutions it's far
worse they are in the business of taking
risks if they're well managed they they
calculate the potential cost to
themselves if there's a loss but the
important words are to themselves they
don't calculate in what's called
systemic risk the effect on the whole
system if I make if I go bust you know
and as a huge effect the result is that
risk-taking is underpriced meaning
there's a lot more of it than there
would be in a reasonable system in your
role a CEO of a corporation you are
compelled to maximize profit and to
ignore what economists call
externalities that is the impact of your
transactions on others well that's why
we have repeated financial crises ever
since Reagan and Thatcher the
deregulation of the financial
institutions means that the people who
run them have to ignore what's called
systemic risk the risk that a
transaction is going to bring down the
system
and since you ignore it you're
increasing the probability of it and
therefore it repeatedly happens so we
repeatedly have financial crises each
one worse than the last markets are
supposed to be magnificent because they
increase your choices actually they
restrict your choices you think about it
for a minute
suppose I want to get home from work at
night
okay the market offers me a choice I can
have a four-door Toyota it does not
offer me the choice of the subway what I
want what's good for me what's good for
the environment what's good for my
children but that's not offer to the
market
markets offer individual consumption and
the enormous stress on the importance of
markets is part of the way to drive
people towards looking for yourself I'm
a Singh there's many commodities you can
forget everything else in fact if you
think about it for every one of you is
taking an economics course or read about
it then you know what markets are
supposed to be markets are supposed to
be systems in which informed consumers
make rational choices right I'm sure
every one of you is turned on a
television set what do you see when you
turn around a television set you see
that there's a huge industry public
relations industry which began in the
United States and Britain incidentally
huge industry which is designed
undermine part of the business world the
undermine markets but to keep the aspect
that's usable for profit and power
namely separating people from one
another focusing on individual choices
not working with your neighbor what's
called neoliberalism it is an attack on
democracy and is an open attack of
democracy it's not secret the goal is to
minimize the state and if you minimize
the state you're maximizing something
else what is the thing that you're
maximizing well private tyranny the
state is the arena within which the
public has some role at least in
principle in determining policy in the
private sector has no role so the more
that the public arena is minimized and
private power is maximized the less you
have democracy now personally in my view
the state is an illegitimate Institute
should be dismantled but not as long as
private power is there because that's
much worse that's a system which is
unaccountable to the public and the main
thrust of neoliberalism is precisely
that it's to restrict the arena within
which the public can make some
difference my suggestion is to extend
the public arena and in in the classic
fashion namely as I said before working
people should have control of the places
in which they work not private tyrants
the people of the community should have
control of their community and they
should interact with one another that
increases the public sphere if the heavy
concentration of private power is
eliminated then I think moves towards
dismantling the entire state system are
entirely legit proper but you face what
the world that you're in right now
incidentally these neoliberal moves are
not moves towards establishing a market
system a private corporation is outside
the market system if you look at world
trade you know about take say the United
States about half of US trade is not
trade at all it's just transactions
internal to a corporation run by a very
visible hand and which just happened to
cross borders so half of US exports to
Mexico don't even enter the Mexican
economy there just think parts are being
assembled in the United States
transferred to Mexico through another
branch of say the same Ford Motor
Company it's called exports they come
back to the United States called imports
that's not trade that's mercantilism and
that's huge part of world trade it's
kind of corporate mercantilism in which
that the market is functioning only at
the margins and functioning mostly to
control people the the the ones who are
running the world economy have
protected themselves very strongly from
market discipline fact if you look at
the top there are some good studies by
good economists of transnational
corporations and there's one major study
by two British economist of the top 100
transnational corporations every one of
them has benefited from the
interventionist policies of its own of
its home government and 20 of the
hundred have been saved from complete
collapse by state takeover and bailout
and over and above that the corporation
itself is out of the market system its
internal transactions are central
centrally directed these are command
economies so you have a the neoliberal
system is an attack in my view both on
the market and on democracy consequences
of the austerity agenda pretty obvious
there in Europe or there being imposed
more strictly there devastating the
societies one is a rich Society they're
increasing debt as anticipated they're
creating a huge number of unemployed and
the United States switches in this in
this case more progressive than Europe
there's there being applied but less
rigorously and they're having a milder
version of the same effects it's not
because people want it so like in the
United States for example there's plenty
of polls the general population
considers the main problem to be
unemployment not deficit and they're
right in fact the deficit is probably a
good idea right now
it's a stimulus to the economy and it's
a way to create more jobs even the IMF
this coming around to accept this so who
wants to austerity well bankers rich
people the people have run the world
they want austerity this recent studies
came out by
good political scientist Ben page
Larry Bartels in which they just studied
attitudes towards deficit and austerity
and the jobs ranked by income level and
it's exactly as you'd predict the very
top of the income scale
the problem is deficits so we have to
have austerity the rest of the
population we don't have a functioning
democracy roughly seventy percent of the
population lower seventy percent their
views have no influence on policy
they're disenfranchised and you get more
influences you go up the scale at the
very top that means tenth of one percent
well what they want is they don't care
what's happened in the past ten or
twenty years is just astonishing I mean
even the Wall Street Journal is
astonished though they pointed out
recently in an article that which is
correct but in Europe no matter what
government is elected you know far left
or right anything else they follow
exactly the same policies because they
have no role in setting policy the
policies are set in the and by the
bureaucrats and Brussels under the
shadow of the Bundys funk so it doesn't
matter what people think in fact there
are some dramatic illustrations of that
couple years ago the Greek Prime
Minister Papandreou meekly suggested
that maybe there should be a referendum
in Greece so that people could say
whether they wanted to accept the
policies that were being dictated to
them
he was denounced across the spectrum
everybody denounced him is totally crazy
how can you dare ask the population what
policies ought to be in Europe we know
that policies have to be set by the
bankers most you have save iPhones or
something like that in your pocket
for example they have in the GPS where
the GPS come from it's created by the US
Navy the Navistar program that has micro
electronics software hardware created
almost all created for decades mostly in
the state sector under often and the
u.s. Pentagon funding here the
counterpart taxpayers pay for this
because they think they're protecting
their security that's what they're told
but in fact the government doesn't care
about your security what it cares of is
about its own power and security for
corporate power and the way the system
works is the taxpayer takes the risks
carries out the investment for decades
literally decades finally something may
come out which is profitable and then
the profit goes to the private sector if
if we had anything remotely like
capitalist systems we don't they would
they would adhere to the capitalist
principle that if an investor takes
risks and you know invests and Waits and
takes risky steps and if something comes
out of it the profit goes back to the
investor that's not the way it works
here the profit goes to people who had
nothing to do with it the risks are
taken by you often through the Pentagon
and comparable systems and if anything
comes out the profits go to Microsoft
and Apple they didn't create it they bar
they take it it's given to them and it
literally is days so computers were
the first in a computer market personal
computer market became viable in 1977 I
think it was Apple was the first that
was about thirty years after the
development of computers almost all in
the state sector like in the building
where I work and it's the said if you
buy pharmaceuticals let's say the
research the basic research and
development is pretty much done in the
state sector places like probably the
biology lab right here probably gets
government funding grants and that's all
across the board when you look back at
these I mentioned the trans-pacific
partnership one part of that was leaked
by WikiLeaks it's secret except for the
corporate lawyers and lobbyists but one
part was leaked it was the part on
intellectual property intellectual
property is a polite term a kind of a
euphemism for government instituted
monopoly pricing rights that's what it
really means
it means extraordinarily hide patent
rights which have never existed in
history for the pharmaceutical
corporations and some other corporations
that's to keep the price of drugs up and
make profits astronomical now there's a
pretext and the pharmaceutical
corporations say look we need that for
research and development that's been
investigated turns out but it's probably
at least half of the RMD is not done by
the pharmaceutical corporations at all
stunned by the state sector and so on
and that's an under estimate because if
you take a closer look the part that's
funded by the pharmaceutical
corporations is towards the marketing
end like you know with around the
molecule to get a new drug with the
basic research the hard costly risky
research that's done by people like you
you pay for it through your taxes
the pharmaceutical corporations ripoff
the profit in the period when the press
was most free was about the mid 19th
century I mean at that time just keeping
to say England in the United States the
two cases that have been studied I
imagined the same elsewhere in the mid
nineteenth century there was a very
lively popular press very widely read by
you know working people by everyone but
no much reached far beyond the
commercial media at the time it was very
diverse it represented you know
reflected public interest and public
concerns and was very popular in Britain
they tried to close it down by
censorship of various kinds but that
didn't work there were too many ways to
avoid it and it was finally understood
that the way to eliminate it was by
advertising while reliance on
advertising and by concentration of
capital so just through the effect of
reliance on advertising which was then
just a you know kind of beginning like
around a century ago and concentration
of capital they've realized that over
time they could marginalize the
independent popular press which couldn't
get the advertising of course because
advertisers know like what they were
saying and didn't have the capital and
it took a long time so in England that
was actually up until that about 40
years ago
still the case forty years ago that the
main newspaper in England The Daily
Herald was a kind of labor oriented
social democratic newspaper very popular
you know if everybody had outsold all
the others the the mirror which was the
main tabloid was the same kind of
leftist paper popular paper but they
kind of come to advertising pressure and
capital control the United States
happened a bit earlier but it was the
same same process and advertising is - I
mean it's part of much bigger industries
as advertising is part of the public
relations industry there's a huge
industry and it developed very
consciously around the first
war in the two most democratic countries
the United and the United States and
there's a good reason for it they were
coming down to as the countries were
becoming more free that just through
popular struggle and people were winning
the franchise and you couldn't shut him
up anymore by force it became it was
understood that you're gonna have to
control people by controlling opinion
and attitudes because we can't rely on
force anymore and the control of opinion
and attitudes means well you know there
was actually a phrase for it this this
was the time when what was called
scientific management of work was
becoming a big issue
Taylor right management you know Ford
know that stuff but it was also
understood you want to not only control
very closely the lives of people in
their work time but also you have to
control them in their off work time and
what you have to do is turn them into
passive obedient consumers who don't pay
you know don't try to get out of our
hair basically pay attention to the what
we're called the superficial things of
life like fashionable consumption you
get them trapped into consumerism
isolated from one another atomized
control their beliefs
that's where notions like manufacture of
consent come from right after this first
world war and out of this came huge
industries the advertising is a large
part of it but and it of course affects
the media and I mean if any of you ER
if you watch television for example
takes a television when you turn on the
television set the corporation doesn't
make any money right like they you don't
pay them when you turn it on less it's
cable but they do so why do they do it
well they do it because of the
advertising so the the resources and the
creativity and the effort and so on in
the whole television industry goes in
advertisement in fact within the
television industry they there are there
are words called content and fill like a
program has content and a program has
fill the content is the
Verizon the fill is the car chase that's
in there to keep you watching until the
next dad comes along and all the effort
of course goes into the advertiser and
the the country phil has to you know
first let's keep your interest enough so
you watch the advertising but the
advertising is there for a purpose I
mean it's to make you it's to turn
people into creatures whose only concern
in life is to max out their five credit
cards and not to pay attention to what's
going on in the world and let the rich
powerful guys do what they want without
interference essentially the same
message because why well we have to look
what the message is first of all the
message is one of remarkable
subordination to power now power in the
United States doesn't happen to be in
state it's not the it's not a
centralized military bureaucratic state
like in the Soviet Union power in the
United States primarily lies in
corporations in the corporate world the
there's very narrow
concentration of control over resources
over investment decisions and so on and
so forth and that affects everything
can't help affecting everything it
effects the government because this
means that there's a very close link
between governmental power and corporate
power furthermore just the ability to
make investment decisions and financial
decisions places bounds on what any
government could do yeah furthermore it
now let's go to the major media for what
are the major media well they're huge
corporations ok the New York Times
Washington Post NBC they FERC law are
large corporations they're quite
profitable ones in fact secondly there
are parts of even bigger conglomerates
like you know Westinghouse and GE and so
on now like any corporation they sell a
product on a market this is a market
roughly a mark that kind of a fate
guided market society what's the product
and what's the market well the markets
advertisers that is other businesses so
they're selling a product to other
businesses corporations are selling a
product other businesses what's the
product well the product is audiences
now for the major media
the ones that kind of set the agenda
they're selling a lead audiences
privileged audiences New York Times say
is targeting privileged elite sectors of
the population that's their audience and
they're trying to sell that audience to
other businesses not so we have to begin
with just on you know the most
elementary grounds we have it we look at
a system suppose we're Martians you know
we're looking at this system we say okay
here are huge corporations selling
privileged audiences to other businesses
well what picture of the world do you
expect to come out of that then we begin
that other factors if you're let's say
you're the chief diplomatic
correspondent of the New York Times or
you know fund it on the op-ed page and
you want to really have important you
know insights into the government well
we all know how that's done you have
lunch with the Secretary of State he
tells you the lies that he wants to
appear tomorrow
you write them and you say a high source
in Washington my intrepid reporting has
discovered that a high source in
Washington said so and so in fact if you
compare the internal declassified record
you know say people like Dean Acheson
these decisions and you look at say
James Reston columns we're pretty close
and the same will be true about the
James Baker and Thomas Friedman
furthermore this is an open secret we
know that this is the way it's it's not
a big secret in the journalism
profession that this is now in order to
maintain those contacts you better
present the world a certain way or those
contexts are going to be cut off you'll
you'll lose your opportunity to have to
appear to have special insight to have
leaks you know to be able to come across
with a story you know cull hours before
the next person and so on plus you know
now in order there's there's an
interplay here which requires power in
order to maintain your own power that's
another factor over and above the just
structural institutional are just this
so-called Patriot movement is just one
ask notice first of all that their
slogans are very much like what the
whole propaganda system has been trying
to ram it your heads for 50 years the
government is the enemy and private
power doesn't exist
okay now it's obvious why big
corporations who are fighting the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
would want that to be the picture you
have if the government is your enemy and
you can let's say when people when 83%
of the population think the economic
systems inherently unfair that's
supposed to mean
they're angry at the government if you
can take that view then those who run
the private institutions are quite
well-off there's no threat of democracy
they can run things peacefully the
people are demoralized and the normal
weapon the normal methods of democratic
participation to gain social ends are
excluded so it makes good sense for
corporate propaganda which means most of
what we see in here makes a good sense
for it to be trying to stress the
message that the government is the enemy
and that and destress in fact eliminate
from sight the fact that private power
exists government is the enemy everybody
is in harmony that's been the message
well the militias just take that a step
further you know they kind of take it
through its logical extension yeah okay
government's the enemy let's blow up the
federal bill okay so in a sense they're
kind of hearing the indoctrination and
taking it literally well it also has
deeper roots in American history but
apart from that remember that it's just
this is a very cult ridden society the
the militias are cold and they're only
one and by no means the major one um
people are isolated they're atomized
they they don't believe in the political
system and they don't take part in it
they don't organize in other ways the
unions are very weak which have been the
leading democratizing force in most of
modern history this kind of constructive
civil society has been very much
demolished kind of striking to compare
the richest country in the world the
United States with the poorest country
in the Western Hemisphere namely Haiti
which had
you know peasants and people in the
slums and so on did construct and have
sustained amazingly a very lively
vibrant civil society with grassroots
organizations and unions and all sorts
of things and had an effect I mean they
got their own president into office
well that conception of democracy has
been knocked out of people's heads here
we could do well to go to the Haitian
slums and try to learn something about
what democracy is but here it's kind of
it has been very much dissolved people
feel lonely isolated atomized you know
me and the tube they don't do anything
with anyone else the normal methods of
interchange and constructive action like
for example unions or political
organizations barely are very weak by
comparative standards well how do people
react to them well one of the reasons
ways they react is people just don't
give up you know they form other ways of
associating and the other ways of
associating are often extremely
irrational I think that's a reflection
of the dissolution of functioning civil
society and constructive ways of
responding the militias are just one
piece of it and they happen to be
picking out the major theme of the
propaganda system you can't say they
invented it that's exactly what people
are told all the time yeah government's
the enemy you can't do anything through
the political system because it's your
enemy
so therefore let us we and run the
private system let us run everything and
don't bother us okay essentially what
they're doing they're not inventing it
they're just exaggerating something that
has been the primary theme of propaganda
for 50 years and doing it in a way which
you can kind of understand in a
dissolving society where there's plenty
of other and in fact much bigger and
more I think more dangerous cults
development well you know all of that
can be reversed it's happened in the
past and it's been reversed unions were
much worse off in the 1920s and they'd
barely existed and then in the 1890s I
mean I didn't they exist they were being
you know people trying to organize
they're simply being murdered by
security forces fact that went on into
the 1930s here okay
things are better than they were
you know but it can be recovered the way
it's been recovered in the past that's
why we live in a better country then
than it was 60 years ago much better
than it was a hundred years ago
professor Chomsky I think one of the
reasons that you see crowds like this is
people are interested in hearing these
things that don't get said very often
and generally agree that gee these are
bad things how could the US government
be involved in them why do you think it
is that most people feel one way and yet
our leaders invariably and you cited
Democratic and Republican leaders all of
them going across the board you said
Carter Clinton both wishes Reagan why do
you think it is that our leaders don't
feel the same way that we do I don't
want to over generalize there a lot of
different people in Congress and the
White House and so on but by and large
overwhelmingly they simply respond to
different interests that 75 percent of
the population who was skeptical of the
election we're basically correct policy
is determined by power by concentration
of domestic power and it's not a big
secret how power is concentrated
domestically there it's concentrated in
huge conglomerates which are internally
tyrannies in effect they're mostly
unaccountable to the public there
they're given an enormous rights far
beyond the rights of persons they're
linked to one another and all kind of
alliances they have an overwhelming
effect on state policy which largely
keeps to what they want so on and if
they happen to differ
you know if there's splits among them
you get things coming up in elections
where they agree it doesn't come up like
some of the major issues for the US
population are things like the
international economic agreements what
are called trade agreements so they
don't have much to do with trade or say
the free trade area of the Americas or
the trade deficit and so on these are
really top issues they don't come up in
the elections and they don't come up in
the elections for a very simple reason
the business world is on one side and
the population is on the other side very
largely and they know it so like in the
Wall Street Journal they say you know
the problem is if these things come up
opponents of these agreements have what
they call an ultimate weapon namely the
general population so therefore we have
to keep them from coming up and they
don't come up in elections and they're
not discussed and the population more or
less knows that even if they don't know
all the details about you know GATS and
so on yeah except you know anyone who
tries to break out of that know that
rather rigid framework is going to be
marginalized because they don't have the
resources and they don't control them
they don't have the media and they don't
have the organization and so on it's
going to take large popular movements to
change this and that can happen what's
happened in the past I mean that's why
the freedom and justice have expanded
over the centuries it's never been gifts
yeah one gifts from the rich and
powerful these are things that were one
you know they were won by the labor
movement and by the women's movement
about the civil rights movement by other
by human rights movements they're won by
popular struggle then you get a so you
move forward but they're never given us
gifts and they won't be in the future
that leads that critical question
professor Chomsky how do we fight back
how do we win we write back the way they
did in the 1930s the way the populist
movement did in the 1890s and the labor
movement then finally defeated but not
without a lot of victories the way the
civil rights movement
worked again with significant victories
so certainly not what Martin Luther King
was trying to achieve you organize you
try first you have to educate like what
you're doing on you know on your
activities then you have to which
includes educating yourself and then you
have to try to organize get people
mobilized to do something as
the Occupy movement did and has done
inmate might continue to do and then
carry out actions of the kind that
threaten power and require a response
like say see is it down strikes and
there plenty of other things you can do
so for example some things are going on
kind of quietly in the country which
have potentially a kind of you know even
revolutionary implications the growth
and development of cooperatives and
workaround enterprises for example it's
not on a huge scale what it's on a
significant scale and spreading and
those are what could be the germs of a
new society in very different society
undermining capitalist social and
economic relations well all of us on all
sorts of fronts there are things that
can be done and sometimes they're
successful I mean for example but you
know the 1960s 60s activism I had quite
a civilizing effect on the country it
did evoke tremendous backlash from the
nineteen seventies and we're living in
the midst of that backlash but there are
plenty of achievements many of them were
carried forward some are being carried
forward right now I say the advance of
gay rights or much too limited but at
least some concern about the environment
all of those things are developing they
can go further so there's no shortage of
things to do the kinds of tasks that
have always been in front of people who
wanted to make a better world not easy
ones but but not impossible either
there's successes in the past that we
can build on
the political system increasingly
increasingly functions without public
input it means to an increasing extent
not only do people not ratify decisions
presented to them but they don't even
practice it but they don't even take the
trouble of ratifying them they assume
that the decisions are going on
independently of what they may do in the
polling booth and they feed us that even
ratification of decisions made elsewhere
is a very weak form of democracy
ratification would it would be what well
ratification would mean a system in
which there are two positions presented
to me the voter I go into the polling
booth and I push one or another button
depending on which of those positions I
want that's a very limited form of
democracy a real really meaningful
democracy it would mean that I play a
role in forming those decisions making
creating those positions that those
positions reflect my active creative
participation at it not just me but of
course everyone that would be real
democracy that's not very far from that
in a capitalist democracy you have the
problem and it is always perceived as a
problem that the popular general
population has a method of participating
in a decision-making they can
participate in politics the state is not
capable of stopping them you can't shut
them up you can't put them in jail you
can't keep them away from the polls and
so on and it's striking but that has
always been perceived as a problem to be
overcome it's what's called the crisis
of democracy too many people organizing
themselves to become to practice it to
enter the public arena that's a crisis
so therefore what we have to have what
walter Lippmann back in 1920 or so
called manufacture of consent we have to
ensure that actual decision-making
actual power is in the hands of what he
called a specialized class a smart guys
you know we're gonna make the right
decisions and we've got to keep the
general population marginalized because
they're always going to make mistakes
marginalizing meaning reduce them to a
path Ian obedience allow them to
participate in the political system but
as consumers not as true participants
that has allowed them a method for
ratifying decisions that are made by
others but eliminate the methods by
which they might
first inform themselves second organize
and third act in such a way as to really
control decision-making that is the
ideas our leaders control us not we
control them the doctrines of the
Enlightenment held that individuals
should be free from the coercion of
concentrated power well the kind of
concentrated power that they were
thinking about was the church and the
state and the feudal system and so on
and that you could sort of imagine a
collect a population of relatively equal
people at least equal weight now
property owners who would be not
controlled by those private powers but
in the subsequent period a new form of
power developed namely corporations with
highly concentrated power over
decision-making in the economic life
that is they can control over what's
produced what's distributed what's
invested and so on and so forth it's
very narrowly concentrated this is why
the vice president of the Lord's
corporation doesn't say the public mind
is totally mine might have funny ideas
about democracy which say that we should
not be forced simply to rent ourselves
to the people who own the country rather
and own its institutions rather we
should play a role in determining what
those institutions do that's democracy
if if we were to move towards democracy
and I think democracy even in the 18th
century sense we would say that there
should be no mail distribution of power
in determining what's produced what's
distributed what's invested and so on
rather that should be that's a that's a
problem for the entire community in fact
there are in my own personal view unless
we move in that direction the human
society probably isn't going to survive
why well we now face the most awesome
problems of human history about problems
such as the likelihood of nuclear
conflict either among the superpowers or
through proliferation the destruction of
a fragile environment which finally
we're beginning to recognize those
obvious decades ago that we're heading
for disaster other problems of this
nature they're they're of a level of
seriousness that they never were
in the past why do you think more
participation by a public by the public
more democracy is the answer because
well more democracy is a value in itself
so part because democracy is a value
doesn't have to be defended any more
than freedom has to be defended that's
just it's it's a part of it's an
essential feature of human nature that
people should be free that should be
able to participate they should be
uncoerced and so on these all values in
themselves
why do you think if we go that route I
think that that's the only hope that I
can see that other values will come to
the fore I mean if the society is based
on control by private wealth it will
reflect the values that in fact does
reflect the value that the highest the
only real human property is the desire
for its green and the desire to maximize
personal gain at the expense of others
now any society made that small society
based on that principle is ugly but it
can survive a global society based on
that principle is headed for massive
destruction and that's what we are we
have to have a mode of social
organization that reflects other values
that I think are inherent in human
nature that people recognize and that
would be able to see exactly I mean what
are human beings I mean in your family
for example it's not the case that in
the family every person tries to
maximize personal gain at the expense of
others or if they do it's kind of
pathological it's not the case that if
if you and I are say walking down the
street and we see a child eating a piece
of candy and we see the nobody's around
we don't spend we happen to be hungry we
don't steal it if we did that would be
would be pathological I mean the idea of
care for others and concern for other
people's needs and concern for a fragile
environment that must sustain future
generations all of these things are part
of human nature
these are elements of human nature that
are suppressed in a social and cultural
system which is designed to maximize
personal gain well I think we must try
to overcome that suppression and that's
in fact what democracy could
bringing out it could lead to the
expression of other human needs and
values which tend to be suppressed under
the institutional structure of a system
of private power and private profit if a
real democracy is going to thrive if the
real values that are deeply embedded in
human nature are going to be able to
flourish and I think that's necessary to
save us if nothing else it will be it's
an absolute necessity that that groups
form in which people can join together
can share their concerns can articulate
their ideas can gain a response can
discover what they think can discover
what they believe what their values are
this can't be imposed on you from above
you have to discover it by experiment by
by by effort by trial by application and
so on and this has to be done with
others
furthermore surely central to human
nature is a need to be engaged with
others in cooperative efforts of
solidarity and concern that can only
happen almost by definition through
group structures and unless such a floor
Galatian political and other civic or
there's all sorts of trade association
which people can associate with one
another and I think what I would like to
see is a move towards a society which is
really based on for Lacan proliferating
voluntary organization with eliminating
as much as possible as the structures of
hierarchy and domination and the basis
for them and ownership and control and
[Music]
becoming the means by which we govern
ourselves by which we control our lives
may begin by saying something about
liberalism which is a very complicated
concept I think it's correct
surely that liberalism grew up in the
intellectual environment of the
empiricism and the rejection of
authority and Trust in the evidence of
the senses and so on however liberalism
has undergone a very complex evolution
it has a social philosophy over the
years if we go back to the classic
service what i regard
classics say for example Humboldt limits
of state action which inspired Mill and
is a true libertarian liberal classic
affect the world that Humboldt was
considering which was partially an
imaginary world but the world for which
he was developing this political
philosophy was a post futile but pre
capitalist world that it was a it was a
world in which there is no great
divergence among the individuals in the
kind of power that they have and what
they command let's say but there was a
tremendous disparity between individuals
on one hand in the state on the other
consequently it was the task of a
liberalism that was concerned with human
rights and equality of individuals and
so on it was the task of that liberalism
to dissolve the enormous power of the
state which was such a an authoritarian
threat to individual liberties and from
that you develop a classical liberal
theory and say Humboldt Urmila sense
well of course that is pre-capitalist he
couldn't conceive of an era in which a
corporation would be regarded as an
individual that's it
or in which such an enormous in which
enormous disparities and control over
resources and production would
distinguish between individuals in a
massive fashion now in that kind of
society to take the Humboldt in view is
a very superficial liberalism because
while opposition to state power in an
era of such divergence conforms to
Humboldt conclusions it doesn't do so
for his reasons that is his reasons we
the very different conclusions in that
case namely I think his reasons lead to
the conclusion that we must dissolve the
authoritarian control over production
and resources which leads to such
divergences among individuals in fact I
think one might draw a direct line
between classical liberalism and the
kind of libertarian socialism which I
think can be regarded as the as a kind
of an adapting of the basic reasoning of
classical liberalism to a very different
social Europe now if we come to the
modern period here at liberalism has
taken on a very strange sense if you
think of its history now now liberalism
is essentially the theory of state
capitalism of state intervention
in a capitalist economy well that is
very little relation to classical
liberalism in fact classical liberalism
is what's now called conservatism I
suppose but this new view I think really
is it a my my my view at least the
highly authoritarian position that is
it's one which accepts a number of
centers of authority and control the
state on the one hand agglomerations of
private power on the other hand all
interacting with individuals as
malleable cogs in this highly
constrained machine which may be called
democratic but given the the the actual
distribution of power is very far from
being meaningfully democratic and cannot
be so so my own feeling has always been
that to achieve the classical liberal
ideals for the reasons that led to them
being put forth in a society so
different we must be led in a very
different direction it's superficial and
erroneous to accept the conclusions
which were reached for a different
society and not to consider the
reasoning that led to those conclusions
the reasoning I think is very
substantially I'm a classical liberal in
the sense but I think it leads me to be
a kind of an anarchist anarchism is a
point of view which at first once covers
a lot of things
political rhetoric is not the clearest
it's not a model of clarity an anarchism
has covered quite a lot of ground but
the mainstream of it has just been the
basic principle which I think comes
straight out of classical liberalism and
the Enlightenment that any form of
authority and domination hasn't as a
burden of proof to bear it has to
demonstrate that it's legitimate no
matter what it is whether it's inside a
family or global economy if it's if it
is a form of authority and domination
and coercion that's to show that it's
legitimate it can demonstrate its that's
a heavy burden to bear if it shows that
it's legitimate okay if not it ought to
be dismantled that's anarchy
that's the that's the task of those who
have the authority to demonstrate that
suppose I'm taking a walk with my
granddaughter and she runs runs out into
the street okay and I grab her and pull
her back
well that's authority and it's my task
to demonstrate that it's legitimate and
I think in this case if anybody
challenged me I could make an argument
thing that's legitimate Authority but
the burden of proof is always on those
who exercise you that's true if it's men
and women parents and children owners
and people they ran the state and people
who serve it the IMF and people who
follow its orders wherever it is so
there's no general definition of what
legitimate Authority is it's the task of
those who exercise authority to
demonstrate their legitimacy they're the
ones have the burden of proof and if
they can't meet that burden by
explaining why what they do is
legitimate then they have no right to
exercise the authority and whatever
institution any institution within which
they exercise it is illegitimate unless
they show otherwise and the anarchists
are just people who believe that and try
to do something about it
well I don't I don't mean that every
minute of the day everybody has to be
saying look this is my legitimate
Authority but they have to be prepared
to make the challenge so if it's like a
Dem expose it's a formally democratic
state well in principle that challenge
is met by interchange among the
population which recognizes the
authority of the of actions in the
public arena through constant
interaction debate struggle and so on in
theory that's what happens if it is a
democratic state to the extent that that
doesn't happen it's not a democratic
state and it is a legitimate when you
move to other systems of authority like
say private corporations or fascist
states or other forms of totalitarianism
there's no question of legitimacy
because they have none no it's not their
responsibility it's their responsibility
to meet the challenge it's the
responsibility of people to make the
challenge so it's the responsibility of
say women to challenge a framework in
which they are supposed to wash the
dishes and put the children to sleep and
that sort of thing and it's the
responsibility of men and a patriot
traditional patriarchy family to answer
that challenge I mean it would be nice
if you could if the challenge could be
raised by those in positions of
authority that's pretty rare I mean
usually when you're in a position of
authority you kind of internalize the
values that say it's right and just and
the reason is because I think because
most people are sort of decent human
beings and it's very hard to tell yours
to look in the mirror and say I'm a
bastard so usually what you do is look
in the mirror and say I'm a nice guy and
I do these things because it's right and
just
and that's pretty standard you know I
mean everybody knows that from their own
experience we don't have to go into it
that's what people are like and
therefore the responsibility of raising
the challenge is typically in the hands
of those who recognize that they have a
subordinate status it's very hard to
recognize that people live you know
first
millennia you know without recognizing
that they are being subordinated in the
systems of power I'm gonna true of the
women for example it's it's in - per
slave you know I mean most slave
societies we're accepted by the slaves
as legitimate and in fact necessary and
a large part and and the same is true of
for example people have jobs today in
our society
almost without exception they consider
it legitimate for them to be in a
position where they have to rent
themselves in order to survive it's not
certainly not obvious you know and in
fact if you go back a century ago it was
not any considered not obvious it was
considered outlandish but we're marrying
working people and I'm not talking about
Marxist or socialist or anybody like
that
that's a mill hands and Lowell
Massachusetts who never heard of
socialism who regarded it as a form of
slavery and we're complaining that they
had not fought the civil war to replace
chattel slavery by wage slavery and that
therefore those who work in the mills
are owned because that's the Republican
rights that we want in the American
Revolution and so on and so forth so you
know it's not obvious but by now I think
enough indoctrination and propaganda and
so on has taken place so people do
regard that form of subordination
through external Authority as legitimate
whether they should is another question
but the fact is they do just as for most
of history women have accepted a
subordinate role as correct and proper
and so on and slaves did and people
living in a feudal societies and a
feudal society people had a place you
know
some kind of rule and quite typically
the societies were stable because people
regarded those structures as legitimate
the same is true of religious structures
and I mean throughout human life there's
a whole variety of systems of authority
and oppression and domination and so on
which are usually accepted as legitimate
by the people subordinated to when they
don't you have struggles and revolutions
and sometimes changes some nice
brutality and so on that's as far as I
understand that anarchists are just
people to take this seriously
here the term libertarian means the
opposite of what it always meant in
history libertarian throughout modern
European history meant socialist
anarchist they're not the antes under
the socialist movement the workers
movement in the Socialist Movement I
sort of broke into two branches roughly
one statist one a D status the statist
branch led to Bolshevism and Lenin and
Trotsky and so on the a D status branch
which included Marxists left Marxists
was looking for others to kind of merge
more or less into an amalgam with a big
strain of anarchism into what was called
libertarian socialism so an a
libertarian and Europe always meant
socialist here it means ultra you know
anger and or Cato Institute or something
like that but that's a special US usage
having to do with the or a lot of things
quite special about the way the United
States developed them this is part of it
there it meant and always meant to me a
socialist and socialist anti-state the
anti state branch of social socialism
which meant a highly organized society
completely organized a night with KF but
based on a democracy all the way through
that means democratic control of
communities of what
places of federal structures built on
systems of voluntary association and
spreading the internationally though
that's traditional anarchism at least
you know anybody can have the word if
they like but it's a mainstream really
the mainstream of traditional anarchism
and it has roots coming back to the
United States it has very strong roots
in the American working class movement
so if you go back to say the 1850s the
beginnings of the Industrial Revolution
I was right around the area where I live
eastern Massachusetts textile plants and
so on I have the people working in those
plants were in part the young women
coming off the farms they were called
factory girls so the women from the
farms and work in the textile plant but
some of them were Irish immigrants
embossed and that group of people they
had had an extremely rich and
interesting culture we're kind of like
my uncle never went past forty great
very educated reading modern literature
they didn't bother with european
radicalism that had no effect on them
but the general literary culture they
were very much played out and they
developed their own conceptions of how
the world ought to be organized labor in
newspapers in fact the period of the
freest press in the United States was
probably around the 1850s in the 1850s
the scale of the popular press meaning
run by factory girls in Lowell and so on
was scale of the commercial press or
even greater these were independent
newspapers a lot of interesting
scholarship on them he could read them
though they were called not note that
just spontaneously without any
background of narrative marks or
or anyone else they develop the same
ideas they thought that they're they
from their point of view were what they
called wage slavery renting yourself to
an owner was not very different from
chattel slavery you know what they were
fighting to the war about and you have
to recall that by the in the mid 19th
century that was a common view in the
United States for example the position
of the Republican Party was Abraham
Lincoln's position was not an odd view
that there isn't much a difference
because it's selling yourself and
renting yourself that's how the idea of
renting yourself meaning working for
wages was degrading you couldn't it was
just an attack on your personal
integrity the and they despised the
industrial system that was developing
that was destroying their culture
destroying their independence their
individuality constraining them to be
subordinate to masters losing there was
a tradition of those called
republicanism in the United States we're
free people first free people in the
world this was destroying and
undermining that freedom and this was
the core of the labor movement all over
and included in it was the assumption
just taken for granted that those
quoting those who work in the mills
should run in fact one of their main
slogans of this court it was they
condemned what they called the new
spirit of the age a gain wealth for
getting all but self that idea that you
should the new spirit they don't even
interested in gaining wealth and
forgetting about your relations other
people they regard it as just a
violation of fundamental human nature
and a degrading idea like take for
example one of the most successful
industrial commercial installations and
for in Spain quite big in fact Mondragon
it's a big collection of industrial
works schools
you know social systems health systems
and so on very substantial very
successful it's one of the few parts of
the Spanish economy that's competitive
internationally even after joining
European Union it's worker owned and
it's partially socialist anarchist its
worker owned but manager controlled
workers pick the managers but they
theoretically at least control the
managers how much they control them you
can debate and it but in but there's no
outside investors telling what to do
that their own banks their own
Development Bank's they have their own
social services and so on and it's been
dramatically successful well okay that's
pieces of a more free and democratic
society pieces only because workers are
not really participating directly it's
they're still picking somebody to tell
them what to do at least they're picking
them and they have the authority
ultimately which in principle they could
use well okay that's a piece of
democratic to say and you find pieces of
democratic societies all over the place
very often in periods of revolution very
democratic societies emerge fast and
spontaneously and similarly like workers
council to control industries they come
up all the time I mean they come up
after the Bolshevik Revolution they were
immediately crushed by the reacted
before the Bolshevik Revolution they
developed and they were immediately
crushed by Lenin and Trotsky and Italy
at the same time they developed after
the Hungarian Revolution they developed
in Spain they don't even thought that
flourish in fact these things have
happened over and over again
spontaneously the reason is this
unnatural you don't have to read big
books to think that the workers in the
plant or to get together and run it
thank you back to 19th century America
you know the mill towns around here
the workers were saying
factory girls as they call them young
women from the farms or you know local
craftsmen the mills ought to be run by
the workers who are owned and run by the
workers in them that's just natural
that's like saying that people should
vote their own representatives in
Congress well ok those natural ideas are
crushed but there's no reason why they
can't be realized and implement ok I
mean the principle as far as I can see
goes right back to the Enlightenment you
know like if you go back to classical
and lighten my thought I'm not talking
about Adam Smith's and you know
Jefferson and those guys the sort of
core idea is people have a right to
control their own work you know ok that
the that if a person here I'll quote
some standard formula back in an 18th
century you know leading heroes of the
Enlightenment is if a person works on it
if a person does beautiful work under
external command meaning for wages we
may admire what he does but we despise
what he is because not for human being
ok that goes all the way through
classical liberal thought and lighten
man thought I mean you know Alexis de
Tocqueville says under wage labor the
art advances the art ISM declines now
you find this going right into the
working class movements and Lowell and
Lawrence I think that's just natural I
wouldn't try to convince anybody oh but
it seems to me if you think about it
yeah why should you work on command I
mean if you work on command you're some
kind of slave now why not work because
it's coming out of your needs and
interests I mean like cheap for me to
say I'm gonna fence the University and
our science department and I can do that
one of the nice things about being in
the Sun in science is a defense of
fencing universities you really do have
workers control I'm to a very large
extent we control what we do you know
want to work on this topic I work on
that topic I mean you gotta sell it to
funders and this and that but the degree
of workers control at the elite level is
quite substantial
I mean that's why it's such a privilege
to be in a science department
you know enormous ly privileged
existence forget the money if they pay
you one-tenth the amount of money it
would still be a much better existence
than working on command now I think
people do know that you know I don't
think that these Enlightenment ideas are
hard to grasp I think people know that
if you work on under external control
you may despise admire what the person
does but despise what he is because his
labor you know the sort of central part
of your life is being done at somebody
else's orders and you are not
controlling the way it's done or why
it's done or how it's used or anything
else well you can't have every
individual controlling every single
thing but that's why you have a
democratic structures best people
control things together you know okay I
I I don't know how to I wouldn't try to
convince anybody of this I because I
frankly just don't believe that everyone
doesn't know it I think maybe I'm
sentimental but it seems to me if he's
sort of cut away waves of you know
layers of distortion and delusion these
things that we're considered pretty
obvious 200 years ago still
people are interested in linguistics for
all sorts of reasons but my own interest
for since the beginning for 50 years has
been as a way of exploring some aspects
of human higher mental faculties and
ultimately of human nature which should
show up in every domain not just in I
mean language happens to be one of the
few areas where you can study very core
human capacities unique gun core human
capacities in a very intense way and
achieve some results that go beyond
superficial understanding in most areas
it's very hard to do it but this is one
area in which you can't and at the core
of this capacity for language it's been
recognized for centuries is a kind of
was sometimes called a creative aspect
the free ability to do it you and I are
doing to express their thoughts without
limit within constraints but without
limit in novel ways and so on that's
somehow a fundamental part of human
nature the core of Cartesian philosophy
was disability for example well similar
questions arise in every aspect of human
capacity and again it's traditional so
David Hume 250 years ago pointed out
that the foundation of morals must be
what we nowadays call generative grammar
he didn't call it that but it must be
some set of principles that we're
capable of applying in novel situations
again without limit and he pointed out
these principles have to be part of our
nature because there's no way to acquire
them from experience in theory you can
learn something about these aspects of
human nature and that moving over to the
domain of human affairs including
politics but personal life or anything
else anyone who make takes any stand on
anything I say if you're in favor of
keeping things the way they are or some
minor reform or revolution or whatever
it may be I mean if you're serious about
it if you're acting as a kind of a moral
agent you think what you do should meet
certain minimal moral standards you're
taking that position because you think
it's it's good for people it's gonna
somehow conform it's going to bring out
and amplify and offer possibilities for
their fundamental nature to express it
so well at that point there's a
theoretical connection but it's pretty
abstract because when you deal with
anything as complex as human beings
you're always on the surface the fact we
can't answer questions like this about
in six a long time if ever before one
can have a anything like scientific
understanding of any questions like
these my own studies in language and
human cognition demonstrate to me at
least what remarkable creativity
ordinary people have the very fact that
people talk to one another is a
reflection just in the normal way I
don't mean anything particularly fancy
reflects deep-seated features of human
creativity which in fact separate human
beings from any other biological system
we know if in fact our minds were a
blank slate on the experience wrote on
them we would be very impoverished
creatures indeed so the obvious
hypothesis is that our language is the
result of the unfolding of a genetically
determined program
well plainly there are different
languages in fact the apparent variation
of languages is quite superficial it's
circum as certain of anything it is that
humans are not genetically programmed to
learn one or another language so you
bring up a Japanese baby and Boston
they'll all speak Boston English it when
you bring up my child in Japan it'll
speak Japanese and that means that the
base that from that it fought from from
that it simply follows by logic that the
basic structure of the languages must be
essentially the same our task as
scientists is to try to determine
exactly what those fundamental
principles are that cause the knowledge
to unfold in the manner in which it does
under particular circumstances and
incidentally I think there's no doubt
the same must be true other aspects of
human intelligence and systems of
understanding and interpretation and
moral and aesthetic judgment and so on
one consequence of your theories is that
we are as human beings very very rigidly
pre-programmed there are certain things
we can understand certain things we can
communicate and anything that falls
outside that we simply can't is that so
that's certainly correct so I mean in a
way this is a rather alarming doctrine I
mean it it certainly contravenes the way
we want to feel about ourselves that may
be an immediate reaction but I think
it's it's not the correct reaction in
fact well it's true that our genetic
program rigidly constrains us I think
the more important point is that the
existence of that rich of that rigid
constraint is what provides the basis
for our freedom and creativity and the
reason I mean it's only because we have
pre-programmed but we can do all things
and exactly the point is that if we
really were plastic organisms without an
extensive pre-programming then the state
that our mind achieves would in fact be
a reflection of the environment which
means it would be extraordinarily
impoverished fortunately for us we are
rigidly pre-programmed with extremely
rich systems that are part of our
biological endowment correspondingly a
small amount of relative rather
degenerate experience allows a kind of a
great leap into a rich cognitive system
essentially uniform in a community and
in fact for roughly uniform ilysm which
would have developed over campus
evolutionary ages through the basic
system itself developed over long
periods of evolutionary development we
don't know how really but for the
individual its present as a result the
individual is capable of with a very
small amount of evidence of constructing
an extremely rich system which allows
him
to act in the free and creative fashion
which in fact is normal for humans we
can say anything that we want over an
infinite range other people will
understand us that I've heard nothing
like that before we're able to do that
precisely because of that rigid
programming but short of that we would
not be able to at all what account are
you able to give of creativity if we are
pre-programmed in the way you see then
how is creativity and possibility for us
well here I think one has to be fairly
careful I think we can say a good deal
about about the nature of the system
that is acquired the state of knowledge
that is attained we can say a fair
amount about the biological that the
basis the the basis in the initial state
of the mind for the acquisition of the
system but when we turn to a third
question namely how is this system used
how are we able to act creatively how
can how do we decide - how can we decide
to say things that are new but not
random that are appropriate to occasions
but not under the control of stimuli
when we ask these questions we really
enter into a realm of mystery where
human science at least so far and maybe
in principle does not reach we can say a
fair amount about the principles that
make it possible for us to behave in our
normal creative fashion but as soon as
questions of will or decision or reason
or a choice of action when those
questions arise human science is at a
loss it has nothing to say about them as
far as I can see these questions remain
in the obscurity that in which they were
in classical antiquity would you also
accept this or not but that having
arrived at our present situation across
millions of years of evolution we must
have been going through a continual
process of innovation and new adaption
and development of new abilities
dispositions organs etc might we not
still be as it were plastic at the edges
might least not still be developing and
evolving genuinely evolving if only on
the margin
well I think one has to be again very
cautious here because well it's true at
a very independent very vague sense to
say it's correct to say that the systems
that we now have have developed through
evolution and through natural selection
it's important to recognize how little
we are saying when we say that for
example it is certainly not necessarily
the case but every particular trait that
we have is the result of specific
selection that is that we were selected
for having that in fact there are
striking examples for the contrary which
the parent examples to the contrary say
take for example our capacity to deal
with abstract properties of the number
system and that's a distinctive human
capacity as distinctive as the capacity
for language any normal human fact found
of pathological levels can comprehend
the properties of the number system and
can move very far and understanding
their deep properties but it's extremely
difficult to believe that this capacity
was the result of specific selection
that is it's hard to believe that people
who were a little better at proving
theorems of number theory had more
children would say that didn't happen in
fact through most of human evolution in
fact essentially all of human evolution
this capacity wasn't it would have been
impossible to know that this capacity
even existed lis contingencies that
allowed of the exercise never arose
nevertheless the trait is there the
capacity is there the mental organ if
you like has developed presumably it has
developed as a concomitant of some other
properties of the brain which may have
been selected for example we can
speculate say that you know the the
increase in brain size was a factor in
differential reproduction it's an
evolution and it may be that for
physical law because of physical laws
that we presently don't know that an
increase in brain size under the
specific conditions of human evolution
simply leads necessarily through a
system which has the capacity to deal
with properties the number system well
then as a matter of physics ultimately
and then the mind that evolves the brain
that evolves will have this capacity but
not because it was achieved for
selection not I think it's at least
likely that something of the sort is
true
language I mean surely if it were
dysfunctional it wouldn't have been
maintained it's obviously functional but
it's a long leap to claim that that the
specific structures of language are
themselves the result of specific
selection and it's elite that I don't
think is particularly possible the
language and communication are about the
same thing but if you think about it
it's extremely implausible for one thing
you know almost any behavior you carry
out communicate something a gesture the
hairstyle you know almost anything so
sure language behavior also communicates
even the first of all beyond that almost
all language is not involved in
communication and we all know that I
mean you can't go one minute without
talking to yourself I mean it's it's it
takes a tremendous effort of will not to
be doing whatever you're doing when
what's going on in your head well that's
plainly not communication you're doing
it yourself
that's about 99.9% of the use of
language now in fact when you really
think that's never been investigated but
if you introspect about it as it could
be investigated seriously you know from
kind of third person point of view but
it hasn't been so you can only sort of
think about it yourself but I can I tell
you my introspections you can figure out
yours but my introspections are that
when I am thinking in language it's not
really language there's just like an
occasional wordles little long and I
know what I want to say and then I can
express it somehow something sometimes
either internally or externally but if
it's the same for you then that suggests
that there's some kind of language use
going on in there that isn't even using
the articulated language system and it's
just kind of hovering in there somewhere
occasionally bits and pieces come out
and
if you try you can say them to yourself
or say him outside and you know when you
get it right that which means that you
must have meant something and the
articulation that you produce can match
what you meant but what you meant is in
some internal language and furthermore
even if you take a if you look at the
part of language very small part that's
external you know like what we're doing
a very small part of that is
communication in a serious sense I'm a
lot of us just setting up social
relations telling jokes to your friends
you know passing time and it's not
communication in a meaningful sense of
the word communication so I think it's
just a big mistake to identify
communication with language language
hasn't evolved at all for fifty thousand
years since humans left Africa a small
group left Africa spread over the world
and we're all basically identical if you
take an infant from an Amazonian tribe
that hasn't had human other human
contact for twenty thousand years and
bring it up in Baltimore it'll speak
straight Baltimore English end up here
studying physics no and conversely so it
doesn't seem to me there are individual
differences among humans we don't see
many significant - almost detectable
group differences so nothing's happened
for about fifty thousand years if you go
back about fifty thousand years before
that there isn't really any evidence
that there was language I mean in that
you know of course we're beyond as I
said you know you don't have you know if
comparative evidence you don't have
fossil evidence but you do have
artifacts and in fact there was a big
kind of creative explosion that took
place somewhere in that window and say
maybe seventy five thousand years ago a
sudden explosion of
symbolic representation complex social
structures observations parent
observations of astronomical events all
kinds of things just suddenly happened
in general it's usually assumed you know
we don't directive it is that this must
have been connected with the sudden
emergence of language and notice that
it's very sudden in evolutionary times
now you can double or triple the numbers
it's still a flick of an eyelash in
evolutionary time so somewhere in a very
small window something happened and
nothing happened afterwards that part
were pretty pretty sure of well what
would have happened
whatever happened unless there's some
mechanism that biology hasn't discovered
yet whatever happened would be some
rewiring of the brain some mutation that
caused a rewiring of the brain and that
rewiring of the brain would have given
this mechanism this computational
mechanism that allows these things to
happen but a rewiring of the brain a
mutation takes place in an individual
not in a group ok that's obvious so this
happened to somebody you know some
person and some small hunter-gatherer
group underwent this change that person
had the capacity to do what we all do
internally but without the
externalization because there was nobody
to talk to there's no reason to think it
was externalized at all just that
whatever is going on in our heads that
is pre-linguistic that we get bits and
pieces of it when we think about that
would have been available for one person
well you know if there's any selective
advantage to that say ability to plan
and so on it could have been it could
proliferate in a small group there over
generations it could be enough people
who have had that so it would make some
sense to interact with in
at that point you get you would get
externalization but externalize ation is
a very tough process there's this
internal thing in the head which
developed without any external pressures
okay because there were no selectional
pressures on it almost by definition so
it's kind of like a snowflake you know
something that just develops because
that's the way nature works you have
this thing in the head you have a
sensory motor system which has been
around for hundreds of thousands of
years and there's nothing to do with it
you have to match them up that's a
complicated process in fact that's where
practically as far as we know that's
where all the compromise all the
complexity of languages when you learn a
language that's what you learn a child
is acquiring a language that's what they
acquire nobody teaches you you don't
learn the kinds of things I've mentioned
at the beginning which are probably just
part of the way the snowflake works so
which and then of course once you have
the externalization you could have some
kind of communication depending what you
mean by religion I mean if you believe
if you mean the Abrahamic religions
we're a week round here because of
course I'm religiously illiterate but
they Judaism Christianity I guess yeah
and and the other religions
what are those Buddhism is different
spiritual beliefs and Native Americans
was different we're talking about the
Abrahamic quite different that Buddhism
is quite different I mean if you really
look at these systems of belief they
differ a lot believe that there's
something in the world which is beyond
my grasp which is determining the way
things happen and it's going to you know
it'll be a consolation for me
maybe you know if my child is dying I'll
see him again in heaven somewhere I mean
these kinds of beliefs and that there's
a sort of a spiritual force somewhere
beyond my grasp
and that explains why things are
happening that's probably a bit Buddhist
that's perfectly understandable yeah I
mean you know the weird things are
happening like the Sun is going around
the earth you can see it I'm done have
that happening but you see it well
something must be making it happen okay
so it's Apollo on his chariot pulling
the Sun and the same with everything
else goes on you don't understand
anything that's happening in the world
in personal life and you know why are
why is my child
sweet little wonderful kid dying he
didn't do anything
so there's got to be some explanation
somewhere so it's a stead of stories to
make sense of reality except not science
I mean Apollo pulling the Sun with a
chair it's early science it's a kind of
a scientific theory you know it worked
out you know we're not truly old like
you know for example the classical Greek
so you discover a lot of things if you
say it now when there's lots of evidence
other than that and it's no longer
science you know that just means that
our understanding is deepened right but
you know the transition from magic to
science is a pretty smooth transition
and it just I mean even the work the
word science in English didn't even
appear until the mid 19th 19th century I
mean there was a word but it meant
something else just meant knowledge in
the 19th mid 19th century there was a
divorce between science and philosophy
before it was just philosophy in fact if
you study if you go to Oxford let's say
you can study natural philosophy and
moral philosophy
natural philosophy is what we here call
the natural sciences moral philosophy is
what we call the humanities but through
it in German it's the same thing so the
whole concept of science in our sense is
a pretty recently and it's it began and
there was a intellectual revolution you
know so it begins with Galileo
goes on and led to enormous insights and
after a while science just kind of took
off and he gave a special domain we've
been in the early 19th century it was
that takes I can't
he couldn't have told you whether there
was a philosopher or scientist he taught
astronomy I mean he thought the moral
philosophy yeah
an intelligent educated gentleman did
all those things well by the mid 19th
century becoming very hard to do all
those things the sciences were reaching
a point where you really understand
things and you couldn't be a gentleman
who knows everything so okay things got
professionalized and we get you know
what we call science separate domain but
recall how recent this is a prior to
that people were trying to figure things
out and we we might now call what
they're trying to figure out the magic
but these are pretty smart people what
they say Isaac Newton you're not a fool
exactly
I mean he's now kind of people laugh
about the fact that he would spend most
of his life working on chemistry and
church fathers that was alchemy in
church fathers I was perfectly
reasonable I mean in terms of the
vertical corpuscular Aryan theories that
everybody accepted you know the world
was made up with little building blocks
like bricks as if nephew yeah shift a
few and you get gold from lead that
makes perfect sense that's where the
church fathers that made perfect sense
to I mean he was coming right after the
humanist period when they were having a
sudden discovery of the wealth and
richness of classical civilizations
which hadn't been known so the belief
expanded that these guys really
understood something and they were kind
of keeping it secret for us so they were
doing it in esoteric way and if we in
decode what they were doing we'll get
all kind of wonderful discoveries wasn't
an irrational pursuit would you or do
you consider yourself a person of faith
I try not to have faith I believe in a
principle that was enunciated rather
well by Bertrand Russell which is
you should try to keep away from having
irrational beliefs you should believe
some things that for which you can find
some evidence or some support
apart from commitment to principles like
equality and freedom and justice and so
on those I wouldn't say that's faith
those are things you're committed to but
as far as beliefs about the world
reality my feeling is one should try to
as much as possible have substantiated
beliefs or at least beliefs for which
evidence could be appropriate well then
would you consider yourself
paradoxically a person who has faith in
the scientific method I think it's the
only method we have to try to get some
approximate understanding of the world I
don't have faith that it'll reach the
truth or even that it's leading us in a
truer direction
in fact as someone committed to the
scientific method I'm also committed to
its consequences and among them are that
you and I and the rest of these species
or organic creatures who have our
specific
capacities and limitations and we simply
don't know and have no reason to believe
that these capacities are such that we
can gain the truth about the world we do
our best but that's the most we can do
but if people would say that you cannot
have moral principles unless you adhere
to a faith if I attribute those
principles to a divine creature who I
define as ordering me to have those
principles the principles don't become
any more better established so that's a
useless tip it's true that our moral
principles are not firmly grounded in
unshakeable evidence and argument but
nothing is going to make them any more
firmly grounded as for having a
meaningful life that seems to me
irrelevant
no people who have meaningful I was with
faith and without faith do you think
holding a supernatural worldview is
healthy and beneficial for Humanity it's
not for me I don't see any point to it
at all
on the other hand I know that it means
religious beliefs of other forms of
supernatural and have to mean a lot to a
lot of people if I find someone who's
say mourning the loss of a dead child
and is comforted by the idea that
they'll be reunited with a child in
heaven it's not my business to take to
try to convince them that their belief
is incorrect in fact in a way I think
they're lucky to be able to have such a
belief I don't have it I don't think in
the long run it's healthy but you can't
legislate to other people of what they
should believe in order to say comfort
themselves what in general do you feel
then about religions role in human
society both historically and here in
the 21st century overall I think it's in
terms of its effect on policy ranging
from social policy to war I think it's
been mostly negative I think often
extremely negative with regard to
individuals it varies for a lot of
people it just means a lot and always
what do you think behaviorally speaking
humans primarily are that is do you
think we have a sort of Hobbesian human
nature or a plastic human nature or
something else because this seems to
when you hear either conservatives or
liberals or people on the far right or
far left discuss what kind of policies
and what kind of economics and what we
should have you know how we should deal
with the rest of the world it usually
always what often comes back Lisa to
justify their opinions it always comes
back to well this is what humans are and
this is therefore more natural for us to
do a you know have a capitalist society
or B have a social society what do you
think is the basic human nature that or
do you think that we have a basic human
nature I believe that we are part of the
natural world okay hmm therefore we have
a nature
it's our genetic endowment determines
substantially what our nature is
in fact if you look at the growth of any
organism us bees you know yeast would
have a like there are actually three
factors that enter into its growth of
development one is its genetic
Constitution another is environmental
effects and a third is just the way laws
of nature work which isn't turns out as
a major effect and the inquiry into
biological organisms takes all of those
into account or should as for our human
nature the genetic endowment that we
essentially share the very little is
known about it it's just a really hard
question and as I mentioned in our
earlier discussion a lot of the ways of
studying it are excluded simply because
we don't allow invasive experimentation
hmm the and it you know it's hard enough
to learn about insect nature where we
allow ourselves anything they're much
simpler organisms so what do we know
about human nature we'll most of our
knowledge comes from history experience
literary exploration and so on that's
what our knowledge comes from what does
it tell us it tells us that of course
humans are partially plastic like I
don't speak Swahili for example so were
partially plastic on the other hand
there's there has to be an enormous
uniformity at a level right below the
surface and what we see on the surface
is a wide range of possibilities I mean
we see people who are acting in a
beastly fashion we see others who are
kind of sacrificing their lives to save
dolphins one of the the sciences and I'm
not sure it would be categorized the
hard science or soft science or it's an
emerging science evolutionary psychology
people like yo Wilson and Steven Pinker
have come around and and said they
understand what human nature is and it's
based on this new science are you saying
then that they're either still just
guessing or do they have some some
scientific backing that from what you
have if you have read any of their work
yes another word
I met a lot of them it was now called
evolutionary psychology was in fact
initiated about a century ago over a
century ago by Peter Kropotkin the an
ERISA thinker and naturalist wrote a
book called the mutual aid a factor in
evolution mmm-hmm
and in it he investigated he was
basically trying to counter social
Darwinist he was Darwin a Darwinist
himself and he argued by looking at a
lot of naturalistic phenomena other
animals human history and so on he
argued that if you look at it you
discover that mutual aid had a provided
the selectional advantage and therefore
organisms were had evolved through
selection including humans to be deeply
committed to one or another form of
mutual aid well you know that's not what
elite opinion wants to hear mm-hmm they
want to hear some other story so
therefore core potkins form of
evolutionary psychology actually
disappeared been revived to some extent
the actual modern the modern state of
evolutionary psychology as I mean it's
not that there's no science there at all
there's some you know like sake in
selection is real reciprocal altruism is
real a couple other things are real but
very little is known its and this is not
physics in a certain it's not molecular
biology it's not chemistry it's largely
gases not it's a worthwhile topic to
pursue thank you my topic to pursue in
fact that's where my own professional
work is in particular areas but we
should be scientists particularly should
be very cautious about inducing the in
diluting the public to think that they
know more than they do
mmm-hmm science has held an enormous
respect for good reasons and therefore
scientists have a responsibility to make
very clear here's what we know only
here's what we don't know and what we
know in these areas happens to be
extremely thin not because they're not
good scientists because the questions
are too hard there was a concept of
materialism
right through the early Scientific
Revolution right through Newton Newton
still accepted it in fact the great
scientists of the next century except
that it you know lagron and others kept
trying to develop a material mechanistic
concept of the universe that went right
through the 19th century ether theories
and so on it was finally given up in the
20th century you know finally recognized
we're never gonna get it and totally
different ways of looking at things were
developed which have no relation to
traditional materialism if readers
longest correct
so since and nobody's ever suggested
another notion it materialism just is
like anything we more or less understand
it includes thinking it includes
reasoning and so on and so forth Locke
suggestion so we can't leave it behind
unless someone tells it what it is but
there's no reason why we kind of we
can't study it and we can study what the
human capacity of understanding is in
fact we know some things about it we
know some negative things for example we
can't understand the way the world works
because our concept of understanding is
too limited to incorporate that what
Newton described as an absurdity you
know people like Newton and human Locke
were not idiots
we have to take them seriously for very
good reasons and modern cognitive
science which somehow tries to
recapitulate some of this finds pretty
much that so as I mentioned an infant
presented with presentations which
indicate that there's some kind of
causality like you know when the ball
rolls this way light turns red or
something they will invent a mechanical
cause and they don't care if it's not
visible because infants understand that
most of what goes on is invisible you
know but there's got to be some
mechanical cause otherwise the way for
it to influence anything else so that
does seem to be the way our minds work
and that tells us something about the
limits of our understanding in fact a
classical social case
and it can go on to other cases so and
we can't study it directly in principle
we can study it directly it's not simple
I mean it's not easy to understand why a
rat can't understand can't deal with a
prime number maze even that's hard and
we have good evidence that's true but
why it's true is unclear nothing known
about the brains of rats that explains
why they can't do that in fact we can't
explain why say the tiniest organism
that seriously studied C elegans
nematodes that eight hundred cells three
hundred neurons entire wiring diagram
known have any years of study trying to
explain why this thing it goes left
instead of right let's say it's just we
don't know how to explain that it's it
was an answer but these are hard
scientific questions when you talk about
how human intelligence works it's
incomparably more difficult second you
can ask the questions you can you know
cut away at them but we shouldn't we
shouldn't exaggerate it's kind of
striking that going back to what
philosophy ordered the world
philosophers often appear to intend to
want to get answers about humans that we
can't get about insects and that's too
much you know science sort of works at
the edges of understanding and it faces
hard questions all the way so we can
sort of talk about it but if you want to
seriously work on it you have to take a
look at what he's understood and try see
if you can formulate questions which
will which are can be investigated and
will tell us more about what's
understood actually it's interesting
work going on on this having to do with
things like that mark the human moral
instinct in the past twenty thirty years
that's become an experimental subject
with the interesting experimental work
on universal probably universal moral
principles a very important book just
came out a couple of weeks ago by John
McKay oh he's a
philosophers now teaches law at
Georgetown University yeah who gives a
very acute he more or less initiated
this modern study didn't publish much
but other people have drawn off his work
combination of reanalysis of traditional
moral philosophy may lead roles and his
antecedents and an analysis a lot of the
critique of roles and and then on to
developing experimental programs to
investigate some of these questions and
it's feasible maybe we can get some
insight into in a human that moral if
concepts that are that are
cross-cultural like you're going to find
them in every culture and that you can
find with young children the free any
serious cultural impact those are all
things that can be studied and there's
beginnings of studies centrally your
whole approach represents a rejection of
the empirical tradition in philosophy it
doesn't it because I mean the very fact
that you think that the empiricists are
wrong about how we learn must mean that
they're wrong about knowledge and the
nature of knowledge and the nature of
knowledge has been the central problem
in the whole empirical tradition of
philosophy
well the classical empiricist tradition
which i think was that the traditions
represented let's say craft in its
highest worn by him seems to me to be a
up to that tradition of extreme
importance in that a particular theory
of the origins of knowledge of the
science of human nature in humans phrase
was put forth an empirical theory and I
think Hume for example would regard it
as an empirical theory did regard it so
when we investigated I think we discover
that it's just completely false that is
that the mechanisms that he discussed
are not the mechanisms by which the mind
reaches states of knowledge that the
states of knowledge attained are
radically different than the kinds that
he discussed for example for Hume the
mind was his image a kind of a theater
in which ideas paraded across the stage
and we think therefore followed
necessarily that we could introspect
completely into the contents of our mind
if an idea is not on the stage it's not
in the mind and the ideas may be
connected and associated in fact he went
on to say there isn't even any theater
there's just the ideas and that respect
the image is misleading well that's a
that's a theory and in fact it's a
theory that has had a an enormous
Grippit on the imagination throughout
most of my knowledge most of the history
of Western thought for example that that
same image dominates the rationalist
tradition as well where it was assumed
that one could exhaust the contents of
the mind by careful attention you know
you could really develop those clear and
distinct ideas and that consequences and
so on and in fact even if you move to
someone let's say but Freud with his a
vocation of the unconscious still I
think that a careful reading suggests
that he regarded the unconscious as in
principle act accessible that is we
could really perceive that theater and
the stage and the things on it carefully
if only the barriers of repression and
so on could be overcome well if what
I've been suggesting is correct that's
just that's radically wrong I mean even
wrong as a point of departure
there is no reason at all that I can see
for believing that the principles of
mental computation that enter so
intimately into our action or our
interaction or our speech to believe
that those principles have are at all
accessible introspection any more than
the analyzing mechanisms of our visual
system or for that matter the nature of
our liver is accessible to introspect it
seems to me that over and over again you
come back to the same point that is to
say that many of the particular problems
discussed and theories put forward by
philosophers in the main but also
psychologists you just mentioned Freud
and in your writings you mentioned many
other
our in fact theories about physical
princesses they are therefore open to
checking by investigation and when you
check my investigation you'll find out
that the theories are wrong and
therefore you are as it were radically
subversive of a lot of very
well-established theories in our
tradition it seems to me that once you
put forward in their place over and over
again in fact as paralleled the
rationalist tradition I said in my
introduction to this program that what
I'm always is the theories of Comte you
seem to me to be almost redoing in terms
of modern linguistics what Kant was
doing do you accept any well right not
only accepted truth in it but I've tried
to bring it out in a certain way however
I haven't myself specifically referred
to Kant but rather to the primarily to
the 17th century tradition of the
Continental Cartesians and the British
neoplatonist who developed many of the
ideas that are now much more familiar in
the writings of Conte for example the
idea of experience conforming to our
mode of cognition or the well
particularly in the British platon is
Edward for example there are I believe
is a rich line of insight into the
organizing principles of the mind by
which experience is structured in fact I
think that some of the richest
psychologically so source of
psychological insights they don't know
and that's the one it's this tradition
that I think that can be fleshed out and
made more explicit by the kinds of
empirical inquiry that are now possible
of course I think we also have to
diverge from that tradition and a number
of respects I've mentioned one namely
the belief with the contents of the mind
or open introspection
similarly we there's certainly no reason
to accept the metaphysics of that
tradition to believe that there's a
dualism of mind and body I mean you can
see why the Cartesians were led to that
it was a rational move on their part but
it's not a movie we have to follow we
take a look at some other organism I
mentioned a rat you can teach a rat
complicated mazes don't turn right and
then turn left and right and left a lot
of things that can do you cannot teach a
rat to run a prime number maze a maze in
which you supposed to turn right at
every prime number
you can teach a human that you know to
figure out the prime numbers in their
heads but then they can do it a rat
can't do it with an infinite amount of
training it simply does not have that
concept so it's a total mystery for rats
that's kind of analogous to the fact
that a human embryo can't grow wings
just beyond this capacity now there are
some that I think the scientifically and
philosophically interesting question is
what things are beyond human scope of
what things are mysteries to us in the
same way that a prime number mage is a
mystery to Brett and I think there's a
very interesting record of things in the
world the most simple and striking and
dramatic one is interaction of objects
so you go back to the medieval period
and they the Neo Scholastic period that
was assumed that there are what we're
called sympathies and antipathies so
sympathy is brought two objects together
and antipathies push them apart when you
get to Galileo and modern science begins
these notions were ridiculed
what's a sympathy antipathy it's called
not cult idea and Galileo introduced a
conception that guided and modern
science
it's the one I quoted every the world is
a machine it every everything that
happens can be duplicated by a skilled
artist in fact it was created by a
skilled artist you know
but and that that's what was called the
mechanical philosophy everything works
like a machine and that and the kane'
modern science developed on the
principle that unless you can show that
something works like a machine you
haven't explained it so Galileo at the
end of his life was kind of in despair
because he had not shown that the
movement of the tides let's say or the
heavenly bodies could be accounted for
by mechanical principles Descartes the
would later thought that he had shown
that you could do it
liveness his own version christiaan
huygens
another version but that was modern
science until Newton demonstrated there
are no machines nothing works by
mechanical principles he just concluded
that that is an absurdity that no person
with any scientific understanding could
possibly accept and he was right but
it's true that scientists just had to
kind of accept the fact that the world
is not intelligible to us that's a major
mystery and science changed totally at
that point it happened slowly you know
so it kind of became assimilated into
common sense but so there's no longer
tried to find and into a picture of the
world that's intelligible to our
intuitions what they try to do is
construct theories that are intelligible
but that's a totally different topic
much lower goal and that's not that's
post-newtonian science well that's one
huge mystery but I think there plenty of
others like Tex a freedom of will as big
debates about freedom of will it's kind
of striking that everyone who
participates in these debates including
the people who write learning tomes
showing there's no freedom of will
believe in freedom of will otherwise
they wouldn't write to learning poems
I'm gonna for all just thermostats of
some complicated time then what you do
is determined and how people react as
determined so it's the point of the
effort you know not so everyone kind of
intuitively believes it I mean we all
believe that I can either pick this
offer for it across the room or not
doing anything with it but what is it
well it lies beyond I think you can
speculate about what the core of the
problem is they take a look at human
science there are two concepts that are
very well understood but one of them is
determinacy something determined
something else you know the other one is
randomness things happen without
anything determining them and that's
about it I think those are the basic
concepts that we comprehend and it
freedom will just doesn't fit in that
set of concepts well it could be that
this is just another mystery for humans
we don't have the right concept if some
Martian might be looking at us and
thinking how stupid we are why do we
keep the determinacy in randomness when
there's obviously that thing out there
that I can't point to because I'm a
human could be and many other things
that seem impossible might turn out to
be like this I mean once we recognize
that we're not angels we are just
biological organisms and as such we must
have limits it's just point of logic you
could not have any capacities at all if
you didn't have limits because the
capacities determine the limits and then
the question comes well what's beyond
the limits and we have some examples
plausible examples there may be many
others and I think that's a fertile
direction to explore that once we
abandon the kind of belief that we can
do anything which is a very common
belief in the modern sciences it's very
common do you believe that the mind is
in principle computable implying that it
could be emulated on other substrates in
the future another substrates like
silicon I think he's talking about the
mind is organized matter it's organized
in a particular way which we don't
understand but we don't understand much
about and there's no reason we don't
know of any physical reason to believe
that the particular component of that
organized matter are critical for its
operation it appears to be something
about the way it's organized yeah that's
a fitness I mean it's it it we are a
computing machine of some sort and it
happens to be it has happen to use a
certain system for storing and and and
reproducing whether its genetic or or
electrical it's hard to imagine any
other system wouldn't that if we were
able to reproduce all that information
we wouldn't get the same the same person
but it's one of those cases as you said
before where you really have to be
humble so little as understood about it
and the major question what's what is
the puppeteer doing yeah that one we
don't even know how to address this this
emerging notion that many of our
conscious decisions are really not
conscious maybe you want to elaborate on
that
well there's increasing experiment
there's some experimental evidence by
now that when you undertake a voluntary
action let's say picking this up very
briefly before you're conscious of
making the decision the parts of your
brain that are organizing the action are
already active which means that the
decision is made
pre consciously
and then reaches consciousness at some
point most of our decisions never reach
consciousness that we're doing all kinds
of things all the time and totally
unaware of them and parts of the way
ever we have two brains remember there's
this one there's this one sometimes the
gut brain the enteric nervous system
which is a real nervous system rich in
neurons as it suffers Alzheimer's it's
very similar to this one and we haven't
the slightest consciousness about what
it's doing its work unless you get a
stomachache then you know it's not
working but with regard the language
unfortunately there has been no
investigation serious investigation of
the question though it could be
investigated so we're left at the moment
with introspection that's not a good
state but try it when you introspect
about your thinking and language I think
what you'll find is that the expressions
you articulate to yourself you know come
almost instantaneously indicating that
there was pre conscious organization of
the thought that is sometimes reaching
consciousness and often is not and I
suspect that when these topics begin to
be investigated which is not impossible
that's what we're going to discover that
most the this mystery of what the
puppeteer is doing is probably
preconscious we will not get access to
it through conscious introspection but
only in indirect ways the way we think
we learn what the enteric nervous system
is doing that's a guess about what will
be discovered if these topics are ever
investigated seriously one of the
reasons they're not investigated is
because of the assumption in modern
philosophy psychology that consciousness
is the hard problem I don't think that's
true
I suspect consciousness is a problem
that we know how to address you know you
can find the mechanisms involved in
consciousness learn a lot about it
preconscious decisioning choices I
suspect is a much deeper problem okay
well this is I mean both to speculate on
things about the future virtual we
really as we should emphasize about a
system that we don't understand much of
now but in that spirit and following up
on this idea that maybe we could we
could that the brain is a material
entity and and therefore might be
reproduced elsewhere Bishop is asked do
you think that a and this is a real
interesting question I think do you
think that AI will have the same
snowflake language apparatus or quick
evolutionary moments in regards to
creativity and language namely assuming
AI becomes conscious well it it would
you imagine it would have the same kind
of language development it's a really
speculative question but it's an
interesting one it seems to me little
cautious about AI what exactly is it
there's two variants of AI one is
roughly science and engineering it's
rough distinction there's the kind of AI
which is trying to construct devices
that are useful you know self-driving
cars
robots that can clean your house things
like that that's fine you know it's not
really contributing except very
indirectly to the understanding of how
cognitive systems intelligent systems
work it's doing things that are useful
which is fine it's like building a big
bigger bulldozer great there's another
kind of AI which is which is pure
science which is trying to discover the
nature of what is going on when a
nematode decides to turn to the left or
when I decide to pick this up but that's
the same as its cult map might be called
AI if you like but it's the same as just
cognitive science what will happen if
thee I think the question is asking what
if robots are designed which have the
same properties that the mechanisms that
we will come to understand are essential
for come for consciousness will they be
conscious that we can already asked that
question about dogs I mean are they
conscious in fact you can ask that
question about me you know you're
conscious do you know that I'm conscious
no just because I tell you that doesn't
mean it robot could - we
there's the Turing test which it turns
out to me not a very good test after all
well the Turing test is kind of
interesting Turing himself was a very
brilliant mathematician and scientist he
understood that the test didn't amount
to much the history of the Turing test
is kind of intriguing this is based on
an eight-page paper around 1950 called
the can machines think or something
Turing and that paper says the question
whether machines can think is too
meaningless to deserve discussion and
he's right asking whether machines can
think is like asking whether submarines
swim if you want to call that swimming
it's swimming it's
you know it takes a the airplanes fly in
English they fly in Hebrew they glide
two people fly in Japanese when they're
jumping they fly in English they don't
these are terminological questions what
we can do and touring with touring he
did suggest this imitation game but it
is not as he pointed out an answer to
the question where the machines think
because it's not a serious question the
notion thinking isn't well enough
defined so you can ask whether it's
being achieved by some device now it's
kind of striking that if you go back to
the 17th century the same questions were
asked but are scientific questions so go
back to Descartes who observed as far as
we know correctly that this creative
aspect of languages is a unique human
capacity well that immediately led to
experimental proposals the corps de moi
won the minor Cartesians outlined tests
that you could use a series of
experiments that you could use if there
was another creature who looked like you
and you wanted to find out if he had
this capacity and he pointed out like a
scientist that if the creature passes
all the tests you can think of then it
would be reasonable to assume that he
has the capacity it doesn't prove it but
you don't prove things in science that
was a serious version of the Turing test
it was about something real alleged the
namely a capacity that you're trying to
test for it's kind of like a litmus test
for acidity there's something real
you're trying to find out whether some
object has it that's very different from
the Turing test in fact in many ways I
think there's been a kind of
intellectual regression from the 17th
century to today replacing the serious
tests for about reality litmus tests for
a particular capacity by a test
basically like answering the question
whether submarines swim let's follow up
in that little because you know you
talked earlier this evening about the
idea that maybe things the the the
whatever was that initiated the
possibility of language had to be in a
sense because of the laws of nature the
thing that I would be interesting to me
is whether therefore there is a unique
set of cognitive processes and so it
would be interesting if one had machines
that think to see if they think
differently I think that would be a
fascinating question certainly we know
that there are some that are different
so for example an automated procedure
for say determining whether a paper in
the American Mathematical Society gives
a real proof if you look at things that
are called proofs and there lots of
intuition and you know appeal to what
people know and so yeah you try to
formalize it and fill them in the
details it's pretty hard they have to be
very hard but you can think of automated
ways of doing that which are not the
ways we do it and as I've said in the
stage before we know the computers think
at least right now think differently
because they could lose energy in a very
vastly different way they do all kind of
things that we can do but and they also
do it much in some sense more much more
inefficiently in terms of energy
consumption sort of sort of sort of cars
yeah
