the budget cuts in the US and the United
States a merry old England camera in
recent began the series of massive cuts
to the welfare state to negate the
British budget deficit as many other
countries have he talks about tough
times ahead and yet as he is someone
born into absolute privilege in comfort
many people me included find such
comments but critical I mean what does
he know about tough times yet there's an
argument which states it isn't important
because I guess he understands the
concept of financial hardship
intellectually and therefore you may be
doesn't need to understand it
empathetically what's your position does
a politician need to have endured a
degree of poverty to make equitable
far-reaching decisions regarding it ma
no not at all and it takes a Franklin
Delano Roosevelt you came from wealth
and privilege big estates in New York
but he was sympathetic to carrying out
highly progressive policies that were
great benefit to the population maybe it
helps to know something about poverty
but it's certainly not critical you know
in fact let's go back to the founder of
the hero of the modern conservatives who
actually they hate his principles but
they put him up as a hero Adam Smith
yeah I'm in his moral philosophy which
was the foundation of the economic
theory was based on the assumption that
core human emotions sympathy acting
David Hume the other major founder of
classical liberalism same thing and that
is indeed a core human emotion it takes
real effort to drive that our people's
head in fact it's kind of striking to
see it that takes a the United States
and no better the early industrial
revolution in the United States sure
around here eastern Massachusetts the
latter part of the 19th century at that
time that was the period of the freest
present american hist
lots of newspapers popularly run lots of
engagement lots of readership many of
the much of the press was coming out of
the labor movement workers and factors
and so on what they call factory girls
young women from the farms moving the
textile factories in Irish artisans from
blossom insolent they ring the papers
they bitterly condemned the new
industrial system which was destroying
their culture their lives and slaving
them and so on but one of their main
complaints was against what they called
the new spirit of the age gain wealth
forgetting all but self and that's
totally inconsistent with they're just
normal feelings that's taken 150 years
to try to convince people that they
should be committed to the new spirit of
the age and it's still going on
massively that's why you have tax on
Social Security on pensions and so on
those are all based on the attacks are
based on the new spirit of the age after
150 years ordinary people don't feel
that way they think we ought to have
responsibility for a disabled way to
across town it doesn't have enough money
d but from the point of view of those
who Adam Smith again called the Masters
of mankind they follow their vibe what
he called their vile Maxim all for
ourselves nothing for anyone else that's
the new spirit of the age and from their
point of view why should I care about
the disabled widow gross down and why
should I care if the kid across the
street as a school I don't have to get
some school why should I pay taxes for
that you know that's the new spirit of
the age and I don't think that has much
to do with whether you grew up in wealth
or poverty as to do whether you are
willing to allow your basic human
consciousness and understanding that
prevail and your ordinary life Richard
were thoughts on the same thing but the
banks are once again reverting to their
previous position of huge bonuses and
short-term greed what's the rest of us
are beginning to be able to effectively
austerity measures with large numbers of
workers losing their jobs or having pain
conditions of early affected and yet I'm
just shocked by how brazen the corporate
world appears to be with Goldman Sachs
15 billion in bonuses just one example
they appear to have absolutely no
concern over the growing hatred and
anger that exists within the population
towards them now I've heard you state
that their raison d'etre is to create
profit to their shareholders and
companies in the short term so problems
that only may reach there's anything a
generations time are irrelevant to the
exigencies of now however this anger
that I mentioned if mobilised into
action could severely damage them in the
short term and it's very hard to predict
don't they care are they counting on the
general public remaining atomized and
passive that's what they're gaining on
foreign policy works the same way
actually I was in England for a week
couple months ago every day the front
page story about some scandal at
Barclays Bank pain executives huge
bonuses well people are suffering that's
the way the systems designed and they
are yes counting on the passivity of the
public actually there's a doctrine that
was expressed pretty clearly with regard
to the Arab Spring it was expressed by
MNN Marwan washer who's the chief middle
east analyst for the Carnegie Endowment
for murder Dane high official i forget
his exact words but we said is as long
as the population is quiet you can do
anything you want and that's correct
domestically to Egypt is a very striking
case this arps the sport remove barack
is not coming out of nowhere back
in the late 1950s the president at
Eisenhower it was concerned about what
he called a campaign of hatred against
us in the Arab world and not among not
in the government's there ok but among
the people and at the same year the
National Security Council and is the
main planning body that came out with a
study of this and they explained it they
said there's a campaign of hatred is
based on a perception in the Arab world
that the United States supports harsh
brutal dictatorships and we block
development and democracy now we do this
because if you want to ensure control
over their resources and went on to say
that the perception is more or less
accurate and furthermore that's what we
should be doing we'll count on the
dictatorships to control the population
and count on the washer doctrine and
that's fine that's why Obama square eid
mubarak to the bitter end count on the
dictatorship to control the population
and it's going it continues to go on and
it goes on domestically as long as the
population is maybe they're angry maybe
they're frustrated maybe they hate
institution long as they don't do
anything about it the Masters of mankind
will pursue their vile Maxim moving on
to Iraq I was discussing my position
recently regarding the Iraq war they my
opinion Blair and Buzz should be at The
Hague in front of the ICC not that I
have expect this to happen I was asked
whether I wanted every leader of every
country there was a member of the
Coalition of the Willing to be placed on
trial what about countries that we
remember the coalition but didn't fight
like New Zealand or countries that
didn't have an army such as Micronesian
allow what will what would your answer
be well basically the Nuremberg
principle then put everybody in trial in
fact lower level people were not in
tried at Nuremberg the people who were
tried were the leaders of the decision
makers
the people who were sitting in the room
while the decision was made to invade
Poland people like fun driven drop
foreign minister was hanged incidentally
that's several charges but the crime
against peace was he was there when the
decision was made to invade Poland he
supported a preemptive war against
Norway the Nazis knew that the British
were planning to invade from Norway they
invaded first pre-emptive war well you
know pal colin powell's more guilty than
he was but but they didn't you know that
the people who threw bodies into the
crematoria they weren't directed
November some were charged all summer
but the and certainly not collaborators
here in there and the same principle is
true here I'm Blair and bush and their
close associate made a decision to
invade another country to carry out the
supreme international crime of Nuremberg
which remember as defined at Nuremberg
and found its way I'd international law
that supreme international crime the
question of the tribunal its aggression
but it's more than that they said it's
different from other war crimes because
it encompasses all of the evil that
follows so in the case of Iraq it
encompasses the destruction of the
national heritage the sectarian warfare
which toured the country to shreds is
now spread over the region these are
huge consequences millions of displaced
people maybe hundreds of thousands or
more killed you know all of those are
consequences that's really serious and
yeah sure there should be didn't know if
law meant anything they would be
infected again the Nuremberg principles
are interesting the chief counsel for
the prosecution justice Jackson US
Justice he made a pretty impassioned
appeal to the tribunal saying we're
handing these defendants poisoned
chalice and if we ever sit from it we
have to be subject subjected to the same
principles or else little trials of
farce it's not this exact words it's
nothing like that so we have a choice
either the trial was a farce and we
political we murdered the nazi
defendants extra judicially or else
you're right should apply to us
