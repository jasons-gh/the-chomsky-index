wait this is what I call a good audience
I'm not going to regale you with what
happened since 8 o'clock this morning my
time which is because I want to forget
it myself and I think it seems to me
that in view of the you know lateness of
the hour it would make sense if you're
willing to do what I often do do in
places that I go to a lot and where
they're used to it and that is just
dispensed with the talk and starting
with the discussion which is always a
lot more interesting and it's more key
to your interests I mean I could start
talking about any number of things but
since it's another Cuban baby I don't
think so for a number of reasons the
main reason is that the guys who I mean
the the the American business community
is not in favor of it at this point and
they have plenty of clout no you know
it's conceivable that jingoist
fanaticism overwhelm sort of the
interest of those who really run the
country but I didn't look likely I mean
they what's happening around the case of
Cuba that's kind of like what happened
in the case of Vietnam the the US policy
toward Cuba or Vietnam or Nicaragua was
completely understandable
I mean you simply have to think in terms
of state some neighborhood in Chicago or
maybe Vancouver where the local mafia
done is running the thing and some
storekeeper says he's not going to pay
his protection
his protection money well you don't just
you send your goons in and you get the
money but you don't stop there so you
got to break its legs or kill them or
you know make sure that other people
understand that that's not the kind of
thing you do and that's what's been
driving US policy it's what drove us it
basically won the war in Vietnam by the
early seventies in any reasonable sense
but I think it maximal goals but they
got the main ones but you have to show
other people in the neighborhood that
that's not the way you behave so you
have to really torture and they
continued to torture them as long as
they could one excuse after another each
excuse more ridiculous than the last one
until something happened other people in
the neighborhood stopped being
intimidated and started going in you
know the Japanese slowly moved in and
then the Europeans slowly moved in and
pretty soon the American business
community it things got to the point
where they recognized that well it's
kind of useful and maybe even fun to
torture people and kick them in the face
it's much more important to make money
and when you pass there comes this or a
transitional point when you switch and
when that transition point came all of a
sudden it turned out that Vietnam was
being forthcoming on the MIAA is and
making great progress and human rights
and so on and so forth so therefore
American businesses could go in and get
their share of the take and that's
pretty much what's happening in the case
of Cuba I think I've got a suggestion
we're constantly being bombarded by
somebody you know I make can I make a
suggestion
yeah we're constantly being bombarded by
the media it's almost you it's almost a
complete and total one line and that is
we have to pay back again I'm sure
you're having the same thing in your
country there's the same thing in
Western Europe and in Eastern Europe I
you know rarely in my life and I'm over
50 now have I seen such a universal you
know chorus
that has you know no dissenting voices
and I wondered if you might come through
that
yes I'm sure there's no dissenting I
mean I hear all like I don't want to
talk about Canada you you know you know
much more than me but let me talk about
the United States where there's is a
dissenting voice like you know the
overwhelming majority of the population
and you see that right now simply have a
look at what's going on in the primaries
a couple of months up to a few months
ago the top priority for both political
parties was getting rid of the deficit
and you know get balancing the budget
and so on that was the top priority for
both parties the only difference was
whether you do it and you know seven
years or seven years in two months or
something like that the you know the
government kept being closed down over
this for a couple of months I would and
in the press you know had a lot of gotta
balance the budget Americans voted for a
balanced budget boost on anybody had
been looking at the polls knew that this
was total nonsense the public was
overwhelmingly opposed to this on any
realistic grounds if you looked at the
polls they were always kind of that to
kind of questions there was one question
for the headline writers and that
question was would you like to have a
balanced budget and on that everybody
says yes I mean I would say yes it's
like asking would you like to have your
household debts magically removed sure
you know but then when people were asked
would you like to have a balanced budget
if and then becomes any realistic
assumption you know cuts in education or
health or environmental protection or
you name it it's quickly became
overwhelmingly no and you couldn't it so
that the first question was for the guys
who write the headlines or on National
Public Radio and so on but the questions
down at the bottom they were for the
people who have to keep their finger on
the public pulse I like the public
relations industry and the propaganda
system and everyone else they have to
know what people are thinking you know
you're gonna
to control minds you have to know where
they are so there is so if you look at
polls carefully they give you a pretty
realistic picture I mean as much as can
be done of because the business
community needs to know that and it was
very clear what what the attitudes were
so contrary to what you're saying
outside of elite circles the articulate
intellectuals the political class and so
on
most people were opposed to it and on
very solid and you can see that right
now as soon as the primary started the
minute the primary started and people
had to face the voters the budget
disappeared and nobody's talking about
it take a look at any of the campaigns
it is never mentioned and the reason
that it's never mentioned is well you
know these guys have to face an angry
voters so they better talk about
something else not what they're doing in
fact nothing that they're doing ever
reaches the voters if you compare the
campaign that's going on now with the
congressional you know Gingrich army
proposals they don't even overlap
there's no contact between them and the
budget is one dramatic example if this
takes a lot of discipline for
journalists and others not to notice
this and to see what it means but you
know there's been I like a sea change
within as soon as the primary season
started the budget dropped off the
stream and you might ask a different
question who's right you know there's a
question of fact like is it important to
balance the budget so who's right the
instincts of the general population or
the business community which does want
to do it but of course they want to do
it for very simple reasons balancing the
budget is a weapon against social
spending so that's kind of irrelevant
you know but if you ask about the
evidence very it's not even hidden you
know for example although all the talk
about the budget balancing some parts of
the budget are going up in fact to
clark's they're going up pretty fast in
fact one is the Pentagon
budget is a basically Cold War levels
actually it's hired and it was under
Nixon and there's no Russians around so
that tells you how seriously they took
the Russian threat but it's going up and
it's going up under pressure from the
far right the Heritage Foundation you
know Gingrich Republicans and so on they
wanted to go up the public has an
attitude on that to the public is
opposed to that by about six to one but
the difference between public attitudes
and public policy which is always
significant has just become like a chasm
the so that's one thing that's going up
the other things going up is the other
aspect it's like that's going up because
it's a the the main function of the
Pentagon its main domestic function has
always been to transfer public funds to
high-tech industry like that's not my
salary gets dated to be honest I MIT is
part of that funnel where I work it's
part of the funnel by which the public
unwittingly pays the costs of high-tech
industry and the whole of the modern
economy if you look through it is
crucially based on this so the Pentagon
has denied stave and in fact go up the
other part of the federal budget that's
going up state budgets to is the other
part of the security system jails the
crime hasn't changed in about twenty
years leave if you can believe the FBI
but the perception of crime has gone has
changed radically and that's propaganda
that's you can given it's the effect of
propaganda to try to make people of
crime is serious but you know it's no
more series and it was thirty years ago
