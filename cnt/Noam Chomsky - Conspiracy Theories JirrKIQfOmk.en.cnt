conspiracy theories which have become
quite popular amongst those people who
identify as progressive I know you've
been fairly critical of those ideas why
do you think that they're popular now
first of all there are conspiracies no
question about it in fact sometimes it
takes a something that big effects like
take the suburbanization of America the
huge government state corporate social
engineering projects which were largely
dedicated to maximizing the inefficient
use of fossil fuels with everything goes
on goes along with it
well I may destroy the species so it's
not insignificant but it did start as a
literal conspiracy of General Motors
Standard Oil of California and Firestone
rubber to buy up and destroy the fairly
efficient electric transport system in
Los Angeles and other cities destroy it
and turn it into the monstrosity we have
okay I was a conspiracy fact they were
taking a cord you know find a couple
thousand dollars but look looking for
something hidden that's sort of beneath
the surface that's really running things
I think that's a sometimes it's true but
usually it's my view turns out to be of
ethology and I think it comes from a
sense that I don't like the way things
are and so there must be some hidden
hands somewhere that's manipulating and
controlling it
whereas when you look closely I think
you just see the normal workings of
institutional structures that makes you
of course raise questions about the
nature of the society who we are how we
tolerate it and so on so for example
it's appealing to believe that say John
F Kennedy one of the main figures and
conspiracy theory water
called conspiracy theories it would be
nice to believe he's just a
fantastically wonderful guy I was going
to what kind of great things and they
shot him down just because he was so
wonderful than the world has gone off
how I had duska ever since then that's a
comforting feeling it's less comforting
to recognize what I think the
documentary record demonstrates in the
historical record but he was a kind of a
hawk who was a politician trying to gain
power by the usual techniques is kind of
affable and friendly and smiles you've
got a better people up but if he take a
look what he's doing is pretty horrible
one of the worst most dangerous
creatures in 20th century and
unfortunately didn't happen the blow of
the world they came pretty close to
that's a less comforting position I
happen to think it's largely true same
with Barack Obama but you can see the
appeal of trying to find so takes a
Obama there's a widespread feeling on
the Left middle-eastern commentators and
so on that he's really dedicated doing
wonderful things it's just the dark
forces are preventing so we just have to
hope that he's going to overcome the
dark forces you know like
hero in a fairy tale and somehow get rid
of the witches and Dragons and
everything will be nice I don't think
that there's any truth with it
exactly what he seems to be and there
nobody's going to ride in on a white
horse pack them get rid of the Dragons
and the witches got to do it ourselves
that's order right so would you say that
conspiracy conspiracy theories in
general are not particularly helpful for
radical politics and radical action if
they're inaccurate I mean if they're
accurate as they sometimes are sure that
helps explain the world but most of what
happens is on its advocates I you know
in a sense it's a conspiracy if the
board of directors of General Motors get
together and decide okay here's our
plans for next year it's kind of a
conspiracy but we don't call that a
conspiracy theory because it's the
normal working of institutions and
similarly when the young take say during
the Second World War the high state
department planners and comparable
features figures in the private sector
like the Council on Foreign Relations
did meet and extensively discuss the
nature of the post-war world and lay
plans which were pretty much well
executed what's happened to be public
but is it a conspiracy
you know they got together they worked
out plans that he later implemented them
smoker people they have special
interests not the interests of the
population but exposing that makes
perfect sense that's not what's called a
conspiracy theory because that's the way
institutions operate and that makes
sense
you know on the other hand this to take
I don't like to use the term because
there are conspiracies it's called a
conspiracy theory if we don't like it or
something it's not the way to look at it
but you have to ask is whether the
theories of the conspiracy are
so let's take say the idea that the Bush
administration plotted to blow up the
World Trade Center that attracts a huge
support maybe a third of the population
believes it and very dedicated groups of
people many of them on the Left they're
just committed to that is it plausible
I mean suppose that the let's say
somebody conspired to blow up the World
Trade Center we know what they did they
blamed a ton sities with the Bush
administration blame it on Saudis
thereby shooting themselves in the you
know in the feet I mean they wanted it
bomb Iraq so if they work in heist it
they would have blamed it on Iraqis then
they'd have no problem at all getting
congressional authorization a UN
resolution NATO had joined in everybody
fine let's invade Iraq instead whoever
did it leave the munsi Bootes
well that absolves the Bush
administration short of outright
insanity why harm your relations with a
valued ally instead of blaming it on the
people you want to invade so it's
already a barrier to even entertaining
the possibility and the elaborate work
that goes into you know is there
nano-thermite and building segment seven
or whatever it is it's kind of a sad to
point yeah maybe it was maybe there
wasn't unless you have a pretty
sophisticated knowledge of civil
engineering and structural architecture
you can t make a judgment as to whether
it means anything but there are obvious
clear phenomena that that the theory has
to deal with somehow it doesn't and if
it doesn't I don't see I don't see where
doesn't take it seriously so yes then it
becomes one of these kinds of conspiracy
theory that you
obviously misdirected energy and so on
it wouldn't surprise me if say four
years from now we get declassified
documents would show that the Bush
administration was very sympathetic to
these theories it was it was diverting
energy from real crimes into things that
are basically a wild goose chase
actually we have documents like that
from about the Kennedy assassination
so there are Pentagon advisory documents
which advise the Pentagon the government
to periodically leak information about
the Kennedy assassination
basically so as to keep people out of
our hair you know let them follow those
non non-existent leads instead of asking
us questions that we really don't want
to answer so real conspiracy theory
there and there we have the actual
documents and I wouldn't would shock me
if there are similar things about 9/11
conspiracies they do have an immediate
effect they draw a lot of energy and
effort away from major crimes the crimes
which are a lot worse than blowing up
the World Trade Center
so that's convenient for the powerful
that's it's the you know the theories
seem to have just major logical problems
that I don't see how they confront like
what I mentioned it it does seem to me
the the kind of theory that misleads and
mr. eggs and I it's not hard to see why
it's popular I mean some terrible things
are going on should be some dark hand
behind it we hate
in Roseville for good reasons so maybe
they're behind
