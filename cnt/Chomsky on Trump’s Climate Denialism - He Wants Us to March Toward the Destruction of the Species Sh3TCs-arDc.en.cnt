no you were just talking about the issue
of climate change let's turn to the
presidential election and a clip of the
presumptive Republican frontrunner
Donald Trump speaking last month when he
dismissed concerns about climate change
President Obama said the biggest threat
to our country is global warming that's
cool give me a break okay the biggest
threat to our country is nuclear and we
cannot let Iran get a nuclear weapon
that was Donald Trump Noam Chomsky your
response on that comment and Donald
Trump overall was a possible President
of the United States it's pretty scary
prospect for one thing it's not easy to
find out that what he thinks if I'm
saying third that he knows what he
thinks he's a kind of a loose cannon all
kind of statements come out sometimes
some statement plus the negation of that
statement within a few minutes it's kind
of a con job but there are some pretty
steady features of his position which in
fact were expressed and the clip that
you ran one note there isn't any global
warming give me a break that's not an
issue so what he's saying is let's race
to the precipice says quickly as we can
and we should not this is not abstract
it's already having major effects the
Republican position and notice it's not
Trump it's a hundred percent of the
Republican candidates taking essentially
the same position what they're saying
let's get rid of the EPA let's get rid
of regulations so that's all the joke
it's a liberal hoax and so on that's
having effect the Paris conference last
December the signing was just a couple
days ago aimed at establishing a treaty
which countries would be committed to
adhere to which would put fixed limits
on global warming the limits were
nowhere near enough but at least it was
something but even that could not be
reached for
one clear explicit reason the Republican
Congress which would not accept the
treaty that was recognized worldwide
therefore the hope for a treaty was
abandoned in place was put voluntary
agreements obviously much weaker when
the Republicans on the Supreme Court
just recently beat back pretty moderate
proposed Obama regulation on coal that
again as a message to the world says
don't bother doing anything the biggest
most powerful country in the world just
isn't going to doesn't care so you go
ahead and do what you like this is all
literally saying let's race to the
precipice and it's it's not remote it's
not a matter of centuries as a matter of
decades it's just shocking to see this
happening now Trump did mention
correctly that nuclear weapons are a
very serious threat and he picked the
absolute worst possible example Iran is
not a threat period the world doesn't
regard Iran as a threat that's a u.s.
obsession you look at global polls of
global opinion taken by Gallup
International Affiliate leading us
polling agencies agency one of the
questions that they ask is which country
is the greatest threat to world peace
answer United States by a huge margin
Iran is barely mentioned second place is
Pakistan inflated by the Indian vote
that's way behind the United States
that's world opinion and there are
reasons for it Americans are protected
from this information the media
literally did not report it you could
read it you hear it on BBC you could
pick it off on the international press
the Iran there's never been any and the
the threat of Iran so
called is actually described pretty
clearly by the US intelligence what
they've made clear is that the threat of
Iran's nuclear programs not nuclear
weapons they don't have any but the
threat of Iran's nuclear programs is
that they might provide serve as a
deterrent in the region what does that
mean it means that the states that carry
out regular aggression and violence in
the region might be deterred if Iran has
a capability of some someday producing
nuclear weapons which states are those
the United States and Israel so Iran
might be a deterrent to the two rogue
states that rampage in the region that's
the threat if there was if there was any
concern for the threat real concern
there would be clear straightforward
ways to eliminate it namely moved to
establish a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East now that that there are
countries that advocate that primary
among them is Iran as head of the
non-aligned movement it's been leading
the call for a nuclear weapons free zone
it's strongly supported by the Arab
states has been for decades in fact
supported by about the whole world why
aren't we making steps towards it
because the United States blocks it and
the route why does the u.s. block it
well understood wants to protect
Israel's nuclear weapons capacity from
scrutiny and accountability that's the
nuclear threat in the region not Iran so
yes there and in fact Trump did not go
on to give his answer what he says he
means it is we have to rapidly build up
our military forces which are already
overwhelming Obama already has a
trillion-dollar program outlined for
zatia nuff nuclear weapons which
includes what you mentioned correctly
earlier small nuclear weapons which are
regarded by specialists correctly as a
very serious threat because there'll be
a temptation to use them and it's almost
certain that any use is going to quickly
escalate and that Doomsday Clock goes
right to midnight so Trump is saying
y'all let's let's make the global
warming problem as dangerous and
imminent as possible let's march towards
destruction of the species like we're
destroying everyone else and let's
escalate militarization and at the same
time sharply cut down resources by
radical tax cuts mostly for the rich
which means essentially eliminate pretty
much the rest of the government
incidentally in that position he's not
very different from paul ryan who's
considered the intellectual on the
republican side this is a really
astonishing moment in human history if
you look at it
