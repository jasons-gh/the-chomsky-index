2006 you go shabbos goes to the UN
General Assembly with your book and then
we found out about your connections with
them and then in 2011 you have publicly
criticized him for the detention of
Judge of uni I'm just very curious about
your personal thoughts about his legacy
in general well it's actually that UN
visit is interesting he did something
quite important at the UN I mean showing
off the book joking but of course that's
what the press was in yesterday but he
actually gave a very interesting talk at
the General Assembly I think it was that
year he's probably on the internet you
might look about what he as well of
course an oil producer and he suggested
at the T said at the General Assembly
that the producers and the consumers of
oil oughta get together and work out
ways to reduce the use of fossil fuels
because it's very destructive to the
environment and they ought to be
cooperating on this outside of Korea
Ecuador it's the only oil producer
producing state whoever suggested
cutting back on the use of fossil fuels
that was important much more important
than any of the shenanigans that the UN
english you devil the holding of the
book but the fresh wouldn't touch it
it's to constructive the do you think
that in an in general his rule
especially about 2010 especially with
the judge uni case did it go sour at one
point do you think you defeat their
human rights violations this is one
that's interesting about the affinis
case I mean I've been involved in
endless activities about human rights or
a letter turkey turkey alone I got a
thousand times as much as I did on a
unit but it never gets any attention the
offending case got a lot of attention
article in The New York Times interview
interviewing the Guardian the
International the reason is because I
was criticizing an enemy of the United
States if you criticize an enemy of the
United States then it's wonderful if you
criticize a ally or a client of the
United military can't mention it you
know so that's why this case is known
but in my own activities it's very minor
example as I say during one of many
turkey alone is it by another one from
turn over all but but that could never
be mentioned you know that was some of
their other human rights violations lot
of problems but and it's a mixed legacy
there are some things that were quite
good at the poverty levels been very
sharply reduced the literacy went way up
health standards improved in part
they've improved through very sensible
relations that the West bitterly
condemned there's a kind of a barter
relation between Cuba and Venezuela
Ella which makes perfect sense they're
each pursuing their comparative
advantage just let me connoisseur
applaud that as well as oil Cuba has a
highly trained personnel very affected
in fact so they're training cubed gets
reduced prices for oil Venezuela gets
teachers doctors and so on and the
Cubans are quite remarkable the West
doesn't like to talk about it but their
humanitarian aid to the third world just
divorce what the West does I mean as an
incomparable near tiny country under
attack when they said send doc words to
a country you say after the big
earthquake in Pakistan or to South
Africa or wherever it is they go live in
the villages they go to hard places
where Western doctors and native ducts
and country don't want to go and they do
really hard work very constructive work
growing people with much of the third
we'll just look at them with all Haiti
Pakistan and all over and didn't
Venezuela too it's a quite a remarkable
feat for a small yeah country under
constant attack by us and propel that's
right and and their relations with you
on for instance how would you categorize
that well what about Turkey's relations
with around i started this increasing
rate with around the turkish brazilian
iranian a deal made a lot of sense
actually as you probably know it was
proposed by obama and then but assumedly
because he assumed that I would never
worked they would never
Iran agreed immediately came out since
their Brazil and Turkey for doing it
race through sanctions at the UN but
that was quite sensible effect Turkey
and Iran are a very natural trading
partners in durant needs manufactured
goods and technical materials of kinda
and the turkey needs energy yeah so it's
perfect trading relation the u.s. is
trying to block our followers but you
know i don't know exactly what turkeys
doing now but the other countries like
China and India they can't they can't
defy us sanctions where they get cut out
of the international financial system
but they're evading them in various ways
because they don't agree with them so
they have various like for example
China's linked up with a Pakistan Iran
pipeline which is a way of getting arany
in oil ago and then the India's of
building a port and Iran but you
wouldn't like it but there's a limit the
US power and Turkey was doing that for a
while but I think far as I know Turkish
Iranian relations of cool recently over
yes middle east regional issues but
that's actually a good segue for the
next one I I know you recently visited
velocity University in Istanbul and I
did see that footage what were your
impressions I mean
I understand that it's the last time I
visited with you you were also at a
human rights freedom of speech
conferenced um what has changed in your
opinion what is improving and what is
stalling well I've been in first time I
went to Turkey was around a little or 10
years ago maybe 15 years ago wouldn't
that was right at the end of the peak of
atrocities and crimes since then through
this millennium the situation's improve
a definite improvement far from perfect
but not better on the other hand the
last couple of years it's starting to
get worse again with repression
increasing and so on this particular
occasion as you may know was a memorial
lecture for grunting and
the political activists kind of people I
know you know Oh most of them think that
he was probably killed by the government
if they did it it was a tactical error
because it created a big backlash yes in
fact a lot more concern over the
Armenian issue you notice they don't
work my artists in general there was
this time there was a big demonstration
march through the streets of Istanbul
demonstration outside of the aqua
displacers assassinated and a lot of
enthusiasm and this is in this
contradiction in Turkey all the way long
right through the 90s they peak of
atrocities it's very repressive but a
lot of resistance the last in our last
interview what it was printed it costs
for some question marks about your views
on the rdy government now there are
cases in which of course there are a lot
of journalists or imprisoned it'll be
the most speech at the world river world
record and recently I don't know if
you're familiar with the case of fazal
sigh of Basel Sonia was a musician every
World War be renowned musician who is
now facing a probable 18-month sentence
for saying something tweaking something
against Islam what is your general view
about the air21 government and this
particular repression and where it's
going even with the current talks with
Vickers in a different fashion what do
you think is different in there are
talks and she was an article not York
Times about it today which presented on
us very forthcoming looking for peace
he's willing to drink the hemlock
that'll bring peace most of the people i
talked to them turkey felt it was mostly
for show that didn't really take it very
seriously but and they thought that many
thought but they should be talking to
the BP and also into the people in canto
no no because they're in the because of
vigilance kind of removed from what's
happening being having been in prison if
there are to be serious negotiations it
should bring in the civilians and also
the the real PKK did not a symbolic
figure there's also a theory that is
this nearly symbolic to get a different
system where he would be the president
instead of primates this art up everyone
yeah well I'm sure there's plenty of
political new great motivation behind
but the current trajectory is
not very good under depressions been
increasing as i mentioned turkey novice
the world record for imprisonment of
journalists reporters without borders
know which monitors yeah journalists
published a special monograph about
turkey just a couple months ago because
the situation is getting bad yeah and
that's not what the islamization is
threatening on the other hand there
there are at least at least symbolic
maybe more steps towards trying to break
for reconciliation there's been some
improvement in the rights of kurds
enough but so so it's and there's a lot
of resistance which is the most positive
thing speaking of Islamization this is
the second part of the piece that i'm
working it's regarding your views
starting from 1994 I'd like to if you
don't mind just quote exactly what you
said in 1994 my curiosity is what your
thoughts are now after nine at a 911 and
current developments that you say the
inability to participate in a meaningful
fashion in the political arena which may
have a rather important psychic effect
heightened by striking disparity between
the facts and the ideological depiction
of them what's sometimes called the
ideal culture is so radically different
from the real culture in terms of the
theory of popular participation versus
the reality of remoteness and impotence
that's not impossible people will find
some ways of identifying themselves
becoming associated with others taking
part in something they're going to do it
some way or the other if they don't have
the options to participate in labor
unions political organizations that
actually function they'll find other
ways religious fundamentalism is a
classic exam
probably i was referring to the united
states yes you were you also give some
islamization references as well really
on in general I think was beyond that
assemble as secular nationalism was
destroyed partly by external force
partly by internal corruption as a
mixture but as it essentially
disappeared like say the Nazarite to the
Egyptian custom in Iraq and so on
because as that was destroyed there was
a rise of Islamic fundamentalism cannot
simply by accident like Saudi Arabia
which is the most extreme Islamic
fundamentalist state in the world and is
also kind of a missionary state they
spend a lot of money to try to encourage
sponsor a radical the cinemas ation then
it Pakistan we need to do we get many
clearly Libya there has been a very
definite prize and Islamic
fundamentalism and that's pretty natural
yeah that's a little there is as you say
I was talking about the United States
very notable here the significant I mean
they're always source been a very
religious country the United some kind
of off the spectrum but it never really
organized as a major political force in
the best I'm today Christian
fundamentalists are a large part of the
bases Republican Party and I think it's
a reflection of the fact that the
Republican Party abandoned much of a
tensive being a parliamentary party
they're now in kind of lockstep service
to very rich in the corporate sector and
almost like the old communist party at
sonic catechism and everyone is repeated
so on you actually mentioned many times
that in 19th century the call them
bridgestone type preachers you know they
were encouraged to promote and encourage
the businesses allows two gentlemen them
getting it now it's gotten it's a
qualitative change now it's comes I mean
the Republican Party can't get votes by
coming forth on their actual program we
want to take everything away from you
and put it the pockets of the rich can't
get a lot about gentlemen so they have
to find other ways of getting votes in
one of the ways is by mobilizing and
encouraging radical fundamentalism it's
its analogues to some of the things
happening in the Middle East alpa throbs
question in here do you think the Tea
Party is a function of this or as a
result of this nettle tea party is very
largely a creation of private capital in
the media and it exists you know it's
drawing from something real but the
enormous funding enormous publicity and
you know it's similar to this it also
overlaps with it a lot to the Tea Party
membership is a lot hi but the
commitment that Tea Party values is
simplest overlaps with religious
fundamentalism
incidentally Tea Party values are
somewhat misinterpreted they're very
good studies of actual attitudes of
people who identify with the deep party
what are they in favor of or other
groups that you know identify themselves
as what they call the Rotarians
small-government get the government off
our back that kind of thing yeah turns
out that their attitudes are kind of
Social Democratic so you do feel that
their grievances on their real group
there if they are real Tory bit awesome
I mean look at the United States of rich
country it's not like you the grievances
in a third world country but
structurally similar so the United
States in the last 30 odd years has been
subjected to a version of neoliberal
programs of the kind that we replied in
Latin America the Middle East Africa
everywhere always have the same effect a
very harmful to the general population
very beneficial to a very small segment
of extreme wealth wipeout social
programs you know it's in effects
everywhere and there's always a reaction
to it there has to be the most
interesting reactions latin america
latin america was the most obedient
servant of the IMF World Bank Treasury
Department programs but glass during
this millennium they've broken homes
completely free of it the independence
of Latin America now is remarkable this
is a interesting example of it just
about a couple of weeks ago the the open
society for sure is funded floor
published a study of participation in
rendition renditions in global torture
program
the United States and over 50 countries
participated practically all of your the
least of course because that's where
they sent them to be tortured Africa
Asia everybody participating one glaring
exception no Latin American country
participated which is pretty remarkable
for one thing because it's an exception
for another because no 10 20 years ago
of Latin America was the tortured center
of the world run by the United States of
murders torture states all over the
police and it had always been highly
subordinated to the United States but
it's broken so free that it's the one
area the world that refused to
participate in the u.s. global 30
program and there's other illustration
do you feel the just settling into Obama
Guantanamo ordeal do you think the u.s.
is position on this is the same as it
was with the Bush years or what do you
think is improved or not the early Bush
years just were straight out ready
tortured years the later Bush years
going to backed off somewhat Obama
Guantanamo is probably not major
tortures in the world anymore there's
just too much attention on yes so just
an ugly detention center it's because
it's nowhere near as bad as supermax
prisons in the United States but there
are plenty of others nobody knows what's
going
for example there are other so whether
tortures going on or not we have to
guess but I presume but is the there are
fairly recent cases of rendition it's
not nothing like it was an earlier year
mean but I don't think this reflects
Obama civil libertarian commitments on
the contraries done more to tear civil
liberties apart than bush in the United
States and internationally so he's
pushed forward very strong attacks on
civil liberties in the United States
they're not getting a lot of attention
with a very real actually one of those
related to Turkey gettin done one of the
worst Obama initiatives was a case
initiated by the Obama administration
against a group called the humanitarian
law project which is getting legal
advice to the PKK they weren't charged
them with material assistance to
terrorism that the Obama administration
pushed it all the way to the Supreme
Court where the right-wing justices
approved the position of the
administration in a very far-reaching
decision which if you read it literally
would mean that i'm giving material
assistance terrorism yes I mean I flight
now your turn I've talked to miss Rowley
yeah whatever if I had a chance I'd
happily took the PKK leaders and may be
advised them to turn to nonviolent
measures and that's actionable under
Obama it's a terrific attack on
means you cannot give legal advice you
can't do an investigation you can't read
a recorder anything that you do that
they decide is material assistance makes
you subject it severe punishment yeah
that's other other cases right now the
Obama administration hard push through
legislation through the court you know
lower courts knocked it out but by
pushing it to higher courts to which
would permit indefinite detention in
military prisons and that's
unfortunately not getting much protest
or that's getting protest is that it
extends to American citizens and in the
court proceedings the federal judge
asked the Justice Department the lawyers
well would it apply to the plaintiffs on
one of the plaintiffs would it apply to
them and he said well we can't say we
have define who would have liked it so
that it jerk judge threw it out but it's
going up to the next level and will
probably win ultimately and you know the
the global assassination campaign is a
massive violation of human and civil
rights which go back to the 15th century
I mean the you know the core of
anglo-american law is presumption of
innocence yeah if your Magna Carta you
know
if you're no man can be a sentence can
be punished unless the judge unless they
have due process judged by the court of
law by the quick and speedy trial other
peers I mean it's in the Constitution
yeah this is just going to the winds and
there's nothing any protester them
speaking of the civil rights issues
that's my last question the gay marriage
issue that Obama supports that's getting
a lot of attention obviously and Lucas
as though you know that is the direction
that he you know what's America to grow
into it what what what are your feelings
about that he didn't want it affect it
was against it at first he way he put it
his his views of evolved on the subject
and that's also true of the Republican
the right wing their views are evolving
on the subject and the revolving for a
very simple reason that if you take a
look at popular opinion its way ahead of
them on this issue and they can't be
that far beyond public opinion and as
far as it's not a class issue so you
know the corporate lately couldn't care
less I'm in a phacelia on the sexual
here but so for them it's not a nation
Amish so therefore it can easily move
forward is important on the yent agree
that what doesn't illustrate any
commitment to civil liberties mr.
Johnson thank you so much appreciate
your time very very much
