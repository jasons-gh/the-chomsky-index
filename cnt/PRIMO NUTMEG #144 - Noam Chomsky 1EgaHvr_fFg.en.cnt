[Music]
thank you again for a meeting with I
really do appreciate it
it's always an honor to speak with one
of the greatest thinkers of the modern
era so maybe sincerely do appreciate
your time thank you very much it's
likely that the key story that will
define the Trump presidency is the so
called Russia gate accusations I know
that you previously stated that these
claims were something of a joke and that
Trump himself is largely a distraction
but could you please clarify if you
think Russia did anything devious
if leaking the DNC emails are really
even a crime or if you believe Russia
did clewd with Trump but let the story
has been manipulated by the mainstream
media to create sort of a neo McCarthy
stret scare I presume that Russia had an
interest in the outcome of the election
and probably tried to influence it I
don't consider that a major issue for
one thing if you want to consider
interventions in the elections there are
vastly greater ones so for example it's
well established by very solid empirical
work by academic political scientists
Thomas Ferguson is the major one that
American elections are in a certain
sense bought in the sense that you can
predict the outcome of an election with
extreme precision simply by looking at
the single variable of campaign funding
and effect Ferguson did a very close
careful analysis of the 2016 election
which verified this hypothesis in a way
that most people aren't aware of they
discovered they look closely at the way
campaign funding worked and it turned
the last stages of the campaign when the
big investors and capitalist interests
were beginning to be afraid that they
didn't like Trump but they were afraid
that there might be a moderately Liberal
Democrat they poured money in a very
targeted way not just to the presidents
but to the Senate and House elections
and that led to a change which is
reflected in the vote so that's real
manipulation of elections and a massive
manipulation if the Russians did
something minor maybe further more
manipulation of elections by external
powers is pretty normal the United
States in fact is the champion and I
regard we not only intervened in
elections we overthrow governments if we
don't like them things like that in fact
if you want to look at manipulation of
elections recently the most striking
example which to my knowledge has only
been reported in the business press
Bloomberg Businessweek
is the latest the less German elections
a couple months ago there was a very
surprised that everyone was surprised by
the rise in votes gained by the more or
less neo-fascist party alternative or
third slot turns out that there was a
campaign organized by the Texas media
company that works for Trump the Penn
the Fed Yahoo others they collaborated
with the Berlin Facebook office the
which provided them with a detailed
demographic analysis of voters in
Germany and they were able to
micro-target
election based
these individuals in a way which seems
to have had a fairly significant
influence on the rise of the neo fascist
party that's a detectable case others
may exist or may not but they're all
pretty much in fact the u.s. Norway
intervenes but in elections let's say in
Russia for example but is very proud of
it
so Clinton massively intervened and the
I think was 1996 elections in which
Yeltsin his favorite was elected and it
was considered a great triumph it wasn't
hidden so maybe the Russians tried to do
something there's no indication that it
had much effect but doesn't seem to me a
significant issue I think it's picked up
by the Democrats and by the liberal
press because they hate Trump of course
and are trying to find some way to
undermine and Democrats are seeking an
excuse for why they lost an election we
should have been a open-shut affair if
that hadn't ran a decent campaign and
that decent programs well what's
interesting is if you'll actually back
to the 2012 election President Obama was
very critical of Mitt Romney's position
on Russia and was saying that it was a
cold war-era position and it was very
critical I believe he even said one
point the 1980s called because a few
months ago when you were asked what's
the biggest geopolitical threat facing
America you said Russia not al-qaeda
he said Russia and the 1980s are now
calling to ask for their foreign policy
back because you know the Cold War has
been over for 20 years but governor you
know when it comes to our foreign policy
you seem to want to import the foreign
policies in the 1980s you indicated that
we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties
with Russia despite the fact that 71
senators Democrats and Republicans voted
for it the statements that Governor
Romney makes show little understanding
of what is actually going on in the 21st
century this is to Russia that this is
without question our number one
geopolitical foe it's a really curious
statement
given that the Cold War has been over
for some time he is not up to date and
that is a very dangerous aspect that's
just an example of his 20th century
approach to 21st century issues
he's even blurted out the preposterous
notion that Russia is our number one
political geopolitical foe folks Sarah
Palin said she could see Russia from
Alaska MIT Mitt Romney talks like he's
only seen Russia by watching rocky for
[Music]
I tell you we have a lot of problems
that are not leftovers from the past but
are of the moment we've just been
talking about one namely Iran and in
many of the areas where we are working
to solve problems Russia has been an
ally you know they're in the p5 plus one
talks with us they have worked with us
in Afghanistan and have been very
helpful in the northern distribution
network and in other ways so I think
it's a it's somewhat dated to be looking
backwards instead of being realistic
about where we agree where we don't
agree but looking for ways to bridge the
disagreements and then to maximize the
cooperation what do you think it was
that caused the Democrats to suddenly
become such hawks against Russia was it
was it what happened with Ukraine or was
there something maybe else that that has
caused this new way of a kind of it
seems like a second Cold War almost well
you know the roots are pretty deep it's
you have to look back to the collapse of
the Soviet system if we want to
understand what's happening in around
1990 the Berlin Wall fell Soviet Union
collapsed the question is what's going
to happen next and there were two quite
different visions Mikhail Gorbachev they
speaking for the Soviet the former
Soviet Union advanced the idea of what
he called a common European home there
should be a single broader European home
including Western Europe including
Russia eliminate all military alliances
have a common security system and work
towards a common the integrated future
the US wasn't having any of that the
George Bush was the first and
his Secretary of State James Baker had
their proposal what they wanted and what
Gorbachev agreed to was a unified
Germany that would become part of NATO
for Gorbachev to agree with that is
pretty substantial concession after old
Russia had practically been destroyed
twice in the century by Germany alone
Germany as part of a hostile military
alliance has sent a little bit
frightening from a Russian quite a few
but he agreed and there was a quid pro
quo the quid pro quo was that NATO would
not move the phrase was one inch to the
east by that they meant East Berlin East
Germany nobody was talking about
anything beyond that was never in
writing and it was a gentlemen's
agreement and when the US very quickly
moved NATO into East Germany they argued
Bush and Baker argued that there was
only a verbal discussion never an
official commitment we could debate that
but what next happened under Clinton is
that NATO extended all the way to the
Russian border and from where the
Russian point of view which we should
try to understand that's the traditional
invasion route through which Russia has
been repeatedly invaded and virtually
destroyed now all part of a hostile
military alliance the u.s. went on
including under Obama to place adding
that the George Bush ii had withdrawn
from the anti-blast ABM Treaty listed
missile treaties will understood the
missile defense which gold missile
defense is in effect a first-strike
weapon and nobody believes that any
conceivable missile defense would ever
stop the first strike conceivably it
might stop a retaliatory strike which
makes it in effect for strike weapon
these are being placed right near the
Russian border they also have the claim
is their defense against Iran but it's
not even laughable right it was pointed
out right at the time at the beginning
of the expansion but in George Kennan
other Statesman that expanding to the
Russian border was a an error of tragic
error of historical significance it
virtually guaranteed tension and
conflict at the border which is
extremely dangerous and of course that's
taken place meanwhile the Russian
economy was subjected to a rapid
marketization shock therapy it was cold
which devastated the economy in the 90s
the economy just almost totally
collapsed and mids of people died it was
monstrosity from the point of view of
the Russian population and the whispered
action and Putin came in and restored a
kind of nationalist effort to restore
Russia's place in the world its power
and build its economy and so on all of
this led to an inevitable conflict the
Obama administration at first tried to
what they called reset relations with
Russia dragged more amical but that
broke down under disagreements over a
series of issues in Korean which
mentioned was one there were others and
policy reversed Clinton herself was
pretty much of a hawk on Russia but now
the situation's makes there's
interactions on Syria there's
threatening conflicts and there is
that's often called a new Cold War so
another thing that's pretty remarkable
about the Trump administration and about
his campaigning is that he was he
largely ran against the corporate media
I mean you know Imus is called him fake
News many times and at some points in
his campaigning he also even took a
dovish approaches he was seemingly
criticizing Hillary Clinton from the
left on Iraq for example and that was a
joke he supported the Iraq war after it
turned into be a disaster everyone
became a late opponent of the war well
what I was going to ask you about is
generally the relationship between the
media and trunk because another thing
that's kind of funny is that the media
although they're very critical of Trump
when he does something like bomb Syria
that's when they seem to celebrate him
and there's some of the criticism even
for example from Rachel Maddow has been
that in regards to North Korea he's
being too soft on North Korea recently
so just what is your overall take on
this at least supposed rivalry between
Donald Trump and the corporate media
first of all it's not true Donald Trump
had an enormous support from the
corporate media the Fox News is the
most-watched cable news program there's
no other media outlet that is so expects
only and fanatically politicized and the
early term you know others try to be
more or less neutral whether they
succeed or not but Fox didn't even try
apart from that there's the radio system
talk radio just and taken over by the
far-right reaches huge numbers of people
that's and again it's so extreme you can
barely describe it so that's huge media
support Trump had enormous corporate
support plenty of funding his campaign
rent
billion dollars of so enormous media
support and what he was Tati's and he's
a county politician I understood very
well that a good part of the population
is extremely disillusioned angry
frightened it doesn't like what's
happening that this is happening all
over the world incidentally salmon
Europe
it take a look at the attacked as look
at the last Italian election right ever
frankly every European election the
center the main kind of centrist parties
senator left center right of being
virtually destroyed there's anger fear
contempt for institutions looking for
something else and the reasons are not
that obscure starting roughly in 1980
policy general social Anakin up all
assisted towards what's called
neoliberalism which is designed in ways
which lead to sharp concentration of
wealth stagnation or decline for much of
the population so real wages in the
United States are roughly what they were
in the 1960s productivity has increased
but not it's not going to labor it's
going to cau but there is growth but
very few and meanwhile the public
services decline the funk that
government as as wealth concentrates
that means that its power over
government concentrates almost
automatically by many means lobbying all
sorts of ways that are familiar so the
government becomes less and less
responsive to popular interests you find
in effect a decline in functioning
democracy all of these phenomena do lead
to extreme discontent and hatred of
establishment institutions and Trump was
able to capitalize on that pretended
total pretense of course to be working
for the
ordinary common man meanwhile he's
shafting them in every possible way but
gaining their popular support by
catering to their pretty often pretty
legitimate grievances claiming that mean
one that in fact what's actually
happening in the Trump administration
whether by design or by accident is a
kind of a two-tiered program
Trump Kari gets the media to focus on
him the fact that's is basically one
doctor and me you know correct
everything follows from that so he does
one crazy thing after another the media
focused on it they spend time
criticizing it the couple days later
they exposed the lies meanwhile he's on
to something else
all of this appeals to his base
unleashed the picture of the media sort
of picking on the guy who's speaking for
us in while he's doing that and the
media are kind of cooperating by the way
they focused on this while he's doing
that the really savage wing of the
Republican Party and Paul Ryan Mitch
McConnell those guys are ramming through
legislation which is extremely harmful
not only to the general population but
to the world at large and that's kind of
in the corner so the media do not focus
on the major issues in the Trump
administration the most significant one
by far it overwhelms everything else is
the race of the Republican Party towards
destruction of an environment in which
organized human life can survive that's
not a small fact as these are imminent
problems this generation of the next and
the deep problems the the trumpets
kind of astounding that the most
powerful country in world history has
departed openly and publicly from the
international effort to at least try to
do something about the problem beyond
that is racing to try to increase the
destruction and the equally astounding
fact is that this isn't a headline every
day in fact it's pretty it's not just
the United States although the u.s. is
in the lead on the or it takes a the
latest the one Republican achievement
that they're proud of the tax bill said
tunnelled give away to the rich in the
corporate sector it's not going to help
anyone else but if you appeal to the
anger and of course a large part of the
Trump supporters evangelical churches so
you give them whatever they want you no
chance to be politicized a Supreme Court
justice then you can keep the base in
line well meanwhile serving your actual
constituency which is the rich and
corporate power and shafting everyone
else it's a workable program so far he
succeeded I have to give him credit for
it so I did mention Syria Trump did of
course bomb Syria again this year like
he did almost one year to the day prior
and both of those bombings were
predicated on the accusation that Assad
used chemical weapons against quote his
own people do you believe that those gas
attacks took place or that they were
carried out by the Assad regime I think
the weight of evidence suggests that
they were probably carried out and
carried up by the Assad regime but fact
is we don't have a really strong
evidence overwhelming evidence that's if
I had to make a guess I'd say against
that's what
and in fact you could even think of
reasons for but the bombing was a purely
symbolic act first of all they didn't
know it didn't have strong evidence for
secondly it was pretty plainly
coordinated with the Russians so that
there wouldn't be any conflict that they
bound targets that didn't seem of any
significance one of them may have been
in fact a medical facility that and it
was a one-shot affair mainly for the
usual reasons to fire up the base and
some support look as if you're tough
doing something different from Obama
those are the main criteria the matter
with the consequences own a lot of folks
out there have denied that Assad carried
out that attack and that position has
been labeled a conspiracy theory and I
just want to talk with you about the
disturb for a minute because I know that
it's somewhat complicated term because a
lot of things can be labeled a
conspiracy theory there are conspiracies
that are happening by the wealthy and
powerful there are conspiracy theories
that the media itself pushes like the
Russia collusion and then you know there
are insane
conspiracy theories about a reptilian
Illuminati when you hear this term
conspiracy theory are there any
conspiracy theories that you believe
might have been purposely diligent
amazed things that might have actually
happened such as if the assassination of
John F Kennedy
RFK MLK if any of those assassinations
were carried out by the US government
just overall are there any coca-cola
conspiracy theories that you think might
actually be legitimate no the
conspiracies all the time go back to
Adam Smith
an iconic figure he pointed out he wrote
infected a famous book Wealth of Nations
that if you see a few businessmen
talking to each other privately they're
probably engaged in a conspiracy against
the public that's the normal kind of
conspiracy when those in power get
together to try to achieve their gangs
often in secret often sometimes you find
out about it later so that happens all
the time that's normal life the term
conspiracy theory is used to refer to
ideas that the speaker thinks wants to
be legitimate maybe correctly maybe not
correctly but you just have to take a
look at any one of these proposals on
its face and forget the name and ask is
it possible is it pointing to something
is it discovering something well for
instance I think that the most popular
or most widely received conspiracy
theories would be that the US government
took part in the assassinations of JFK
RFK and MLK do you think that any of
those three instances that may actually
be the case
I think it's conceivable and the m/l and
the Martin Luther King case maybe not
the government but some element in the
government might have had a role in that
in the John F Kennedy case it's
extremely unlikely there's a lot of
confusion about this everything about it
I don't take any stand on who killed
John F Kennedy maybe the math
maybe somebody else but I think the
evidence is overwhelming that it was not
a high-level conspiracy with policy
consequences that much we can check by
looking at the evidence what were the
policy positions of Kennedy
how were they changed and the answer is
essentially none a lot of it focuses on
a completely misinterpreted national
security memorandum innocent some 273
which in which Kennedy agreed rather
reluctantly with a proposal from
McNamara that troops should be withdrawn
from Vietnam another year or so but
what's overlooked is that he added after
victory he insisted that it be after
victory it looked at the time as if the
US might have succeeded in its goal of
establishing a client regime in South
Vietnam looked optimistic at the time
and so he said well if that's true okay
then we don't need to reverse any more
but that's not a dovish position shortly
after the assess in fact if he had been
interested in withdrawing there was a
perfect opportunity for it just shortly
before in August 1963 the the government
discovered that the Jim Brothers the
running South Vietnam running the client
state were negotiating with the north to
try to settle on some peaceful
negotiated settlement which would end
the war if Kennedy had been interested
in withdrawing that was a perfect
opportunity
it could have taken credit for it saying
okay we have peace words over let's go
home what did they do they decided to
overthrow the government and install a
super hawkish general that's shortly
before this right at the same time and
until the end he remains one of the more
hawkish parts of the the government and
if you look at the other cases in the
same collapses in the Robert Kennedy
case I think there's questions about
what happened but I don't know of any
evidence that the government might have
been involved the Kane cases and what
different another range of conspiracy
theories has to do with central banking
and how the Federal Reserve for example
was established on Jekyll Island when a
bunch of wealthy bankers met I know that
you and the past's have said that a
central bank is necessary in our current
economic system or current world but it
seems that a lot of monetary there is
trace back most of our social ills to
central banks Tomas Greco for example
has highlighted how tight monetary
policies lead to artificial scarcity and
the cancerous consumptive nature of the
global financial system so shouldn't it
really be in the forefront of a popular
movement to also take on monetary
policies and oppose the current central
banks that we have and maybe create
local currencies like the EF Schumacher
Institute does with Bay Bucs or maybe
even something more radical than that
well if you want to talk about a radical
change in the economic system there's
all sorts of possibilities you could
have
a community based banking systems could
have control of the total financial
system but that means overthrowing
capitalism we're not talking about small
things here if you're going to have
anything like the kind of state
capitalist system that prevails in the
United States Europe to varying degrees
the rest of the world then it just won't
be managed without a central banking
system it's not a conspiracy you know so
what are your thoughts on Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies I mean the the
background system blockchain system is
probably a usable system but I'd be very
surprised if Bitcoin really survives as
a major part of the economy maybe well
it's really been pushed by right-wing
libertarians and this is something else
I'd like to ask you about because you
know that's another group that really
opposes the Federal Reserve I know that
you said that right-wing libertarianism
is essentially barbaric and the leaves
of private concentrations of power but
what I wonder often is in a truly free
society wouldn't there be different
economic systems in different places and
when some people be allowed voluntarily
to have with some wait called
anarcho-capitalism sure if if certain
people for example decide we want to be
slaves I don't think they should be
stopped I don't expect that to happen if
the options are available but I don't I
wouldn't like to see a society in which
the force concentrated force including
military force blocks a group of people
who say we want to be slaves of some
master and if people say we want to rent
ourselves to to somebody which is
temporary slavery as classical liberals
described it I don't think that should
be barred but I think that better
options can be
which people will accept well I did
actually have a question for you from a
right-wing libertarian Walter block I
don't know if you maybe have heard of
his dam before he's involved with the
Mises Institute
he's also the eminent scholar and
endowed chair and professor economics at
Loyola and I just wanted to read you a
question he has again these aren't my
words
shrim they're not very delicate so I
don't mean to be insulting I'm just
reading what you know he says you left
yous favor sexual and other acts between
consenting adults why not also
capitalist acts between consenting
adults like hiring someone for $6 an
hour less than the minimum wage do you
think that's exploitative but if the
worker agrees that's the best
opportunity that he sees for himself
ditto sweatshop labor deado using money
you call yourself an anarchist and yet
would have the government prohibit by
law these things first of all consent is
a very curious notion it's well
understood Oh
all the way back in the tradition of
classical liberalism James mill John
Stuart Mill others that hiring yourself
that renting yourself to someone
essentially is temporary slavery now do
you consent to that well if the choice
is starving yes probably a consent to it
but that's a curious kind of consent you
have to look at the conditions under
which people that make agreements if
there's an enormous disparity of power
between the owner and the person renting
himself and under those conditions to
talk about consent as a joke was like
saying if I if I'm holding a big club
and you're over there and I say I want
you to lie down on the floor and your
choice is either I'll lie down on the
floor about my head smashed by a club
you know you can send it the lie down on
the floor but do we take that seriously
it's also just worth mentioning that dr.
block asked for the opportunity to
debate you he's even so that he would
come here to Arizona I just was
interested would you possibly debate him
if you want
come out here possibly I don't
particularly the concept of debate first
of all is one of the most irrational
inventions that human beings have come
up with just think about what a debate
is the ground rules for a debate or
you're not allowed to change your mind
you're not allowed to say that the
person you're talking to oh that was an
interesting idea of why don't we pursue
it it's just the height of irrationality
I mean I sometimes participate in them
if there's some point to doing it but I
think it's a kind of totally ridiculous
notion and if they take a suppose we
have a graduate seminar and the sciences
is it set up as a debate or do it an
interchange in which people have
proposals and they discuss them and
somebody else has an idea and you think
makes them sense you pursue it and so on
that's what a sane rational interchange
among the grownup human beings should be
not here's my position
there's your position I stick to it no
matter what I mean it's a game if you
like like a football game maybe it's fun
for people to play but it's not a
rational interchange so as I say
sometimes agree to participate well
recognizing that it's the height of
irrationality so I know that you
previously have spoken in favor of gun
control there are other left-wing
theorists who seem to be against it or
at least at times of written against it
for example Kevin Carson with the Center
for stateless society years back he
wrote an article showing that in the
past gun control has often been used by
the ruling elite who controlled
government against the working class for
instance with the Black Panther Party so
shouldn't we oppose the state either
under its current model or even under a
benevolent sort of state socialism
shouldn't we oppose that sort of ruling
elite disarming the working class hey
