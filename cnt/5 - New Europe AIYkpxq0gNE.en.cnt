my question was in that it could be a
bit more vocal and you know that it is
the first time that you came to hug you
and simply what I wanted to ask is what
what you're knowledgeable this century
or generally all the post-communist look
in Europe just join the European Union
and we have been holed by mr. Bush
Europe and such things if you could
react to that not gonna try it tell you
about Hungary audition but from point of
view of famous bush and West Western
Power the attitudes towards the eastern
europe are important and interesting and
I'm sure you're aware of them but you
wouldn't be very aware of them I just
take the concept new Europe that was
that you mentioned it's a very
intriguing concept it reveals very very
dramatically the deep hatred of
democracy on the part of us elites not
just bush but the elite community and
gender the educated you know some
managerial community in general they
despise democracy more than anything
else and for very good reasons I'm in
the way he maintained centralized
control is to make sure that the moment
he doesn't function so if you have act
through the history of the United States
back to its origin there has been a
struggle going on between this starts
right in a constitutional convention in
the 17 8 between the elites who founded
the country and imposed a structure on
it who despise democracy and want to
maintain narrow control by the wealth
and power and popular movements were
trying to create them up
and this is good as a whole of the
history well the Bush administration
happens need the extreme end of a pretty
narrow spectrum but they're at an
extreme end just that every issue and
one of them is there absolutely visceral
hatred of the lockers which is a passion
and it's revealed dramatically in this
sold your new york distinction so if you
take a look at the way old europe was
divided from new Europe but you know I'm
in sorry it from the Bush administration
but then it went all over the journals
and the you know intellectual discourse
and so on and so forth so it does
represent a kind of a general picture on
the probate lead opinion it was a very
sharp criterion distinguished new Europe
from ol you're very sharp I mean it
really takes discipline for Western
intellectuals not to notice it because
then they don't but it takes it's hard
not to notice it because it's a dramatic
the criterion was straightforward what
was called Old Europe none of the bad
evil ones were supposed to dislike and
be angry about so you can't eat french
fries anymore with you freedom fries as
we hate old europe so much old europe
was the countries in which the
government took the same position as the
large majority of the population okay
that was old europe the New York were
the countries where the government
opposed an even larger majority of the
population so if you look at Old Europe
they look at polls New York sustain
Italy Hungary and look pick around take
a look at the poll results the
population was even more opposed to
going to war in Iraq and an older but
the government dis
the population overwhelming majorities
of them and followed orders from
Washington that makes them good so
Berlusconi and odds are and Eastern
Europe are the good hope of the future
because they take workers in fact some
of them are very conscious of it
especially in the old Eastern Europe for
example being the foreign minister of
Latvia it was asked in the American
crest why latvia agreed to support the
war in iraq is another population was
overwhelmingly against it and his answer
could have been given by anyone in the
former communist countries he said we
know that you have to say yes sir and do
what the Americans tell you and help
America that's your job and they know
that from experience that's the way to
react the power you say yes sir thank
you all help you if you accept those
views you're good your new Europe you're
the hope of the future if you on the
other hand that the government takes the
same stand as its own population
terrible you know fact most dramatic
case of all was turkey Turkey to
everyone's surprise mine as well and it
could be fairly well but everyone
surprised the government finally agreed
to go along with ninety-five percent of
the population and USA leagues were
absolutely shocked so infuriated they
were immediately told by Colin Powell
great modern that they'd be punished for
this Paul Wolfowitz who's depicted as
they call me idealist in chief and great
visionary was leading the crusade for
democracy he went so far as had
condemned the Turkish military because
they didn't overrule
an overthrow the government and he told
them they had to apologize to the United
States literally and say that they will
understand that their job is to help
America then they'll be real Democrats
that all of this passed without any
comment no as if it's perfectly natural
and it is perfectly natural for a lead
opinion which simply despises and fears
the mockers with a real passion I'm it
rarely shows up that clearly
interestingly that's understood outside
of Western lately intellectuals I don't
know about Hungary but it certainly is
in other places and forgot Lear act it's
quite dramatic to see the attitude
stories about this question in Iraq and
in the West what by the West I mean
mostly the United States and England
that's right follow the Christmas
closely and commentary so the standard
line like a hundred percent of
commentary close to it in the United
States and England is that they invaded
Iraq to bring democracy to Iraq and the
Middle East the world there are critics
but if you look at the critics with a
what they say is it's a wonderful noble
generous effort but it's beyond the
reach of the people don't deserve it or
something to work or something like that
but to find somebody get a group of very
hard to find any questions what's the
evidence for it well the evidence for it
is our leader announced it and that
proves once the dear leader has
announced that our mission is to sub
Knoxville his messianic mission to bring
democracy once he's announced it it
becomes true if you're deeply committed
to pellet area so deeply committed
in question totalitarian beliefs that's
enough evidence to make it true well
that's essentially the entire Anglo
American intellectual class you really
have to look hard to find an exception
and nobody sees anything odd about it
which is kind of sure is because you
first of all if you accept this view you
also have to accept the view that bush
and Blair are among the most
accomplished liars and history because
when they tried to organize the
countries to go to war that wasn't the
source the story was we have to go to
war to defend themselves from weapons of
mass destruction and terror and so on
but after all that collapse it turns out
that the real reason we went was because
our messianic vision and if you are well
disciplined intellectual you went to the
best universities like Oxford and
Harvard and so on that's just built into
you you just accept reflexively what the
leaders say even if you have to overlook
the fact that they're saying we were
lying before so in the West that's like
close to one hundred percent including
the critics now there aren't polls in
Iraq now though s is constantly carrying
our poles in Iraq to try to figure out
how to deal with the population right
after President Bush made his speech in
which he declared his messianic vision
debris applause now there was a poll in
Baghdad in which people were asked why
do you think the United States invaded
and the sum agreed with unanimous
opinion in the West one percent one
percent of people in Baghdad said this
purpose was to bring democracy five
percent said the purpose was to help
Iraqis the rest said was completely
obvious but unexpressible in the West
the goal was to take control of your
actions
base for reorganizing the Earth's and
American interests which is obviously
true but you simply can't say that in
the West that's just unspeakable so
that's the difference between people of
different ends of the cloth that's very
common I mean victims and people who
hold a club at a different picture of
the world on just about everything and
it goes way back if you want to learn
something about reality you don't ask
the people holding the clothes you know
you're honest the policemen in the
electoral and so on you ask the people
who the Dickens they generally have a
much clearer picture of it this is true
of international society it's through
the smallest social minutes I mean takes
a family and if this patriarchal family
and you want to figure out what's going
on you always the husband yes the wife
they're going to great different
pictures of what's going on and one was
real you know the others the way it
looks if you've got the club in your
hand and that's true on this tube so the
older of New York is extremely
interesting but what it tells you about
the Western intellectual culture is very
revealing actually there's more behind
it than that as usual there's some
geopolitical reality behind it if you
look at what's called old you er you
know the bad ones that's primarily
Germany France well Germany and France
are the heartland of Europe and that's
the commercial industrial financial
heartland of your new Europe the good
guys is the periphery Spain Italy Latvia
Hungary I mean fringes well and the
hatred of Old Europe has much deeper
roots than just hatred of democracy it
goes way back to the
end of the Second World War I after the
Second World War the United States was a
first in a position that run the world
there was no question about that but
they recognized their potential problems
and one of the potential problems is
Europe Europe might Europe might go off
in its own direction it's not a law of
nature that your episode just the
clients of the United States in the
early post-war period it was clear and
it was most of confidence but it was not
a recover there's no doubt about that
france and germany were going to recover
and the rest of europe would slowly
recover become a major industrial and
commercial society again and of course
it happened and from right away the
early 1950s there were concerns that
europe might become what was then called
a third force independent of the united
states and russia and that the main
reason for the formation native and the
reason why NATO remains today when
there's no no no we can pretend there's
a Russian threat is that the NATO is a
mechanism by which the United States
maintains control over Europe as long as
the native framework functions the
United States will Donnie because in not
an economic power or cultural power or
anything but in military forced the
United States so overwhelmingly dines
the world delivers you close so if
anything ever shifts to the military
arena the United States will run it
that's one of the reasons why the United
States constantly tries to drive
policies towards military confrontation
that's the dimension in which the US
Supreme well no that's not an England
goes along sort of a client state but
Europe is very capable of moving off in
an independent
part of the reason why the United States
has been so eager to have the European
community and they extend to the former
satellites is it assumes that they will
be more under us control so the
assumption is that in Eastern Europe
blending their more illusions about the
United States having been under Soviet
domination creates illusions about the
alternative if you live in Central
America even have any illusions about
the United States but if you live in
Hungary you might have you would
evolution and it's assumed those
illusions will carry over and also that
they'll be like the foreign minister of
lactic they'll know that your job is to
say yes sir we have to help the
Americans and that it's hoped will we
can they that likelihood that a unified
Europe might simply move off at its own
direction and become an independent
force in world affairs which is one of
the major problems of world control act
it's one of the major reasons why the
United States is in the middle controls
once make sure that controls Middle East
energy then understood back since the
1940s that the main energy resources of
the world are in the Persian Gulf region
and by now expected that about
two-thirds and the next three decades
will be in the region of the Persian
Gulf and whoever controls as energy
resources has a very powerful lever for
controlling others the back to the early
nineteen fifties us planners understood
that control of Middle East oil with the
what they call veto power over move sort
independence in the Europe and at that
point they were thinking about Japan and
that's why there's such a struggle going
on right now about who controls the oil
resources and who decides where the
pipelines are going to go from Central
Asia to somewhere on the United States
wants to make sure the Central Asia is
not on a scale of the Middle East but
it's fairly substantial and there's a
big battle about whether the pipelines
are going to go to the east you know to
China and Japan and South Korea this
major industrial center there or are
they going to go to the west and if they
go to the west the United States wants
to make sure that they don't go through
Russia or Russia controlled areas and
they don't go through Iran but they go
on some complicated route which ends up
being under us control all the way
ending up right and albanian that but
part of the reason for controlling
Kosovo is to make sure that you end up
with the pipelines staying under control
you know if you look at the pipeline's
their planned they go in a very strange
route but ending up in regions that are
always under us control and that's
important if you want to control the
world and part of the concern about
so-called old europe is that it is the
center of a potential in europe which
may be tolerated
