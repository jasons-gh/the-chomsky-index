thank you very much for being with us
myself here everyone Ahlan wa sahlan on
behalf of the bookshop and the free
dashi part ship down here in Jerusalem
we are all most welcome
whether you are among those who are with
us on zoom' or the few hundreds who are
watching us live on Facebook or perhaps
you are watching this on replay you are
almost welcome we have a few people here
in the bookshop as well this virtual
place that we have normalized somehow
but I hope soon that we will be able to
will come and greet and meet you in
person here in the bookshop but for now
we are honored to bring you a very
special guest someone who would like
maybe will take me a very long time to
comprehensively introduced therefore I
shall not I'm honored to be chairing
today's event with the godfather of
linguistics and one of the best-known
contemporary political minds professor
Noam Chomsky is a key educational
resource on a variety of topics and I
have certainly learned a lot from his
writings and his books I'm continuing to
learn we wish him a very long life and
more books to write he have wrote
already more than 100 books so there
always one more book to read for Chomsky
and we are planning to hear the bookshop
which you are all invited to come and
pick some but before starting I would
like to invite Hannes Alban here on my
left who's been the director of the
finishing for Steve Tom if office here
in Palestine he's our key partner for
today's event and help us to make this
happens I'll ask Hanna's to say a few
words and then we were starts and it's
peace Thank You Mahmoud a very warm
welcome from my site on behalf of the
turkey but shift on did he budget of
tone for all of those who are not
familiar with it yet is a German
political foundation that has its roots
in the global workers movement and that
is working to foster the values of
social democracy the fight for equality
freedom and justice is a global one and
we're actually spread out throughout the
world with offices in more
under countries in the world and also an
office in Israel proper and one in
issues one that is the one that I'm
directing and so represented in
Palestine working in the West Bank and
East Jerusalem and also in Gaza which
sometimes proves difficult but
nonetheless we're committed to a
peaceful solution for everyone to live
in peace and security between the Jordan
and the Mediterranean and in this spirit
I don't want to take too much of your
time and I'm looking very much forward
to tonight's event I'm sure our
questions
to Professor Trump he won't rest solely
on the Palestine issue but I think
current events in the US will force us
to also talk about that a little bit I'm
very much looking forward to this
interesting talk tonight and move it's
your turn
all right
thanks hon it's for that and please keep
your questions coming whether on the
chat on zoom' or on the different
platforms on either facebook we are have
an exceptional team here that's going
through the questions and we'll filter
them through to us we will put them on
to Chomsky before any further delay
frost or Chomsky you have signed on
yourself with the Palestinians for
decades you are one of the first
defenders of policy on human rights we
are a Jewish Socialist that probably
came here in the sticks is if I if I
mean mistaken we continued your visit
sense then after you visit during the
First Intifada you wrote your milestone
book fateful triangle and in 2010 you
were denied entry by Israel I think or
in airports I believe you were coming
here to deliver a keynote speak speech
in State University that's a quite a
complicated relationship with this place
but I would like you to define that
relationship to this part of the world
I don't wanna bore you goes back at
least 85 years so I'll just get you as a
child young child my family was very
much immersed in the revival of Hebrew
my father was a Hebrew scholar
my mother was a Hebrew teacher the two
of them essentially ran the Hebrew
educational program in the city of
Philadelphia where we lived so it was
immersed in it from childhood they were
basically the cultural Zionist followers
of the haedong fact by the time I was
seven or eight years old I was reading
the hot arms essays my father and got
involved in non-state cultural Zionism
by the time I was a teenager 15 16 I
became much more politically involved
but I was drawn to groups that were
committed to by nationalist socialist
Palestine this is proof this is early
40s mid 40s the I was pretty close to a
show merits a year I could never join
them they were split between Stalinists
and Trotskyites I was much involved in
they left what Lenin called the
ultra-left criticisms of as
critics of Bolshevism from the left so I
really could never join us on merits of
year but I was kind of close to them
after the state was established I
thought it was a big mistake but after
that Israel's just state like any other
state I actually went to Israel in 1953
I lived for a while on a my palm kyboots
because our there might have stayed
thought about it came back but anyway
stayed very much involved by the
the late fifties early sixties other
issues were taking over for my political
active life the civil rights movement
the anti-war movement 1967 I became very
much involved again in Israel Palestine
and I my own I started writing speaking
the I should say that speaking was not a
simple matter from the late sixties
until about 2006 it was almost
impossible to give a talk on Israel
Palestine without large-scale disruption
I had to have police protection even at
my own University that meetings were
broken up a lot of disruption
Furion anger just were allowed to talk
about this topic but we can those were
interested continued did a lot of
writing from roughly 67 to 75 was
writing and speaking about an option
that I thought was available at the time
some kind of federal arrangement inside
the former Palestine leading to a
bi-national state which might perhaps
move further into further integration in
fact with the whole region I should say
that when I was living in in the kibbutz
in 53 I was once hiking in the northern
Galilee and in one evening and a jeep
came by and a road behind me and the man
in the Jeep started yelling at me and he
said come back here you're in Lebanon
there were no borders so I just rated
the Lebanon my first visit to Livan then
came back now of course it's bristling
with armaments but it gives a sense of
what the region could be should be an
integrated system basically borderless
from 6775
I thought those were alkanes
by the mid-seventies Palestinian
nationalism has become a main eight
major issue the only option from that
point on was the two state settlement
that became an international consensus
very quickly unfortunately in the mid
seventies Israel made a fateful decision
which has determined everything that's
happened since I was the Labour Party at
the time they decided to choose
expansion over security there were very
definite clear options for a political
settlement by the mid seventies the our
concentrated confrontation states were
forward Syria Jordan Egypt supported a
UN Security Council resolution in
January 1976
calling for the establishment of two
states on the internationally recognized
border with guarantees for the rightness
of each state to exist in peace and
security within secure and recognized
borders was one of a number of such
initiatives Israel was furious refused
to attend the session Prime Minister
Rabine said there will never be a
Palestinian state not discussing the
Israeli ambassador Chimera Tugg claimed
of course falsely that the initiative
was initiated by the PLO to destroy
Israel the United States vetoed the
resolution from that point on the things
went to this I won't go through the rest
of the history but my own commitments
were for a terse state settlement as a
stepping-stone I hoped for something
further that goes on to the present lots
of issues I should say in connection
with this band visit to Palestine so
this true story is a little bit
different than the one that Israel
promulgated after it became an
international
incident I was invited by beers aid
where I had spoken before what are all
previous occasions I had gone to beers
aid from Israel and that was tolerating
this time I was coming from Jordan with
my daughter that we were stopped at the
border interrogated for several hours
Israel later claimed that it was a
border guard who made a mistake that was
not true
the border guard was on the telephone
all the time with the ministry in Tel
Aviv they were feeding him the questions
the questions were we if you've ever
been interrogated as a standard form a
lot of irrelevant questions get you off
the topic and the question they were
interested in keeps getting repeated
every once in a while and the question
they were interested in is why aren't
you visiting Israel if I had agreed to
go to Israel they would have let me in
then I could have gone to bears a but
they did not want there's a to have the
option of inviting their own lecturers
that was the issue so I would have been
sent back to Jordan gave the talk bears
aid over
al-jazeera instead of being small
seminar at a global audience when I am a
big issue but that but I've had number
of visits to Lebanon since and if did
make it together once in between two
bombings
if talks they are met people there but
that's that's been pretty much the story
it's enough to give you a rough idea
well on behalf of the Palestinian
professor Chomsky would like to always
welcome you unfortunately we don't have
the keys to our own gates but one day we
will and you will be invited and you
will be will come hopefully some time
soon
this is all very interesting and I'm
going to come back and pick on some of
your answers but if I may just
kind of go a little bit global and asked
you about the state of the United States
today we have a president that's kind of
running for election I guess in a few
months what the chances what's you see
how his chances of free winning and you
reading into the current grassroot
movement black lives matter and the way
it's perhaps as America is changing or
does it justice another small page in
the history of oppression against people
of color in the United States well
they're very important things happening
in the United States I'll come back to
Palestine in a moment but take the
current demonstrations they're very
different than anything that's happened
before other have been police killings
and police atrocities against Blacks
demonstrations but they were localized
also the closest one that this was in
1991 and Los Angeles black man Rodney
King was correctly beaten to death there
were six days of riots sixty people were
killed and federal troops were brought
in to quilladin but it was localized to
Los Angeles this is totally different
it's all over the country but most of
the protesters are white intermingled
with black there's never been anything
like this before well it's even getting
the protests are even being I mean the
the president who is a vicious racist is
trying to fan no conflict and cold for
what he called for his domination by
vicious dogs and ominous weapons that he
was very interestingly he was
reprimanded by the top by a lot of the
top military command they forced him to
withdraw troops from Washington the
former chairs of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff not only harshly condemn knew what
he was saying but it expressed support
and sympathy for the protest
and for the black population that
suffering all of this is totally new
unprecedented that we don't know where
it's gonna lead to talk about the
possibilities but turning to Palestine
in Israel that have also been major
changes ever since about 15 years ago
affecting in pretty much time it to
Operation Cast Lead which led to a very
significant reaction in the United
States
I mentioned that I used to have police
protection but talks
not since gastly changed everything and
now the audience is huge audiences
they're supportive of an interesting
concern it's part of a great shift of
opinion that shows up in polls and shows
up another act and other actions but by
now that that from the early days up
till then the main support for Israel
which was often passionate was in
liberal America that was the basic
support now the support is in the most
reactionary sectors of America
ultra-nationalists Christian
evangelicals no right-wing Republican
Party that's the support the Liberal
Democrats now are have shifted that when
they're asked in polls about attitudes
towards Israel and Palestine there's
more sympathy for Palestinians and for
Israel that's particularly true among
young people including young Jews
incidentally there's an enormous shift
of opinion it's had no effect yet on
policy policies so far to the right you
can't you need a telescope to see it but
there's a growing split between policy
both the president of course is
unspeakable but even Congress League
split between them and public opinion
that offers opportunities to talk about
it later but I think that the
real opportunities there for a
longer-term shift in US policy which
would have an enormous impact on the
region because of us power couldn't talk
about that later if you like but is not
that very perhaps too late on his reign
Palestine I mean now that we are and I
want to drag you to that question of one
state to state or versus any other
solutions you may want to discuss but
isn't that that change in international
public opinion towards Palestine Israel
is kind of late when Israel is actually
kind of eating the complete cake I think
we should be realistic about the options
the true the options today there are
only two options today not one state one
state is not an option first of all
Israel would never accept it there's a
small group of ultra-right cultural
religious extremists who say oh let's
take everything but the large majority
in Israel will not agree to see Israel
go out of existence which is what the
one state means they're not willing to
accept them there is no supports word in
the world not in the men in the Western
countries not in the third world African
countries for example are very jealous
about issues of sovereignty for good
reasons they're not going to support
seeing this a state member of the United
Nations go out of existence
so supports where it is zero we can put
it aside there are two options one of
them is two states the other is greater
Israel since 1970 roughly Israel has
been engaged in a bipartisan program
labor we could the two coalition's to
create a greater Israel by taste slowly
taking over step-by-step dunamis our
dunno
the old terminology since the 1920s
slowly taking over every part of the
West Bank that is of any value to Israel
that's going to exclude the major
population centers they don't want to
take over numbers the point is you know
this is what they call the demographic
problem too many non-jews in a Jewish
state can't have that
so we'll take over everything that's a
value the Jordan Valley Mall elder meme
Arielle the court could do meme the
corridors leading to them break avoid
the major Palestinian population centers
the rest of the region that are Israel
is of course all integrated into Israel
with the extensive infrastructure
projects you know all about it or talk
about it the Palestinians were left in
the Israeli controlled areas are divided
into I know almost 200 small enclaves no
people separated from their fields their
love grows and so on by checkpoints the
idea is to make life unlivable and maybe
they'll leave at least the more educated
and leave as in every neo-colonial
society in central Africa anywhere else
now something has to be left for the
elites that's called Ramallah so if you
live in Ramallah Palestine any leads go
to the theater go to nice restaurants
that's standard neo-colonial practice
but the rest will be taken as being
integrated into Israel Greater Israel
the present with what's called
Presidents Trump's greatest deal of the
century was essentially written when
Netanyahu handed to Jared Kushner to
present to the world it's essentially an
endorsement of the greater Israel
project that is
developing before arise since the 1970s
that was the reason why Israel in the
1970s rejected every possibility for
peace because they wanted to expand to
develop in fact in the 1970s he was even
more they wanted to develop the Sinai
that was harbors colony protocols drive
out the better ones it's destroyed the
town destroy the cemeteries build Juba
team build a whole Jewish city you meet
on the Mediterranean so the time was
saying I like y'all meet means warm
Israel didn't believe it they didn't
take Egypt seriously Kissinger didn't
take them seriously they thought it was
a basket case that led to the 1973 war
clothes thing for Israel after that they
realized they can't just assume Arizona
exists then started a period of
variations fighting led to Camp David
Israel agreed to abandon the Sinai but
at the same time to expand settlement in
the West Bank and then jazzing at that
time cuz that's the policy that's been
going on since essentially 1970 and that
is the alternative to two states there
was no other realistic alternative on
the horizon and I think we should be
realistic enough to recognize that these
are the choices okay III will follow
your being realistic advice do you think
the Arab world any country in the
current Middle East is has a capability
little leverage to actually stop the
proposed annexation next month I mean
we're hearing a lot of high-tops from
Jordan a little bit from Egypt but you
think they can't set up our in at least
come to our system let's be a little
more realistic the Arab states the the
leadership of the Arab states has
essentially no interest in the
Palestinians they're forced to show
interest because of their populations
you can't maintain your position as the
leader of one of the reactionary Arab
states not Jordan but Egypt Saudi Arabia
and the Emirates you have to pretend to
be supportive of the Palestinians
otherwise you'll be thrown out
rebellion because of the populations but
in fact they've been forging tacit
relations with Israel for a long time
now it's pretty much coming out into the
open but it's been tested for quite a
while in fact u.s. strategists back to
the early 1970s the internal documents
now regarded the u.s. position in the
Middle East as based on three pillars
the main one was Saudi Arabia Israel the
West the United States like Britain
before it has always been strongly
supportive of Islamic extremism as in
opposition to secular nationalism
so what a lot of what the 70 67 war was
about they don't say it I can't say it
but it's obvious and it's in the
internal documents so one in Saudi
Arabia center of Islamic radicalism the
second is Iran which was then under the
Shah so it was under US control and the
third is Israel Israel had very close
relations with Iran under the Shah
technically they were war but in fact
they had quite close relations which
came out into the open very clearly when
the Shah was overturned meanwhile the
relations with the reactionary Arab
states the Gulf dictatorships Egypt then
they're dictatorships has become closer
so Palestinians are not going to get
support from that quarter what can
change is the United States it's kind of
hard for us to believe if you look at
formal policy but if you look at what's
going on in the United States there are
opportunities for change which
unfortunately are not being exploited
but can be that's where I think for long
term hope for Palestinians lies doesn't
look like it on the surface but I think
a lot of things are changing you can see
it on the ground all the time I mean as
I say I've been intensively involved in
this for 50 years now and then the
changes are very striking I'm gonna ask
you I'm gonna push you further and ask
you to elaborate on this because it
seems like for Palestinians is gonna be
sad news coming from the Arab world I
don't know about Europe maybe you can
comment a few things about Europe we
have questions here about Israeli
society what the internet Israeli
society who a little bit sane and like
to help what they can do but maybe you
could elaborate a little bit more about
the hope that we we looking for from the
US especially as we moving corporate 19
and there's a lot of challenges coming
up for the United States economically
and politically locally well let me talk
about some opportunities import lost
opportunities but they're still there in
1997 URI of Neri and his go shalom group
initiated a campaign for boycott and
divestment 1997 talk about sanctions we
can forget there's no sanctions so
initiated a call for boycott and
divestment it was focused on the
occupied territories that made a lot of
sense got support a lot of support the
Presbyterian Church one of the main
churches in the United States is
committed to a boycott divestment
program not just aimed at the
territories but also in that us-based
molten
Nationals that are involved in the
directories that could be a very
successful movement unfortunately it was
preempted by the BDS movement which in
part is committed to protests about the
occupation which makes good sense but
has other planks which are
self-destructive and has shifted
attention away from Palestinians to
other issues this is self-destructive
tactics if one of the planks in your
program is saying we have to boycott
Israel until all the refugees return
you're going to get nowhere that's not a
policy that's simply an opening for a
counter-attack saying you're just any
Semitic you want to destroy Israel then
we get laws and you go off into
discussion of whether the laws are valid
everyone forgets about the Palestinians
now if you call for say academic
boycotts of Tel Aviv University Hebrew
University you can make a case for that
but if you think politically what's the
reaction going to be the reaction is
going to be why not boycott Harvard
Chicago Columbia and MIT they're
involved in much worse of Trustees then
you get off in a discussion about
academic freedom you've forgotten about
the Palestinians this is not sensible
tactics if the protests are focused on
the occupation can get plenty of support
in the United States US policy on Israel
Palestine is very fragile it survives
because it's not exposed you've noticed
I'm sure that the United States does not
recognize that Israel has nuclear
weapons of course they know it but they
don't recognize it why because if they
recognize that
Israel has nuclear weapons US law comes
into play which bans military or
economic aid to countries that have
developed nuclear weapons outside the
framework of the non-proliferation
treaty that's why it's kept secret
suppose you make it public plenty of the
population across the board doesn't see
why should we should be sending arms and
giving economic aid to other countries
now why should be giving aid to
countries that are violating US law
there's another law called the Leahy law
patric laid which bans u.s. military aid
to any military organization or unit
which is engaged in systematic human
rights abuses
that's the IDF of course it's engaged in
systematic human rights abuses don't
have to go through it up to the sky so
the Leahy law could be imposed to ban
military and economic aid even a threat
of this would have a big difference and
the threat can be made supported by a
large part of public opinion for
whatever reason maybe not the reasons
we'd like but for whatever reason
there's plenty of support for
Palestinians that's latent it's not
being organized it's being sidetracked
but I think these are possibilities that
could be exploited and could lead to a
change in US policy we can see this
beginning to happen now the Sanders
movement was an enormous success
tremendous success and it's the first
time in over a hundred years that a
political organization reached the
center of focus coming very close to
winning a nomination maybe an election
without any support from private wealth
corporate power the media
none but it made it that's a break from
a hundred years of American political
tradition that a young activists managed
to sweep into covers on the Sanders wave
others especially among young people
Norma's portrait us didn't win the
nomination came very close but part of
this is an opening for a shift in policy
on israel-palestine it's coming very
close to the taking over the Democratic
Party not the establishment general the
Democrats there in the old position of
total support for Israeli expansionism
but they're having a fragile hold over
the constituency now that can lead the
changes as it has done in the presence
of the u.s. is a very different country
from what it was 60 years ago and the
reason is popular recognition if you'd
look back and think of what it was like
then in the 1960s the US had
anti-miscegenation laws that were so
extreme that the Nazis refused to adopt
them because they went too far literally
the US had federal laws in the United
States van blacks from public housing in
the 1960s in the United States women
were not legally regarded as equals
which still old British common law
basically property that changed until
didn't change till 1975 now they were
anti sodomy laws there was no s--
almost no support for the Vietnam
anti-war movement till the late sixties
violent opposition even among the
Liberals when Martin Luther King 1967
came out in criticism of the Vietnam War
it was destroyed by liberal opinion
didn't want anything to do with him
anymore well that was the 1960s
radically different today and it didn't
come as a gift from both came from
constant activism on the ground which
changed things that can happen again
it's a possibility doesn't look like it
when you look at government programs but
if you look at the gap between
government programs and popular
sentiment you can see that there are
opportunities what the probabilities are
you can't say you can never say but
there definitely are opportunities but
Chomsky if the pressure going to come
from outside on Israel within that in
effect mobilize Israeli society more to
the right around the right-wing
government anywhere and they will see
that the whole world is against us and
the whole anti-semitism and the you know
everyone's hate us and they want to kill
us and it goes against us the whole
Israeli what is left from the left I
guess what is that left for them to do I
guess well Israel's moved very far it to
the right now the two major political
groupings in Israel are both far-right
groupings and one of them Kaholo Vaughn
is called centrist but doesn't mean
anything it's far-right political
grouping there are shreds of the left
remaining they're not gone they're still
there but very small Lord I think a
large part of that is because the left
former left got no support from the
United States the United States is an
enormous leap our powerful country you
mentioned that the Palestine Israel
Journal had a issue on the greatest deal
of the century why does anybody even pay
attention to it
first China had come out with a proposal
like that or Germany or France or
anybody now people would have just left
a favor even bother to look at it but
when the United States comes out with it
it's law no matter how ridiculous it is
everyone has to take that that's the
basis for discussion that's what it
means to be the the Mafia dawn the chief
of the the Godfather the chief of the
global order has a lot of impact
everywhere as long as the Israeli left
got almost no support from the United
States they withered away if there is
support from the United States I think
that the situation in Israel could
change furthermore Israel's decision
labor Labor's decision back in the 70s
to choose expansion over security
compelled Israel to rely on the United
States for survival that was one of the
predictable predicted consequences we
see it happen you don't want
negotiations you know a political
settlement reject everything you're
gonna have to rely on an external force
for survival when the United States was
supporting now when the United States
gives an order to Israel it always no
matter how much it doesn't like to in
fact President Obama was the first u.s.
president not to order Israel to do
something it didn't want to do Reagan
did it
Clinton did it first book second Bush
did it both bushes in fact and Israel
obeyed no matter how much didn't like it
these were quite important issues
incidentally Obama didn't he let Israel
do anything you wanted but if the United
States gives an order or even a hint of
an order Israel has to comply and if
Israel if the United States begins to
move in any of the directions I describe
situation in Israel will change almost
almost automatically and I think there
will become
openings for the lift isn't the
situation Israel is very frightening
it's one of the very few countries in
the world where young people are more
reactionary than older people when you
look at polls in Israel that older
people still have some memories of when
Israel was a kind of social democratic
society the younger ones don't know that
for them it's just the rule of force and
violence that's what they know and
they've moved very far to the right
that's unusually hard to find other
countries like that and that has to be
changed it's very important for that to
change well just on following on this do
you think that in the slight chance of
Biden winning the office I don't know if
it is a slight chance anyway you could
comment about that but do you think we
could see real change on Israel
Palestine politics are we gonna go back
to back to business as usual like with
the Obama and the pushes well button
buttons are kind of any empty vessel I
don't think he has much in the way of
ideology or strategic thinking he wants
to be President destroyed many times
failed before now he's trying he's the
pressure from below activist pressure
has shifted his positions spoken
positions very far to the left where it
is the democratic party program his
program no farther to the left than
anything since Franklin Delano Roosevelt
not because he wants it but because
they're being pressed in that direction
by their constituency the founders
movement others in fact even the people
who that if you look at the democratic
party primaries you look closely Biden
won the primaries but the reason was
Sanders lost to major sectors
african-americans and women now when you
look at their opinions they say they
support Sanders his program but they
voted for Biden because they didn't
think that Sanders couldn't put together
a large enough coalition to defeat Trump
which is of course the highest priority
in fact the highest priority for the
world four more years of Trump would be
a disaster for the entire world talk
about that
so they preferred Sanders his program
but they voted for Biden so the Sanders
movement is now working within the
Democratic Party to press them further
activists on the ground can be doing the
same thing where that will go
we can't say I think it could press
Biden's
the Biden presidents that if he wins the
farther towards a progressive direction
on israel-palestine and many other
issues
I'm the country split the part of it is
very reactionary and racist no almost
totally concentrated in the Republican
Party which has ceased but Republican
Party used to be a normal political
party in the pit back in the 1960s I
could vote for a Republican a
congressional representative for example
in the last 10 or 15 years that's
totally changed
it's drifted completely off the sweater
it's not a political party in any normal
sense that when you look at comparative
studies of political parties in the
international spectrum the Republican
Party is ranked alongside the European
parties with neo-fascist roots the
National Front they
they're totally in president Trump's
pocket if any Republican dares to step
on them to depart from his royal Majesty
they get crushed you just saw this a
couple of days ago when one Republican
caucus senator Lisa Murkowski said that
she was in doubt about some of trumps
positions he immediately came down like
a ton of bricks like a petty dictator in
some third world dictatorship no one is
allowed to deport one inch from my order
and not a single Republican raised their
voice this is not a political party
anymore but they can change back to what
they once were the moderate Republicans
are in the past were no different than
Clinton Democrats so because the
Democrats shifted the right to but
there's a lot of turmoil inside the
United States so much sermon well there
might even be a civil war it's not out
of the question the respectable figures
know former one political analyst who's
a longtime mix CIA analyst very
respected Robert Baer that recently said
that if he were a foreign intelligence
agents looking at the United States he
would be anticipating a possible civil
war that's what the situation is looking
like countries in turmoil breaking apart
Trump's reaction to the pandemic has
killed tens of thousands of Americans
and plenty of people are upset about it
well they know what to do but they're
upset they're upset about racism to an
extent that's never been true in the
past there's they should be like I said
upset
unfortunately nobody's talking about it
but the worst of Trump's crimes by far
or his climate policies
he's racing towards the abyss of
destruction of organized human life it's
not a joke it's not it's not an
exaggeration people are paying attention
know about this but he's dismantling the
arms control regime which has saved us
even a some protection for from terminal
nuclear war tearing to shreds disposing
enormous dangers to the whole world
forced to the United States there are
people who understand it then it's
coming to a head it wouldn't be a
terrible surprise as I say respectable
people are talking about it if Trump if
he loses the election if he just refuses
to leave the White House it's not an
impossibility
I mean he's turning the United States
into a tin-pot dictatorship of the
Central American variety the people say
he's a lot of charges that he's moving
towards fascism even academic
specialists on fascism saying that I
don't think that's correct
it gives him much too much credit the
fascism isn't much too sophisticated in
ideology for Trump to grasp he has no
such ideology his ideology is very
simple me me me me nothing else
now that ideology has corollaries he's a
good politician he knows that the people
who really owned and run the country the
corporate sector the very wealthy
they'll tolerate his antics as long as
He pours dollars into their pocket so if
you look at his legislative programs
it's entirely without exception devoted
to enriching the very rich and enhancing
corporate power he understands he has to
do that then they'll let him play his
games he austin esta appeals to some
sort of a voting base
he can't come to people and say and I'm
trying to destroy you vote for me can't
say that so you have to say I'm your
savior I'm the chosen one
like we sent by God that appeals to the
evangelical Christians about 25% of the
population I'm gonna bring your jobs
back while I'm destroying you I'm gonna
save your guns I'm gonna ensure that the
white race rules forever
that's the constituency he's trying to
hold together it's tearing up the
country it's in a very strange situation
Robert there's intelligence analysis is
not out of the question
now for blood pressure and health
reasons just a swing away from the US
and look at other places you know we
have perhaps maybe emerging new powers
in the world of course we have the you
lots of money in this part of the world
and the two state project and the
prospect for peace in Palestine in
Israel and perhaps could they lead in
any way form do you think they had the
credential the potential to lead the
free world now within after the collapse
and the obvious collapse of the of the
u.s. morality that's one but at least in
the annexation question I want to go
back to it because it is it is what's on
everyone's mind now do you think that
you has the power or any power in in
stopping Israel from annexing parts of
the West Bank in especially the day you
had signals that they all might use some
sanctions against Israel in that the
United States doesn't even have to
impose sanctions you can just say it
in 2005 Israel was that Israel has a
this economy is based much very much on
military industry it needs markets the
huge market is China Israel has been
dying to get into the Chinese market in
2005 they made a strong effort
send descendant the Dukes and advanced
military equipment to China the George W
Bush said sorry you can't do that
I want a formal apology and writing for
your daring to do that
hi military officials are not allowed to
come the Izzard the United States unless
you do it
Israel back down instantly same thing
that happened in 2000 with Clinton the
same thing with George Bush when he said
you know my phone number if you want to
call me and they back down same happen
with Ronald Reagan I go back to 1982
Menachem Bagan was desperate to break
into West Beirut and to capture our
thoughts as he said it's in his mind it
was Hitler and his bunker he was
desperate to do that Reagan said sorry
you can't get out they got out Israel is
a small country the United States runs
the world Israel has decided on policies
which make it totally dependent on the
United States the United States gives
orders they follow them they don't have
any choice doesn't require sanctions
just as in the past it just requires a
word saying this is the law okay if you
notice States was in the hands of a
government that wanted the block
annexation it would simply say no
annexation that would end it now there's
a lot of talk about American decline and
some respects that's true
in respect and approval around the world
America's declining but America is the
most frightening country in the world
and when it gives an order it's followed
we saw it on the greatest deal of the
century the United States came out with
a ridiculous proposal everyone accepts
it we
on many other things that icky rent
President Trump as you know that
dismantled the Iran treaty which was
working very effectively US intelligence
agreed everyone agreed and imposed harsh
thanked harsher sanctions on Iran
Europe doesn't like it they want the
treaty to persist they oppose the
sanctions do they do anything about it
no they obey they obey the sanctions you
can't step on the toes of the most
dangerous country in the world
so you obey and that's also true of
Israel of course Europe can't stand up
against the US Israel's not going to you
know it's not nice to say but that's the
reality of the world international
affairs international affairs scholars
don't tell you this but if you look at
the world international affairs runs
very much like the Mafia there's a
godfather he gives the orders others can
say they don't like it but they pretty
much obey and if a small grocers drugs
grocery store somewhere says I'm not
gonna pay protection money doesn't mean
anything to the Godfather he wouldn't
even notice it but he sends in his goons
to smash it to pieces because he can't
let people get away with it there's a
name for that in international affairs
it's called the domino theory if any
country no matter how small makes a move
in the wrong direction you smash it it
takes a Cuba which has been under harsh
US sanctions for 60 years the terrorist
attacks and so on what's Cuba's crime
we know from internal records from the
early 60s
Cuba's crime is I'm quoting into the CIA
internal records successful defiance of
US policy going back to the Monroe
Doctrine
which said that we will dominate the
hemisphere you can't accept successful
defiance the Mafia Don understands that
if the grocery store doesn't pay
protection money maybe somebody else
won't so you have to stamp it out at the
root that's one of the leading
principles of world affairs and that
u.s. power remains intact that is
overwhelming nobody comes even close no
other country in the world can impose
sanctions about a quarter of the world
is now under US sanctions in any other
country impose sanctions that everyone
has to obey I mean it's not even a
thought does any other country have
almost a thousand military bases all
over the world the US military funding
is kritis almost as much as the rest of
the world combined and far more
sophisticated the no country is going to
defy this I mean certainly not Israel so
if it's a very ugly situation but
there's no point blinding ourselves to
reality now there are many very positive
things about the United States so the
anti-racist demonstrations today are
remarkable so if 400 years too late but
it's happening and that's remarkable
progress through progress in the United
States since the nineteen sixties very
significant it's not the whole country
country is divided where it'll go
we don't know but to talk about American
decline is very misleading not in the
manner that matters in setting the stage
in world affairs
so Chomsky where does that put the
Palestinian Authority now where it's has
been receiving funds and and money from
the EU to build a state Israel is
withdrawing the carpet from underneath
their foot and there is hardly any land
left to the state I understand and I see
your vision that we ultimately
I'm not gonna run away from the
two-state solution but they are now in a
position where they exist as an
authority without an authority they
hardly seen as Palestinians by many and
I don't know if they work for the
interest or the national interest of the
Palestinians what would you advise me
for the taxing authority now that's kind
of lost in between the reality that
Israel is imposing on them well the
person in authority one advice that I
would give is to reconstitute itself
there are internal problems internal to
Palestine which have to be overcome and
resolved there's a lot of corruption
there's a division that should be
overcome between Hamas and the VA the
Palestinian society internally has to
reconstruct itself and take a a
principled unified position that's the
beginning it has to interact with
solidarity groups around the world in
Europe in the United States to work
together that can make a big difference
every third world I've been involved
with dozens of third world nationalist
movements over the years the ones that
succeeded are those that had close links
with solidarity organizations mainly in
the United States also with Europe those
have to be established if there's no
support for a weak move people in the
powerful countries they're lost
if their support for them that can
inhibit violence against them and can
lead them to move towards their
objectives so first internal
reconstruction second forging relations
with solidarity groups moving them in
sensible directions influence of the so
for the sake of influencing them to
choose policies
can make a difference in their own
countries in Europe for example can be
pressed to impose real boycott
divestment actions against anything
involving the occupied territories
certainly against annexation they can
they make they say words but they can
move on to forceful actions that would
be significant now they can threaten to
expel Israel from the European
organizations which it shouldn't be
allowed to be in if it follows its
current policies in the United States
I've already took mentioned I think
there are opportunities there for what
might be a significant change in policy
but the opportunities have to be grasped
and the Palestinian Authority the
Palestine and if it can be a unified
authoritative voice could have an impact
on policies of solidarity groups in the
United States which would lead to
significant change this has happened in
movements all over the world I can't
tell you how many I've been involved in
myself
the hard struggle can can be achieved
who've achieved thunder what looked like
almost impossible situations let's take
one that's much looks much more
impossible than Palestine nifer about 25
years I was very actively involved in a
movement against the us-backed
Indonesian invasion of East Timor the
worst the worst extermination of
population since the Second World War
closest to genocide since the Second
World War it looked totally unequal
there is a country of 700,000 people
invaded by want to play a major military
power huge good country backed by the
United States also backed by your
how could they possibly survive well
there were small groups of activists in
Australia and the United States and
England kept pressing on it finally
developed a bigger movement finally the
United States under Clinton was
pressured to order Indonesia to withdraw
the United States is the mafia dawn when
the United States orders the Indonesian
generals to withdraw they withdraw the
next day they had been dedicated to this
for 25 years they said they would never
leave all it took was a word from the
boss
his team was devastated but its no
independent things can happen take a
look at history things can happen on the
on the point of keeping the pressure on
what sir where do you see the
Palestinian resistance place in the
current time or what does Hamas fit and
the Palestinian struggle currently you
still see them as a as a part of the
national struggle resistance movement or
have they moved already into a group of
power-hungry
administrators for the Gaza Strip as you
advise that the precedence have already
moved away from the armed struggle and
probably never going to come back to
that one well it's very easy to
understand why a young person in Gaza
will go to the border and throw a rock
you know it's very easy to understand
just as you can understand why Jews in
the Warsaw Ghetto fourth back but if you
think it's a gift to Israel Israel loves
powerful States love it when the arena
of conflict shifts in the area of
violence because that's their strong
chord powerful states are strong in the
arena of violence they're weak in the
arena of public opinion
so if things shift to the arena of
violence they're delighted they have
overwhelming force okay
an Israeli sniper can kill a young
Palestinian health worker fine we can do
that what you can't do is deal with
nonviolent protests it's a much harder
much harder to undertake nonviolent
protests then to throw rocks and break
windows that we're seeing that in the
United States right now the black
organizers of the protests are putting
out every effort to try to keep them
non-violent their worst enemies are
white and black the young looters people
who break windows and attack police and
so on that's a gift to the far-right
they love it because that's the arena in
which they're strong overwhelmingly
strong and the same lesson sold for
Palestine even in Gaza Hamas is very
repressive very brutal in many ways and
the people in Gaza deserve much better
than that and there should be every
effort to help them Palestinian
Authority hasn't helped by any means
don't have to go through it policies
have been extremely harmful but that has
to be overcome internally the resistance
can only have effects if it keeps to
nonviolent protests which will be
supported in the world and will lead to
the growth of effective solidarity
movements will change could change
policies in the major states primarily
the United States also Europe and that
will compel Israel to move in a
different direction
I think it'll also change internal
Israeli affairs now there are sectors in
Israel who don't at all like the shore
shift to the right the growth of
violence the racism and so on that much
prefer a different Israel and Israel
that could be respected in the world
instead of be a pariah in the world as
it is no and those forces can be
strengthened - there's a lot of room for
solidarity across the boundaries of
ethnic religious groups so one of the
most impressive things in the United
States know is black and white
protesters marching arm and arm
sometimes even arm an arm with police
that's the direction in which you want
to move that's how things change that's
why it was always in favor of by
nationalism frankly I'm just moving on
on on media you have wrote extensively
on propaganda and the rule of media in
manufacturing consent and on leaking and
the fear of politics and the politics of
fear and so on but now we're moving into
a new era of media social media has
played an important role in the Arab
revolution in the up strains coating
code do you think this could be utilized
for Palestinians and of course for for
people of color in America and the
currents demonstration America won at
the same time we see an attempt from the
states and from the social media
platforms to actually minimize their
usage by the demonstrators and by rebels
like most technology social media are
neutral they don't care how you use them
and it's kind of like a hammer the
hammer doesn't care if you use it to
build a hill sort of smash somebody's
head in a hammer doesn't care question
is how you use the technology now social
media offer many options they can be in
fact to a large extent or taken over by
the far-right to instigate violence
race hatred we had we don't have much
time but if it were time I could give
examples of some of the awful outcomes
Brazil is one of the most horrible cases
they can be used to organize to educate
to bring people together to move towards
solidarity constructive joint action
they can be used that way the rest is up
to us up to people like you how are you
how are you going to use this
opportunity there are opportunities all
over the place if they're not used
doesn't matter but they can be used
they're not easy wasn't easy I mean you
go back to the early civil rights
movement in the United States I can
describe to you demonstrations that I
participated in in the South Jackson
Mississippi where demonstrators white
and black were being beaten bloody by
the state police were fleeing up to the
Federal Building where the state police
are not allowed to go for protection
thrown back into the crowd by federal
marshals they gathered in black churches
every evening and lick their wounds talk
about what to do sing hymns decided to
go back tomorrow
went back tomorrow smashed up by the
state police finally they want something
after many years Jackson has had the
most radical mayor in the country black
mayor it's possible to change it's not
easy you know the irony of Chomsky's at
the media and the new media and the
social media is actually owned and run
by the top-100 anyway and they they
pretty much in bed with the politicians
so there's a very little comfort in my
heart that they can help or they can
facilitate any revolution or unrest in
places like the u.s. I mean we have seen
well here employing people and working
hard around the clock
suppressing people on social media even
arresting people actually a man putting
them in jail I've written probably
thousands of pages on control of the
media by corporate power government
power but the fact is they change the I
don't the New York Times today it's
plenty about it that I don't like but
it's much more progressive than it was
60 years ago much more and the reason is
activism it for so many of the people in
the media today have a background of
experience in the activist movements of
the sixties and later and then simply
changes and public attitudes have led to
changes in the media quite significant
ones so take the New York Times recently
they featured a long series of featured
articles called sixteen nineteen sixteen
nineteen is when the first black slaves
were brought to the United States okay
four hundred years and this series of
featured programs day after day ran
through the hideous vicious treatment of
blacks for four hundred years that would
have been unthinkable 10 20 40 years ago
that's the kind of thing that happens
not just in the United States take the
Financial Times in England the major
business journal in the world quite a
good journal it had an editorial
recently saying we have to have a
radical reconstruction of the economic
system which is too oppressive too
brutal than too destructive
the main business journal in the world
they're being pressed you go to the
Davis conference last January every year
in January the people who are called the
Masters of the Universe gather in a ski
resort it gave us to go skiing to
parties to tell them each other how
wonderful they are and so on this last
meeting in January was different the
theme was new the theme was concerned
concern over what they call reputational
risk it's a fancy way of saying the
peasants are coming with their
pitchforks we've got to watch out about
the public there are angry at us so they
came out with a statement saying yes we
know we've made mistakes in the past
none of the whole neoliberal period was
very harmful it's our fault we
understand that we're changing now we're
going to be nice wonderful people you
can put your trust on us that we're
going to take care of you ok they'll do
it if their feet are held to the fire
but why did they come out with a
statement because there is a lot there's
fear over popular activism and a
JPMorgan Chase biggest bank in the
United States that recently an internal
memo of the bank leaked out it was
concerned about JPMorgan Chase's funding
of fossil fuel industries so we have to
stop this for one thing it's endangering
the survival of humanity for another
it's causing reputational risks but we
don't want to be subject to boycotts we
don't want the university to divest we
don't want people to be banging at our
door saying you're criminals ok public
action does make a difference it's a
very hard course
the violent action is a gift to the
right and it's almost a certainty
nonviolent action has had very
significant effects and I think it can
in this case - but it has to begin with
a Palestinian society basically
reconstructing itself to be an organized
and positive force one that can create
strong solidarity links with sympathetic
groups other ones ultimately in
influencing modifying the behavior of
the great States and Israel is will I
don't see any other path and I think
that is appears but within the
nonviolent Arsenal the Palestinian half
is actually going to the International
Court of Justice and trying to take
Israel actions under the courts do you
see any potential for that it would be
if people knew about it
all that people know is pronouncements
from the United States government and
Israel that the International Court of
Justice is anti-semitic now we have to
put them out of business well that's all
people here that's what they're gonna
believe if there were real functioning
solidarity movements they would be
supporting Ben Sodano in her effort to
investigate Israeli and US war crimes
that's not easy but people at least have
to know about it have to be organized to
do something about it they can happen
before it's not the first time in 1986
Nicaragua brought a case to the World
Court against the United States for its
attack on Nicaragua the United States of
course
violently objected to be rid of the
World Court but they proceeded they
reached the judgment condemning the
United States
for the illegal use of force terrorism
in other words the United States of
course rejected the decision that went
on for further terrorism but a lot of
the public knew because the public was
organized by then and that could become
an issue that helped support the Central
American solidarity movements it kept
the United States from carrying out the
kinds of policies that it did in Vietnam
destruction of Central America was bad
enough but was nothing like what
happened in Vietnam there was too much
public opposition okay it's not utopia
but that's the way changes move forward
including the ones I mentioned before
about the United States in the 60s then
it can happen here same kinds of
measures that have worked in the past
thank you thank you very much officer
Chomsky for a nice overdose of optimism
I know you have generously gave us from
your time and you have many engagement
and you have slot this in for us from
Jerusalem will still be our best regards
we hope that we can see you in person
sometime very soon you know do another
interview thank you again and thanks for
the audience here and zoom and for the
few hundreds who are on Facebook and
thanks for the fritter sheet bite or
pardon on this have a lovely evening
triggers bye-bye
