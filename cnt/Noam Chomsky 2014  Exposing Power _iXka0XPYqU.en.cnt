hey well I mean I think we should take a
lesson from the the powerful and the
rich that they understand this perfectly
well that's why the population has to be
kept in the dark actually the professor
of the science of government I love that
term at Harvard leading policy
intellectual Samuel Huntington once
pointed out that power must remain in
the dark exposed to the sunlight it
begins to evaporate and he's right oh
that's what lies behind the kind of
things I was talking about you know much
more about it here so one thing you can
do is to shun exposed power to the
sunlight and it will evaporate that's
why it the massive secrecy has to be
maintained but that's not enough
exposing power to the sunlight has to be
a preliminary to the only thing that has
ever worked in history mass popular
organization and that has achieved
results it has a plenty of results I
mean right now the troika is trying to
dismantle and destroy the Europe's great
post-war achievement the Social
Democratic welfare state and they're
pretty frank about it Mario Draghi the
head of the central bank said a couple
of years ago that the social the social
contract is dead it can't be maintained
why not for economic reasons just
because they have the power to dismantle
and destroy it well it doesn't have to
happen the power is actually in the
hands of people like you but it's got to
be exercised and that requires
organization and action as an individual
you can do very little but when you get
together you can do almost anything and
that's been demonstrated over and over
again through history I mean you
mentioned occupy which is interesting
and important
I mean I've if I had been asked myself
say should people occupied Zuccotti Park
in New York my judgment would have been
its it's pointless I was completely
wrong it was very successful remarkably
successful within days weeks there were
hundreds of Occupy movements around the
country others in Europe I actually
spoke at an Occupy event in sydney
australia they were all over the place
it lit a spark which had a real impact
and it changed a lot of things change
the discourse put inequality on the
agenda for the first time and now
phrases like you know one percent 99%
just common coin and it's it's but
remember that occupy was a tactic
tactics it wasn't a movement it's a
tactic that has every tactic has
diminishing returns can't keep doing it
over and over and this one in particular
couldn't be continued you cannot occupy
a central square say in New York or
Boston over the Widder it's just
impossible you're sitting under five
feet of snow but and the population
won't accept that after a time so it has
to turn into a movement and to some
extent it has but I think that's the
answer to your question there's no magic
tricks that's the one that's worked all
through history it's made real
achievements if there's always
regression the power systems don't say
thank you we're going to give you the
power they try to maintain themselves
and that's a story that's class struggle
goes on through history and it will
continue
