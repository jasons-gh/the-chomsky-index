what I was thinking about these remarks
I had two topics in mind couldn't decide
between them actually pretty obvious
ones one topic is what are the most
important issues that we face the second
topic is what issues are not being
treated seriously or at all in the
quadrennial frenzy now underway called
an election but I realized that there's
no problem it's not a hard choice
they're the same topic and there are
reasons for it which are very
significant in themselves I'd like to
return to that in a moment but first a
few words on the background
beginning with the announced title who
owns the world actually good answer to
this was given years ago by Adam Smith
someone we're supposed to worship with
but not read he was a little subversive
when you read him sometimes he was
referring to the most powerful country
in the world in his day and of course
the country that interested him namely
England and he pointed out that in
England the principal architects of
policy are those who own the country the
merchants and manufacturers in his day
and he said they make sure to design
policy so that their own interests are
most peculiarly attended to their
interests are served by policy however
Grievous the impact on others including
the people of England but he was an
old-fashioned conservative with moral
principles so he added the victims of
England the victims of these what he
called the savage and justice of the
Europeans particularly in
well he had no illusions about the
honors so to quote him again all for
ourselves and nothing for other people
seems in every age of the world to have
been the vile Maxim of the masters of
mankind was true then it's true Dell
Britain kept its position as the
dominant world power well into the 20th
century despite steady decline by the
end of World War two the dominance had
shifted decisively into the hands of the
upstart across the sea the United States
by far the most powerful and wealthy
Society in world history Britain could
only aspire to be its junior partner as
the British Foreign Office ruefully
recognized at that point 1945 the United
States had literally half the world's
wealth incredible security controlled
the entire western hemisphere both
oceans the opposite sides of both oceans
is nothing there has never been anything
like that in history and planners
understood it Roosevelt's planners were
meeting right through the Second World
War
designing the post-war world they were
quite sophisticated about it and their
plans were pretty much implemented they
wanted to make sure that the United
States would control what they called a
grand area which would include routinely
the entire Western Hemisphere the entire
Far East the former British Empire which
US would be taking over and as much of
Eurasia as possible crucially its
commercial and industrial centers in
Western Europe and within this region
they said the United States
hold unquestioned power with military
and economic supremacy while ensuring
the limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with these global designs and
those were pretty realistic plans at the
time given the enormous disparity of
power the US had been them by far the
richest country in the world even before
the Second World War although it wasn't
was not yet the major global actor it
during the Second World War the United
States gained enormous ly industrial
production almost quadrupled got us out
of the depression meanwhile industrial
rivals were devastated or seriously
weakened so that was an unbelievable
system of power actually the policies
that were outlined then still hold you
can read them in government
pronouncements but the capacity to
implement them has significantly
declined actually there's a major theme
now in foreign policy discussion you
know journals and so on the theme is
called American decline so for example
in the most prestigious establishment
international relations journal Foreign
Affairs a couple of months ago that was
an issue which had on the front cover
and big bold letters is America over
question mark that's announcing the
theme of the issue and there's a
standard caller corollary to this the
power is shifting to the west to China
and India the rising world powers which
are going to be the hegemonic States of
the future actually I think the decline
the decline is quite real but some
serious qualifications are in order
first of all the corollary is highly
unlikely least in the foreseeable future
that China in India are very poor
countries just take a look at say the
Human Development Index
of the United Nations they're way down
there
China's around 90th I think in these
around one hundred and twentieth or so
last time I looked and they have
tremendous internal problems demographic
problems extreme poverty hopeless
inequality ecological problems
China's great manufacturing center but
it's actually mostly an assembly plant
so it assembles parts and components
high technology that comes from the
surrounding industrial sent more
advanced industrial centers Japan Taiwan
South Korea Singapore the United States
Europe and basically assembles them so
say you buy a one of these eye things
you know an iPad from China that it's
called an export from China but the
parts and components and technology come
from outside and the value-added in
China is miniscule it's been calculated
they'll move up the technology ladder
but it's a hard climb in the even harder
well so I think one should be skeptical
about the corollary but there's another
qualification it's more serious the
decline is real but it's not new it's
got been going on since 1945 in fact it
happened very quickly in the late 1940s
there's an event that's known here as
the loss of China the China became
independent that's a loss of a huge
piece of the grand area of Asia and it
became a major issue in American
domestic policy who's responsible for
the loss of China a lot of
recriminations and so on actually the
phrase is kind of interesting like I
can't lose your computer right because I
don't own it
I can lose my computer well the phrase
loss of China kind of presupposes a
deeply held principle of a kind of
American a leak consciousness we own the
world and if some piece of it becomes
independent we've lost it and that's a
terrible loss we got to do something
about it it's it's never questioned
which is interesting in itself well
right about the same time around 1950
concerns developed about the loss of
Southeast Asia that's what led the
United States into the Indochina Wars
and the worst atrocities of the post-war
period partly lost partly not very
significant event in modern history was
in 1965 when the in Indonesia which was
the main concern
that's the country of Southeast Asia
with most of the wealth and resources
there was a coupe military coup in
Indonesia it Suharto coup it led to an
extraordinary massacre what the New York
Times called a staggering mass slaughter
killed hundreds of thousands of people
mostly landless peasants destroyed the
only mass political party and opened the
country up to Western exploitation
euphoria and the West was so enormous
that it couldn't be contained so in the
New York Times describing the staggering
mass slaughter called it a gleam of
light in Asia it was a column written by
James Reston the leading liberal thinker
in the times and the same elsewhere
Europe Australia was a fantastic event
years later McGeorge Bundy who was the
national security adviser for Kennedy
and Johnson in retrospect he pointed out
that probably would have been a good
idea to end the Vietnam War at that
point to pull out contrary to a lot of
illusions the Vietnam War was fought
Merilee to ensure that an independent
Vietnam would not develop successfully
and become a model for other countries
in the region would not to borrow Henry
Kissinger's terminology speaking about
Chile we have to prevent it the what
they call that he called the virus of
independent development from spreading
contagion elsewhere that's a critical
part of American foreign policy since
the second world war Britain France
others to a lesser degree and by 1965
that was over Vietnam was South Vietnam
was virtually destroyed the word spread
to the rest of China wasn't going to be
a model for anyone and the contagion was
contained there were the Suharto regime
made sure that Indonesia wouldn't be
infected and pretty soon the US had
dictatorships in every country of the
region at Marcos and Philippines
dictatorship in Thailand's China and
South Park and South Korea it was no
problem about the infection so that
would have been a good time to end the
Vietnam War he felt well that's
Southeast Asia but the decline continues
the last ten years has been a very
important event the loss of South
America for the first time in five
hundred years the south and since that
conquistadors the South American
countries have begun to move towards
independence and a degree of integration
the typical structure of one of the
South American countries was a tiny very
rich westernized elite often white or
mostly white and a huge mass of horrible
poverty countries separated from one
another oriented for each oriented
towards its you know either Europe or
more recently the United States last ten
years that's been overcome significantly
beginning to integrate the prerequisite
for independence of even beginning to
face some other
horrendous internal problems that's the
loss of South America one sign is that
the United States has been driven out of
every single military base in South
America trying to restore a few but
right now there are none well moving on
to just last year the Arab Spring is
another such threat it threatens to take
that big region out of the grand area
that's a lot more significant than
Southeast Asia or South America go back
to the 1940s the State Department
recognized that the energy resources of
the Middle East are what they call the
one of the greatest material prizes in
world history
a spectacular source of strategic power
if we can control Middle East energy we
can control the world they take a look
at the u.s. you could bridge to and Iran
in 1953 very important event its shadow
cast over the world until today that was
was a pretense that it was a part of the
Cold War had nothing to with Cold War
what it had to do was the usual fear
independent nationalism and wasn't even
concerned with access to oil or profits
it was concerned with control control of
the oil resources of Iran and in fact of
the region and that's a theme that runs
right through policy decisions not
discussed much but it's very important
to have control exactly as State
Department pointed advisors pointed out
in the 40s if you can control the oil
you can control most of the world and
that goes on so far the threat of the
Arab Spring has been pretty well
contained in the oil dictatorships which
are the most important ones for the west
every effort
to join the Arab Spring has just been
crushed by force Saudi Arabia was so
extreme that when there was an effort to
you know go out into the streets the
security presence was so enormous that
people were even afraid to go out
there's a little discussion of what goes
on in Bahrain where it's been crushed
but Eastern Saudi Arabia it was much
worse the Emirates totally controlled so
that's okay we managed to ensure that
the threat of democracy would be smashed
in the most important places Egypt is an
interesting case it's important country
not oil producer it is a small one but
in Egypt the United States followed a
standard operating procedure maybe if
you're going into the diplomatic service
you might as well learn it there's a
standard procedure when one of your
favorite dictators gets into trouble
first you support them as long as
possible
but if it becomes really impossible say
the army turns against him then you send
them out to pasture and get the
intellectual class to issue ringing
declarations about your love of
democracy and then try to restore the
old system as much as possible this case
after case of that Somoza and Nicaragua
de Vega in Haiti and Marcos and the
Philippines it's shown in South Korea
Bhutto in the Congo over and over them
it takes genius not to see it and that's
exactly what was done in
in Egypt than what France tried to do
not quite with as much success in
Tunisia well the future is uncertain but
the threat of democracy so far is
contained and it's a real threat I'll
return to that it's also the record
important to recognize that the decline
over the past 50 years is to a
significant extent self-inflicted
particularly since the seven days I'll
go back to that too
but first let me say a couple of things
about the issues that are most important
today and that are being ignored or not
dealt seriously dealt with seriously and
the electoral campaigns for good reasons
so let me start with the most important
issues there are two of these there of
overwhelming significance because the
fate of the species depends on them the
one is environmental disaster the others
nuclear war I'm not going to take much
time reviewing the threats of
environmental disaster actually there on
the front pages almost daily so for
example last week the New York Times at
a front-page story with the headline
ending its summer melt Arctic sea ice
it's a new low that leads to warnings
the melting this summer was fast far
faster than it was predicted by the
sophisticated computer models and the
most recent United Nations report that's
now predicted that the summer ice it
might be gone by 2020 it was assumed
before that it may be 2050 they quoted
scientists who said this is a prime
example of the built-in conservatism of
our climate forecasts as dire the
warnings are about the long-term
consequences of heat-trapping emissions
many of us fear that they may still be
on us under estimating the speed and
severity of the
pending changes after there's a climate
change study program at MIT where I am
they've been worrying about this for
years and repeatedly have been proven
right
The Times report discusses briefly the
severe attack the severe impact of all
of the sudden the global climate and it
adds but governments have not responded
to the change with any greater urgency
about limiting greenhouse emissions to
the contrary their main response has
been to plan for exploitation of newly
accessible minerals in the Arctic
including drilling for more oil that is
to accelerate the catastrophe that's
quite interesting it demonstrates an
extraordinary willingness to sacrifice
the lives of our children and
grandchildren for short-term gain or
perhaps an equally remarkable
willingness to shut our eyes so as not
to see impending peril those things you
sometimes find with young infants
something looks dangerous close my eyes
and won't look at it well there is
another possibility
I mean maybe humans are somehow trying
to fulfill a prediction of great
American biologists who died recently
Ernst Meier now he argued years ago that
intelligence seems to be a lethal
mutation he and he had some pretty good
evidence there's a notion of biological
success which is how many of you are
there around you know that's biological
success they pointed out that if you
look at the tens of billions of species
in human world history
the ones that are very successful are
the ones that mutate very quickly like
bacteria are the ones that have a fixed
ecological niche like beetles they seem
to make out fine but as you move up the
scale of what we call intelligence
success declines steadily when you get
up to mammals it's very
very few of them around there's a lot of
cows it's only because we domesticate
them when you get to humans it's the
same till very recently much too recent
that time to show up in any evolutionary
accounting the humans were very
scattered there were plenty of other
hominids but they disappeared
probably because humans exterminated
them but nobody knows for sure anyhow
maybe we're trying to trying to show
that humans just fit into the general
pattern we can exterminate ourselves to
the rest of the world with us and we're
hell-bent on it right now well let's
turn to the elections of both political
parties demand that we make the problem
worse in 2008 both party flat platforms
devoted some space to how the government
should address climate change today the
in the Republican platform the issue is
essentially disappeared but the platform
does demand that Congress take quick
action to prevent the Environmental
Protection Agency from regulating
greenhouse gases so let's make sure to
make it worse and it also demands that
we open the Alaska's Arctic refuge to
drilling I'm quoting now in order to
take advantage of all of our American
god-given resources can't disobey God
after all on environmental policy the
program says we must restore scientific
integrity to our public research
institutions and remove political
incentives from publicly funded research
oh that's a code word for climate
science stop funding climate science
Romney himself says there's no
scientific consensus so we should
support more debate and investigation
within the scientific community but no
action except to act to make the
problems worse well what about the
Democrats they
concede that there is a problem and
advocate that we should work toward an
agreement to set emissions limits in
unison with other emerging powers but
that's it no action and in fact as Obama
has emphasized we have to work hard to
gain what he calls a hundred years of
energy independence by exploiting
domestic or Canadian resources by
fracking and other elaborate
technologies it doesn't ask what the
world would look like in a hundred years
so there are differences that the
differences are basically about how
enthusiastically the lemmings should
march towards the cliff let's turn to
the second major issue in nuclear war
it's also on the front pages daily but
in a way that would seem outlandish to
some independent observer the viewing
what's going on on earth and in fact
does seem outlandish to a considerable
majority of the countries of the world
the current threat not for the first
time is in the Middle East focusing on
Iran the general picture in the West is
very clear it's far too dangerous to
allow Iran to reach what's called
nuclear capability that is the
capability enjoyed by many powers and
dozens of them to produce nuclear
weapons if they decide to do so as to
whether they've decided US intelligence
says it doesn't know the International
Atomic Energy Agency just produced its
most recent report a couple weeks ago
and it concludes or quoted it cannot
demonstrate the absence of an undeclared
undeclared nuclear material and
activities in Iran that is it can't
demonstrate something which cannot a
condition that can't be satisfied
there's no way to demonstrate the
absence of the work that's convenient
for Iran must be denied the right to
enrich uranium that's guaranteed to
every power that signed a
non-proliferation treaty
well that's the picture in the West it's
not the picture in the rest of the world
as you know I'm sure there was just a
meeting of the non-aligned movement
that's large majority of the countries
in the world and of representing most of
the world's population a meeting in
Tehran and once again not for the first
time they issued a ringing declaration
of support for Iran's right to enrich
uranium right that every country has
that signed the non-proliferation treaty
pretty much the same is true in the Arab
world that's interesting I'll return to
that in a moment there is a basic reason
for the concern it was expressed
succinctly by General Lee Butler he's
the former head of the US Strategic
Command which controls nuclear weapons
and nuclear strategy now he wrote that
it is dangerous in the extreme that in
the cauldron of animosities that we call
the Middle East one nation should arm
itself with nuclear weapons which may
inspire other nations to do so general
Butler however was not referring to Iran
he was referring to Israel the country
that ranks highest in European polls as
the most dangerous country in the world
right above Iran and not incidentally in
the Arab world where the public regard
the United States as the second most
dangerous country right after Israel in
the Arab world Iran though disliked that
ranks far lower as a threat among the
populations that is not the
dictatorships with regard to Iranian
nuclear weapons nobody wants them to
have them but in many polls majority
sometimes considerable majorities
said that the region would be more
secure if Iran had nuclear weapons to
balance those of their major threats now
there's a lot of commentary and the
Western media journal is about our
attitudes towards Iran and what you read
commonly is that the Arabs want decisive
action against Iran which is true of the
dictators it's not true of the
populations but who cares about the
populations what are called
disparagingly the Arab Street don't care
about them that's a reflection of the
extremely deep contempt for democracy
among Western elites I mean so deep that
it can't be perceived you know it's just
kind of like reflexive this study of
popular attitudes in our world and there
is very extensive study by Western
polling agencies it reveals very quickly
why the US and its allies are so
concerned about the threat of democracy
and are doing what they can to prevent
it they certainly don't want attitudes
like those I've just indicated to be
become policy well of course
issuing arousing statements about our
passionate dedication to democracy those
are relayed obediently by reporters and
commentators well unlike Iran Israel
refuses to allow inspections at all that
refuses to join the non-proliferation
treaty has hundreds of nuclear weapons
as advanced delivery systems also it has
a long record of violence and repression
it has annexed and settled conquered
territories illegally violation of
Security Council orders many acts of
aggression five times against Lebanon
alone no credible pretext New York Times
yesterday you can read that the Golan
Heights are disputed territory Syrian
Golan Heights there is a UN Security
Council resolution 497 which is
unanimous
declaring Israel's annexation of the
Golan Heights illegal and demanding that
it be rescinded and in fact it's
disputed only in Israel and in the New
York Times which in fact is reflecting
actual US policy not formal US policy
Iran has a record of aggression to it in
the last several hundred years it has
invaded and conquered a couple of Arab
islands that was under the Shah us
imposed dictator with us support it's
actually the only case in several
hundred years meanwhile the severe
threats of attack continue you've just
been hearing them at the UN from the
United States but particularly Israel
there is a reaction to this at the
highest level in the United States Leon
Panetta Secretary of Defense he said
that we don't want to attack Iran we
hope that Israel won't attack Iran about
Israel's a sovereign country and they
have to make their own decisions about
what they'll do
you might ask what the reaction would be
if you reverse the cast of characters
and those of you who have antiquarian
interests it might remember that there's
a document called the United Nations
Charter and foundation of modern
international law which bars the threat
or use of force in international affairs
there are two rogue States United States
and Israel which for whom which regard
that yet the Charter and international
law is just boring irrelevance so do
what they like and that's accepted well
these are not just words there is an
ongoing war includes terrorism
fascination of nuclear scientists
includes economic war us threats
national ones us threats have cut Iran
out of the international financial
system Western military analysts
identify what they call weapons of
finance as acts of war that justify
violent response when they're directed
against us that is cutting Iran out of
global financial markets is different
the United States is openly carrying out
extensive cyber war against Iran
that's praised the Pentagon regards
cyber war as an equivalent of an armed
attack which justifies military response
but that's of course when it's directed
against us the leading liberal figure in
the State Department Harold Koh is the
top State Department legal adviser he
says that cyber war is an act of war if
it results in significant destruction
like the attacks against Iranian nuclear
facilities and such acts he says justify
force in self-defense but of course he
means only attacks against the United
States or its clients
well Israel's lethal armory which is
enormous includes advanced submarines
recently provided by Germany these are
capable of carrying Israel's nuclear
tipped missiles and these are sure to be
deployed and the Persian Gulf or nearby
if Israel proceeds with its plans to
bomb Iran or more likely I suspect to
try to set up conditions in which the
United States will do so and the United
States of course as a vast array of
nuclear weapons all over the world but
surrounding the region from the
Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean
including enough firepower in the
Persian Gulf to destroy most of the
world another story that's in the news
right now is
the Israeli bombing of the Iraqi reactor
in Osirak which is suggested as a model
for Israeli bombing of Iran it's rarely
mentioned however that the bombing of
the O's Arak reactor didn't end Saddam
Hussein's nuclear weapons program it
initiated it
there was no program before it and the
O's Arak reactor was not capable of
producing uranium for nuclear weapons
but of course after the bombing Saddam
immediately turned to developing a
nuclear weapons program and if Iran is
bombed it's almost certain to proceed
just as Saddam Hussein did after the
Osirak bombing well in a few weeks we'll
be commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the most dangerous moment in human
history those are the words of the
historian Kennedy advisor Arthur
Schlesinger is referring of course to
the October 1962 Missile Crisis the most
dangerous moment in human history others
agree at that time Kennedy raised the
nuclear alert to the second-highest
level just short of launching weapons he
authorized NATO aircraft with Turkish or
other pilots to take off fly to Moscow
and drop bombs setting off a likely
nuclear conflagration at the peak of the
missile crisis Kennedy estimated the
probability of nuclear war at perhaps
50% it's a war that would destroy the
northern hemisphere President Eisenhower
had warned and facing that risk Kennedy
refused to agree publicly to an offer by
her chef to end the crisis by
simultaneous withdrawal of Russian
missiles from Cuba and u.s. missiles
from Turkey
these were obsolete missiles they were
already being replaced by
invulnerable flower submarines but it
was felt necessary to firmly establish
the principle that Russia has no right
to have any offensive weapons anywhere
beyond the borders of the USSR even to
defend an ally against us attack that's
now recognized to be the prime reason
for deploying missiles there and
actually a plausible one meanwhile the
United States must retain the right to
have them all over the world at
targeting Russia or China or any other
enemy in fact in 1962 the united stry
cently learned the united states had
just secretly deployed nuclear missiles
to okinawa aimed at china it was a
moment of elevated regional tensions all
that is very consistent with grand area
conceptions the ones I mentioned that
were developed by Roosevelt's planners
well fortunately in 1962 core shift back
down but the world can't be assured of
such sanity forever and particularly
threatening my view is that intellectual
opinion and even scholarship a hail
Kennedy's behavior as his finest hour my
own view is is one of the worst moments
in history inability to face the truth
about ourselves is all too common a
feature of the intellectual cultural so
personal life as ominous implications
well ten years later in 1973 during the
Israel Arab war the Henry Kissinger
called a high-level nuclear alert the
purpose was to warn the Russians to keep
hands off while he was so we have
recently learned he was secretly
informing Israel that they were
authorized to violate the ceasefire that
had been imposed joint
by the US and Russia when Reagan came
into office a couple of years later the
United States launched operations
probing Russian defenses flying into
Russia to probe defenses and simulating
air and naval attacks I mean while
placing Pershing missiles in Germany
that had a five minute flight time to
Russian targets they were providing what
the CIA called a super sudden first
strike capability the Russians not
surprisingly were deeply concerned
actually that led to a major war scare
in 1983 there have been hundreds of
cases when human intervention aborted a
first strike launched just minutes
before launch
that's after automated systems gave
false alarms that we don't have Russian
records but there's no doubt that their
systems are far more accident-prone not
just a near miracle that nuclear war has
been avoided so far meanwhile India and
Pakistan have come close to nuclear war
several times and the crises that led to
that especially Kashmir remain both
India and Pakistan have refused to sign
the non-proliferation treaty along with
Israel and both of them have received US
support for development of their nuclear
weapons programs actually until today in
the case of India which is now a US ally
war threats in the Middle East which
could become reality very soon once
again escalate to dangers well
fortunately there's a way out of this a
simple way is a way to mitigate maybe
end whatever threat Iran is alleged to
pose very simple move towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
in the Middle East the opportunities
coming again this December there's an
international conference scheduled
to deal with this proposal it has
overwhelming international support
including it's an early majority of the
population in Israel
that's fortunately unfortunately it's
blocked by the United States and Israel
a couple of days ago Israel announced
that it's not going to participate and
it won't consider the matter until
there's a general regional peace Obama
takes the same stand now he also insists
that any agreement must exclude Israel
and even must exclude the calls for
other nations meaning the u.s. to
provide information about Israeli
nuclear activities the United States and
Israel can delay regional peace
indefinitely they've been doing that for
35 years on Israel Palestine virtual
International isolations a long
important story that I don't have time
to go into here so therefore there's no
hope for an easy way to end what the
West regards as the most severe current
crisis in no way unless there's
large-scale public pressure but the
can't be large-scale public pressure
unless people at least know about it and
the media have done a stellar job in
averting that danger nothing reported
about the conference or about any of the
background no discussion apart from
specialist arms control journals where
you can read about it so that blocks the
easy way to end the worst existing
crisis unless people somehow find a way
to break through this well turning to
the election there's unanimity and
ignoring all of this not a word the only
issue discussed is should the United
States agree with Israel's position
Israel's position is that the US should
establish a red line the red line should
be
Iranian capability to produce nuclear
weapons the capability that vast number
of countries have so if they reach
capability we should mama
that's Israel's position it's also the
position of the US Senate
a couple of days ago the Senate declared
ninety to one the one exception was rent
Ron Paul ninety to one that the United
States must accept Israel's position
establish a red line at capability
contrary to the white house well that's
the most important international issues
there are also quite crucial domestic
issues the most serious is that there
are roughly twenty three million people
unemployed underemployed or just given
up now that's a real catastrophe and for
the people themselves you know their
lives are destroyed and families are
destroyed and for the economy huge
resources not being used that does enter
the elections the Republicans have an
answer to this and we should enrich the
rich you don't use the word rich anymore
there's a euphemism there called the job
creators they don't create any jobs but
that's the way it refer to the rich
sometimes they called the makers not the
takers so who are the takers well that's
easy the big banks for example or
enormous takers now they get thirty
billion dollars a year from just the
government insurance policy alone
too-big-to-fail policy some estimated at
about sixty billion dollars the
super-rich are incredible takers so they
take a look at just at tax breaks tax
breaks amount to more than seven percent
of GDP gross domestic product that's two
fifths as large as the entire federal
government the tech breaks are
overwhelmingly regressive favoring the
rich and how do they achieve that nice
outcome by lobbying heavily and
systematically and systematically
contributing to political campaign
I'm quoting that radical rag foreign
affairs' there are many other regressive
devices patent laws designed to
radically increase the price of drugs
and others research and development
procurement or techniques for enriching
the private sector particularly
significant since the 1970s a big change
in the way the economy works then
particularly since significant since
then our financial institutions there is
a role for banks in a state capitalist
economy so for example what a bank is
supposed to do is and take your deposit
and decide to lend it to somebody who
wants to do something with it like you
know buy a car send the kids to college
and start a business buy a house
whatever it might be that's the function
of banks and it was pretty well filled
that during the great growth period
sometimes called the golden age the 50s
and 60s enormous growth period pretty
egalitarian that's pretty much what
banks were doing that at that time the
New Deal legislation still prevailed
including fair amount of regulations so
there were no financial crises since the
1970s that's all changed there's been a
huge explosion of financial institutions
mostly dedicated to financial
manipulations that take a look at the
business pages of the New York Times
today there's a big debate about whether
there should be some regulation on
superfast automated trading you know we
even cut a trade by you know microsecond
or something and maybe beat somebody
else out which is causing all kinds of
problems and Europe and Australia and
Canada are trying to clamp down on it
the United States is hanging back with
there's plenty of this by 2007 the
financial institutions that literally
reach 40% of corporate profits well
what's the impact of this on the economy
actually before the recent crash
there was a very little study of it the
reason is there was there's a kind of a
religious doctrine the doctrine is
markets know best
so it had to be beneficial so if you're
well trained economists just don't look
at it after the crash there was a kind
of a change of mood somewhat so
prominent international economists wrote
them quoting that an emerging consensus
is developing among economists on the
need for macro Prudential supervision of
financial markets there's growing
recognition that our financial system is
running a doomsday cycle whenever it
fails we rely on lacks money and fiscal
policies to bail it out this response
teaches the financial sector or lesson
take large Gamble's to get paid
handsomely and don't worry about the
costs they'll be paid by the taxpayers
through bailouts and lost jobs and the
financial system is just is thus
resurrected to gamble again and to fail
again quoting Barry Eichengreen and
Simon Johnson economists among you will
know that they are among the most
respected financial and international
economists the system is a Doom loop in
the words of the official of the Bank of
England who's responsible for financial
stability after the crisis a number of
very prominent economists did start to
write about it there's a issue of the
Journal of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences that had articles by
Benjamin Friedman at Harvard Robert
Solow at MIT s Nobel laureate they both
pointed out that there hadn't been much
in the way of study of the impact of
financial institutions didn't say why
but the reason is the religion and they
said when you look at they started said
if you look at it carefully it looks
like they are imposing significant costs
on the economy the most respected
financial commentator and
english-speaking world the Martin wolf
Financial Times he went well beyond that
he said the out-of-control financial
sector is eating out the modern market
economy from inside just as the larvae
of the spider wasp eats out the host in
which it's been laid banks as presently
constituted and managed cannot be
trusted to perform any publicly
important function today's banks
represent the incarnation of profit
seeking behavior taken to its logical
limits in which the only question asked
by the senior staff is what can they get
away with that's not a spokesperson for
the Occupy movement it's the most
respected financial correspondent in the
english-speaking world quite
conservative Martin wolf there's a study
by two leading economists one a Nobel
laureate Paul Romer and George Akerlof
who found that the most lucrative
strategy for executives at big banks
would be to loot them to pay themselves
vast rewards knowing full well that the
government meaning the taxpayer will
move in and save them from bankruptcy
that was 20 years ago it's a lot worse
today there are some limited steps to
try to deal with this but they're being
beaten back by armies of lobbyists well
that's the takers what about the makers
working people they're under constant
attack
fiscal policies and trade policies are
designed to undermine manufacturing to
set workers in competition with each
other around the world with the poorest
to drive down wages meanwhile protect
professionals they're given all kinds of
protections they're not supposed to
compete unions are under terrific attack
that's been going on since the 1940s but
the last generation has been very harsh
employers have been basically told that
they can violate the laws of at will and
of course you're following Clinton that
was Reagan Clinton which led to about a
tripling of firing of organizers
illegally Clinton added his own method
it was called NAFTA NAFTA gave
opportunities for employers to threaten
to move plants to Mexico in order to
brake strikes
that's illegal of course but when you
have a criminal state it's fine to act
illegally that under a NAFTA study that
led to a very sharp increase in braking
strikes illegally by now they
practically don't exist private sector
unionization is down to about seven
percent public workers have so far
defended themselves but they are under
terrific attack time to go into it but I
should mention that Obama takes part in
it
all of this is it has been accelerated
under a strong right-wing backlash that
took place backlash against the 60s that
took place from the early 70s major
change in the nature of the economy
towards financialization leading to what
I described and offshoring that led very
quickly to concentration of wealth
concentration of wealth leads to
concentration of political power or
almost reflexively that leads to
legislation to enhance the process the
vicious cycle fiscal policy deregulation
rules of corporate governance quite a
lot so the vicious cycle goes on and it
leads to what in the Occupy slogan which
is now become prevalent the one percent
ninety nine percent distinction actually
one percent is wrong it's more like 0.1
percent versus the rest if you actually
look at income distributions highly
concentrated in a fraction of one
percent CEOs hedge fund manager
and so on for the majority its
stagnation and decline meanwhile costs
of elections of skyrocketed Supreme
Court just has given its help a couple
of times there are studies of what the
outcome my very good political
scientists the most recent one good book
by Martin gilens concludes that seventy
percent of the public are powerless to
shape government policy it's phrased I
mean while the rich get what they want
and the mechanisms are by all means
obscure this has changed the political
parties the Republicans some time ago
abandoned any pretense of being a normal
parliamentary party they are just
dedicated lockstep with a kind of
catechism that everyone has to repeat
towards service to the super-rich and
the corporate sector you can't get votes
that way so they've been compelled to
mobilize sectors of the population that
have always been there and are
substantial but we're never politically
mobilized before the United States says
you know is a unusually religious
fundamentalist religious country off the
international spectrum I mean almost
half the population thinks the world was
created a couple of thousand years ago
with all the fossils and everything else
about a third of the population believes
that every word of the Bible is
literally true two-thirds expect the
second coming half of them in their
lifetime and on and on I don't think
anything like this close to it anywhere
in the world that goes far back actually
goes to the colonists but it's always
been there it's never really been
mobilized as a political force now it is
and for good reasons you got to get
voters somehow there's also a nativist
tradition people are afraid that you
know they're coming after us
and it's amazing to watch so Rand Paul
is the young libertarian hero in the
Senate right now he's organizing a
campaign to try to get people to block
the small arms treaty at the United
Nations that's a important treaty small
arms of massacring people all over the
world and almost 80% come from the
United States but his rationale is as
the arms control treaty is a plot by the
United Nations and the Socialists
radical of Obama and Clinton to try to
take Oh air arms so that when the UN
comes to attack us we won't be able to
defend ourselves you can't find this
anywhere in the world you know nothing
remotely like it but these sectors are
there they've been around it's old
traditions they're now being mobilized
because there's no other way to get
votes and that's why you get what you've
just seen in the Republican primers I'm
in near lunacy you know that people in
the rest of the world are looking at
this and can't believe what's happening
in the country well what's happening is
quite understandable when one of the two
political parties abandons any pretense
of being a parliamentary party just
serves the super-rich you know lockstep
uniformity there's no other way for them
to survive they've got to mobilize these
sectors to get votes that's what's
happening it's commonly said that
moderate Republicans have disappeared
which is not quite true they are now
centrist Democrats and the Democratic
Party is veered to the right as well
seeking the same corporate dollars not
quite as fast well there's a recent
study by the Economic Policy Institute
that's the major source of regular
reliable information on and analysis of
the economy the recent studies called
failure by design it reviews the data is
simple it's worth reading it's very
simple presentation of a lot of data
it reviews the data on the impact of the
are called the neoliberal policies of
the past generation which includes
astonishing concentration of wealth
while wages incomes have stagnated or
declined working hours have increased
the far beyond Europe the weak benefit
system eroded this incidentally in the
richest and most powerful country in
history with extraordinary advantages
the authors of the study point out that
the failure they refer to is class-based
so the designers they have achieved
spectacular success and they also stress
that it is designed that is there have
been alternative policies they were
always possible they still are but it
will take the kind of activism that
brought about the New Deal progressive
step in the 60s back to much earlier
days in order to do something about this
I mean progress doesn't come as a gift
from above the post Golden Age economy
the one reviewed by this pamphlet it's
actually enacting a nightmare that was
envisaged by the classical economists
Adam Smith and David Ricardo both of
them recognized they're talking about
England of course they recognize that if
British merchants and manufacturers
invested abroad and relied on imports
they would profit but England would
suffer both of them hope that these
consequences would be averted by what's
called in the literature home bias that
is a preference to do business in the
home country and see the home country
grow and develop
therefore as if by an invisible hand
England would be saved from the ravages
of global markets actually that's the
one occurrence of the famous phrase in
visit
and in Smith's classic Wealth of Nations
in it's pretty hard to miss it's the
only occurrence and it's basically in an
argument against neoliberal
globalization David Ricardo successor
hoped that thanks to home bias I'm
quoting him now most men of property
would be satisfied with the low rate of
profits in their own country rather than
seek a more advantageous employment for
their wealth in foreign nations feelings
that I would that I would be sorry to
see weakened same point essentially
actually that one was brought to light I
didn't know it before in an important
book on globalization that was produced
here by the political economy Research
Institute in the past 30 years Adam
Smith's masters of mankind have
abandoned the sentimental concerns for
the welfare of their own society
concentrating instead on short-term gain
huge bonuses the country be damned as
long as the powerful nanny state remains
intact to serve their interests the
developing picture is very aptly
described in a brochure for investors
that was produced by Citigroup it's a
huge investment bank and so on that's
once again feeding at the public trough
it's been doing that regularly for
thirty years in a cycle of risky loans
huge profits crash bailout by the public
the bank's analysts this is a brochure
for investors they describe a world
that's dividing into two blocks at one
of which they call the plutonomy then
there's the rest the vast majority now
they're sometimes called the global
precariat those who are living a
precarious existence who whether or not
there
enough to get employment in the United
States they are subject to growing
worker insecurity that if you didn't
know is the basis for a healthy economy
Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan
explained that to Congress while he was
loading his performance in economic
management I think that's the real shift
in global society and not to China and
India but to the global plutonomy and
the Citigroup boundless understand it
they invite advise investors to focus on
the very rich where the action is they
have something called a plutonomy stock
basket which is investments on things
that the rich one and they point out
that it's far outperformed the world
index of developed markets since 1985
that's when the reagan-thatcher
economic programs of enriching the very
rich and punishing the rest we're taking
off and by shredding the remnants of
political democracy at the Masters also
lay the basis for carrying the lethal
process forward and will continue to do
so as long as their victims are willing
to suffer in silence which is always a
choice and never an assessee
