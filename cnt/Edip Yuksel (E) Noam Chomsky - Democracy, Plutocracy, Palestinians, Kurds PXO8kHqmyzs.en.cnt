you are the most celebrated and the most
reference modern scholars and also you
are very combo and I saw your name in
David Horowitz professors F is
highlighted and your global activist
you are very humble and I consider you a
guy with great brain mind and great
heart that's really we see someone in
your prominence that goes and support
the people who are vilified not
supported and now my question the first
question I would have hopefully six
question and if you have more time
hopefully seventh question with a little
bit off the topic what and I don't see
you in much in mass media when I came
here 22 years ago I was like poliana I'm
still grateful being this country to
have freedom that is true Constitution
guaranteed though I think it's slipping
away in certain way gradually now the
mass media we don't see you and when I
ask my students in philosophy class how
many of them heard you feel hands up but
in the world you are more recognized by
general population one thing comes to
mind whether this conspiracy what do you
think
true not just me accidentally any dozen
but for example I do have regular
columns that are distributed by the New
York Times said together which reaches
every newspaper in the country and it
mostly lives in the world I don't think
one has ever been picked up in the
United States covered area but elsewhere
I think not even mentioned Europe
they're published month except southern
Europe they're published in the
southwest of all the countries which in
fact they morph read in many ways and
they have more less free political
systems often the case that they're
actually a little moral and I don't
think that's an accident the effect if
you look at the history of propaganda
and indoctrination it's quite
interesting the huge propaganda
industries the biggest one ever is the
US public relations industry in fact it
used to call itself propaganda now
that's not a nice word 'aslim
with the early the earliest manuals in
the PR industry were sent of coal
probably animal and its main it
developed it these industries which are
enormous the development in the free
countries in Britain in the United
States and for every bats naturally
recorded at the reason which was
conscious it was recognized that people
had won enough rights through popular
struggled that was getting quiter to
control a little bit for us and if it's
part of control people by force yet find
some other way and the other way is
control of attitudes and opinions in
fact it was very conscious written about
subscribe the people are quote the
people are stupid and ignorant and for
their own good we have to make sure that
we they're responsible and they're
called whether we are we run things and
they can be spectators but not
participants don't have to keep matter
our here
great where does public intellectual in
the United States in the 20th century
water Lipman regret decision wasn't
progressivism
Wilson Roosevelt Kennedy
his view was we have to protect
ourselves from the trampling and the war
of the bewildered the ignorant and
meddlesome Outsiders the general public
always for their own good exactly as to
stupid ignorant put that manufacturing
consent well because that's his phrase
my board at the end maybe others and the
propaganda the street was called
engineering simply the same way and so
they next quite good sense and it said
this no conspiracy it's just internal
nature it's internalized by the
intellectual classes sometimes it's
twelve literally so for example is a
concept of objectivity that's used in
the media and this worked in journalism
tools and it's it's discussed by editors
objectivity means reporting accurately
what said within the Beltway in the
human service so if you have something
discussed within the Beltway crazy is no
matter what slipped out and so on you
recorded accurately and the results are
sometimes the best time may be one
example right now which is really quite
urgent
I mean within the Beltway the line is
the greatest threat to peace in the
world was here at the presidential
debate the commentary on the greatest
threat in the world
well it raises a couple of questions
first of all who thinks is a threat but
a second lead but what is the threat
certainly what can you do about it
whatever it is well the answers are
pretty straightforward
who thinks it's a threat the United
States and say all the rest of the world
most of the world strongly supports
Iran's right to enrich uranium denounces
the sanctions and so on
the Arab world is interesting the
propaganda line here is that the Arabs
support the United States and that's not
totally false the dictators exactly not
the people the populations strong that
doesn't like that but hatred of
democracy is so profound and deep seeded
that if the population overwhelmingly
opposes us and the dictators support us
they support us and that's 100%
effective blocking the space of public
opinion which are taken by the leading
US politicians is very thick reported at
the show but so that's what about what
the threat is you can learn that from
the Pentagon and US intelligence the
basic threat is is deterrence they might
get in their way if we want to use force
in violence the other thread is what
they call destabilization like they're
trying to expand their influence
we're supposed to run so that's the
threat what can you do about it that's
the most interesting part a very simple
way of addressing whatever you think the
problem is bigger large very
straightforward way of addressing moved
to establish a nuclear weapons-free zone
in the rich overwhelming international
support for that the Arab world
non-aligned countries I'm supportive so
overwhelming that even the United States
has to formally agree but with the
qualification
the qualifications great idea
but not now the task excluded endless
there's a conference coming up in a
couple of months international
conference move forward on this if you
think there's a strip that's the way of
addressing personal eating those
sanctions no bombing consequence there
can't be any it won't get anywhere as
long as the US need to unless there's
popular pressure here the u.s. is not
going to change as well the American
public whatever sentence there can't be
pressure here unless anybody knows about
here's where the media come in there has
been a hundred percent
conformant literally now you couldn't
achieve that in totalitarian state it's
done without conspiracy without pressure
just by internal subordination to power
which is internalized and I think that's
the crucial part that's the actually one
of the founders of
political science realist political
science stuff made of political science
not some work until he once described
the pathology of American intellectuals
as what he called their conformist
subservience to those in power and
that's that it's not it's not kind of
chosen this just for you you don't even
get to be a person cool the neck
respected intellectually very rare
unless you internalizes know you know if
this cognitive dissonance does you know
if you net you can listen there's lots
of it because people recognize are this
problem I may have an interesting you
know the journals extra by fair this
group fairness and accuracy in reporting
yeah of course where there hasn't been
their last issue that short article
which
the discussive colloquy with the
managing editor of the New York Times or
sometimes official was asked about why
how they were reporting the political
campaign they're just reporting every
while I as a statement of fact that I'm
leaving idols he said just what I said
before I said that's what it means to be
objective then they asked one of their
top reporters yes we were reporting what
they say in Washington accurately now
they're not saying anything but they
didn't even raise this but it was asked
they say well they're not saying
anything
it's important
this time Cartman's business they're
doing exactly what sounds right and what
they're doing
well I also meant like Christians in
this country especially the wrong way
Christians wrong wink I call them and
they are quarter to and I think in that
part when I see co-opted yeah
Christian's got a wrong wink I called
right the right-wing Christians and they
were to church they say peace love your
neighbor and they say the golden rule
but when they come out they vote for the
bigger military for the first three
centuries after Christ Christians were
persecuted the harsh person has a reason
for that you really do hospitals this
radical passes that's Romans are a lot
of that so they were viciously the
person
until a year 350 when the emperor
constantine adopted Christianity as the
official religion of thee well they work
with Roman endeavor and then the cross
which had been the symbol of suffering
and the persecuted people that was put
on the shield of the road legions got
the offensive Wow one of the great
historians of Christianity Thomas could
it says at that point the Church of the
persecuted became the Church of the
persecutors and it remained that way
until 1962 1962 Vatican to the 23rd
tried to get the church to go back to
the Gospels that it had an effect yes
better than Latin American bishops and
priests no they went out to try to
organize dependence to organize in
communities where they would read the
Gospels which is extremely severe yeah I
mean read doesn't mean just say that
work you know let me just think about
what the words mean and organize to try
to
and themselves from the are in which
been the u.s. reaction was quite
interesting us immediately went to war
against the church and if you look for
him 62 to 89 there was a bitter world
war against the church lots of religious
martyrs Archbishop collection
slaughtered the US aren't quite open
about it if you go to the School of the
Americas were they training
Latin American officers but one of their
talking points advertised influences
that the US Army helped defeat
Liberation Theology Liberation Theology
was the attempt
we're not having any of that stuff so
that's the history of the church and
it's it sent us you know there always
were some critics around the fringes
like everyone but these are the general
tendencies and the same with the
muhammad and jesus they were not
capitalist just a the other way around
they were for the pool for the week and
then but exactly what I hope that we can
cover all these things that the crew did
not show up therefore I have my former
student I found her here and therefore
we don't have microphone I thought that
its caption this is a top-of-the-line
camera camcorder now I want to go it is
related and the second question is about
so-called democracy when I go to the
Walmart I see what happened as
investment issues go to the
baskin-robbins ice cream do you know ice
cream company about 30 some plus okay 30
plus flavor of ice cream norm and but in
this country we have more than 300
million people with diverse backgrounds
with diverse ethnic religious and
cultural background we have only two
parties and this really baffles me and
it is somehow system is designed in a
way that punishes those people who would
like to work for third party what do you
think about that
accurate to say we have only 140 we have
what's called a business border yep
that's two factions they're full
Democrats Republicans and there's
somewhat different but if you want to
take a look at what the two-party system
which goes way back but its current form
developed since the Civil War
let's take a look at the newspapers
that's when the day after the election
and they all had the maps rhythmic red
and blue red and blue the Confederacy is
red the ignores is blue no they've
actually changed the names that happened
in the sixties up until the 1960s the
Confederacy was Democrat and the North
was Republican during the 60s civil
rights legislation was passed and some
limited rights were given its African
Americans which costed great fury and
anger among the dominant you know they
ruling the governor of the way things
are and Richard Nixon was a good
politician where
he initiated what he called his Southern
Strategy that is to take over the racist
South and call more publicly and that
worked very well were other things that
contributed to the time but there were a
lot of interesting things actually learn
of liberals contributed to it in many
ways but anyway it happened so the names
have shifted but a founder of this name
and in fact if you look at American
politics after the Civil War the
politics the two parted there had been
parted with the parties that emerged
became sectional parties but it was
actually a slogan you both breeze you so
if you shopped for the Confederates you
would have been credit there was some
mixture because the northern Catholic
workers and it'll be Democrat but they
were kind of stucked in time any style
systems you know Irish politicians kind
of a little mix but that's basically
what it was and it pretty much stays
like that because the name changed one
effect is that both parties very quickly
were taken over by manufacturing and
Spanish
so they both became right-wing business
words but not class-based parties the US
doesn't have a parliamentary system so
there's a big barrier to start with
against getting other voices in but the
basic structure of the system is there's
a friendly business run society that
much more so than Europe you know kind
of reasons but it's true that one reason
why the history of the labor movement in
the United States is so violent
much more so than Europe and welfare
measures knitted by European standards a
lot of a lot of the consequences and
interesting sources but the effect on
the party system is you get a one-party
- faction system yep it's effective you
look very interesting work in the
political science leaders rejected it
they take the most recent and the gold
standard the business work what they can
put includes is from study of polling
which is expensive to know about
attitudes in the policy which person
that turns out to be if you look at the
income your lowest the bottom seventy
percent has no influence on policy don't
pay attention so there are essentially
disenfranchised as you move up the level
a bit more influence when you get to the
top you get what you want and if you
look at the outcome of the last election
dislodge the most are acting the fact is
the correlation of income level devoted
it's almost a straight line if you go
from poorest to the richest it gets more
and more Republican act if you go above
it was approximately the median income
$50,000 about that Ronnie
that's what and that kind of understates
the fact because almost half the
population gonna vote
and overwhelmingly they're poor and
overwhelmingly their democratic and
probably the reason they don't vote is
that intuitively without studying
political science tax they know because
the change doesn't make any different
whether they say yet this is a land of
contradiction to me it's kind of like
Janis with two faces
for example freedom why they enjoy here
though the loudspeaker in the end of the
few and what we have the highest prison
population in the world we preach the
world about freedom that that's Bruce
management yeah that's right that's it's
rated yeah war on crime soulful drugs
but it has to do with the neoliberal
policies all across the world there's
been a neoliberal assault against the
populations that's different effects in
different places
States but it's all in the United States
one effect was to sharply change the
income distributions so you have an
enormous it's been wealth created but
it's going into very few bottles so you
have extreme concentration of wealth
which affects the political system
immediately and although there's been a
decision have to be done to offshore
manufacturing which is fine for
financial institutions from an enormous
to be in this very honorable to working
people superfluous population one thing
you do and yeah freak them yeah I just I
want to do this view contradictions the
opportunity this celebrated we have
opportunity but recently this exactly
it's just the opposite and also recently
Gini index I look at it
the United States is among the worst
countries top-five Chile Mexico and the
United States Turkey my home country and
Israel the foreman Turkey and Turkey in
Turkey and Israel the worst countries I
call them the more the worst immoral
countries those reasons potentially yeah
that's since energy yeah
they've never pulled out say us early
stage
saltador a rule Israel it's recent it's
like the US since the 8th just be kind
of social democratic time but citizen
became part of does the occupation
partly because the reliance when the
u.s. came to mimic the u.s. Mexico were
some very much every of us influence
Turkey has got this actually and I want
to go to of course human rights I see my
god I was incredible told she's shocked
when I see these colors and this talking
heads with ties with God
well grooming they are trying to justify
torture unbelievable shock for me and of
course we know the list of the wars it's
worse than you think
yeah I mean takes a bushes torture I
think he was unfairly criticized because
the torture that was carried out the
u.s. ratification it only it ratified in
I did but only after it was rewritten
the Senate rewrote it and they rewrote
it to exclude a certain category of
torture that was called metal 3 meaning
the kind of torture did then leave marks
and that's the kind of torture that is
in the CIA manuals
they picked it up from the
KGB discovered years ago that the most
effective way to turn a person into a
vegetable is what's called mental
torture isolation threats you know all
this kind of stuff it's much better than
electrodes you know that CIA picked that
up and that's was in the CIA manuals and
that's what the u.s. find and that's
pretty much what the CIA didn't really
do
I stood this book 110 Ammal by David
Tate's David X was in Australia yeah is
he journalist today one who's done
things we could happen to be in
Afghanistan only the northern wouldn't
the Northern Alliance came down they
picked him up when they sold him as a
bounty to the Americans and he's treated
viciously at first didn't Afghanistan
them in Guantanamo our story they were
at any anything they just kind of
concocted a story it's a major ok
but he's Australian so finally they I
should get him out to a stretch ever he
was free under some limitations so he's
able to write about and most of the
people aren't but if you take a look at
the torture its within the framework of
the accepted us torture actually the
main historian of torture very good
scholar Albert Floyd Musa console he's
written about this points out that this
is normal us a lot of the criticisms of
quite unfair now it's true that these
guys kind of went off fitting them but
the main criticisms are well within the
framework of standard us burger in fact
you go to a maximum-security prison in
the United States
I love the Turkish prison for 40 years I
know how brutal it is and also I
suffered torture about one year and both
mental and physical and that would I
ever
I consider these guys worse than animals
the worse animals I just I have personal
also an experience of what this guy's
trying to justify no I want to the third
question I don't want to tell you
anymore I just go ahead yeah
in recent years are over one backed by
the United States yep like the worst
crimes were in the nineties you know
better than I did was real about 80% of
the arms were coming from the US as
torture and terror and violence with us
alarms but in 1998 was one of the years
of state terror and torture exactly
Clinton sent more arms and that one year
then the entire Cold War combined up to
the onset of the counterinsurgency
trying to find a reference for this in
the u.s. address whether they had a very
good correspondent sometimes in the
Kurdish this is my question
I see the Kurdish issue Turkish
government is one of the most racist
governments it was in the Constitution
when I wrote that Journal article on
democracies because Turkey had the habit
of bending parties the Constitution
Court been so many parties therefore the
name of my articles cannibal democracies
in the name of protecting democracy go
are keep banging the parlance political
parties a paradox and the Kurdish
population the Kurdish language was
banned in Turkey at that time the
constitution article was not referring
to the word courage anyone even to utter
the word Mountain terms yeah the band
language and says according to the
chrome and then Kurdish people could not
sing in your own language and give their
names to kids conditionings and Kurdish
towns
incredible actually
I asked because
a trial under a military tribunal put it
finally I did go out to the director and
with Turkish intellectual activist good
people hi Denise but one thing was quite
interesting which I never reported when
we were walking through the streets and
caricature if the people with me you
know the brightness if they saw children
playing whose clothes happen to have the
mixture of clothes you know would be the
Kurdish color they directed us somewhere
else because there were security people
and television crews and they told me
later that if they found a collection of
children I want to cut my questions
short because we have another
appointment coming
yeah the Kurdish issue right now they
are on hunger strike and they are very
arrogant basically racist people really
they become they they are in denial they
don't see their racism I want to talk
about what palestinian-israeli issue and
I know about your position but I
personally don't think that two state is
possible practical after so much
gerrymandering and basically getting
settlements every corner they wish and
come out NEBOSH Adama whether you heard
of him he is a attorney a lawyer in
Washington DC american palestinian and
together with some jewish friends they
established a kind of organization
promoting to state what country solution
and to account a federal and device to
protect the israelis concern regarding
population
50/50 and by this way having both of
Stanley both nation live in peace
proposing 470 oh you see nobody's 170
years without a break writing about it
and so on but I'm different from them I
want to achieve to achieve it pay
attention to the real world and yeah ask
what can be done at this moment to move
towards well pre 1948 when this was one
of my name preoccupations you could
imagine moving towards it directly 48
1967 there was another possibility that
time Israel conquered the whole
territory he could have moved directly
towards some kind of federalism of the
Tigers right I wrote about it it was
bitterly denounced across the board
nobody want to hear about by 1975 that
became impossible because the
Palestinian national issue reach the
international agenda then you get the
two state efforts of overwhelming
international consensus the United
States acceptable Akkad ever since night
let's go to today what are the options
unfortunately a lot of my friends are in
this scene
they're living under is serious delusion
they don't recognize that the that the
options are not two states or one state
the options are two states or the u.s.
who exactly what they're doing and
exactly what they're doing is separating
Gaza from the West Bank in Gaza a new
prison of taking over whatever is a
valium in the West Bank we just want to
have very few Palestinians so there
won't be any part by the issue that
won't be any civil rights struggle and
they'll leave the rest of the
Palestinians volcanic comes that's the
alternative to two states what you just
described is a nice idea but it's not
one of the alternatives yeah we don't
get much about it I hear a lot about it
way too much I need to methane me you
never actually to hear much more about
it now once they when I was feasible
okay Ben from 67 to 75 you heard nothing
except a condemnation of anybody
starting to raise it starting the last
few years of the mainstream media are
willing to tolerate so you get our New
York Times
fragment I said fragment so the
interesting question is why I didn't
want to accept it now when they weren't
willing to accept it when it was
feasible and I think there's a reason
now if you there is next door
by the way they succeeded he was keeping
the principles in the back of their mind
thank you my must question is a little
personal its opportunity to answer or
not if there was god which I argue there
is God in fact I had debate with the
president of atheist organization in New
Jersey and also with the Michael Shermer
skeptic Society but if there's a God if
you had chance to ask a question and get
answer and a trailer get an answer what
would be your question to know and your
feelings or Thomas Paine if there is a
history of the world I don't see what
other first of all if it's the god of
the Old Testament did a genocide on
meaning that none of the Old Testament
Genesis idol they paired that every
cannon
I mean God is so such a genocide all
fanatic that he was willing to destroy
every living thing on earth because I'm
human being offended you know we have to
have brain check for this debate I think
I think yeah I disagree with that I
think I have very good discussion for
that but hopefully I don't know whether
you are interested to discussion of this
issue problem of evil and what was your
prayer
yeah something that wanted too many
things yeah this human species no it's
not a precipice facing disaster the
others nuclear war which gets worse over
here
there's an abstract situation I'd like
to be able to deal with those otherwise
nothing else to talk about
that's sir thank you very much more yeah
