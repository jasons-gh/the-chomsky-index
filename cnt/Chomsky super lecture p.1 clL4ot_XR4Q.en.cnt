it's it should be understood to be a
real war and it's not a new war it's an
old war furthermore it's a perfectly
conscious war everywhere but
specifically in the United States where
there happens to it's very free country
but it happens to have a highly class
conscious business class and always has
and it's very free and open so you have
a lot of information about it they talk
you have their records and they have
long seen themselves as fighting a
bitter class war except they don't want
anybody else to know about it
occasionally someone else gets the news
rather famous case which I'm sure you
know was Doug Fraser about 20 years ago
1978 I think when he pulled out of the
labor-management council and condemned
business leaders for words were roughly
like this for having decided to fight a
one-sided class war against working
people the poor the unemployed
minorities even members of the middle
class and for having torn up the fragile
social compact that had been achieved
during periods of growth and prosperity
in fact had been achieved primarily
didn't say this primarily through rather
militant struggle very militant struggle
under harsh conditions back in the 1930s
the only thing wrong with his statement
is that it was way too late in fact that
war that he's talking about was
initiated as soon as the fragile social
compact was established back in the
1930s and very openly there's no if you
that's you don't have to go to secret
records to find out about it nor do you
have to have been at the wrong end of
the clubs when the strikes were broken
up in the late 30s to know about it it
was completely public the reason it's
not well-known is because neither the
educational system nor scholarship like
our
and so on pay any attention to it it's
not a topic that studied so there's no
doubt that one of the major issues of
20th century history surely in the
United States is corporate propaganda
that's a huge industry in fact it it
extends over the obviously the
commercial media but the the whole range
of systems that reach the public the
entertainment industry of television a
good bit of what appears in the schools
a lot of what appears straight out in
the newspapers and so on huge amount of
that comes straight out of the public
relations industry which was established
in this country early in the century and
it sort of developed mainly in the 20s
and on and has become an enormous
industry it's now spreading over the
rest of the world but it's primarily
here and its goal from the beginning
perfectly openly and consciously was to
control the public mind as they put it
and the reason was that the public mind
was seen as the greatest threat to
corporations that's from early in the
century business power was strong but
it's a very free country by comparative
standards and it's hard to call on state
violence not impossible but hard to call
upon state violence to crush people's
efforts to achieve freedom and rights
and justice so therefore it was
recognized early on that it's going to
be necessary to control people's minds I
should say that's not a new insight
either you know you can read it and
David Hume and the Enlightenment where
it was already recognized and thank you
back to the earliest stirrings of
democratic revolutions in England in the
17th century and there already was
concerned that we're not going to be
able to control people by force and we
therefore have to control them by the
means controlling what they think what
they feel their attitudes their
attitudes toward one another I mean all
sorts of mechanisms of control are going
to have to be devised which will replace
the efficient use of force and violence
that was available to a much greater
extent earlier on and as has been
fortunately declining you know not
uniformly but often declining through
the years particularly here leading to
the need for other methods of control
you don't have to move very far from the
Cambridge a leak to learn about it the
major the leading figure of the public
relations industry is a highly regarded
Cambridge liberal Roosevelt Kennedy
liberal died recently Edward Bernays who
wrote the standard manual of the public
relations industry back in the 1920s
which is very much worth reading
remember I'm not talking about the right
wing here this is way at the left
liberal end of American politics his
book it's called on propaganda or maybe
just propaganda I should mention that
terminology changed during the Second
World War
prior to the Second World War the term
propaganda was used quite openly and
freely for controlling the public mind
it got bad connotations during the
second world war because of no Hitler
and that sort of thing so the term was
dropped and now there's other terms used
but if you read the literature in the
social sciences and the public relations
industry and so on back in the say
twenties and the thirties they describe
what they're doing as propaganda this
manual is for the rising public
relations industry and he opens by
pointing out that the conscious
manipulation of the organized habits and
opinions of the masses is the central is
the essential feature of a democratic
society it's the essence of democracy as
he later pointed out and he said we have
the means to carry this out now he said
we have the means to regiment people's
minds as efficiently as armies regiment
their bodies and we must do this first
of all that's the essential feature of
democracy but also sort of footnote it's
the way to maintain
power structures and authority
structures and wealth and so on roughly
the way it is it's worth remembering
something else that they usually don't
teach you very much about in school and
that is if you go back to the origins of
American society it was found that on
the principle that was stated very
explicitly by the leading framer James
Madison at the constitutional
conventions that the as he put it the
primary responsibility of government is
to protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority I and Madison
recognized a smart guy that this was
going to be a serious problem if a
democratic system were established it
was going to if people had the right to
vote he used England as his model
England was the model for democracy in
those days right it's like talking 1780s
and he pointed out in the debates on the
Constitutional Convention something
which everybody would have read in third
grade in a free society I mean this is
the origins of our society you know he
pointed out that in England if they had
the right to vote which fortunately they
didn't he said pretty soon you would
find people calling for redistribution
of property and for a tax on property
rights for what nowadays we call
agrarian reform was mostly an
agricultural society he didn't use the
term agrarian reform but the same thing
he said people will start calling for
agrarian reform obviously that's
intolerable and we have to protect our
own society against that kind of
injustice by protected by ensuring that
the rights of property prevail he
recognized that he said its problem now
he was already concerned in the 1780s by
what he called symptoms of a leveling
spirit that is people are trying to you
know feel the property oughta more
equitably distributed that's a danger
but he said that the danger is going to
become much more severe over time as
more and more people are marginalized
and dispossessed and secretly yearn for
a more a equal distribution of life's
blessings now if those people get to
vote we're going to be in trouble
because it's gonna be hard to protect
the minority the opulent against the
majority which is what government is all
about
