the box doesn't play the music all right
one thing is what is it for a second for
a second what one of the unique features
of this campaign and this is rare is the
fact that you not only get to elect the
enactment of having public power of
Industry Utility District but a
companion feature of getting elect and
'its you running for the mud board
because you can't get rid of the PG PG
any executive board of directors you
can't get rid of the appointed Public
Utilities Commission but you can elect
and you can get rid of mud board
directors so I'm going to ask mud board
directors to please stand and just
recognize that we have candidates in the
room you guys want to stand to get
around the saw well done
it's a pioneering undertaking because
how unusual this particular feature of
the campaign is so there's twice the
responsibility of educating the voters
of this particular style to campaigning
there are other candidates in the room
it's not it's an off-year election their
City turn you can as I imagine please
stand and give them a welcome if there
are
I am going to conclude you don't have to
applause quite yet and I want to ask you
to please make sure when you leave this
is our signature of fights this is the
fact that we can't afford those
ridiculous TV commercials shameful and
crafts we cannot afford well maybe we
can do something with theirs
those utility pole signs that you see
but we can do something by putting this
in your window as you leave here please

passed around we need you to volunteer

important mobilizations in the following
saturdays and sundays thereafter there
are Flyers being passed we ask you to
give at least four hours between now and
November 6 that is not much if everybody

campaign because it will be propelled by
a people filled campaign so get a signed
volunteer and let's win thank you very

Steve Williams the Green Party candidate
for City Attorney has asked for 30
seconds and kneels Eisenberg wants 30
seconds to respond all right guys each
got 30 seconds Steve Williams Green
Party candidate
thank you very much obviously the mud is
more important than any single candidacy
however the city attorney will be on the
front line of enforcing it
there's only one environmental candidate
in this race I've garnered every
environmental endorsement I have five
members of the Board of Supervisors
including Tom Ammiano Matt Gonzalez Jake
McGoldrick Aaron Peskin and Leland Yee
supporting my candidacy I ask for your
vote mr. Eisenberg 30 seconds mr.
Eisenberg come on 30 seconds or do you
already have 30 seconds to mess them up
okay thank you very very much remember
the box is on the way out and in a very
short time we'll have Ralph Nader
[Applause]
so it's really terrific to see such a
enthusiasm in the midst of tragedy which
is not to be confused with the concept
of Shady Freud's which is in getting a
pleasure out of other people's misery
recently I had a shade before attack
when they canceled the Emmys
so I now have the honor of introducing
Medea Benjamin
[Applause]
Macias is the founding director of the
San francisco-based human rights
organization global exchange and and I
was happy to say that I voted for her
which he was the Green Party candidate
for US Senate from California
[Applause]
for over 20 years she has supported
human rights and social justice
struggles around the world
her most recent work has centered on
California's energy crisis fighting the
market manipulation by the big energy
companies and rate hikes that cause
hardship for low-income ratepayers and
small businesses she has a powerful
coalition of consumer environmental
union and business leaders working for
clean and affordable power under public
control during the WTO meeting in
Seattle in December 99 global exchange
helped galvanize world attention on the
need to place labor and environmental
concerns over corporate profits San
Francisco magazine named her to their
powerless as one of the 60 players who
rule the Bay Area I've seen her on TV I
met her backstage for the first time
she's a moral powerhouse here's Medea
Benjamin
[Applause]
Oh
it's nice to be on the campaign trail
with Ralph again and this time it's two
issues one is energy and I'm running for
the mud board because I really believe
we got to take over from PG&E and the
other is a campaign around peace which
is perhaps biggest one we've been asked
two ways in our lifetime right now let
me start with the peace one I was just
interviewed by somebody on television
they said there's a 100 percent
certainty that there's going to be
another terrorist attack how do you feel
Madea are you afraid and I said of
course I'm afraid I've been I haven't
slept a good night since September 11th
does anybody here of course we're afraid
I have family in New York my family's in
the very city in Florida where they
found the anthrax outbreak I'm afraid to
get on a plane I'm afraid when my
friends and relatives and husband get on
a plane I'm afraid for where the cycle
of violence is leading us to I'm afraid
we might be getting ourselves into World
War 3 I'm afraid for what is happening
to the Afghan people right now the
millions of people that are fleeing from
the bomb I would be crazy if I were not
afraid but the problem with fear is that
it is paralyzing and right now we have
to be organizing so we have to find from
the depths of that fear and despair
we've got to find hope so where do we
find the hope I find the hope in many
places first of all while our quote
leaders like George Bush and even mayor
Giuliani and even here in San Francisco
do saying get back to normal life go out
and shop you hear that Giuliani even
said go out to the gap and Willie Brown
here is desecrated the flag and put it
on a shopping bag and said open for
business but guess what
people are more interested in other
pursuits right now now they're more
interested in family friends rebuilding
community and that's very good to the
spirit
okay
I also find hope that out of this
horrendous wave of hate crimes that has
led to deaths and stabbing and targeting
of Arab American and Muslims and those
perceived to be out of American and
Muslims has come something else we at
Global exchange have started this
campaign our community as a hate free
zone
we can't keep enough of these and stop
they are pouring and pouring out of our
office and there have been over a
thousand of them downloaded over the web
not just in the United States they're
downloading them in Europe and Australia
everywhere we have also seen that when
merchants have targeted other small
businesses come out to support them
we've had outpouring of people who want
to be trained in the accompanies
provement program to go physically with
people who have been threatened so out
of these hate crimes has come an
outpouring of love and that is by far
the most powerful weapon we have against
terrorism
[Applause]
where else why find hope before
September 11th I'm afraid that the
majority of people in this country were
in an ignorant state of bliss about the
world didn't care much about it didn't
think it was important the world stopped
at our borders and suddenly people have
to face the reality we are one of a
community of Nations and it's time we
start acting like one of a community of
nations
[Applause]
people in this country have started to
ask themselves the question I never
thought I would hear in my lifetime why
are there people around the world that
hate us and that in such a profound
question it leads to such an opening for
us to talk about issues that are
important to all of us here but we
haven't have the voice and now we can
start saying if they hate us because we
are supporting repression and Palestine
guess what let's stop reports with
supporting repression in Palestine
[Applause]
if they hate us because we have been
killing children and innocent people in
Iraq for all too long let's stop the
sanctions shop sourcing innocent people
[Applause]
and this is time what we can talk about
something very important like an
International Criminal Court that is the
place that the perfect traders of this
crime to try and we should ask why is
that the United States has refused to
sign on to the International Court and
isn't it time we do it in a hurry and
isn't it time we also signed to the
treaty against landmines but isn't it
time we've signed to the treaty against
biological and chemical weapons and
while we're at it let's sign on to the
Kyoto Accord and while we're at it let's
pledge never to walk out on a conference
as important as the conference on racism
[Applause]
and it's also a time where we can start
asking people why is it that we only had
one person in the entire Congress
incentive that stood up to George Bush
and said no to bombing that's our belief
[Applause]
where where is the other Progressive
Democrats where was russell Feingold
where was Dennis Kucinich
where was Maxine Waters Jesse Jackson
jr. Paul Wellstone where were these
people what it points up is that we need
an alternative party we need to build
the Green Party we need
[Applause]
getting before elected that brings me to
the mud campaign because this mud
campaign is intimately tied to what is
happening in the Middle East because the
foundation of US policy is based on one
little word anybody in other words
that's right and more and more so it's
based in Central Asia on another word
and that is gas natural gas the Achilles
heel of the energy system here in
California in fact there are companies
like unocal that have been dying to get
Afghanistan a pipeline through
Afghanistan over to Pakistan so we could
bring that natural gas we have to say no
to the dependence on foreign resources
we have to say no to fossil fuels we
have to say yes to energy independence
and yes to clean energy and that's what
we can do November 6 the only way we can
do it is if you join us we are having
mobilizations at the Green Party office
every single weekend every Saturday
every Sunday from now into the elections
please join us or stop by our tables and
we'll give you a precinct to walk
tonight so finally let me say that what
gives me hope is that we had an amazing
grassroots anti corporate growth
globalization movement that we were
building now we have to take that
movement and we have to merge it with
the emerging peace and human rights
movement and we have to build a movement
for economic justice for political
justice and for human rights around that
world we have to build a movement that
put life values before money values we
have to build a movement that puts the
oneness of the human family right up
front and center and in closing I want
to invite a family up here who for me
represents that oneness of the human
family this is a family that I recently
met and have grown to love and admire
the father safe
kyla and the mother angelica of shop
owners in Noe Valley their store was
attacked after September 11th they had
go home Arab repeatedly painted on the
storefront they had eggs thrown at the
window they had people come in and
verbally abuse them and then one day
their five-year-old daughter zina came
home from school and said what is the
terrorist and why are the people at
school calling me a terrorist this is a
family also I just say where the two
adult daughters two and five years old
speak both English Arabic and Spanish
they represent the best of our human
family and I'd like to come up and
acknowledge them and please give them an
incredibly warm welcome
[Applause]
Joe of our love and appreciation and the
oneness of the human family I'd like to
give them a bird of love a word of hope
a bird of peace and if the Canaries with
the brood of music as well
thank you very much make me feel very
good my family and I we have been the
victim of the hate crime
we have been verbal abuse and we have
been treated as a suspect because we are
Middle Eastern joking - Middle Eastern
is looking family there is no other
reason our business has been run the
light I'll be written Arab go home has
been tarnished go home which is my home
in San Francisco which is on very proud
[Applause]
I have my dog beautiful daughter Nina
she's five years old killed Oh God
she came one day home from the school
and she asked me what I mean
Tara I explained to her she's on the
fight field
she said why kids in the school call me
Terry
imagine this is the future generation of
the United States this is your future
America has been treated with hate and
discrimination
she has no fault just because her origin
on her her religion at the time to live
together is the time to unite it
together as American and it's the time
to raise war against the hunger against
the violation against the violence
against the AIDS against the
discrimination not to against the human
being
[Applause]
I hope the teeth for all of us
and for all of those the world united
states be a leader with compassion and
forgiving and 44 palm or discrimination
we are all American and we are proud to
be American thank you very much
[Applause]

[Applause]
a quick introduction for a individual
who wrote the mud what's the word now my
name is mud the mud initiative and who
got it on the ballot but more
importantly represented my daughter
Holly in a personal injury suit Neil
Eisenberg
[Applause]
good evening the other day yesterday
that San Francisco Weekly said that it
was going to take ten years of
litigation if the law passes and the
PG&E will be in court for ten years and
I'm here to tell you that I spent eight
years protesting a war in Vietnam and it
came to nan and I went to the University
of Wisconsin law school where we learned
the Nader School of Law and we learned
what do you do with corporations you sue
them and you sue them and you sue them
[Applause]
and I came out to San Francisco and I'm
proud to be endorsed by the Bay Guardian
and Medea Benjamin for City Attorney and
for the last three years I have gone to
court against he genie and I have sued
them and I had sued them and I have sued
them and we had that much ballad as a
result of those lawsuits
[Applause]
and when I become the Bay Guardian Medea
Benjamin city attorney I will sue them
and sue them and sue them and we will
take the power back because it is ours
[Applause]
now I'm going to introduce the man who's
going to introduce Ralph Nader a lot of
people wonder how how Nader can be so
dedicated I voted to him but I've
watched him as a heroic figure as a
moral activist for decades there's a
practice called tantric yoga which is a
discipline this is primarily a male
thing where through sheer willpower a
man can make the spermatozoa swims
backwards through the backstroke along
the shaft of his penis up the spinal
column into the cranial cavity which
cures baldness from the inside
well Ralph Nader practices the deluxe
contrary oka where the one can actually
ejaculate for two inches and then recall
it as if it were damaged parts in the
normal middle hey Ralph did you come I
can't recall
so I'm proud to introduce
[Applause]
um Nader forgive me I guess that's what
they mean by Nader's Raiders okay no

bare heads latest stay human features 13
new songs it's a woven with the tale of
an activist who is to be executed for a
murder her community is sure she didn't
commit between dramatic : reports and a
highly charged phone conversation with
the governor played by Woody Harrelson
the music is full of unflinchingly bold
and fundamentally positive lyrics stay
humans storyline also reflects Francie's
passion about the issues currently

[Applause]
yeah far from giving to the kid yo the
feminine and the masculine the pieces of
the puzzle seeming reflections in the
puddle after the storm the purple of the
sky brings to mind another time when we
desire below the waterline life was
finally human divine but in the years
following evil men came swallowing
everything excites some learn to run
some stage of fight I kneeled at the
tomb of the soldiers that I would love
behold the magic in stores it puts them
on the show
he said in time all interview a box of
life until now listen to me son be like
a kid on the drug I keep on living with
performance of the one like the heat of
the Sun or the skin on the drum I keep
on living with the song another one I
think in such a son or the skin on the
drum but not fully marinated and I'm
ready for the fire so you can fire one
fire one by the oven fully marinated and
now I'm ready for the fire so you can
fire one fire fire and it's all smoke
cleared and the police and the
protesters go home and the sting of
pepper spray remains on my list
just as the morning dew drops are the
teardrops of the night my emotions
always definitely and will never leave
you drive
[Applause]
[Applause]
thank you very much thank you Vaughn
Michael is the that was a wonderful
presentation everyone who preceded me
here I want to really thank and of
course this could have happened without
a whole bunch of volunteers and you know
who you are and I want to thank you very
much for bringing this together
[Applause]
so it's very important at a time like
this to retain our focus we just heard
our president say repeatedly that
Americans should go about their business
and we'll make reference to the the
tragedy of recent weeks but first I want
to I want to focus on what our business
is tonight which is a series of civic
rallies all over the country started in
in Portland and we've done one in
Phoenix we just did one last night in
Cleveland and now San Francisco and
having one city hand off to another as
we bring together progressive forces
civic groups who often don't connect
with one another and connect the local
issues with national issues in a
stronger democracy Drive I mean we we
just have to have a stronger deeper
democracy there's there's a reason why
people like democracy intends to solve
problems and prevent and justices and
and and meet necessities but it's a it's
a wonderful abstraction but the only
place where democracy comes before work
is in the dictionary as we all know so
we really have to work at it and what
what these realities are by not just
one-time events they're they're igniting
events of much greater proliferation in
the region where they are held so we
hope that you will carry on with other
gatherings in Marin County
in other places in the in the Bay Area
and as this momentum begins to build up
maybe we'll get a little courage on the
part of our political representatives
who are not showing much courage on
important issues confronting the country
it just saw a stampede situation in
Congress where the resolution that was
passed basically stripped Congress of
its constitutional role in in that
foreign policy situation and that
military situation it was only one
member of the entire Congress who said
that this is a Senate in the house has a
constitutional role here we shouldn't be
giving their way any kind of Stampede
panic and that was Barbara
[Applause]
you know the there were about 50 other
members like John Lewis and and Dennis
Kucinich who who really were leaning in
her direction but backed off at the last
moment and you ask why well the one easy
thing is to say well it didn't have the
political fortitude but you can't say
that Bob John Lewis I'm a huge the most
courageous fighter for civil rights and
back in the sixties when it really was
very very tough what what the real
reason is that they didn't hear enough
from back home that this looks at the
polls and every time we have a crisis in
this country in terms of any kind of
foreign threat starting with the alien
Sedition laws and going up to post-world
War one such every time we do it's the
same pattern there's a there's a
political panic that stampede a rallying
around the executive giving the
executive more power stripping it of the
court stripping the legislative branch
and now we have this added revenue of
poll after poll responding obviously to
the general question and not getting
down into the consequences of one
pathway in contrast to another so these
are these gatherings are designed to
focus on ten major advances that our
country should have achieved in the
1950s so weird
and you never postponed until next year
what should have been done in 1951 and
the first stage we call him the first
stage goals for a better America and
quite a few them had already been
accomplished in Western Europe and in
Canada coming coming out of the rubble
of World War two these countries with
their Social Democratic parties and
their strong trade union movement and
this was before the rise of the global
corporation powers they they gave their
people by law rights that we do not have
today and for example they gave their
people everyone universal health care
coverage completely
[Applause]
and you know the things that we're still
struggling for in this country even
people working for governments are
struggling for one month paid vacation
full maternity leave full family sick
leave decent public transit decent
retirement benefits much more facilities
to form trade unions and our obstructed
labor laws provides such as taft-hartley
and and after a while you begin
wondering why the richest the country in
the world is bringing up the rear on
these issues so here quickly are the
first state goals for better America
which will not be particularly new to
you but it's nice to put it into focus
and a lot of the tables and and civic
groups that are here tonight have been
fighting for parts to them and
unfortunately we must all have meant not
getting that far we have been suffering
from a weakening democracy in our
country as more and more powers in the
hands of the few corporations now have
no longer any allegiance to country or
community other than to control them as
they lie aside the giant of their their
planet they're just out of control and
you can actually have a whole list of
indicators which show that year after
year especially in the last 21 years
we've been losing ground
and when we lose ground democratically
in terms of our ability to voice ability
to remedy our ability to mobilize our
ability to connect our bili ability to
control our country as the sovereignty
of the people is supposed to have us
control as you see the decline you see
the results there's a very clear
connection between a weakening
democratic society and the problems that
grow out of that weaken that's why for
example we have 47 million workers who
don't make a living wage one out of
every three workers in this country
that's why we have a federal
minimum wage that's two dollars and
fifteen cents less in purchasing power
adjusted for inflation than it was in
1968 when the economy was half the size
in production for output per capita than
it is today
that's why we have 20% poverty here in
California it's 25% poverty University
of San Diego
Robert Falmouth professor wall give you
that data if you add the second category
which is near poverty there are two
categories Department of Labor has
poverty and near poverty forty-five
percent of the children in California
are in those two categories by the way
in the Netherlands the child poverty
rate is at three percent they're ashamed
of it want to do something about just by
contrast so
the top bosses of the bridge of 300
corporations are now making 450 times
more than the entry-level wage in their
operation 450 in 1940 the bosses paid
themselves 12 times the entry-level wage
in the richest and largest 300
corporations the top 1% of the
wealthiest people in this country have
financial wealth equivalent to the
bottom 95% of all Americans combined and
of course our public infrastructure is
crumbling in so many ways so we really
have problems and and no one's going to
solve except the people who are
organized and informed and and bringing
more people together in this way we have
far more problems than we deserve and
far more solutions than we're applying
the solutions are all over the place now
energy solutions are here there around
the country but they're not diffused in
any quantitative sense we've got
solutions in terms of what to do with
the public school system we've got
solutions and what to do with renewable
energy and dramatic new public transit
etc but we're not putting them to work
because our democracy is getting weaker
and weaker and if you are making the
decisions for the many and when that
happens they don't really care about the
money as much as they care about
themselves
[Applause]
so here the first here the 10 there very
which one is a sentence or two and just
to ask yourself aren't we up to this and
if we're not up to this we just don't
have any civic self-respect you know
we're just better at diagnosis than if
movement and and resolution and
sometimes when the the better you are at
diagnosis the less attention you pay to
movement he's so incredibly analytical
you know exactly why things aren't being
done so you don't do them so one one
enact legislation that mandates publicly
financed public elections and broad
reforms the electoral process
and that includes facilities to make it
easier for workers taxpayers consumers
and voters to band together and organize
the only way you deal with organized
money is with organized people we've got
to make it real easy for people through
the media and through facilities to band
together as it's being done here on the
public power issue about which we'll say
a few words mud and proposition I among
other propositions that are up and if
you cannot win those propositions in the
city of San Francisco given what you've
been going through these would be PG&E
ripping you off and giving their
executive bonuses and going into a
bankruptcy and siphoning billions of
dollars into their parent company which
then has other subsidiaries investing
your money in Indonesian electric plants
in South America and East Coast plant if
you cannot beat that in this compact
community that we're all told on the
East Coast is one of the most
progressive dynamic communities in all
of North America
you ought to be ashamed of yourself
[Applause]
and that means getting out the boat
enemy's going to your neighbors and your
friends and over the water cooler with
the co-workers and get-out-the-vote
85,000 folks will win all of these
propositions and sets this city on a
renewable energy efficient energy on a
reasonable price where you through the
mud utility district will control the
distribution of electricity and you know
that will make you the 22nd hundred and
one municipality that owns its own
electric system in this country so
you're not exactly pioneering you have
Sacramento that's shown you since the
nineteen forties how to do it even shut
down a nuclear plant and you're leading
in conservation that's called smut
[Applause]
you know you have athletic pride and
then your sports teams and it's time for
some civic pride it's at least as
important would you say so let let's hit
it
let's hit a civic homerun next a month
on election day ii enact living wage
laws strengthen worker health and safety
laws to repeal taft-hartley and other
obstructions to collective bargaining
and worker ride
the third third issue Environmental
Protection standard systematically
reduced damaging environmental toxic
switch is a major source of silent
violence in our country and to promote
sustainable technology
[Applause]
number four I just mentioned to provide
full Medicare coverage for everyone in
this country we revamp our national
programs for prevention of disease and
trauma prevention
five launched the national mission to
abolish poverty as other Western
democracies have done based on proposals
made long ago in this country by
conservatives liberals and progressives
including Milton Friedman and Richard
Nixon for heaven's sake
sick design and implement a national
security proud policy to counter
violence and the silent mass violence of
global diseases TV AIDS malaria and so
on environmental devastation and extreme
poverty reduce the waste and corporate
domination of defense budget a wasteful
defense is a weak defense we need we
need to learn how to wage peace and we
don't give any resources to the waging
of peace compared to the waging of war
that's not smart
[Applause]
renegotiate NAFTA and GATT to be
democratic and to be pull up not pull
down standards the subordinate labor
consumer and environmental requirement
to the supremacy of international
commerce
they end the criminal injustice system
which discriminates viciously against
the poor and people of color and reject
the failed war on drugs and replace
corporate prison with superior
alternative
9 defended strengthen the civil justice
system were wrongfully injured people
can have their full day in court against
their perpetrators like corporations who
expose them the toxic and dangerous
product apply the criminal laws against
corporate crime we need a crackdown on
crime in this week
and
and fully prosecute consumer fraud and
abuse expand consumer worker and
children's health safety and economic
rights we know how to do it
the proposals have been thought out we
need the Civic propulsion behind it
to get it done when you see how many
children this country exposed to cancer
respiratory and other toxic producing
materials in Hartford Connecticut inner
city 40% of the children suffering from
asthma and the place has quite a few
incinerators not that far away that is a
serious form of violence and maybe a
corporate form of violence that doesn't
make the inability of these children
even to breathe in the land of the free
home of the brave they'd only have the
ability to breathe it's time to really
raise that to a high high level the
priority children infants are much more
vulnerable to toxic than adults and 10
strengthen investor shareholder rights
remedies and authority over managers and
offices and board of directors of
corporations and if that means giving
labor pension funds to hold a lot of
these shares the power of ownership the
people who own the corporations don't
control them they're controlled by the
executives CEOs and a rubber-stamp Board
of Directors and end the massive
corporate welfare schemes that distort
and Mis allocate public budgets we're
where tax money goes to stadiums and
ballparks while schools clinics and
public transit systems crumble for lack
of repair
[Applause]
this it's also involved reintroducing
the historic function of using the
corporate charter which all state
governments give the corporation as an
instrument of ensuring corporate
accountability and the sovereignty of
the people over the sovereignty of
corporations remember corporations are
charted by us through our state
government they don't exist to list
their charter that means we can
condition the Charter suspend the
Charter put the corporation on probation
subjected to a three strikes in year out
provision and otherwise bring it under
the role of law
[Applause]
corporations were meant to be our
servants as they were devised in the
early 19th century they were not meant
to be our masters
[Applause]
now the proposition they're up in
November are being attacked by PG&E
using your money it's not a wonderful
thing their illegal monopoly they use
your money part of the checks you sent
of every month blasted the TV and
engaged in the usual propaganda and
distortion and falsification have little
signs on posters saying you know I saw
the today prop you know no on Prop I is
costly
can you imagine PG&E saying anything
about being costly 33% rate increases
here 45 percent rate increases they're
sucking the money out under the
deregulation here's what PG&E has done
in just five years
first if mislead the state legislature
by ramming through that legislative
deregulation monstrosity on the basis
that they were going to reduce your rate
big time starting year 2000 aren't you
saving all that money now so they
mislead then they mismanaged their own
business top-heavy would swollen
executive compensation packages to the
to the top plug people of PG&E they
mismanaged them into bankruptcy so so
now they're mischaracterizing
proposition I and the other propositions
in order to try to win in November at
the poll so you know be very very aware
of what's going on here because when we
fought for proposition 9 in 1998 year in
California statewide referendum and that
was designed to to taper off some of the
real rough edges of electric
deregulation the utility spent forty
five million dollars on TV and a beat is
overwhelmingly and they got all kinds of
front groups with nice sounding names
and they give all kinds of grants and
their foundations to various groups that
either compromised them or
them to sign on so they've come on TV
and say jeez look at the Republican
Party's against prop 9 Democratic
Party's against prop my Labor's against
frontline consumer groups are against
5/9 minority groups are against prop
knife it must be a bad thing because
they didn't say P GE and Edison funding
haulage and that they're the ones who
are really against prop none and of
course San Diego got struck first these
huge rate increases over a year and a
half ago if for low-income people you
know going from $15 or $20 to $60 or
going from $30 to $100 a month that
means something that means they're going
to go without so on on the election day
in November really get this through and
it's going to be done by word of mouth
your word amount can overwhelm their
millions on TV your word of mouth can
overwhelm those minutes on TV
[Applause]
now let's talk about the massacre of
September 11th and the and the aftermath
here how many of you just be very candid
with yourself how many of you since
September of love eleven have wanted to
express an opinion that was something
other than the Stampede thought police
process how many of you wanted to
express an opinion to a friends or
publicly what and just swallowed how
many huh
see this is the sign this is a sign of
what happens after every crisis is truth
is the first casualty candor is the
first casualty and before we even
discuss this we've got to lay down some
ground rules that this country is based
on a vigorous use of civil liberties and
constitutional freedoms and freedom of
speech because this country is based on
the premise that when governments don't
get enough influence from people around
their country the people who are going
to have to pay the price
some of them government is going to make
bad mistakes that's what a dictator does
dictator closes off all inputs dictator
thinks he knows everything how to
proceed and that's why they make serious
mistakes thank goodness they make those
mistakes it's about the only thing that
doesn't mend their own hubris their own
arrogance their own secrecy their own
domineering input now what we have to do
is to lay the groundwork and we can use
the words of our leaders in the last few
weeks and I'll share them with you
okay George W Bush says to Congress in
his statement to Congress referring to
the terrorists quote they hate our
freedoms our freedom of religion our
freedom of speech our freedom to vote
our freedom to assemble and our freedom
to disagree with each other and quote ok
now we're free to disagree all right he
also said today Americans should go
about their business well that's what
we're doing President Bush we're going
to buy out this I wonder how he applies
a one of his most frequent statements
last year I just would I could only read
his mind his most frequent statement on
the campaign trail last year was quote I
trust the people not the government
unquote well Abraham Lincoln had
something to say about that I just said
quote I am a firm believer in the people
if given the truth they can be depended
upon to meet any national crisis the
great point is to bring them the real
facts unquote
[Applause]
now I like most of you when you heard
the news and 6000 people's lives were
extinguished in less than an hour like
most people the grief in the morning
gives way to how can we honor their
memory I remember one story it was told
that was that happened on the 70th floor
of the World Trade Center there was a
quadriplegic who went there every day to
work and as the sirens and the fumes and
the smokes and pandemonium and people
rushing by him to get out of that
building he couldn't get out of that
building and a 55 year old man was his
coworker and his close friend and called
his family on the cell phone and he said
I can't leave him and he went down with
him he didn't leave him how do we honor
the memory of people with that kind of
valor and with that kind of loyalty to
one another and I suggest we do it in a
very very deliberate systematic and
thoughtful way and we've got to do it in
a variety of ways we're not a one-track
country we have to do in a variety of
ways because what is opening up out of
this disaster is one of the most
comfortable complicated and perilous
military and foreign policy moves that
our country has engaged in in quite a
long time and we've got to be involved
in how it's going to be shaped or
redirected or replaced with better
policies first of course this is an
international crime is not the only
international crime it is an
international crime of major proportions
and we've got to find ways by which
these criminals who back the attackers
are brought to justice that's one way we
have to honors remember
okay
second there would be entitled to know
why thirty billion dollars a year in our
intelligence agencies could not uncover
a four year plan by these attackers who
left tracks all over the East Coast
month after month and these are the same
intelligence agencies who understand
that they failed because one they don't
communicate with each other and there
are all kinds of jealousies and they're
falling all over each other and there
are tens of thousands of each other and
now they're asking for more money
they're asking for more money
well it isn't more money that's going to
get better intelligence it's less money
[Applause]
as a head of the CIA said the other day
they're drowning in technology and they
need more human intelligence I thought
that was the only intelligence there was
third we have to make sure that we don't
give up our civil liberties and civil
rights and constitutional freedoms
because not just because that's what
they want us to do which is the usual
explanation we've got a more fundamental
reason because that's what we're all
about
that's how we foresee and forestall
that's how we try to contribute to a
safer and peaceful world by using these
constitutional freedoms and we have to
also be careful the future attacks are
not made on our country by making
mistakes abroad and worsen the situation
we have to make sure we have to make
sure in other words that our president
and his cabinet do not endanger the
United States of America and slaughter
hundreds of thousands of innocent people
abroad by not being held in check and
not having the full input of the best
ideas suggestions and historical
knowledge brought forth by the American
people
[Applause]
you
and we have to make sure the important
domestic problems projects and missions
which are life and death missions as
universal health care is and environment
and health and safety child protection
that those are not shunted aside as they
seem to be now by this focus on this
tragedy let me just run through what I
mean by always because it's very
important to get down to a little detail
let's take for example the issue of
civil liberties there is no one in
Washington who will say we are going to
restrict our civil liberties in order to
enhance our national security they will
say we have to engage in some
inconvenience in order to enhance our
national security the former head of the
CIA in charge of Middle East operations
was on sixty minutes about two weeks ago
and Mike Wallace asked them this
explicit question you said this is -
Frank Anderson is it mr. Anderson how
much of our civil liberties are we going
to have to give up and here is there is
response quote absolutely none if we
cannot handle this problem without
surrendering our civil liberties or
constitutional freedoms I do not want to
live in this country and I do not want
to offer my son up to it end quote
that is Frank Anderson talking Frank and
you
and when the former head of the Middle
East operations for the CIA something
like says something like that he
deserves to be quoted doesn't it all
right so what is John Ashcroft do the
same John Ashcroft that could have been
defeated in terms of his nomination we
had a little backbone in the US Senate
he sent over a proposal under the cloak
of fighting terrorism that United the
right wing and the liberal in the House
of Representatives on when you get
Barney Frank and Bob Barr on the same
side saying we don't want this kind of
big brother we don't want this kind of
invasion of the rights of innocent
people under the pretext of having this
as a necessary brace of tools to deal
with the terrorists then you can see how
bad it really was and it was infringing
on the confidentiality of the grand jury
proceedings massive surveillance that
could apply in later years to millions
of innocent people that have nothing to
do with this situation it involves the
detention of people with a very cleverly
drafted phrase that could keep them
indefinitely without presenting charges
against them and you know how animal
that is to our democratic traditions and
sense of justice not to mention other
other parts as well without much valley
who they've shaved off some of these
provisions and in the House of
Representatives they put a two-year
limitation on the legislation so they
would say well look at it completely new
two years to not the Senate version does
not have a two year or any cutoff so far
and that is now being being deliberated
but the bottom line of these proposals
is to stripped our rights of judicial
review and the rights of immigrants the
judicial review and also to vastly
strengthen the forces of the executive
branch and that really sort of upsets
the whole checks and balances concept of
our founding fathers but as the
president University of Michigan said
the other day
this is what happens after a crisis in
our history they moved to restrict our
constitutional freedoms and it's our
role to make sure the way we contact our
Senators and Representatives and all the
modes of communication that we have
personal letter phone email whatever to
make them realize that while we don't
have the details that are not exactly a
bunch of town meetings all over the
country deliberating this potential
surrender of our civil liberties that we
expect them to stand tall and not be
stampeded and to and to make sure that
then the necessary enforcement tools if
they don't have the necessary
enforcement tools they seem to have
plenty for years do not compromise the
rights of people they go about their
daily work and develop a huge big
brother in terms of all kinds of
surveillance an invasion of proper
judicial review recourse by the American
people so that's one area that we really
have to deal with and one area that we
can in the next few days and weeks have
an important impact over now let me
discuss the the issue of power and
vulnerability we are the most powerful
economic and military force in the world
but what we don't give sufficient
credence to is that we are also probably
the most vulnerable country in the world
because of our technology
interdependence and complexity the
attacks on those buildings on September
11 shot down our country for a week and
are now producing panic and fear and
economic dislocation and forthcoming
government deficits and a huge shift of
money into the military budget and
everybody is clawing with any power in
Washington to take away the the kind of
resources that were supposed to be
distributed to the people this country
in various categories of need and so
this is a this is a sign that we are
extremely vulnerable
and and and the other side the attackers
don't have that much power but they are
very less vulnerable they're willing to
sacrifice their lives as they did so
they have little power but to have far
less vulnerability we have a lot more to
lose and if we don't realize that we
will not be as cautious as smart and
deliberate and strategic and long-range
thinking and willing to try alternatives
that don't have massive and complicated
boomerangs in future years as our past
blunders overseas have that's why we
gotta focus not just on our power but on
our vulnerability
now Donald Rumsfeld secretary to pay
defend
said said the other day something that
wasn't widely reprinted and he said
quote poverty disease illiteracy can be
breeding grounds for tolerance of
terrorists end of quote
linkie - it's very important to have
that recognized by the Secretary of
Defense he was at Princeton with me a
year ahead of me and sometimes I can
read him when he's when he's on TV has
that pained look in his in his visage
quite different from his deputy mr.
Wolfowitz you know what I found in
Washington Alaska month or so that both
in the press and in our government there
is a heavy preponderance of war hawks
who have never worn a uniform compared
to those who have worn a uniform who are
trying to be a little bit more cautious
maybe rush limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly
and Brit Hume and Dick Cheney and
Wolfowitz and others Ottawa go over
there
[Applause]
others raises issue of foreign policy
and here's where the thought police
comes in in Washington whenever you try
to say we know this is this is rather
intricate these are these attackers are
not just out for economic gain they're
not like corporations marauding they got
something in their mind that leads them
to this and don't you think we should
know our adversary and that comes with
thought police
that's justifying what they did no
that's not justifying what they did what
they did was criminal butchery
who is a massacre more than was attack
but we don't understand what motivated
to this prolonged plan and this suicide
mission we are not going to understand
whether there is anything we can do then
we'll have a lot of beneficial
collateral benefits as well preventing
future attacks now in their writings in
their writing
a young scholar went through their
writings and final statements etc and
here's what they said they are very
upset at our military presence in Saudi
Arabia and our support of secular
dictatorships in the Islamic world I
mention secular because not all Muslims
are viewed as fanatics over there they
want to practice their religion they
want to wear their clothing the way
their traditions provide and the secular
dictatorships have been offending a lot
of peaceful Islamic gathering and a lot
of peaceful Islamic customs and they
resent that and they ask themselves well
who is supporting these secular
dictatorships and the answer more often
than not is the United States militarily
and and in terms of tax dollars so
that's one thing that's in their mind
we'll get to that in a moment
the second is that the economic
sanctions not the military sanctions on
the Iraqi people are killing a lot of
children and innocent men and women that
has been documented repeatedly by the
American physicians task force that has
gone over there and the United Nations
how is that occurring it is occurring in
violation of major international
conventions and treaties you do not
attack a dictator by destroying the
lives of innocent people civilians in
that country indeed
and he has cement by the physicians task
force is 5000 Urraca children among our
dining they're dying from two major
sources one is I mean a dictator doesn't
care about them
it's not enough for Matt on al bright
albright to say it's Saddam besides his
fault it's his fault we know what he's
up to he doesn't care about the question
is what are we doing
what is Britain doing what is what are
other nations doing with this kind of
boycott and one of the third-person
things we did is we destroyed their
public infrastructure in the bombs in
1991 that destroyed their electricity
system and their drinking water
purification system and those documents
have now been printed in the current
issue the progressive magazine and a
cover story out of Madison Wisconsin and
that led of course to contaminated water
and the little children are much more
vulnerable and they're dying from
dysentery from grievous diarrhea from
cholera from typhoid etc now to destroy
the public infrastructure and the
drinking water purification systems and
then boycott the export of chlorine the
export of all kinds of equipment to
repair it is not going to destabilize
Saddam Hussein he's going to get his
drinking water he's here to get his
health care he's going to be able to
point to the foreign Devils who are
taking the lives of little children in
Baghdad as a way to further entrench his
power
you do not destabilize the dictator by
destroying the lives of little children
and innocent adults in his review
[Applause]
and this is Clinton Gore's
responsibility Madeleine Albright net
celebrated interview Linda
Leslie saw had 1996 when she went over
to Baghdad and saw the dying children
and came back and did something for 60
minutes and she interviews Madeleine
Albright and she says looked good
Madam Secretary here is what we found
XYZ ABC what do you think is it worth
the price
and she said taken as a whole it's worth
the price I mean who's paying the price
alright the third of course is that
these people see that our country is
supporting the Israeli occupation of
Palestinian territory and that support
is coming in the form of military
financial support and Israel now is the
secure is it's ever likely to be
according to the Jaffa Institute of
Strategic Studies in that country they
are a military powerhouse visa vie their
surrounding countries their
technological and educational and
economic powerhouse and their net need
for security has been established and
they're backed by the United States the
question is whether we can balance that
Palestinian justice in order to develop
a peaceful settlement in that region and
in the negotiations at Taba last year
they came very very close but there are
forces on both sides who don't want it
and we can see the result and that is a
constant television program on on Al
Jazeera television that millions of
people in the Islamic and Arab world see
again and again and again and it's very
important to ask ourselves if that is
what is in their minds and if Donald
Rumsfeld's right that that poverty and
disease and illiteracy and repression
our breeding grounds to tolerate this
kind of violent behavior that we saw on
September 11th then are we candid enough
to look ourselves in the eye and ask
whether these foreign policies are
representing the best instincts of the
American people in whose names that they
are
being perpetrated and I suggest that we
have to have a prolonged and detailed
debate on foreign policy now in in the
coming month so RiRi orient we reorient
[Applause]
so we reorient so we reorient our
foreign policy in the post-soviet era
when we no longer can use repressive
policies in order to ward off the the
communist powers that's over with now
it's all been ten years what's what's
the pretext now and what we have to ask
is when are we going to turn our great
beneficent society assistance and
humanity to support democratic forces in
this country and side with the millions
and millions of workers and peasants for
a change instead of dictators and
Aligarh
[Applause]
it's amazing who we alai with who we
don't alai live in our in our world and
you know a little bit of history will
give us a little sobriety in these
moments of impetuousness a little
sobriety some of you may remember when
France controlled Algeria as a colony
and Algeria erupted in the revolution in
1960s and there is huge bloodshed in
Algeria and the Algerian revolutionaries
took it to France proper and there is
bombs and terror in Paris and elsewhere
and the generals in Algeria representing
president de gaulle's regime were saying
to de Gaulle we want more military power
we want to wipe out this this
insurrection this revolution we want to
bomb them into state into the into the
Stone Age and if you don't give us what
we need we're going to overthrow you
we're going to fly right into Paris and
overthrow you and General de Gaulle who
is not one to be intimidated decided
that the best way to cool the situation
down was to give algerian their freedom
and that was the end of the riot and
that was the end of the bombing
successful
when we caught the Nazi mass murderers
right at World War two and you want to
talk about mass murderers these fellows
set new records and we could when we
caught Goering and gurgles and
Ribbentrop and all those they could have
been immediately disposed of by our
soldiers immediately on the spot when
Germany had already killed 160 thousand
American troops and we didn't do that we
set up the Nuremberg war
trials we're at war crimes tribunal
because we wanted to set their vicious
record on the record for the whole world
to the whole we gave him defense counsel
we had due process and we wanted to
reassert a new expansion of
international law to deal with war
criminals and they were convicted and
most of them were executed now just
think of the restraint that that took at
that time and we held the rule of law
and we've got to move forward in
apprehending these people under the
variety of rules of law and
international conventions that we our
warrant of Howe
[Applause]
and use what the Bush administration has
been referring to his diplomatic and
economic and political methods having
told us that the the military solution
is not going to be the one that's going
to win well and remember when Gerald
Douglas MacArthur occupied Japan after
the defeat the Japanese Empire and he
had to think of how he was going to
occupy Japan now Japan's the Japanese
Empire killed millions of people in
Korea Philippines China they destroyed
whole societies they killed a lot of our
soldiers too he could have gone in there
with the US Army Air Force and Navy and
put a very very tough regime on those
people instead he he consulted with
various people in our country who a lot
about Japanese culture including Ruth
Benedict they had anthropologists who
wrote a book called the chrysanthemum
and the sword on Japanese culture and
she said to him general whatever you do
in your occupation do not humiliate them
and he took that advice and he didn't
humiliate them he actually advanced
levels of democracy he kept the emperor
as a figurehead and he brought the
economy around before we left
think of the self-restraint that was
involved there and didn't it come out
better then a brutal occupation would
have come out because he didn't
humiliate them and yeah after World War
one when we defeated the Kaiser the
Allies we humiliated the Germans with
the Treaty of Versailles that crushed
any attempt to recover economically and
humiliated him in a whole variety of
ways as historians have documented and
that was the breeding ground for that
Austrian adult Hitler to rise to power
in the 1930s when are we going to learn
from history when are we going to stop
thinking that we can just bomb our way
to justice well we're not going to be
able to bomb our way
[Applause]
because here is what's going to happen
if we continue on the path of the last
six days let's talk about the people of
Afghanistan 99% of which has nothing to
do with this are trying to feed their
families get enough work so they can
just get get through the day and you
know they've been destroyed by the the
Soviets and before that the British and
their own tribal warfare well in four
weeks the winner will be in Afghanistan
according to United Nations there are
seven point five million Afghans who are
on the board verge of starvation with
their families they don't know where the
next meal is coming from
and what are we doing in order to
apprehend the attackers we are bombing
that country all over or say we're just
hitting military targets how many times
have you heard that before
remembering the Iraqi bombing we just
hit military targets oh yeah we just
bombed a bomb shelter that had 2,000
huddling Iraqis men women and children
with these bombs that go deep
underground and blow them apart
completely incinerated them and we knew
there was a bomb shelter and that has
never been satisfactorily excellent
explained although the press has done
very good reporting on so this business
of pinpoint bomber forget it when you
bomb every airport and destroy every
airport in Afghanistan how are you going
to fly relief rations in case the family
how are you going to ship medicine in
case of dire epidemics there's no such
thing as just military target bombing
and when you bum
[Applause]
then when you when you and when you bomb
out the electricity in Kabul as we just
did that means that there's no
electricity for the drinking water
purification systems and here we go
again and the little children are going
to be the chief sufferers along with
their mamas and daddies with typhoid and
cholera and dysentery and he's horrible
gastrointestinal diseases but we knocked
out their electricity systems we knocked
out their electricity system we have
declared war on Afghanistan without
asking the Senate to declare war as the
framers of our Constitution provided for
as a safe
[Applause]
the UN has now stopped convoys the food
Afghanistan they've already had for
their age people at least killed by the
bombs so there's no there's no food in
terms of food aid to these impoverished
people by international institutions and
what are we substituted well we've got
it we've got a new version of the first
war of the 21st century it's called
bombs away with rations and snacks there
are seven a half million people who need
food and we've dropped 135 thousand
snack probably not 10% of which will
ever reach these people to begin with
how cheap how cheap is this propaganda
how cheap is this propaganda it's going
to get more rancid and more grim look at
this description from from an article in
a British paper says if I can find it
here in the meantime here it is this
show of generosity meaning the rations
is of course designed to impress us as
well as them the yellow packages and I'm
quoting drifting on to the minefields of
the Hindu Kush are likely to be the most
over the next few days that we will see
of the humanitarian crisis in
Afghanistan the hungry will die quietly
on the Forgotten trails through the
mountains huddled behind rocks searching
the streets of deserted cities clawing
for roots in the empty fields the
satellites that can count the shell
stack behind the howitzer cannot hear
into the faces of the starving and quote
this is exactly the kind of devastation
those attackers want us to inflict in
order to spread more hatred and more
resentment and more rebellion
in our country and our allies
[Applause]
for those of you who want a local
explanation of the roots of terrorism I
refer you to the subject to the
editorial in the September 30th edition
of the San Francisco Chronicle the
editorial which had a very good analysis
of asking the important questions which
today are considered the impertinent
questions and the Chronicle says to ask
those questions is not unpatriotic
nor do historical explanations absolve
those who have committed the tiniest
heinous crimes whether or not history
can help us heal it can offer up the
perspective and wisdom we need to fight
this unprecedented threat and then it
goes through explaining why the Islamic
world is upset with us and that was your
own paper and what have what some have
called an uncharacteristic demonstration
of analytic candor
now in in the midst of this situation
comes the big corporations in Washington
these are corporations who are turning
this tragedy into green and then into a
pre-test
demanding from Congress in the executive
branch subsidies bailout immunity from
liability demanding deregulation they're
going big for it folks they're taking
advantage of this crisis in order to
increase their power over the rights of
the people they're moving to put a
little amendment it will open up the
Arctic refuge after after 26 years of
not improving bylaws the fuel efficiency
requirements for the motor vehicle
industry they are now moving for a
capital gains cup they are moving to
bailout one industry after another the
airline's got theirs after announcing 85
thousand workers layoffs they got 15
billion dollars 10 billion and loan
guarantees and 5 billion in cash just
like that
stampeding a congress and sending the
bill to a willing george w bush with
nothing in it for 85,000 workers who are
laid off this is what's going on
[Applause]
now the hotel industry the car rental
industry's up there
going for the big crowd the oil industry
the securities industry going for the
big crowd suddenly Uncle Sam is a
desirable man suddenly they all want
government to be the ultimate guarantor
the ultimate insure or the ultimate bail
our outer of this kind of corporate
capitalism and isn't that on trade Reata
you know we never say corporations are
unpatriotic do we yeah we never say that
well they are exploiting this tragedy to
a level where they were denounced a few
days ago by a brilliant article in The
Washington Post itself in the business
page which had a headline something like
stop blaming everything on Bin Ladin
they're blaming all their woes going
back several years saying it was the
attackers that we got to have a bailout
we got to have a subsidy you got to get
us exemption from this law
you got to deregulate us here and of
course they're getting away with it
because our Congress is being stampeded
it's in a panic and we've got to
strengthen it and give us the kind of
backbone that comes only from people
back home so you really have to in
whatever area you want to work it in
this in this subject matter
contact your your members of Congress
and in many ways when they come back
here during the recess give them an
earful give them an earful tell them
that you expect them to have modest
profile of courage very modest profiles
of courage they don't even give you
their voting record on their website
they're only two members of Congress
both Republicans who put their voting
record on their website and Frank wolf
and Christopher Shay's so while you're
talking to them tell them you want to
connect every cradle with the Internet
why don't you connect your voting record
with your website
[Applause]
let me end on this note and I think we
think we've had a lot of good talk this
evening long overdue but just give it
yourself your own test if in the coming
weeks you inhibit what you really want
to say about these situations you're
inhibiting the quality of democracy in
our society and once you once you
consider your own level of inhibition to
be unacceptable in terms of your own
self-respect you'll find it to be
contagious the reason why democracies
always defeat dictatorships is because
they're more open to review to criticism
to proposals to new ideas and to
challenges of the conventional wisdom
that's why they always are stronger and
we should never allow anyone in
Washington and in positions of political
power to say to us in times of crisis
shut up America get in line and just
wave the flag because you should never
let anybody take that flag away from you
[Music]
that flag was not that flag was not
designed to be a bandana or a fig leaf
it was designed to stand for the last
fewer of our Pledge of Allegiance which
are quote with liberty and justice for
all
end quote and never you let anyone else
forget that when they take their flat
your flag away from you and turn it into
an instrument of silence of your voice
and your First Amendment right
[Applause]
Oh
for me
when you hear discussions of moving
through violent warfare to achieve a
rather focused end as defined by our
president you're entitled to ask what
price violence how many hundreds of
thousands of Afghani are going to die or
starve to death or be fixed to death
because they don't have medicines as a
result of this destruction what's the
likelihood of more attacks in our
country what is the likelihood of
subordinating our domestic programs of
Social Security Medicare health
insurance children's care environment
education which are now on the shelf how
much of that price are we going to pay
how much of the price are we going to
pay of shoveling tens of billions of
dollars into a military budget and
intelligence budget that needs to be
more lean and more than me and more
effective rather than more overflowing
with dollars and how much price are we
going to pay for spilling over into more
deficit funding in the coming years what
is the price we're willing to pay here
as this effort unfolds with its enormous
complexity and repercussions
through one country in one continent
around the world what is the price we're
willing to pay this is a question that
we must ask our leaders what is the
price that you are willing to pay they
don't want to talk about that when you
wage feet and you move with muscular
international law enforcement and
criminal law enforcement and you utilize
your own allies and utilize the United
Nations and you move forward on all
those grounds you know that those prices
that brutality and violence and bombing
will exact will not be exactly in this
manner we don't know which pathway is
going to come out the best except from
our historical perspective and our
historical perspective tells us that
this kind of mindless destruction of the
nation of its infrastructure
of its drinking water systems of its
food relief I is not going to end well
for them and I fear it's not going to
end well for us either and we've got to
begin probing this as we see the death
toll mount in Afghanistan I'd like to
end on this note
you've got window signs for the
propositions we do want to focus on that
there are volunteers who are needed you
can on your way out there are tables who
will give you window signs volunteers
there are four weeks left they need your
contributions in order to pay printing
bills and telephone bills and and it's
very important to to focus on all those
four propositions but if I have to pick
one if you don't have much time to talk
with your neighbors on this I would pick
the proposition I because that's the one
that sets up the enabling Municipal
Utility District that will deal with
solar energy renewable energy and it
will set a model for the rest of the
country thank you very much for coming
[Applause]
thank you
[Applause]
you've been great thank you very much
let's hear it for everybody here
remember get a window sign on your way
out putting them in your windows let's
win this campaign volunteer mobilization
is four weekends left and drop some
money thank you
[Applause]
