after the Vietnam War elites were
concerned about what they called a
crisis of democracy in fact one of the
most interesting books on this topic or
one of the most interesting books on
most of the insightful books I think on
modern on the modern democratic system
is called the crisis of democracy it's a
study the only book-length study
published by the trilateral commission
it's important group put together by
David Rockefeller in 1973 and it
represents the more or less liberal
internationalists from the three major
centers of modern capitalism the United
States Western Europe and Japan and its
trilateral and remember this is the
Liberals this is the group out of which
Jimmy Carter and most of his
administration came the quite what's the
crisis of democracy that they're
concerned with in all of the democratic
societies well the crisis is that during
the 1960's large groups of people who
are normally passive and apathetic began
to try to enter the political arena to
press their demands and that's a crisis
which has to be overcome so the naive
might call that democracy but that's
because they don't understand the
sophisticated understand that that's a
crisis of democracy the American
spokesmen again Samuel Huntington wrote
in his report that Harry Truman had been
able to govern the country with the
cooperation of a relatively small number
of Wall Street lawyers and bankers in
those days there was no crisis of
democracy things were working just right
but in the 1960s you got all this
turmoil I mean young people and women
and labor and all kinds of weird people
who were supposed to be sitting quietly
and the corners began to get involved
and caused this crisis I'm in the same
crisis that arose in the 17th century
and there repeatedly arises when people
begin to try to take advantage of the
formal opportunities that exist among
the terrible things that were happening
during the 60s causing this crisis they
said was that you had this group of
people who they called the value
oriented intellectuals people who are
concerned with things like truth and
justice and all that sort of nonsense
and they're opposed to the good guys the
technocratic and policy oriented
intellectuals they called the common
source that ones who just do the job
which had these value Airy ended
intellectuals they were doing all sorts
of horrible things like undermine D
legitimizing the institutions that are
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young like schools and universities
remember there's an internal discussion
so they kind of let their hair down
there are general proposal at the end of
all of this is lengthy and thoughtful
discussions was that what we need is
more moderation and democracy to
mitigate the excess of democracy and
overcome the crisis in plain terms what
that means is the public has to be
reduced to their proper state of apathy
and obedience and driven from the public
arena if democracy is to survive and the
appropriate sentence with the
specialized class you know the cool
observers smart guys the technocratic
and policy or intellectuals doing our
job in the interests of the people who
have real power
that's the liberal side I won't go into
what the reactionary side says
