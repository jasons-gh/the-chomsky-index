in our series the world after
coronavirus today and bring you the
first part of a two-part conversation
with Professor Noam Chomsky longtime
professor at MIT and now in Arizona
we'll ask him what he thinks a post
coronavirus were might look like for
neoliberalism we can begin by asking why
we have the pandemic all together
the causes are pretty obvious it begins
with a colossal market failure it was
well known certainly after the SARS
epidemic in 2003 he's well known to
scientists that San demux are very
likely to recur to problems roads one
the corporate sector is the drug
companies are simply not interested they
react to market signals market signals
tell you there's no profit in trying to
prepare for a major catastrophe down the
road there are other than short-term
ways of making profit that are much
better so that they'd simply weren't
interested at that point in a rational
world the government could step in move
right away to would prepare for a crisis
to work on the vaccines but you could
ensure scare capacity and hospitals
diagnostic capacity spare beds and so on
but the government is not allowed to
step in because of a dogma that was
instituted in the early age Ronald
Reagan was the spokesperson for it
government is the problem it's not the
solution now of course that means
government is the solution when the
corporate sector and the wealthy are in
trouble but when it's the fate of the
population that's concerned government
is the problem not the answer so there's
kind of a double whammy ordinary
capitalist logic tells private sectors
not going to do anything the new
the rule when played tells you the
government can't step in so you're stuck
this was dramatized strikingly in the
case of woods right now the lethal wood
roadblock in proceeding namely shortage
of ventilators result now hospitals
doctors and nurses are struggling to
decide who to kill because they are
permanent offender leaders use listens
you see actions by anyone that the rest
of the worker down from the countries
that are well organized dealt with it
China produced information very rapidly
and contrary to us often being said the
US intelligence knew all about it they
spent two months january/february trying
to reach someone in the White House
Trump was out playing golf or do
anything
in contrast the Asian countries Taiwan
South Korea responded added more of us
under control the New Zealand apparently
has it totally under control in Europe
most of the countries kind of did it but
the better organized countries reacted
so Germany with spare diagnostic
capacity possible athletes has what
seems to be the lowest death rate in the
world so there are things that could be
done there's no reason why we can't rise
to the level of other developed
countries and indeed many under
development and introduce in a humane
system of universal health care do you
think that's given the global scale and
the size of what we have seen the
neoliberal model or the capitalist model
will face a serious challenge most of it
so as usual the major corporations are
putting aside their copies of in your
hand and rushing to the knighting state
and asking to be bailed out well maybe
it's necessary in the short
but that should come with strong
conditions so that one condition should
mean a ban on stockpiles which they've
been indulging in to enrich themselves
absolutely been a ban on use of tax
havens absolute ban does that contou
pian not a role that was the law and it
was enforced until Reagan changed not
that's not small change that's tens of
trillions of dollars and we should ask
ourselves considering the roots of the
crisis is that the world we want to live
in a world in which major decisions are
handed over to unaccountable private
institutions which are committed only to
Greens basically listen to Milton
Friedman that require
