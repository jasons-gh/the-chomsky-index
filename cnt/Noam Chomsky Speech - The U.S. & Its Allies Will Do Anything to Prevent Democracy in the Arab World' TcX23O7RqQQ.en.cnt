that was Bob Marley as we turn now to
the 25th anniversary of fair the
fairness and accuracy in reporting the
media watch group in New York which just
celebrated the 25 years of the reports
they've come out documenting media bias
and sponsorship and censorship and
scrutinized media practices that
marginalize Public Interest minority and
dissenting viewpoints one of those who
addressed the hundreds of people who
gathered to celebrate fair was the
world-renowned political dissident and
linguist Noam Chomsky this is some of
what he had to say the US and its allies
will do anything they can to prevent
authentic democracy in the Arab world
the reason is very simple
across the region an overwhelming
majority of the population there regards
the United States as the main threat to
their interests in fact the opposition
to US policy is so high that a
considerable majority think the region
would be more secure if Iran had nuclear
weapons in Egypt the most important
country that's eighty percent similar
figures elsewhere there are some in the
region who regard Iran as a threat
about 10 percent well plainly the US and
its allies are not going to want
governments which are responsive to the
will of the people
if that happens not only will the u.s.
not control the region but it'll be
thrown out so that's that's obviously an
intolerable result in the case of
WikiLeaks there was an interesting aside
on this the revelations from WikiLeaks
that got the most publicity headlines
you for a commentary and so on were that
the Arabs support US policy on Iran they
were quoting comments of Arab dictators
yes they claimed the support US policy
on Iran there was no mention
of the Arab of the Arab population
because it doesn't matter if the
dictators support us and the populations
under control then what's the problem
it's like imperialism what's the problem
if it works as long as they can control
their populations fine they can have
campaigns of hatred our friendly
dictators will keep them under control
that's the reaction not just of the
Diplomatic Service in the State
Department or of the media who reported
this but also of the general
intellectual community there is no
comment on this in fact coverage of
these polls is precisely zero in the
United States literally there's a few
comments in England but very little it
just doesn't matter what the population
thinks as long as they're under control
well from these from these observations
you can conclude pretty quickly pretty
easily what policies are going to be you
can almost spell them out so in the case
of an oil-rich country with a reliable
obedient dictator they're given free
rein Saudi Arabia is the most important
there were protests that's the most
repressive extremists
strongest center of Islamic
fundamentalism missionaries who spread
ultra radical Islamism from jihadis and
so on but they're obedient they're
reliable so they can do what they like
there was a planned protest in Saudi
Arabia the police presence was so
overwhelming and intimidating that note
literally nobody even was willing to
show up in the streets of Riyadh but
that was fine the same in Kuwait
there was a small demonstration very
quickly crushed
comment actually the most interesting
case in many respects is bahrain behind
is quite important for two reasons
the one reason which has been reported
is that it's the home port of the u.s.
5th fleet major major military force in
the region
another more fundamental reason is that
bahrain is about 70 percent Shiite and
it's right across the causeway from
Eastern Saudi Arabia which also is
majorities Shiite and happens to be
where most of a Saudi oil is the Saudi
Arabia of course is the main energy
resource has been since the forties by
curious accident of history and
geography the world's major energy
resources are located pretty much in
Shiite regions their minority and in the
Middle East but they happen to be where
the oil is right around the northern a
part of the Gulf
that's eastern Saudi Arabia so in Iraq
and southwestern Iran and there's been a
concern among planners for a long time
that there might be a move towards some
sort of tacit alliance in these Shiite
regions moving towards independence and
controlling the bulk of the world's oil
that's obviously intolerable so going
back to befriend the there was an
uprising tent city in the central square
like Taher square the Saudi suti LED
military forces invaded Bahrain giving
the security forces there the
opportunity to crush it violently
destroyed the tent city even destroyed
the Pearl which is the symbol of Bahrain
invaded the major hospital complex
throughout the patients and the doctors
been regularly every day arresting human
rights activists torturing them
occasionally is sort of a patent the
wrists but nothing much that's very much
the Carruthers principle if actions
correspond to our strategic and economic
objectives that's okay you know we can
have elegant rhetoric but what matters
is facts well that's the oil-rich
obedient dictators what about Egypt most
important country but not a center of
major center of oil production well in
Egypt and Tunisia and other countries of
that category there is a game plan which
is employed routinely so commonly it
takes virtual genius not to perceive it
but when you have a favored dictator for
those of you might think of going into
the Diplomatic Service you might as well
learn it when there's a favored dictator
and he's getting into trouble support
him as long as possible
full support as long as possible when it
becomes impossible to support him like
say maybe the army turns against him
business class turns against him then
send him off somewhere issue ringing
declarations about your love of
democracy and then try to restore the
old regime
maybe with new names and that's done
over and over again it doesn't always
work but it's always try Somoza
Nicaragua shot Iran Marcos and the
Philippines
Duvalier in Haiti in China and South
Korea
butdo in the Congo Ceausescu was one of
Western favorites and Romania Suharto
and Indonesia it's completely routine
and that's exactly what's going on in
Egypt in Tunisia
okay we support him right to the end
in Egypt right to the end keep
supporting him doesn't work any longer
sent them off the shaman will shift pull
out the rhetoric try to restore the old
regime that's in fact what the conflict
is about right now as Amy said we don't
know where it's going to turn out but
that's what's going on well there's
another category the other category is
an oil-rich dictator who's not reliable
who's a loose cannon
that's Libya and there there's a
different policy try to get a more
reliable and dictator and that's exactly
what's happening
of course describe it as a humanitarian
intervention that's another near
historical Universal you check history
virtually every resort the force by
whoever it is is accompanied by the most
noble rhetoric it's all completely
humanitarian now that includes Hitler
taking over Czechoslovakia the Japanese
fascists rampaging and in northeast
China in fact it's Mussolini and
Ethiopia this is hardly any exceptions
it's let's say you produced that and the
media and commentators present and
pretend they don't notice that it has no
carries no information because it's
reflexive and then but in this case they
could also add something else which has
been repeated over and over again namely
the US and its allies were intervening
in response to a request by the Arab
League and of course we have to we have
to recognize the importance of that that
incidentally the response from the Arab
League was tepid and was pretty soon
rescinded because they like we were
doing but put that aside at the very
same time
the Arab League produced had issued
another request here's a headline from a
newspaper Arab League calls for Gaza a
no-fly zone actually I'm quoting from
the London Financial Times that wasn't
reported in the United States but to be
precise it was reported in The
Washington Times but basically blocked
in the u.s. like the polls like the
polls of our public opinion not the
right kind of news
so Arab League calls for Gaza no-fly
zone that's inconsistent with US policy
so that we don't have to honor and
observe and that disappear now there are
some polls that are reported so here's
one from the New York Times a couple
days ago now quoted it said the poll
found the majority of Egyptians want to
annul the 1979 peace treaty with Israel
that has been a cornerstone of Egyptian
foreign policy and the region's
stability actually that's not quite
accurate it's been a cornerstone of the
region's instability and that's exactly
why the Egyptian population wants to
abandon it the agreement essentially
eliminated Egypt from the Israel Arab
conflict that means eliminated the only
deterrent to Israeli military action and
it's freed up Israel to expand its
operations illegal operations in the
occupied territories and to attack its
northern neighbor to attack Lebanon and
shortly after Israel attacked Lebanon
killed 20,000 people destroyed southern
Lebanon tried to impose a client regime
didn't quite make it and that was
understood so the immediate reaction to
the peace treaty in Israel it was that
there are things about it we don't like
we're gonna have to abandon our
settlements in the Sinai and the
Egyptian Sinai
has a good side too because now the only
deterrent is gone we can use force and
violence to achieve our other goals and
that's exactly what happened and that's
exactly why the Egyptian population is
opposed to it they understand that as
does everyone in the region on the other
hand at times wasn't lying when they
said that this it led to the region
stability and the reason is because of
the meaning of the word stability as a
technical meaning stability is it's kind
of like democracy stability means
conformity to our interests so for
example when Iran tries to expand its
influence in Afghanistan and Iraq
neighboring countries
that's called destabilizing it's part of
the threat of Iran it's destabilizing
the region on the other hand when the
u.s. invades those countries occupies
them half destroys them that's and
that's to achieve stability and and that
is a very common now even to the point
where it's possible to write former
editor of Foreign Affairs that in when
the u.s. overthrew the democratic
government in Chile and instituted a
vicious dictatorship that was because
the US had to destabilize Chile to
achieve stability that's in one sentence
and nobody noticed it because that's
correct if you understand the meaning of
the word stability yeah overthrow a
parliamentary government you install the
dictatorship the invader country and
kill 20,000 people invade Iraq and kill
hundreds of thousands of people that's
all bringing about stability instability
is when anyone gets in the way

linguist Noam Chomsky speaking 25th
