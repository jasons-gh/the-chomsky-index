the mass-media are our first in the
first place major corporations you know
that's what they are they are some of
the biggest corporations in the country
and they're closely interlocked with
other corporations in fact they're they
are part of the small network of
individuals and interests which
effectively own the private economy and
and staff the state executive if you
look at the people who hold the high
planning positions in the state
executive under any Administration they
come from corporate boardrooms
investment banks half a dozen law firms
that cater to corporate interests and so
on there are number of studies of this
if you're interested that's the same
group of people the same interests who
own the media so naturally they share a
perception of the world and general
interests that's at the top level now I
suppose you down to the editorial level
of the reporters level well you know at
that point you find pressures to conform
a journalist a young journalist will
quickly learn that certain things are
reportable and other things aren't you
can say things in a certain way and you
can't say things in other ways and you
learn it from your editors or the people
right above you and they've learned it
from the people right above them
remember corporations are the private
equivalent of what we call fascism in
the political realm the decision-making
structure in a corporation is top-down
you give orders and they get executed by
down below and so on and so forth and
the orders ultimately come from the
owners furthermore the media have a
market that market is other corporations
the media the market for the media is
advertisers remember the media do not
make their money on sales to you and me
in fact every purchase of a newspaper or
journal usually costs the money right
that's the way the economic political
economy of the media work their market
is advertisers which imposes yet another
constraint they want to maintain a
relationship to the state which is their
friends you know that's the kind of
interpenetration up and back in fact
even the individuals flow up and
no burner Cal the Leslie Gelb etc etc of
course they flow up and back because
they represent the same interests
there's a constant flow between
corporate boardrooms state managers
media executives and top-level media
people University elites who play the
game by the rules and so on they all
belong to the same privileged elite they
all benefit the same way they perceive
the world the same way if any of them
get out of line they're excluded and
that can happen even at a very high
level so for example a couple of years
ago the top editorial staff of the New
York Times was essentially thrown out
john oaks and others because they were
beginning to deviate a little bit time
and how do if you look at the mechanisms
very clear a couple of year I think
there's about mid seventies there began
to be reports in the business press The
Wall Street Journal the Businessweek
saying noting pointing out subtly that
New York Times stock was declining on
the stock market they pointed out here
I'm quoting they said if the New York
Times doesn't realize that it's a
business soon it won't be in business
any longer well when in fact they didn't
replace a good part of the top editorial
board at that time what was the great
crime that the New York Times was
committing at that point well if you
look back it turns out that they were
they were editorially supporting some
very mild fiscal reform measures that
business didn't happen to like and that
was enough to set in motion the
technique of control you'll notice that
the state is under exactly the same
technique of control in a capitalist
democracy suppose that the state in fact
is staffed by those have resources but
suppose it tried to deviate suppose it
started to pursue policies that didn't
conform to the interests of those who
make the investment decisions who
essentially own the place well what
would happen in fact does happen is a
decline in investment the beginning of
capital flight just a little bit enough
to tell them that the country is going
to go down the tube unless they go back
to the main course now what that means
is that we
and true decision-making powers in
private hands the political system is
marginal and the ideological
institutions are limited and instantly
these conditions almost never arise
because they're all staffed by people
with the same interests in the same
background in the same perception anyway
getting back again to the reporter they
just shape up or else they're out and
what typically inside this happens in
universities to those of you who are
going on in the ideological professions
the social sciences and so on you'll
learn this you'll learn that you got to
conform now it's not a hundred percent
you know the system is willing to
tolerate statistical error but it's it's
got to be enough so that there isn't any
significant deviation and you do come
under pressures to conform all sorts of
pressures you find out what they are if
you don't know already and those
pressures are effective they what they
do is weed out independent people and
for the people who decide to can also
something very interesting which you
might as well be aware of if you're
haven't faced it yet because it will
happen what happens is that if you
decide well I'll conform a little you
know I'll do what they say but I'll keep
my independence of mind as soon as you
begin to do that you're lost unless
you're a very rare individual because
what happens is you begin to conform you
begin to get the privilege of conformity
you go at you soon come to believe what
you're saying because it's useful to
believe it and then you've internalized
the system of indoctrination and
distortion and deception and then you're
a willing member of the privileged
elites that control thought and
indoctrination that happens all the time
all the way to the top you know I mean
it's a very rare person very rare almost
to the point of non-existence who can
tolerate what's called cognitive
dissonance you know saying one thing and
believing another you start saying third
certain things because it's necessary to
say them and pretty soon you're
believing because you just have to
there is no atrocity in my view that is
that we know of that has been carried
out in the world that wasn't justified
by its
perpetrators as highly moral that
includes incidentally Nazi genocide you
know you read Himmler's Diaries to go to
the sort of extreme and it's all full of
how noble this is and how much strength
it requires and so on and so forth
slavery was justified by the slave
owners with moral arguments if we had
records from Matilda the Hun we'd
probably find out that what he was doing
was highly moral you know same with
Stalin and every mass murderer in
history and it happens at a much lower
level for individuals incidentally
you're all familiar with this from your
personal lives and it's worth bearing in
mind so like they're I doubt if there's
anybody here who hasn't done pretty
rotten things in their life at some time
but I also I'm willing to bet that every
one of you has figured out a way to make
that exactly the right and moral and
proper thing to do okay and that's what
happens when you go when you become
parts of institutions too so that's the
way the indoctrination works on the
participants and it ends up being a very
effective system ultimately rooted in
control over resources as exactly as it
expect some very mysterious some people
talk about it as this is conspiracy
theory that's really idiotic it's not a
conspiracy you know like if the board of
managers of General Motors decides to
maximize profit that's not a conspiracy
in fact if they didn't do it they'd be
thrown out you know that's the
institutional role they have to play and
the the ideological institutions also
have a role that they have to play
within a nexus of institutions and if
they don't play that role or if
individuals within them don't play that
role that will be replaced by others who
do because these are institutional facts
like the arms race
