two questions last time you were here
you spoke about how when you go overseas
you are given access to the mass media
but here that doesn't seem to be the
case has that changed at all have you
ever been invited to appear on Nightline
or Brinkley and could you comment on
that second question could you comment
generally on the situation in Lebanon
and the second part of that is I read
where amine Gemayel has former president
of Lebanon has been given a fellowship
at Harvard University is there is
Harvard susceptible to a pressure
campaign to have them removed as a
butcher in it and a thief Vicky well the
situation when I start with the second
one that's because I don't want to claim
anything I want to continue on false
pretenses I don't claim to understand
the situation in Lebanon let me start by
telling you that so I'll tell you what I
think but take it with a very big grain
of salt because I don't understand that
I mean it's very complex I think my
impression is the following I'm in the
situation in Lebanon you know it changes
every week so you got to pick a time
frame let's pick say the last two or
three weeks custom of the alliances can
shift and the people who are now
fighting on the same side I'll be
shooting each other and so on right at
the moment it looks like there's a split
which has on the one side basically the
organized parts of the Shiite population
the Druze and the Syrians on the other
side most of the Christian population
and the Sunni Muslims look as if they're
sort of split now that's the way it
looks since there's not much opportunity
to articulate under those conditions you
can only talk about the way things look
why did general I wouldn't decide to
raise this confrontation with the
Syrians which looks suicidal well there
are a lot of possibilities I mean
possibilities just made it nationalist
or something like that another
possibility which is what I hear from
journalists in the Middle East who are
close to the topic is that he's being
supported by iraqi money and that it's
an iraqi initiative which would make
sense because the iraqi Syrian conflict
is a deep one and Iraq is really a
murderous terrorists age running hard to
get one like it just little pieces of
that story are coming out it happens to
be a US ally at the moment so nobody
talks about it much but when the truth
comes out if it ever does it's going to
be even uglier than what people think so
that's the way it looks to me and I
don't know what actions can be done to
mitigate that situation to pay the truth
I don't really have a concrete
suggestion to make maybe there are other
I'm sure there other people here who can
talk about it much more knowledgeably
than I can as far as access to the media
is concerned you know if I don't like to
personalize it much I mean it's not
really the point fact of the matter is
if I cross the borders there's easy
access to the media so it's easy to get
on Canadian television and you know
British television just mentioned two
countries that they did not recently and
so on as for say what you mentioned say
here it's much harder it's a little
easier than it was say 20 years ago and
the reason it's a little easier is
because there's much more dissidents in
the general population as the popular
country what everybody says the
movements of the 60s broadened and
expanded and deepened in the 70s and
even more so in the 80s and the
institutions they're kind of like
governments that understand violence
they respond to the need to keep the
population passive and quiet and not too
disruptive and if people are getting
more engaged and involved and so on you
got to adjust and one of the
consequences is there's a bit more media
access for dissidents than there was say
at the peak of the peace movement when I
was virtually zero contrary to what
everybody says the so yeah there's a
little more
you mentioned Nightline I mean yes I
have a couple times been invited to
speak on Nightline I couldn't do it i
had another talking something or other
and today the honest truth I don't
really care very much I just let me just
give you a personal let me tell you a
personal experience fair the media
monitoring group just post a very
interesting study of the people on
Nightline and if you haven't seen it you
ought to I mean shows that is anything
but I'm even within what they call the
spectrum of opinion it's very narrow and
their spec conception of a spectrum is
ridiculously narrow at least by European
at world standards shortly after that in
fact I would in fact shortly after fair
the thing appeared with a lot of media
play I did actually get an invitation to
be run Nightline may be related not
maybe not a couple of weeks after that I
happen to be in Wisconsin Madison on a
rate and it listener supported radio
station community radio stations very
good one where the news director I was
having interview with news director I've
been on that program dozens of times
usually by telephone and he's very good
he gets to all sorts of people and he
started the interview by playing for me
a tape of an interview that he had just
had and had broadcast with the guy who's
some mucky-muck in Nightline I think his
name is Jeff Greenfield or some such
name that name mean anything somebody
maybe something like that that was the
person who he was interviewing and he
started off the interview he played it
had already been played over the radio
so just replayed it to me it started off
by saying well you know i'm interested
in that you know there's this criticism
of Nightline he is it true that you have
narrow choices why doesn't know I'm
if you're a Nightline well first comes
the guy starts the first starts good but
you know a couple minutes of foaming at
the mouth about how he was from Neptune
and Wakko and so on and so forth but
after the hysteria had sort of receded
he made a point which is in fact quite
accurate he said look he said we might
find some kind of paraphrasing but
something like this he said suppose
there's somebody in Turkey who knows all
about you know the INF treaty or
something becomes talk Turkish well
that's no good to us we have to have
somebody can talk English furthermore he
said we have to have somebody who has
the hue meets the condition of concision
as the word you used we have to have
concision meaning you've got to say your
thing in a couple of sentences right you
are say fast and short and brief and to
the point and there he hit the thing on
the nose there's a very significant
structural fact about the American media
which is much more important in my view
than the fact that they're so narrow in
the range of opinion they permit and
that is that the American media as far
as i know are alone in the world I don't
know any other country like this maybe
Japan but nothing in Europe or Canada or
America or any places I know anything
about the US media are alone in it that
it is you must meet the condition of
concision you gotta say things between
two commercials or in 600 words no not
see when you go to say Canada or England
or Belgium or Spain or any other place
it's not just that you have access to
the media it says you have a reasonable
amount of access to the media so like
maybe 20 minutes you know 45 minutes or
something like that and that's a very
important fact because the beauty of
concision you know saying a couple of
sentences between two commercials the
beauty of that is that you can only
repeat conventional thoughts very
significant fact if I suppose I get up
on Nightline say I'm given whatever
two minutes and I say Qadhafi's a
terrorist coming he's a murderer you
know etc etc the Russians you know
invaded Afghanistan all the sort of
stuff I don't need any evidence
everybody just nods yeah obviously
they've heard that 10 million times I
said it I can go on to know what should
we do about Qadhafi's a terrorist what
should we do about it okay then I can
talk about what we should do about it
standard you know standard media clip on
terrorism you don't need any evidence
for what you say if I say the United
States is supporting democracy you know
solver the Orbis have a kind of a
setback what should we do about it you
don't need any evidence right I nearly
had suppose you say something that just
isn't regurgitating conventional piatt
ease suppose you say something that's
the least bit unexpected or
controversial suppose you say yet
Gaddafi's a minor league terrorists then
George Shultz is a major league
terrorist now what should we do about
terrorism suppose or suppose you say you
know the United States isn't didn't get
a setback in its effort to support
democracy it got it set setback in an
effort to pretty up the image so that
you can keep funding to stay terrorists
suppose you say that well you know
people will reason them quite reasonably
expect to know what you mean why did you
say that I never heard that before if
you said that you better have a reason
you know but have some evidence and in
fact you better have a lot of evidence
because that's priest or startling
common you can't give evidence if you're
stuck with concision that's the genius
of these of this structural constraint
so green field or whatever his name is
hit the nail on the head they have
designed a system which guarantees only
conventional thoughts now if anybody
says an unconventional thought they do
sound like they're from Neptune and
wacko like you said because they're
saying something that isn't obvious and
isn't repeated day after day and
therefore reasonable people will ask for
arguments and evidence and they should
you know you shouldn't accept something
you hurt you hear it like you shouldn't
accept what you hear every day either
but you should certainly shouldn't
accept what you hear the univer before
if I tell you the world flat you want to
know why I said it or else I do sound
look like I'm from Neptune well the
structural the structure of the US media
is designed to ensure that you can't
save and my view if people like say
Nightline and niall error and so on were
smarter if they were better
propagandists they would let visit and
son let them on more in fact because and
they would let them right off edge and
so on the reason is that they would
sound like they're from Neptune you know
if they would be saying things which are
unconventional and for which they can't
give any reasons because the system is
designed that way when you're on across
the border it's quite different then if
you say one of those things you're
allowed to explain what you meant and
why you said it and where people can
look for more evidence and so on
furthermore it's not a one-shot affair
you know it's happening constantly
that's what freedom means that's what
democracy would mean and we got a
structural system which denies that I
think it's an important fact
I I just would like to propose another
process that I've noticed particularly
in following then tapada and in the
media and have you comment on it and
that is when once the media formulates
its orientation and some of the
processes you've described they instill
a sort of manichean dualism good guys
bad guys categories where in this
particular case the Palestinians are the
bad guys the Israel's of the good guys
and they're those those actors become
locked in these categories and so that's
why when you have even in the worst days
and then tapada and you know despite
what the media says there are still bad
days there's always there are not a week
goes by without some sort of article
about the moral crisis that the soldiers
are going through by beating these
people so that the good guys don't
become bad guys they go into a moral
crisis and the bad guys just become less
of bad guys that's all quite right
nope no comment except just to say that
that's an obvious property of the
propaganda system you know I'm obvious
property and you're right absolutely
notice that the lines can shift a little
bit so as American policy shifts the
choice of good guys and bad guys ship
the current story is that Israel isn't
all the good guys anymore there's the
Labour Party which are the good guys
healthy pragmatists and then there's yet
such a mere who may be becoming a bad
guy because he doesn't seem to be
following orders completely what makes
you a good guy is he following orders my
question relates to your statement about
states understand the efficacy of
violence if those of us who understand
the propaganda model and want to change
the assumptions of the state and change
the policy of the state should we
advocate or bring about something that's
more violent to get them to change their
stance I'm not saying this as an
advocacy position but I am interested in
your comment no that doesn't follow I
mean I'm not myself but committed
pacifist like I think it's legitimate to
use violence to defend yourself if I saw
somebody breaking into my house and it
was trying to kill my kids or something
I would have no hesitation in using
violence to stop them at this point I
break from my pacifist friend but the
violence is really a last resort now
when I say that states understand the
efficacy of violence I don't mean to
approve in fact here it's a much broader
point I mean what internally yep I think
it's worth recognizing that we should
recognize the distinction that Harold
Lasswell made there's a difference
between states that control their
population by violence and those that
marginalize and control and divert them
in other ways there is a very striking
difference you couldn't do this what
we're doing now in a state that rules by
violence the United States happens to be
deeply committed to violence
internationally and even at home but
it's also comparatively speaking
probably the freest country in the world
we found another one like it that is the
limits on the power of the state to
coerce by violence are narrower in the
United States than any other country I
know that's not to say it's zero it is
but comparatively speaking and those are
important facts I think that in fact is
related to the fact that we probably
have the most sophisticated propaganda
of any country in the world exactly as
less well said these things have to go
along you can't if you can't control
what people do you better will control
what they think or else prevent them
from thinking or something now what's
the way to react well I think the way to
react is first of all to make use of the
options that exist in the system and
their their you know their political
options there's options in the media and
so on there are plenty of people inside
the media for example understand exactly
what's going on you know very well try
to work within it do what they can with
outside support they can do more outside
support knees pressure you know anything
from letters to the editor going to the
editorial office and so on people in
power not only understand the efficacy
of violence they also don't like
disruption of their nice normal ways
what they want is a passive apathetic
population and if they don't have that
that's a cause and that's cause to which
you have to adjust since you can't can
instill that by force in the United
States I mean you can say in the ghettos
and so on but for relatively privileged
people you can't do it by force you have
to do it by adjusting that's the way in
which informal politics can create a
margin of survival for people who were
at the wrong ends of the gun and say
suppose you're doing Central America
solidarity work or something what you're
doing is creating enough pressure and
disruption so that the state will have
to adjust in order to prevent threats to
major interests of power and they will
adjust that's why the Reagan
administration went underground right
away for example in fear of the domestic
enemy the domestic population now on
this issue and you got to choose you
know you have to choose what you do
based on the issue that you're
confronting this
issue i think is a different thing truth
and it's a very different if you want to
talk about how to affect us policy on
this issue I think we should recognize
that it's quite different from the
Central American issue in the Central
American issue there's an a leak
consensus across the board that reform
movements cannot be permitted to survive
the Sandinistas cannot be permitted to
survive precisely because they were
directing resources to the poor and
that's unacceptable on that there's mana
nimah t you know if you don't agree with
that you're from Neptune and and where
you have to respond in a certain way
after respond by organizing people by
creating disruption by making costs and
so on and so forth this issue is quite
different on this issue first of all
there's an elite split there's
substantial elements of real power in
the united states who have always been
in favor of political settlement an
unusual case in this respect that split
that i mentioned between rogers and
Kissinger is only symbolic there's a
real split and they'll eat you know
centers for example the oil companies
typically has been in favor of political
settlement now they're pretty powerful
and with regard to Middle East policy
they're usually very powerful phenomenon
they've lost my people like say George
ball are reflecting real interests
they've lost there are other real
interests that prefer to have the
conflict maintain than commits himself
the strategic asset theory and likes to
have a mercenary state that they can use
to do things the United States can't do
in Guatemala and be a base for us power
in the region and interchange
intelligence and try out technology and
all that kind of stuff and by and large
they've won but that's a split
furthermore if you look at the u.s.
population of most of the population
doesn't care but to the extent that they
care there are about two to one in favor
of a Palestinian state and have always
been so but it's not a deep commitment
so sort of irrelevant politically so
here you have a situation where there's
a nail eats if we're talking about a
diplomatic
so that means some kind of you know to
to state settlement probably some kind
of Confederation or something something
on that order if we're talking about a
non rejection as settlement a settlement
which recognizes the right of national
self-determination of both people and
safeguards and so on you got most of the
population on your side to begin with
you have powerful elements of American
corporate power for example which run
the government on your side to begin
with and it's a different sort of issue
and in fact what has held this issue I
think this is one of the very unusual
cases most rare maybe unique cases in
which the Yunnan near unanimity among in
educated circles particular liberal
educated circles has swung the balance
there's been virtually no discussion or
debate over this issue in fact until
very recently you couldn't talk about it
because he'd get you know assassinated I
mean not for the gun but the verbal
assassination and that's tough it means
the politicians don't want to speak up
because they can't live with it and
journalists don't want to write because
you can't take all that stuff and other
people just gonna get involved you know
you don't want to be the target of vast
amounts of vilification and why
annunciation and so on and so forth it's
just unpleasant nice way to live and if
you're in public life you can't live
that way there's no way to answer it
notice that if people throw slime at you
there's no way to respond you can't say
it's not there nobody's going to follow
the details of an argument on anybody
who swings mud understands that you
always win can't lose especially when
you've got control of the media and in
this case the media have reflected
articulate intellectual opinion
including the liberal media there's
basically been no discussion that's why
it's been possible to suppress the
history so completely and strut you know
let me give you some examples of what's
happening actually a very interesting
study done at Georgetown a couple years
ago by Montague turn no there's a study
done by at georgetown by a person that
on a woman a Montague Kern woman yeah a
very extremely interesting study it was
that must been done around the 17 online
or approximately then it's a study of
it's one of most interesting media
studies I know it's a study of the what
happened in 1977 you know it was very
interesting what happened in October
1977 when when Carter came into office
it looked as if he was going to move
towards the international consensus and
call for political settlement looked
like that and in October 1977 he
actually there was a joint statement
soviet-american statement which called
for a reduction of tension and you know
an end the conflict and moved towards
political settlement didn't spell
anything out very much it was obviously
a move towards politics and away from
the arena violence well the reaction to
that was kind of interesting first of
all Israel was vehemently opposed to it
the whole Israeli Lobby here which is
not Jews much broader the Israeli Lobby
was vehemently opposed to it and they
got to organize and they largely
dominate the media and then comes
montegut turn studies she studied the
way the media treated this kind of this
issue not typically on just about every
issue when the prayer
the United States is in conflict with
somebody else outside say another
country the way the media work is you
know you turn on the television tube and
there's the President or you know
spokesman for the president giving the
official line and you go on and on with
that you get commentators endorsing it
and then in the interest of fairness you
know sort of at the end of the program
right after the last ad you get the
other guys who can say three words you
know that's the usual way it's done in
this case it was the opposite no the
primary focus was on the Israeli
spokesman and the Americans have
supported them and then towards the end
Jimmy Carter was allowed in to make a
kind of a flea that you know maybe he's
not totally connected and again and
that's basically that's basically what
she documents you know that's unusual in
fact it's unique I don't even know of
another case like it and what that
reflects is something that happened in
the educated part of the community and
it happened for reasons having to do
with the United States I think big story
but it happened it happened in 1967
there was tremendous enthusiasm in
educated circles in the United States
for the Israeli victory I think it had
probably more to do with Vietnam War and
you know and the peace movement and the
students and so on and it had to do with
the Middle East Israel had shown how to
put third-world upstarts in their place
and that one of a lot of points you have
to remember what was happening in the
United States at that time and I suspect
that that's the source of a lot of it
but if that's true it means you're
dealing with a quite a different issue
here you're dealing with the matter of
trying to gain you know to act within
the public political system and the
public media system without even
breaking its rules you know you've even
got power lined up on your side it's
going to require a willingness to accept
and to overcome the barriers that the
the barriers that are imposed by the
cultural managers themselves but they're
not very powerful they're powerful only
when they're not challenged and I think
they can be challenged on this that's if
that's correct that's a guess quite
different tactics it can it's exists
information you know pressures writing
speaking organizing people in
communities things like that I think it
could happen on this issue and could
lead to a shift in policy different
issues require different tactics you got
to really think it through
American University where you're going
to speak tomorrow is the home of wamu
which is one of the national public
radio stations in town and to my mind
both nationally and locally their their
news is a very good example of the
liberal defining point of how far left
you can go a group of us are going to go
thursday and talk with the program
manager and sometimes I get inspired
when I read extra affairs publication
and then sometimes I think there's no
it's easy to get discouraged and think
that they're they're impenetrable
especially when I see so many people who
seem like they're on the verge of being
disillusioned by the propaganda who
think that it's wonderful just because
it's so much nicer than the vicious
other extreme so I guess the well
there's two things I wanted to ask you
one is if you could say anything more
about like where is that margin where is
the weak point that that that can have
some sort of effect and the other thing
is National Public Radio is a little bit
different from those corporations that
sell us to the advertisers and yet why
does it sound so much the same well
National Public Radio is not all that
different personal is a little different
but it's not all that different for one
thing remember it is corporate
subsidized and the other thing is it's
run by the government and the government
is corporate run you know so it's just a
step just a step more remote now now
nevertheless it's susceptible to
pressures and I don't think one should
be discouraged in fact doesn't take much
in the way it's amazing how little it
often takes on the way of pressure I
mean you can often get a person in
Congress to change your vote if they get
six letters
literally I mean not on a major issue of
their deep concern but on issues of
great importance and the same is true of
national public radio and CBS and
everything else they don't like
disruption and if there's any indication
and they don't like popular involvement
I mean remember the people have to be
apathetic that's the ideal and if people
are getting involved in things you want
to put them down and one way you put
them down is by doing a little of what
they want and hoping they'll go away now
that's to the good if they do a little
of what you want and then you don't go
away well okay well be more know so you
don't come in you know if you want to if
you're looking forward to a revolution
in the media forget it that's going to
require a revolution in the society but
changes are certainly possible there's
plenty of adjustment possible and I
don't think there's anything general to
say I think it depends on the issue for
example I think would be extremely
difficult in fact near impossible
without a social revolution to get the
media to admit or even to face the
possibility that the United States is
has traditionally for quite good reasons
opposed democracy and social reform and
is still doing it or to get them to
admit that Nicaragua had an election
which I any rational standards is far
better than the one in El Salvador to
get that to be admitted is probably
impossible but you can get changes
nevertheless you know this there's a big
margin between what they're willing to
do and what they could do without
harming their basic interests and
commitments and those things should be
pressed also there plenty of people in
the media who would like that kind of
support you know who could do more if
they had more outside school not a ton
of mana later they one of the effects of
the 60s remembered is that a lot of
people who came as a big experience for
lots of people I think it extended in
the seventies needs more in the eighties
but the effect is that a lot of people
come through those experiences and they
see things differently and they're older
and they're inside the society
and they were and and you know they
would like this evenings changed not
revolutionary changes they just like to
see modifications and that gives lots of
options that weren't there before so
these trips of yours down to the offices
I expect will have an effect not in one
shot you got to keep at it that dedicate
then if you have an effect
one or two more questions as well
I
I just like to pick up on your last
comments on social revolution and I'd
like to know what what you mean one by a
social revolution
two questions last time you were here
you spoke about how when you go overseas
you are given access to the mass media
but here that doesn't seem to be the
case has that changed at all have you
ever been invited to appear on Nightline
or Brinkley and could you come in that
second question could you comment
generally on the situation in Lebanon
and the second part of that is I read
where amine Gemayel has former president
of Lebanon has been given a fellowship
at Harvard University if there is
Harvard susceptible to a pressure
campaign to have them removed as a
butcher in it and a thief thank you well
the situation when I start with the
second one that's because I don't want
to claim anything I want to continue on
false pretenses I don't claim to
understand the situation in Lebanon I
mean start by telling you that so I'll
tell you what I think but take it with a
very big grain of salt because I don't
understand that I mean it's very complex
I think my impression is the following
I'm in the situation in Lebanon you know
it changes every week so you got to pick
a time frame let's pick say the last two
or three weeks cuz you know the
alliances can shift and the people who
are now fighting on the same side will
be shooting each other and so on right
at the moment it looks like there's a
split which has on the one side
basically the organized parts of the
Shiite population the Druze and Syrians
on the other side most of the Christian
population and the Sunni Muslims look as
if they're sort of split now that's the
way it looks since there's not much
opportunity to articulate under those
conditions you can only talk about the
way things look why did general I want
to decide to raise this confrontation
with the Syrians which looks suicidal
well there are a lot of possibilities I
mean one possibility is just committed
national
there's nothing like that another
possibility which is what I hear from
journalists in the Middle East who are
close to the topic is that he's being
supported by iraqi money and that it
were in iraqi initiative which would
make sense because the Iraqi and Syrian
conflict is a deep one and Iraq is
really a murderous terrorist a cunning
hard to get one like it just little
pieces of that story are coming out it
happens to be a US ally at the moment so
nobody talks about much but when the
truth comes out if it ever does it's
going to be even uglier than what people
think so that's the way it looks to me
and I don't know what actions can be
done to mitigate that situation to pay
the truth I don't really have a concrete
suggestion to make maybe they're other
I'm sure there other people here can
talk about it much more knowledgeably
than I can as far as access to the media
is concerned you know if I don't like to
personalize it watch I mean it's not
really the point fact of the matter is
if I cross the borders there's easy
access to the media so it's easy to get
on Canadian television and you know
British television just mentioned in two
countries of it there not recently and
so on as for say what you mentioned say
here it's much harder it's a little
easier than it was say 20 years ago and
the reason it's a little easier is
because there's much more dissidents in
the general population as the popular
country what everybody says the
movements of the 60s broadened and
expanded and deepened in the 70s and
even more so in the 80s and the
institution's they're kind of like
governments that understand violence
they respond to the need to keep the
population passive and quiet and not too
disruptive and if people are getting
more engaged and involved and so on you
got to adjust and one of the
consequences is there's a bit more media
access for dissidents than there was say
at the peak of the peace movement when I
was virtually zero contrary to what
everybody says the so yeah there's a
little more
you mentioned Nightline I mean yes I
have a couple times been invited to
speak on Nightline I couldn't do it I
had another talk and something or other
and today the honest truth I don't
really care very much I let me just give
you a personal let me tell you a
personal experience fair the media
monitoring group just post a very
interesting study of the people on
Nightline and if you haven't seen it you
ought to I mean shows that is anything
but I'm even within what they call the
spectrum of opinion it's very narrow and
they their spec conception of a spectrum
is ridiculously narrow at least by
European at world standards shortly
after that in fact I would in fact
shortly after their thing appeared with
a lot of media play I did actually get
an invitation with beer on Nightline may
be related not maybe not a couple of
weeks s that I happen to be in Wisconsin
Madison on a radio and it listener
supported radio station community radio
station a very good one where the news
director I was having interview with
news director I've been on that program
dozens of times usually by telephone and
he's very good he gets to all sorts of
people and he started the interview by
playing for me a tape of an interview
that he had just had and had broadcast
with the guy who's some mucky-muck in
Nightline i think his name is jeff
greenfield or some
such name that name mean anything
somebody maybe something like that that
was the person who he was interviewing
and he started off the interview he
played it had already been played over
the radio so he just replayed it to me
it started off by saying well you know
i'm interested in the you know there's
this criticism of Nightline he is it
true that you have narrow choices why
doesn't know I'm John Smith here a
Nightline well first comes the guy
starts the first starts good but you
know a couple minutes of foaming at the
mouth about how he was from Neptune and
Wakko and so on and so forth but after
the hysteria had been sort of receded he
made a point which is in fact quite
accurate he said look he said we might
find some kind of paraphrasing but
something like this he said suppose
there's somebody in Turkey who knows all
about you know the INF treaty or
something but Tony's talk Turkish well
that's no good to us we have to have
somebody can talk English furthermore he
said we have to have somebody who has
the meets the condition of concision as
the word you used we have to have
concision meaning you've got to say your
thing in a couple of sentences right you
are say it fast and short and brief and
to the point and there he hit the thing
on the nose there's a very significant
structural fact about the American media
which is much more important in my view
than the fact that they're so narrow in
the range of opinion they permit and
that is that the American media as far
as i know are alone in the world i don't
know any other country like this maybe
japan but nothing in Europe or Canada or
America or any places I know anything
about the US media are alone in that
that it is you must meet the condition
of concision you gotta say things
between two commercials or in 600 words
no now see when you go to say Canada
England they're Belgium or Spain or any
other place it's not just that you have
access to the media it says you have a
reasonable amount of access to the media
so like maybe 20 minutes you know 45
minutes or something like that and
that's a very important fact because the
beauty of conceit
you know send a couple of sentences
between two commercials the beauty of
that is that you can only repeat
conventional thoughts it's very
significant fact if I suppose I get up
on Nightline say given whatever it is
two minutes and I say Qadhafi's a
terrorist coming as a murderer you know
etc etc the Russians you know invaded
Afghanistan all the source I don't need
any evidence everybody just nods yeah
obviously they've heard that 10 million
times I said that I can go on to know
what you would do about Qaddafi the
terrorists what should we do about it
okay then I can talk about what we
should do about it standard you know
standard media clip on terrorism you
don't need any evidence for what you say
if I say the United States is supporting
democracy and i'll solve authorities
have a kind of a setback what should we
do about it you don't need any evidence
right on the other hand suppose you say
something that just isn't regurgitating
conventional paya tease suppose you say
something that's the least bit
unexpected or controversial suppose you
say yeah Gaddafi's a minor league
terrorists and George Shultz as a major
league terrorist and what should we do
about terrorism you know suppose or
suppose you say you know the United
States isn't didn't get a setback in its
effort to support democracy it got it
set set back in an effort to pretty up
the image so that you can keep funding
to stay terrorists suppose you say that
well you know people will reason them
quite reasonably expect to know what you
mean why did you say that I never heard
that before if you said that you better
have a reason you know better have some
evidence in fact you better have a lot
of evidence because that's pretty
startling common you can't give evidence
if you're stuck with concision that's
the genius of these of this structural
constraint so green field or whatever
his name is hit the nail on the head
they have designed a system which
guarantees only conventional thoughts
now if anybody says an unconventional
thought they do sound like they're from
Neptune and Wakko like he said because
they're saying something that isn't
obvious and isn't repeated day after day
and therefore reasonable people
ask for arguments and evidence and they
should you know you shouldn't accept
something you hurt you hear fact you
shouldn't accept what you hear every day
either but you should certainly
shouldn't accept what you hear the
universe before if I tell you the
world's flat you want to know why I said
it or else I do sound look like I'm from
Neptune well the structural the
structure of the US media is designed to
ensure that you can't say and in my view
if people like say Nightline and Niall
error and so on were smarter if they
were better propagandists they would let
dissidence on let them on more in fact
because and they would let them right
off Ed's and so on the reason is that
they would sound like they're connected
you know if they would be saying things
which are unconventional and for which
they can't give any reasons because the
system is designed that way when you're
on across the border it's quite
different then if you say one of those
things you're allowed to explain what
you meant and why you said it and where
people can look for more evidence and so
on furthermore it's not a one-shot
affair you know it's happening
constantly that's what freedom means
that's what democracy would mean and we
got a structural system which denies
that I think it's an important fact
I I just would like to propose another
process that I've noticed particularly
in falling than tapada in the media and
have you comment on it and that is when
once the media formulates its
orientation and some of the processes
you've described they instill a sort of
manichean dualism good guys bad guys
categories where in this particular case
the Palestinians are the bad guys the
Israel's are the good guys and they're
those those actors become locked in
these categories and so that's why when
you have even in the worst days and then
tapada and you know despite what the
media says there's still bad days
there's always there not a week goes by
without some sort of article about the
moral crisis that the soldiers are going
through by beating these people so that
the good guys don't become bad guys they
go into a moral crises and the bad guys
just become less of bad guys that's all
quite right
nope no comment except just to say that
that's an obvious property of a
propaganda system you know an obvious
property and you're right absolutely
notice that the lines can shift a little
bit so as American policy shifts the
choice of good guys and bad guys ship
the current story is that Israel isn't
all the good guys anymore there's the
Labour Party which are the good guys
healthy pragmatists and then there's its
auctioneer who may be becoming a bad guy
because he doesn't seem to be following
orders completely what makes you a good
guy is you following orders my question
relates to your statement about states
understand the efficacy of violence if
those of us who understand the
propaganda model and want to change the
assumptions of the state and change the
policy of the state should we advocate
or bring about something that's more
violent to get them to change their
stance I'm not saying this as an
advocacy position but I am interesting
your comment no that doesn't follow I
mean you know I'm not myself the
committed pacifist like I think it's
legitimate to use violence to defend
yourself if I saw somebody breaking into
my house and it was trying to kill my
kids or something I would have no
hesitation using violence to stop them
at this point I break from my pacifist
friend but the violence is really a last
resort now when I say that states
understand the efficacy of violence I
don't mean to approve in fact here it's
a much broader point I mean what
internally if I think it's worth
recognizing that we should recognize a
distinction that Harold Lasswell made
there's a difference between states that
control their population by violence and
those that marginalize and control and
divert them in other ways there is a
very striking difference you couldn't do
this what we're doing now in a state
that rules by violence the United States
happens to be deeply committed to
violence internationally and even at
home but it's also comparatively
speaking probably the freest country in
the world
I don't know another one like it that is
the limits on the power of the state to
coerce by violence are narrower in the
United States than any other country I
know that's not to say it zero it is but
comparatively speaking and those are
important facts I think that in fact is
related to the fact that we probably
have the most sophisticated propaganda
of any country in the world exactly as
less well said these things have to go
along you can't if if you can't control
what people do you better well control
what they think or else prevent them
from thinking or something now what's
the way to react well I think the way to
react is first of all to make use of the
options that exist in the system and
their their you know their political
options there's options in the media and
so on there are plenty of people inside
the media for example understand exactly
what's going on you know very well try
to work within it do what they can with
outside support they can do more outside
support means pressure you know anything
from letters to the editor going to the
editorial office and so on people in
power not only understand the efficacy
of violence they also don't like
disruption of their nice normal ways
what they want is a passive apathetic
population and if they don't have that
that's a cause and that's cause to what
you have to adjust since you can't can
instill that by force in the United
States and you can say in the ghettos
and so on but for relatively privileged
people you can't do it by force you have
to do it by adjusting that's the way in
which informal politics can create a
margin of survival for people who were
at the wrong ends of the gun and then
say suppose you're doing Central America
solidarity work or something what you're
doing is creating enough pressure and
disruption so that the state will have
to adjust in order to prevent threats to
major interests of power and they will
adjust that's why the Reagan
administration went underground right
away for
example fear of the domestic enemy the
domestic population now on this issue
and you gotta choose you know you have
to choose what you do based on the issue
that you're confronting this issue i
think is a different route and it's a
very differently if you want to talk
about how to affect us policy on this
issue I think we should recognize that
it's quite different from the Central
American issue in the Central American
issue there's an a leak consensus across
the board that reform movements cannot
be permitted to survive the Sandinistas
cannot be permitted to survive precisely
because they were directing resources to
the poor and that's unacceptable on that
there's no known entity you know if you
don't agree with that you're from
Neptune and and where you have to
respond in a certain way after respond
by organizing people by creating
disruption by making costs and so on and
so forth this issue is quite different
on this issue first of all there's an
elite split their substantial elements
of real power and the United States who
have always been in favor of political
settlement an unusual case in this
respect that split that i mentioned
between rogers and Kissinger is only
symbolic there's a real split and
they'll eat you know centers for example
the oil companies typically has been in
favor of political settlement now
they're pretty powerful and with regard
to Middle East policy they're usually
very powerful economic they've lost my
people like say George ball are
reflecting real interests they've lost
there are other real interests that
prefer to have the conflict maintained
and commits himself the strategic asset
theory and like to have a mercenary
state that they can use the two things
the United States can't do in Guatemala
and be a base for us power in the region
and interchange intelligence and try out
technology and all that kind of stuff
and by and large they've won but that's
a split furthermore if you look at the
US population most of the population
doesn't care but to the extent that they
care there are about two to one in favor
of
aust in Ian state and have always been
so but it's not a deep commitment so
sort of irrelevant politically so here
you have a situation where there's mail
eats if we're talking about a diplomatic
settlement so that means some kind of
you know to to state settlement probably
some kind of Confederation or something
something on that order if we're talking
about a non rejection as settlement a
settlement which recognizes the right of
national self-determination of both
people and safeguards and so on you got
most of the population on your side to
begin with you have powerful elements of
American corporate power for example the
truth on the government on your side to
begin with and it's a different sort of
issue and in fact what has held this
issue I think this is one of the very
unusual cases most rare maybe unique
cases in which the Yunnan near unanimity
among in educated circles particular
liberal educated circles has swung the
balance there's been virtually no
discussion or debate over this issue in
fact until very recently you couldn't
talk about it because you get you know
assassinated I mean not with a gun but
the verbal assassination and that's
tough it means the politicians don't
want to speak up because they can't live
with it and journalists don't want to
write because you can't take all that
stuff and other people just gonna get
involved you know you don't want to be
the target of vast amounts of
vilification and why
and so on and so forth it's just
unpleasant nice way to live and if
you're in public life you can't live
that way there's no way to answer it
notice that if people throw slime at you
there's no way to respond you can't say
not there nobody's going to follow the
details of an argument on anybody who
swings mud understands that you always
win can't lose especially when you've
got control of the media and in this
case the media have reflected articulate
intellectual opinion including the
liberal media there's basically been no
discussion that's why it's been possible
to suppress the history so completely
and struttin you know let me give you
some examples of what's happening
actually a very interesting study done
at Georgetown a couple years ago by
Montague turn no there's a study done by
at georgetown by a person that often and
a woman a Montague Kern woman yeah a
very extremely interesting study was
that must been done around the 70 lying
or approximately then it's a study of as
one of most interesting media studies I
know it's a study of the what happened
in 1977 you know it was very interesting
what happened in October 1977 when when
Carter came into office it looked as if
he was going to move towards the
international consensus and call for
political settlement looked like that
and in October 1977 he actually there
was a joint statement soviet-american
statement which called for a reduction
of tension and you know an end the
conflict that moved towards political
settlement didn't spell anything out
very much but was obviously a move
towards politics in a way from arena
violence well the reaction to that was
kind of interesting first of all Israel
was vehemently opposed to it the whole
Israeli Lobby here which is not Jews
much broader the Israeli Lobby was
vehemently opposed to it and they got to
organize and they largely dominate the
media and then comes montegut turn study
she studied the way the media treated
this kind of this issue not typically on
just about every issue when the
President of the United States is in
with somebody else outside say another
country the way the media work is you
know you turn on a television tube and
there's the president or you know
spokesman for the president giving the
official line and you go on and on with
that you get commentators endorsing it
and then in the interest of fairness you
know sort of at the end of the program
right after the last ad you get the
other guys who comes a three words you
know that's the usual way it's done in
this case was the opposite no the
primary focus was on the Israeli
spokesman and the Americans who
supported them and then towards the end
Jimmy Carter was allowed in to make a
kind of a plea that you know maybe he's
not totally connected and again and
that's basically that's basically what
she documents you know that's unusual in
fact it's unique I don't even know of
another case like it and what that
reflects is something that happened in
the educated part of the community and
it happened for reasons having to do
with the United States I think big story
but it happened it happened in 1967
there was tremendous enthusiasm in
educated circles in the United States
for the Israeli victory I think it had
probably more to do with Vietnam War and
you know and the peace movement and the
students and so I'm and it had to do
with Middle East Israel had shown how to
put third-world upstarts in their place
and that one of a lot of points you have
to remember what was happening in the
United States at that time and I suspect
that that's the source of a lot of it
but if that's true it means you're
dealing with a quite a different issue
here you're dealing with the matter of
trying to gain you know to act within
the public political system and the
public media system without even
breaking its rules you know you've even
got power lined up on your side it's
going to require a willingness to accept
and to overcome the barriers that the
the barriers that are imposed by the
cultural managers themselves but they're
not very powerful they're powerful only
when they're not challenged and I think
they can be challenged on this that's if
that's correct that's a guess quite
different tactics it can fit suggest
information you know pressures writing
speaking organizing people and
communities things like that I think it
could happen on this issue and could
lead to a shift in policy different
issues require different tactics you got
to really think it through
American University where you're going
to speak tomorrow is the home of wamu
which is one of the national public
radio stations in town and to my mind
both nationally and locally their their
news is a very good example of the
liberal a defining point of how far left
you can go a group of us are going to go
thursday and talk with the program
manager and sometimes I get inspired
when I read extra fares publication and
then sometimes I think there's no it's
easy to get discouraged and think that
they're they're impenetrable especially
when I see so many people who seem like
they're on the verge of being
disillusioned by the propaganda and
think that it's wonderful just because
it's so much nicer than the vicious
other extreme so I guess they're well
there's two things I wanted to ask you
one is if you could say anything more
about like where is that margin where is
the weak point that that that can have
some sort of effect and the other thing
is National Public Radio is a little bit
different from those corporations that
sell us to the advertisers and yet why
does it sound so much the same well
National Public Radio is not all that
different personal is a little different
but it's not all that different for one
thing remember it is corporate
subsidized and the other thing is it's
run by the government and the government
is corporate run you know so it's just a
step just a step more remote now now
nevertheless it's susceptible to
pressures and I don't think one should
be discouraged in fact doesn't take much
in the way it's amazing how little it
often takes in the way of pressure I
mean you can often get a person in
Congress to change your vote if they get
six letters and literally I mean not on
a major issue of their deep concern but
on issues of great importance
and the same is true of national public
radio and CBS and everything else they
don't like disruption and if there's any
indication and they don't like popular
involvement I mean remember the people
have to be apathetic that's the ideal
and if people are getting involved in
things you want to put them down and one
way you put them down is by doing a
little of what they wanted hoping
they'll go away now that's to the good
if they do a little of what you want and
then you don't go away well I'll be more
know so you don't come in you know if
you want to if you're looking forward to
a revolution in the media forget it
that's going to require a revolution in
the society but changes are certainly
possible there's plenty of adjustment
possible and I don't think that anything
general to say I think it depends on the
issue for example I think would be
extremely difficult in fact near
impossible without a social revolution
to get the media to admit or even to
face the possibility that the United
States is has traditionally for quite
good reasons opposed democracy and
social reform and is still doing it or
to get them to admit that Nicaragua had
an election which by a rational
standards is far better than the one in
El Salvador to get that to be admitted
is probably impossible but you can get
changes nevertheless you know this
there's a big margin between what
they're willing to do and what they
could do without harming their basic
interests and commitments and those
things should be pressed also there
plenty of people in the media who would
like that kind of support you know who
could do more if they had more outside
school not a sana manalo they one of the
effects of the 60s remembered is that a
lot of people who came out I was a big
experience for lots of people I think it
extended in the seventies even more in
the eighties but the effect is that a
lot of people come through those
experiences and they see things
differently and they're older and
they're inside the society and they were
and and you know they would like this
evenings changed not revolutionary
changes they just like to see
modifications
and that gives lots of options that
weren't there before so these trips of
yours down to the offices I expect will
have an effect not in one shot you got
to keep that that dedicated then it can
have an effect
one or two more questions are so
I I just like to pick up on your last
comment on social revolution and I'd
like to know what what you mean one by a
social revolution
