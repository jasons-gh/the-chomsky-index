what looks general is mainly our
ignorance so it takes a radical
behaviour the studies of pigeons
one of the main experimental animals
they thought they could do things like
trained pigeons to say play ping-pong or
something but when these were analyzed
more closely what was discovered was
they're actually taking the instinctive
behavior of pigeons pigeons Peck that's
something they do instinctively and you
can slightly modify their pecking
behavior so it looks to you like they're
playing ping-pong at a pigeon just
knocks its packet you know and in fact
if you look even more closely it turns
out that was considered pecking is
actually at least two different totally
different systems the one is pecking and
one is swallowing water they look the
same but from the pigeons point of view
they're totally different and if you and
you have to distinguish these from each
other and in fact the whole behavioral
systems gaylord system just totally
collapsed just from internal inquiry
into the nature of the actual behavior
instance incidentally when I say it's
collapsed I don't mean it disappeared so
it's still very widely believed then
that the cognitive sciences among the
general public and so on in fact it's
even thought that the universities
shouldn't be good is say that the very
of
very famous 8th language experiments are
the same like the teaching painting for
the language experiments are an
interesting illustration of the
pathology of human inquiry I mean that
whole idea is absurd I mean as if we
were a second ago there's been a lot of
very good working on D communication you
know unfresh famous work Nobel Prizes
they do all sorts of strange things you
could train graduate students to do
something like the waggle dance of bees
and they do a pretty good job you know
get your arms around right over there
but the whole idea is ludicrous I mean
you would learn nothing about bees that
way you would just learn it's possible
together some superficial similarity to
something bees do and but when you
humans we refuse to study rationally and
we will willing to study insects
rationally when we turn to save humans
we don't totally irrational so you do
things in the study of humans would be a
joke if you did it with say insects and
that's what the ape language is it let
me give sort of training these poor
animals to do something which very are
superficial but you can't do you know so
they can kind of mimic a few simple
things as I say graduate students could
be much better mimicking be
communication but it's all joke and of
course it gets nowhere but it but even
if it did get somewhere would be
meaningless because you're trying to
train them to do something they can't do
if they could do it then the chip might
my granddaughter's chimpanzee Pat she
would be doing it just the same data
what they do the same thing but so it's
all it's all basically a joke and it's
taken seriously it's written up in the
science journals and so on but that's
that's a reflection of human
rationality has nothing to do with the
scientists a lot of us the same is true
of a lot of the work in computer science
trying to what's called artificial
intelligence which actually one smart
biologist once called natural stupidity
it's a it's a an effort to try to get
automata to do things we look human-like
you know like little robots from space
workers or whatever and you can do
things and you can construct an
automaton that'll do things that look
something like what humans do but it's
utterly meaningless it enga that's it
but it's not the same thing it's like I
didn't graduate when you get behavior
and study behavior again but not what
you're not finding like what's going on
is and the point is we understand that
perfectly well when it's any non-human
organism we're talking about so to get
humans to act like say Apes or dogs or
bees people would regard as ridiculous
correctly because who cares
no and same this automata that act like
dogs let's say you could speak and
people at visa I just do construct
mechanical bees but for a scientific
reason they construct automata which act
more or less like bees that they want to
see if the bees will swarm when they're
led by a mechanical B instead of an
actual bee and that's important because
that can test how the bees doing it what
are they following an odor trail or are
they doing something else well okay you
can test that by constructing a
mechana-bats once again the question
what what if the we know research
interest in you study the organism or do
you study something that's nestling on
its gift and the in the sciences for
back to
the Babylonians you don't just study
data
