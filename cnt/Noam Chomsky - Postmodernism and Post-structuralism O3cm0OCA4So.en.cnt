our vision other trends even thinking
about in US universities do you think
they're responsible for a lot of what
coming out of the academic collapse
mainly post-modernism you think that has
a particular place in the doctrinal
system meaning people wanting to be
subversive but not rock the boat or if
you think there's some other explanation
for that now individuals have their own
reasons and you have to look and ask why
they're doing things but if you look at
the phenomena as a whole its effect has
been I think the effect is pretty clear
it allows people to take a very radical
stance you know more radical than though
but to be completely dissociated from
anything that's happening for many
reasons one reason is nobody can
understand a word they're saying
so they're already dissociate it's kind
of like a private lingo and it's very
you know there's a lot of material
reward that comes from it like if you're
part of that system you can run around
the conference's get big professorships
and you know all this kind of stuff so
there's a lot of sort of conventional
material reward and it has this very
radical look to it so you feel you know
everybody well let me just give you an
example I gave a talk a couple days less
Saturday last Saturday at Piers 8
University the Palestinian University of
the West Bank and it was a you know you
liked everywhere big mass audience
political talk mostly criticizing the
Palestinian Authority because I was in
you know you always tell people what
they want to hear so when I criticize
Israel I do it on the other side of the
word but the and the audience most of
the audience is very supportive and they
liked and they understood it did guys
with the jackets and ties were pretty
angry but that's normal
however as I left with a Arab friend of
mine who organized cities of actually an
Arab but his miserly Arab was a member
of the Knesset Parliament but an old
kind of good guy he sort of let he was
sitting in the back of the a he as we
walked out he kind of laughed and he
told me to eat you know I said most of
the especially younger people liked it a
lot but he heard one
critical really critical comment from a
young woman faculty member who sort of
liked the general political thrust of it
that told him it was very naive and he
said you know why was it naive and he
laughed and he said well it's because
you said that people do things on moral
grounds and you talked about truth okay
and that's old-fashioned nonsense you
know that's kind of this old
enlightenment stuff we know perfectly
well that nobody does it I mean I talked
about how apartheid was over trying you
know I was necessary to have splits
inside the white society which there
were the white society had been unified
they would have smashed the ANC but
there were splits from the inside and
basically on moral grounds people didn't
tolerate that was quite important
something you know talked about that
well that's naive because nobody does
anything on moral ground soil power
plays you know read Foucault and so on
and so forth if you can understand it
and truth is kind of an old-fashioned
concept you know there's no truth and so
on and socially yeah that stuff goes on
all over I mean the next day I gave a
talk at an Israeli University and then
it was critical of Israel United States
and totally the Palestinians and there
were commentators and one of the
commentators was the Dean and you know
he hated it of course in the historian
and he said he also said it was naive
because I was talking as if there's
there's a objectivity in history I was
running through the history of what
happened and saying I should interpret
what's going on now in those terms it is
complete naive and everybody knows
there's no objectivity and there's no
truth and it's this narrative and that
narrative and so on and so forth that's
very convenient
that sounds very radical you know and
it's extremely convenient you can beat
people over the head with perfect you
know self-confidence because there's no
reality anyway and it's just their
narrative and your narrative in the
third world it has it's particularly
grotesque in mind it's bad enough here I
don't like it here or other rich
countries but when you get to third
world countries it's really grotesque
because the you know their the
separation of the radical intelligentsia
from popular struggle is a much more you
know it shows much more dramatically I'm
people are much
and they're suffering much more and
these guys are usually pretty pretty
very rich in fact often and it's ugly
but I think it has served a function I
don't want to say that the people who
are involved in it necessarily do it for
this reason in fact I know extremely
good people who are very active and I
respect and like and so on who write in
this stuff I don't know why but that's
their means something to them but as a
general phenomenon I think that's the
way it's worked it's worked as a way of
insulating sectors of a kind of radical
intelligentsia from popular movements
and actual activism and serving as and
it served as instrument of power I think
I suspect that's the reason why it's so
readily tolerated in the universities
I'm it's all over the place in the third
world as well well because of the
function it serves that's a lot of
postmodern work I just don't understand
so I can't comment on it seems to me
some exercise by intellectuals who were
talking to each other in very obscure
ways and I can't follow it to them of
anybody else can postmodern views of
science by and large have been pretty
embarrassing I think there's some
interesting work on this this a book by
to visit genre Quan Allen SoCal both of
them have to be political radicals just
running through it's mostly Paris
post-modernism what postmodern
commentators have said about science and
it is really embarrassing I mean to the
extent you can understand it I mean I
think then there is a point I mean
insofar as they say that everything that
people do is some kind of social
construction depends on the historical
context cultural context on that part's
true
I don't know if you need the whole
postmodern baggage to say those things
feeling is not at least personally I
haven't seen anything that it doesn't
seem to me it has to be said anything
with mono syllables it looks as far as I
understand that it's pretty
straightforward
and I get the feeling that it's kind of
there isn't drive among intellectuals to
make things look difficult that's a kind
of self-protection I mean if what I'm
doing can be done by you know the guy
who is preparing my furnace okay then
Who am I
and then there's those physicists over
there who took complicated things and
have to understand so I'd like to be
like them
that drive is clearly the air and I
think it should be resisted and who say
things simply so that people can
understand I'm sure like anything that
we understand them about at all with
regard to things as complicated as human
affairs
the answers are pretty trivial that's
the not to really understand it there is
category and intellectuals who are
undoubtedly perfectly sincere who if you
look at it from the outside what they're
actually doing is using poetic words and
complicated constructions which
apparently they seem to understand
because they talk to each other most of
the time I can't actually what they keep
talking about and these people
especially in my field and it's all very
inflated and a lot of prestige and so on
as a terrible effect in third world in
the first world rich countries has
didn't really matter that much so if a
lot of nonsense goes on in the Paris
cafes or the Yale comparative leadership
department okay on the other hand in the
third world popular movements really
need serious intellectuals to
participate and if they're all ranting
of course modern
it is well they're gone and I've seen
real examples but given T but so there
is that category and it's considered
very left-wing and very advanced and so
on so forth well some of what appears in
it actually makes sense
but when you reproduce it in mono
syllables that turns out to be true isms
so yes it is perfectly true that if you
look at scientists in the West they're
mostly men it's perfectly true that
women have had a hard time breaking into
the scientific fields and it's perfectly
true that there are institutional
factors determining how science proceeds
that reflect power structures I mean all
of this can be described literally in
mono syllables and it turns out that the
truisms when you leave it okay on the
other hand you don't get to be a
respected intellectual by presenting
truisms and mana syllables now a lot of
the left criticism so when the left so
called left personal considered list
when the left criticism so-called
happens to be accurate okay that's fine
so if you point out a lot of things just
like what I mentioned there's a lot of
note that's fine right out now everybody
understand it you take a look this is
true and so on and it had a lot of holes
so-called left criticism seen from pure
nonsense in fact that's been
demonstrated conclusively so there's a
very important book by Jean berkland
Alan SoCo forget what it's called
dangerous illusions or something where
they simply go through the they happen
to concentrate on Paris which is the
center of the rot but it's all over and
they go through the most respected
French intellectuals and run through
what they say about science and you know
it is so embarrassing that you kind of
cringe when you read it because
sometimes one of my favorite writing
ones is one of the very few actually as
a scientist and know something about
science left or has a background in
science and philosophy
Aveda through an article of his and I
think I'm remembering correctly in which
he he's somebody in France that
somewhere had discovered that one of the
pharaohs had died of tuberculosis and
they did it by you know analysis of
whatever DNA or something look to a real
article ridiculing this this is totally
deserved because literally I talk about
tuberculosis undiscovered in the
nineteenth century how good everything's
a social construction and therefore what
we can say oh yes so it didn't have it I
mean you know it's kind of the level of
Bush and Chirac but but it's taken very
seriously and this is considered very
leftist but one point to look at I think
is that the description of intellectuals
the description of journalists and now
the description of this sector apart of
what calls it's out the left you have
something similar going on even though
the price is much lower you have those
guys sitting in the air-conditioned
rooms bombing the hell out of the world
for their careers for their for their
status because of the reflexive lessons
that they've learned and then over here
you have people who are in literary
criticism or whatever field they might
be in who are also completely divorced
from reality or obscuring it or dialling
it up for similar reasons of course the
price is much less I mean high but it is
their depth but it don't rich countries
is just dependent it's still not like
the bombing the world yeah I think but
it's the same phenomenon it hard to
understand I mean if you the nice people
a lot of my friend if you look at what's
happening I think it's it's pretty easy
to figure out what's going on I suppose
your
the literary scholar the elite
university or an apologist or whatever
and if you do your work seriously that's
fine you know but it's not very I mean
y'all getting it prizes for it on the
other hand you take a look over in the
rest of the university and you got these
guys in the physics department and the
math department and they have all kind
of complicated theories which of course
we can't understand but they seem to
understand them and they have no
principles and they deduce complicated
things from the principles and they do
experiments and you know they find
either they work or at home work and so
and that's really you know impressive
stuff so I want to be like that too so I
want to have a theory in literary in the
humanities you know Larry criticism
topology and so there's a field called
theory we're just like the physicists
they talk in comprehensively we can talk
in comprehensively they have big words
we'll have big words they draw you know
far-reaching conclusions will draw our
conclusions we're just as prestigious is
there now if they say well look we're
doing real science and you guys aren't
that's white now sexist
you know Virgil whatever the answer is
how come how are we any different from
them okay that's appealing other other
things that went on remember that a lot
of this stuff comes from Paris and
interesting things were happening in
Paris in the 1970s the French
intellectuals were the last group of
intellectuals in the world who were
dedicated whelmingly not 100% but it was
very standard and respected to be a
dedicated Stalinist and Maoist
I gave her the mid-seventies I was
getting to be a pretty hard position to
uphold so what you had if you take a
look at what happened is there was a
sudden shift people who had been flaming
Maoists and Stalinists suddenly became
the first people in the world
to have discovered the Gulag and went on
a tear about how everyone else supports
you know Stalinist and Maoist atrocities
and we're France of course we have to be
in front of everyone so therefore we've
exposed it and now we're open it's
what's called the new philosophy this
lawsuit is something and it went over
Oakland I remember meeting I won't
mention names because it embarrassing
one of the leading French cultural
theorists who have to visit me around
1974 he was a flaming Maoist
a couple of years later he was one first
people who understood - you know
discovered the smallest Maoist
atrocities well ok when he went through
that transition you got to do something
else
I ain't gonna be on the front pages ok
along comes the invention of the post
structuralism
