I understand well other we really have
to look at it in a case-by-case basis I
think it's really hard to find you can
make some general statements but the
trick is to apply them in the particular
cases so let's look at the particular
humanitarian crises and see what we can
do about it okay so take say the 1990s
we can look there were many humanitarian
crises then one of the worst of them was
in Iraq US sanctions in Iraq killed
hundreds of thousands of people maybe up
to a million people they strengthened
Saddam Hussein the under destroyed they
destroyed any possibility of any
uprising against Saddam they forced the
population to rely on him for survival
they were so horrendous that the the
administrators of the so called
oil-for-food program two distinguished
international diplomats Dennis Halliday
hunts von sponeck both of them resigned
in protest because they regarded the
sanctions they were asked to administer
as genocide 'el okay actually just
yesterday I got a letter from Huntsman
sponeck thanking me for having brought
this up in a discussion in Oslo a couple
of days ago which was about your
question so yes that there was an easy
way to end that humanitarian crisis
namely don't take part in it okay that's
easy doesn't cost anything and there are
many like that one that was going on at
the same time actually was in Turkey not
in the Balkans
inside native not near native turkey at
that time was carrying out vicious
atrocities trying to suppress a Kurdish
protest movement in southeastern Turkey
occurs were deprived of the most
elementary rights they couldn't speak
Turkish illegally and couldn't have the
Turkish color as anything had to pretend
to be mountain Turks as they were called
and there was an uprising and Turkey
launched the counterinsurgency campaign
killed tens of thousands of people
destroyed about 3,500 towns and villages
drove roughly 3 million people something
like that out of the region
I was pretty awful it was an easy way to
stop that namely stop participating in
it the arms were coming almost entirely
from the United States about 80 percent
as the atrocities increased u.s. arms
increased in the year 1997 which
incidentally is the year when Clinton
was praised for the noble phase of his
foreign policy with a saintly glow in
the new york times in that year the
clinton sent more arms to turkey than in
the entire Cold War period combined up
until the onset of the insurgency so yes
there's an easy way to stop that one
stop providing the arms and if you like
that can run through a lot of other
cases so many cases of major atrocities
can very easily be stopped by stopping
our participation in them and it works
one case that Illustrated that is the
Indonesian invasion of East Timor in
1975 authorized by the United States
supported us provided arms Britain came
in provided in fact most of the arms
this one was about as close to genocide
'el as anything in the post-war period
it was aggression and invasion
occupation wiped out maybe quarter of
the population third of the population
they went on right through 1999 always
with strong us support the atrocities
there were worse than 1999 than anything
reported in Kosovo and in fact of course
the background wasn't comprable in
anything in the Balkans finally in
September 1999 under quite a lot of
domestic and international pressure
Clinton quietly informed the Indonesians
that the game was over they told them
you're gonna have to leave
they left instantly a day later that
could have been done for the preceding
25 years that's now called a
humanitarian intervention you know with
a level of cynicism there know how to
describe so yeah you could stop that one
too
and there are many other cases like that
but those are not the kind of cases that
are ever discussed the only cases that
are discussed is what are the criteria
when somebody else is carrying out a
crime okay that's harder it's much
harder to stop somebody else's crimes
than to stop your own and what are the
criteria well you know difficult
criteria they have to ask what are the
purposes what are the likely
consequences what are the general
effects a lot of particular
considerations have to be looked at
which are complex but I don't really
could be an interesting question I don't
think there's much point discussing it
frankly because the question almost
never arises in fact I can't think of a
case where it's arisen as I said at the
very beginning it's hard to find a case
in history of a genuine humanitarian
intervention one carried out for
humanitarian goals and with
consideration of what the consequences
would be
and since if the question doesn't arise
it's very hard
