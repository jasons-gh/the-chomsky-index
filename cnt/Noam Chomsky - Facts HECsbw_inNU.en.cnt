Bertrand Russell told us to pay
attention to facts how do we do that
when there are people who tell us that
facts don't exist first of all that's a
particular Paris pathology so one way to
do it is leave Paris where you don't
hear people saying the facts but the
other thing is to disregard them of
course facts exist and everyone who says
that they don't exist believes that they
exist I mean when they walk out the door
or they assume there's a floor that
they're going to step on you know not
that they're going to go to the center
of the earth so they assume that facts
exist the claim the facts don't exist is
a way of saying don't pay attention to
the real world pay attention to the
propaganda that I give you it's called a
narrative these days so pay attention to
my narrative you know something I make
up for my own power of reasons but you
don't have to succumb to that it's very
easy to avoid it just don't pay any
attention now of course just paying
attention to facts is not enough you
have to understand the facts you have to
know which ones to look for and which
ones are irrelevant otherwise it is
drowned and meaningless data that's true
whether you're a scientist or a person
concerned with human affairs you have to
be able to pick out what is significant
means you have to have a framework of
analysis you have to have people to
interact with to form your ideas to try
out your own ideas and so on that's
these are the ways of gaining the kind
of perspective and understanding which
allows you to interpret the complex data
that are that the world presents and
again that's true if you're a physicist
it's true if you're just a person trying
to find your way through life's dilemmas
there's no formulas for that you just
have to use your common sense
