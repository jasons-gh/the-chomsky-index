so and it's because people are scared
well what are they scared of you know I
mean the greatest threat in this town is
maybe a cattle be lost or something like
that
but people are scared so they have to
have alarms and the other thing and yes
they're afraid and that's fostered but
it's part of something much broader I
think it's part of the effort to break
down community solidarity and sympathy
and that shows up in all kinds of ways
like take privatizing schools what's the
point of privatizing schools well you
know the idea is to instill in people
the idea that all you care about is
yourself so I don't happen to have
children of school age so therefore
according to the ideology that's
implanted in you you're I'm not supposed
to care whether the kid down the street
has school to go to so I don't want to
pay taxes you know I want to cut taxes
because I don't care if that kid goes to
school and if you know I have enough
money I could send my kid to private
school if I wanted to so who cares if
they're public schools so we should
privatize schools to eliminate the
conception that we should care if some
other kid just school which everybody
has you got to drive it out of their
heads the same is true I don't know if
it's happening here of efforts to
privatize pension and security systems
at West Point of that like in the u.s.
these big effort to try to privatize
Social Security I mean you know
financially speaking it's ridiculous
it's a huge cost and everything else but
there are reasons for it
Social Security is based on an
unacceptable principle namely that each
person that you should care if the
disabled widow
across town survives and you're not
supposed to care about that you're
supposed to care about whether you have
enough pairs of shoes and stuff like
them you know enough cars and video
games or whatever it is that's all
you're supposed to care about so you got
a privatized Social Security also
another advantage to privatizing Social
Security is that it has the brilliant
consequence of turning working people
against their own interests
because if your pension is tied up in
stocks you want to make sure those
stocks go up and the way those stocks go
up is by cutting wages and reducing
working conditions you know sending jobs
to you know Chinese sweatshops and so on
so as a working person you should you
have to be committed to undermining your
own interests and that's important so
for reasons like that you want to
privatize Social Security and privatize
water or schools and everything else and
also make people afraid of each other so
you should be afraid of the people next
door so you should pour your money into
alarm systems that the police aren't
paying any attention to the soil idiotic
and so on and so forth yeah these are
ways of controlling people and fear is
one of them that's why fear of crime is
so high in the United States it's not
because of crime it's because it's
manufacturing and and when you see the
activist groups you know and they say
what can we do I mean all that you've
described it's so discouraging what can
we do and he you know I mean I think if
I can use the word inspiring I mean he
he says exactly what you're doing you
gotta let you've got to keep things
active essentially we need an act of his
life so the global justice movements
which wanted to take a different form
they are completely new phenomenon never
been anything like oh they there I mean
it started in the south so the main
centers are in the Brazil places like
that and 10 or 15 years later it reached
the north so you know when it got this
the streets of Seattle you had to start
paying attention to it as long as just a
couple hundred thousand Indian peasants
demonstrating at Parliament you know who
cares about that but so it's it and it's
now international so it porto alegre in
the world Social Forum meetings
I was down there last February there's
that's people from all over the 70,000
people or so all over the world every
possible walk of life every interest and
concern you can imagine very lively
energetic interesting and they reflect
activism all over the world
you know from campesinos to
environmentalist anything you can think
of and that's an entirely new phenomena
you know it's sort of in a sense it's
you could imagine it's the beginnings of
the realization of what was the main
goal of the workers movements on the
Left 950 years ago namely a genuine
international there's never been one but
and the seeds of them were quickly
destroyed but this is really taking off
and it's it is a reflection of things
happening everywhere if I look back on
the life of activism of most of my
friends who are activists the key thing
that people got from me from going over
to coffee shops and talking to Chomsky
and listening to him and getting a
chance to have one-on-one conversations
or a few people getting together was it
he he sort of you know the foundation of
how to approach an issue the building
blocks of how to think about something
Chomsky really gave those to us I'm the
country's just become a lot more
civilized and so as a good deal of the
West and it didn't it wasn't given as a
gift I mean any more than civil rights
were or anything else the earth labor
rights or anything you can think of
these are the results of constant
struggle and the options are perfectly
well open to us much more open to us
than the most people in the world and
we've got an enormous amount of freedom
thanks to the achievements of our
predecessors who struggle the win that
freedom and now we have it and that
gives us opportunities that most people
in the world just don't have you know
like you try to speak up for freedom of
speech in Turkey as many people
courageously do you can end up in a
Turkish prison which isn't a lot of fun
I try to do it in one of the u.s. client
states and Latin America you can get
your brains blown out in Colombia for
example we don't have this problem
so for us to talk of there's no problem
in carrying out activities we've got
plenty of opportunities it succeeded in
the past there's no reason why I
shouldn't continue to so I don't see any
problem there in fact that means the
best period for organizing and activism
that I can remember at least in my
lifetime well don't you think that these
things are just normal aspects of
everybody's life which can be described
in their own terms
I mean after all we're not as far as I
know we're not bringing up any
particularly sophisticated concepts that
you can't talk about to children
yeah well does the average person not
understand things about you know sexual
abuse or you know bosses giving orders
that you don't like and you know all the
destroying the environment I mean I
think these are things that are
everybody's concerned if they're not
that's because they're just not you know
they know the time or energy or whatever
it is it think about them well those of
you who are organizers should speak up I
mean do you really you know do you teach
people already learn from them part of
being on the left at that time was
bringing what we call high culture you
know science mathematics the arts and so
on to people who didn't have the
advantages of the privileges of going
through school going through school then
meant even maybe getting to fourth grade
and it could certainly be done it ends
up then people want it you know they
like it they participate in it they go
on by themselves and those of us all of
us who are privileged one of the
responsibilities is to help people do
this for themselves
how do we get people to collectively
organize how to be liberate people from
racism and sexism you know like it
starts it means a cliche to say he
starts inside you but it's just like
when you start thinking in terms of flat
in terms of other people and what they
need that's when you get into the realm
of theorizing about like ideal
communities and societies and not asking
well why am I asking this question now
what were the discussion previous to
this what's my role as like whatever
gender sexual orientation whatever and
like I think that's a really easy trap
for university oriented activists to
fall into like what's the ideal solution
for everyone what's the utopia and how
you get people to understand our vision
and go there well why aren't we going to
places instead of saying why aren't
people here let's bring them in here
let's use our privilege to like extend
us to everybody you know teach the world
like that's like colonialism it's like
why don't we well is it colonialism if
let's say I mean I suppose I know
mathematics and I go into a
working-class area and help people learn
mathematics is that colonialism no I
don't think so I mean that's what
workers education is I mean I've got a
secretary you know I'm abandoning it I'm
saying I'm gonna use it look I'm not
denying that I have it I'm not gonna
pretend that I'm a poor Emma Korean
immigrant who can't speak English I'm
not nor am I going to pretend that I can
work in a rape crisis center I can't
I mean I'm myself I'm not some other
person and the question is whether being
who you are whoever you are without
denying that that's who you are you can
do something useful for other people I'm
sure we're not disagreeing we can't deny
who we are like I'm not gonna go
organize steel workers because I just
can't know I were to do it I've become a
steel worker and then I got
undo my whole background start over from
age 1 and I'm not gonna do that and
there wouldn't be any point in my doing
I appreciated his sighting all the how
much progress we've made individual
rights and freedoms in the last 40 years
it's good to be reminded of that and
because we get so bogged down
I get so bogged down it's great to hear
him push for more popular struggle and
know that yeah there's a reason why
we're much more free and there's a lot
more justice now than there was in the
past there's a reason why human rights
are much better protected actually
there's a reason why the Wilsonian
intellectuals had to turn the propaganda
as a technique of manipulation and
control because force wasn't available
any longer the reason is popular
struggles over many years which have
just improved thing's enormous Lee just
as they have in the last few years so
trilateral commission intellectuals were
worried about the ferment of the 60s and
the excess of democracy but and they
tried there's been many attempts to try
to figure out how to crush it and to
restore the indoctrination of the young
but they haven't worked there's been
much more activism and engagement and in
fact progress in many dimensions in the
last 20 or 30 years so for example if
you go back to the 1960s just remember
what things were like there was no there
was barely any feminist movement women's
rights sort of an issue we had at the
margins there was no environmental
movement nobody cared about protecting
an environment there were no third world
solidarity movements there was no
anti-nuclear movement there was no
global justice movement these massive
movements really are very significant
there was no opposition to aggression it
was considered just fine
so the protests now over the coming war
and Iraq are absolutely unique they have
no historical precedent at least that I
can think of
I can't think of another case in the
entire history of your imperialism when
there were protests before a war was
started it's in the last year it's since
September 11th now he coming soon that
himself evidence the interviews the
requests for speaking it's it's just and
it's almost as if I mean this is my own
take on it that the need the desire of
people to sort of hear another position
in order to come to understand
everything that's coming that's going on
or that has happened is it's just people
are hungry for hearing an analysis and
host another analysis than the one they
usually get you look through hundreds of
years of history the West has a virtual
monopoly of violence so massive terror
is kind of thing we do to them no
they're not supposed to do it to us
September 11th was the first break first
time in hundreds of years that any
Western country has suffered on home
soil the kind of the thing they do
routinely everywhere else you know and
in Israel it's sort of the same actually
it was pretty striking for me to see
this I mean I had after September 11th
had a ton of interviews everywhere
except the United States of course and
often it was a national radio on TV and
often it turned a couple of times it
turned out to be Irish and television
and BBC back-to-back and the difference
in reaction was startling
you know I mean and you know things are
like things that I said this much on
Irish TV okay discussion over it really
understands what I'm talking about
try to say it on BBC you have to go on
for like about an hour to explain to
them what you mean though the Irish Sea
is a chasm you know and it just depends
who's been holding a whip for 800 years
and who's been under three
and the same is true everywhere else in
the world you know but for the West the
idea that anybody should do to us a
fraction of what we regularly do to them
is just outrageous and the same is true
in Israel it's a 35-year occupation I
mean up until very recently they were
immune
literally immune from retaliation from
within the territories and they weren't
acting very nicely there
I was brutal you know humiliating
repressive robbing the resources kicking
the people out and so on but there was
no retaliation okay last year through
there's some retaliation so it's
scandalous it's also considered a
scandal in the West right because we do
it we do it and it's okay but they do it
to us not okay so if Israel invades
Lebanon with us backing and kills 20,000
people no way the cookie crumbles it's
not a problem but if it goes the other
direction a couple feet and people get
killed yeah that's a horror story
well the question that I was asked is
what was the effect of 9/11 on
organizing and since we was kind of a
dual effect September 11th it was
immediately predicted and now we can
look back and see that the prediction
was correct that every repressive force
in the world would take it as a window
of opportunity to extend what they were
doing so for example the Russians took
it as an opportunity to extend the
attack in Chechnya pretending that it's
a war on terror and now with the
authorization of Washington the Chinese
did the same in western China Indonesia
did the same and I J Israel and the
occupied territories and so on down the
list furthermore every just about every
government used it as an opportunity to
try to impose greater discipline on
their own populations under again the
pretext of a war on terror so that's
true of the more dictatorial States like
say Central Asia and it's also true the
more democratic societies
prevention of terrorism ordinances and
other devices of one sort or another
mainly to try to discipline their own
populations these are just continuations
of tendencies that are already in
process using this kind of opportunity
to escalate it and that was predictable
and of course it's happened if you're
interested in terror you should look at
its causes now if for the point of view
of apologists for state violence like
the ones you're mentioning you're not
allowed to look at the causes because
that's considered rationalization or
justification so if you try to look for
the causes like every sane person does
that's rationalization which supposed to
do is have Tantrums and scream about
Islamic fascism and blame it on the bad
genes of the Arabs or something but
you're not allowed to look at the causes
and there's a good reason for that soon
as you look at the causes you start
looking in the mirror and that you have
to block you know the main task of
intellectuals always but now too is to
make sure that people never look in the
mirror we never look at ourselves they
only look at other people the heckling
the leafleting at the door there's well
as you can imagine there's an enormous
amount of hostility
and the different groups will interrupt
in the question and answer period and
you know oh yeah yeah yeah there's a lot
of that shows up often in fact one
useful effect of the end of the Cold War
is the clouds have lifted somewhat and
reality is coming into clearer view and
it takes a little more effort to
suppress what should have been obvious
all along well five years after this
came the review of post Cold War
deterrence that I was quoting earlier
and now the meaning of deterrence is
clarified you have to deter those who
seek an independent path and it's only
by suffering really deep historical
amnesia of the kind that Orwell
attributed to a properly functioning
educational system it's only by that
that you can fail to recognize the
pedigree of this doctrine which goes
back to the end the World War two and
there are plenty of precedents earlier
in the history of other Imperial states
perhaps the most instructive
illustration of all of this is Cuba it's
an example which happens to be highly
relevant and very timely right now
recall we've just passed the 40th
anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis
the anniversary was the occasion for a
high-level conference in Havana of
Russians Cubans and Americans mostly
from the Kennedy administration and it
yielded some startling information about
how close the world came to a nuclear
war that would have given the unwanted
answer to Eric's Meyers question it was
discovered that we were saved from
perhaps terminal catastrophe
by a word a single word from a Russian
submarine captain named Vasili arkhipov
who ought to get hundreds of Nobel Peace
Prizes he countermanded an order
to fire nuclear-armed missiles from a
submarine that was in under bombardment
by us destroyers who were enforcing john
f kennedy's naval quarantine that was
that's how close we came to the end of
human civilization okay one word from a
russian submarine captain that was the
most dangerous moment in human history
historian Arthur Schlesinger committed
these Kennedy's advisor at the time when
he heard about this Robert McNamara was
in Secretary of Defense he observed at
the conference as he had before that
Cuba was justified in fearing a US
invasion he said if I had been in Cuban
or Russian shoes I would have thought so
too those facts in no way mitigate the
criminal lunacy of sending nuclear-armed
missiles as a deterrent or the other
interactions of that very grim month in
which we almost got the answer to the
question whether it's better to be smart
than stupid the wrong answer
well these extraordinary facts were very
marginally recorded in the United States
I don't know how they were dealt with
here they elicited virtually no comment
the press did however report that with
the collapse of the Soviet Union Cuba is
no longer promoting terrorism as it did
before that follows the convention of
the scholarly literature on terrorism
which highlights allegations of the
Cuban role in terrorism but manages
somehow to ignore the fact that Cuba
probably holds the world record as a
target of terrorism for the last 40
years
it's another fact that wouldn't do to
mention that includes the terrorist acts
of the top-level commanders in
Washington that aroused the fear of
another invasion and helped precipitate
the Missile Crisis and all came very
close to destroying what we call human
civilization so it takes really
impressive discipline
for educated sectors not to mention
these particular facts again
Orwell's phrase just at the moment when
the awesome consequences that have been
so narrowly averted have just been
revealed I looked and I could find no
mention maybe you had lead editorials
and The Globe and Mail about it and
scholarly articles but I didn't see any
mention for an academic to take those
risks to say the heck with my career and
the heck with disciplinary boundaries
and and the heck with being liked by
everybody and getting good reviews being
being praised by my peers I'm really
just going to say what I think is true
and dedicate my life to that I it's very
sad to say that there's only a tiny
minority of academics in universities
that do that and we begin to realize
what a crime that is and we see that
these are the people who have access to
facts who have the training to interpret
them and make sense of them who have
privilege in our country at least to
communicate those facts to others and
instead they frequently concentrate on
advancing their careers perhaps I should
say we wanted answering our our careers
while speaking in our caine language
that ordinary people can understand one
erecting disciplinary fences so that
nobody who wasn't trained in our
discipline is allowed in and he has no
time for them he has contempt for
disciplinary mount
if he wants to learn economics he
studies if he wants to talk about
history he studies it so we have
somebody who is an intellectual and and
academic committing his life to justice
using all his intellectual resources and
not caring about discipline or about it
when you put it all together it's quite
an unusual mix before 1968
there isn't a hint that Kennedy was
trying to get out of it no because he
wasn't he was one of those extreme Hawks
in the administration the Declassified
record shows that very clearly after
1968 all these guys rewrote the stories
and it turns out that Kennedy was
struggling to get out of Vietnam and he
thought the war was awful you know and
then this bad Texan came in after him
and escalated it's total nonsense and
you can see it when you compare what
they were doing beforehand you know like
Arthur Schlesinger wrote a day by day
account of the thousand days not a hint
there that any was even thinking of
getting out of yes you never even came
up afterwards you know Kennedy was a
real dove one of the in the war and so
on today by night there's a whole
industry of people mostly on the left
incidentally trying to prove that
Kennedy was trying to get out of Vietnam
and that's why he was assassinated and
so on and so forth the kind of the
Oliver Stone type business was and but
it's but but that's the picture that
intellectuals construct of themselves
the post hook and since they're the only
one you know they're kind of like the
custodians of history it ends up that
way that's still be in the textbooks and
you know the history books and so on you
want to find out the truth you're gonna
have to go back to the original
documents you're gonna go to the Russell
archives you find out what it was really
like but you're not gonna find it in the
history books
so be cautious when you hear about
intellectuals being fighters for justice
they sort of when I look around the
audience be sort of rapid attention I'm
sure the kids they're leaning forward in
their seats and if there's no it doesn't
come from anywhere else in 1988 I guess
I sort of naively well I knew he was
well known so we put up a simple poster
that just said sort of Chomsky assuming
everyone would know that isn't and then
you know kind of gave the time of the
place and you know we had it in the
biggest room that we normally put people
in and we also rented the room next to
death so they could have a live audio
visual field we ended up having it on
the same night as the major lecture
series from McMaster de Winne lectures
very famous man came to do that despite
all that there's no way people could get
into those two rooms a lot of people
were disappointed they were standing
they were sitting in the other video so
there were lots of people that time but
not as many as this time and it's partly
the book nine nine eleven partly the
events of 9/11 it's partly the fact that
things he's been saying for years are
becoming more and more obvious to people
that he was prescient he who saw what
was happening
and so yeah his famous was great then
and it's greater now what would the
demographic must've been of people who
were getting the tickets it was across
the board it was students
it was professionals we had people from
pretty much all walks of life and people
that we hadn't seen before at the store
so it wasn't just regular customers it
was people from all over the city
perhaps some of the youthful support for
professor Chomsky is looking for a
figurehead if you like to focus their
own feelings or critiques of many of the
issues he's dealing with I think if that
kind of adulation if you like is focused
on professor Chomsky specifically it's
something that he would personally be
very uncomfortable with and would do his
utmost to discourage given that issues
of substance itself that need to be
addressed it is extremely difficult to
keep especially 9/11 I mean we've always
sold steadily the Chomsky stuff and I
think being close to the university has
always helped that and there is sort of
an undercurrent in Hamilton of activism
that you know people don't always see
and they're not always aware of so
Chomsky has always sold steadily for us
but 9/11 because it's on so many
people's minds has sold extremely well I
think it is actually officially our
best-selling book ever and considering
that it hasn't been available for all
that long and that's extraordinary but
there I mean there is the fact that
there is a small percentage of people
who come simply because they've heard
that it's it's big like someone who's
telling me the day they heard someone
saying
I hear this guy's challenged he's coming
so you know I've got a ticket and I
don't know who's opening for him but now
I hear I think that he was a rock star
the hardest part is exhaustion for him I
mean actually part of the reason that I
go is to sort of intervene as a I mean
what when it wouldn't became sort of
Rockstar reception and fuss and bother
he really needs a manager to Shepherd
him around and to turn down adding
something else and so on and they really
the question really was whether to hire
a manager and so the first thought was
well I had just recently quit working I
mean I had retired and to see that I
should go the first trip I mean with
which was to South America and you know
I'll go along and I'll see if it works
you know maybe it won't be so great for
his wife to you know I mean but he said
you try it let's see so I did and it
worked in fact it was very funny
in the Argentina portion of that I would
I mean they're very laid-back in sort of
Latin American style nothing starts on
time and you know Zola and I would you
know cut things off at the time and on
to the next and so on and I had the
feeling I was interfering all the time
and really getting in their way and I
just did it it had to be done and at the
end when they gave their thank you big
thank-you speech at the final event and
thank norm and so on and so forth I you
know I was really amazed that the guy in
charge with whom we didn't keep encoding
the whole thing said and we also want to
thank Carol for keeping us on track and
without that discipline we could never
have
gotten through everything we had planned
for this trip and I was just you know
the idea that in any sense he I won't
say he welcomed it but in any sense he
found it a positive thing for his own
purposes so I thought well okay if
that's the way it's going to be viewed
then I guess it's alright this is too
obvious to mention but he's obviously a
very very gifted man he's very smart
smart enough to marry Carol Chomsky who
was a wonderful person I guess I could
equally well say she's smart enough to
marry him
they are really a real powerful it's
very funny in some of these situations
the last trip which I did not go on the
schedule said he is to have a half an
hour alone in a room with no
interruptions and we're back he
described how somebody sat there with
him the whole time and several times
students knocked on the door to have
books signed and the anted person who
was with it said come right in and he
signed the book so I was just telling my
side afterwards how look but you know
they just clearly written there as it's
supposed to be understood and no one
said they just don't understand they
just don't understand what it means
so my son he said to me on the gun he
said what is not to understand in alone
and no interruptions
then I got honest ago that's the
you
