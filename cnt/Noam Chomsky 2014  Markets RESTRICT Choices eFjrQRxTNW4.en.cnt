yeah there's a lot of propaganda about
the wonders of markets actually we only
have very limited markets but there are
markets markets are supposed to be
magnificent because they increase your
choices actually they restrict your
choices you think about it for a minute
suppose I want to get home from work at
night okay the market offers me a choice
I can have a four-door Toyota it does
not offer me the choice of a subway what
I want what's good for me what's good
for the environment what's good for my
children but that's not offered in the
market markets offer individual
consumption and the enormous stress on
the importance of markets is part of the
way to drive people towards looking for
yourself amassing as many commodities
you can forget everything else in fact
if you think about it for every one of
you is picking an economics course or
read about it then you know what markets
are supposed to be markets are supposed
to be systems in which informed
consumers make rational choices right
I'm sure every one of you is turned on a
television set what do you see when you
turn on a television set you see that
there's a huge industry public relations
industry which began in the United
States and Britain incidentally huge
industry which is designed to undermine
markets every ad is an attempt to create
an uninformed consumer will make an
irrational choice right a huge effort on
the part of the business world the
undermine markets but to keep the aspect
that's useful for profit and power
namely separating people from one
another focusing on individual choices
not working with your neighbor
