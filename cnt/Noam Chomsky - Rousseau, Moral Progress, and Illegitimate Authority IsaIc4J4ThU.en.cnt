you wrote a wonderful essay called
language and freedom before I get there
though it seems to me what the
motivation to study language was to
understand something which you often
talk about as human nature I was going
to ask you what I still don't quite know
what human word mean the phrase means
mean nature but but you seemed
attractive attracted to the notion that
understanding human nature would help us
understand social interactions an issue
that was that has been and clearly is
very important when you get there and
and you were attracted and written a lot
about Rousseau now I remember
Rousseau jean-jacques Rousseau had a big
impact on me when I read and be the
social contract because of that famous
phrase man is born free but lives
forever in Chains which which took me a
long time to understand and but but but
Rousseau had this idea which which in
your writing you've repeated number
times it's somehow the natural state of
man and we'll just sees man for that
moment here is a good one
and somehow society screws it up so for
example you wrote actually at the time
of American draft resisters you were
saying many who were beginning to
recover from the catastrophe of 20th
century Western civilization which is so
tragic and confirmed Rousseau's judgment
and he wrote here arose the National
Wars battles murders and reprisals which
make nature tremble and shook reason and
all those horrible prejudices would rank
the honor of shedding human blood a bunk
among the virtues the most decent men
learned to consider it one of their
duties to murder their fellow man at
length men were seen to Massacre each
other by the thousands without knowing
why more murders were committed on a
single day of fighting and more horrors
in the capture of a single city than
were committed in the state of nature
during whole centuries over the entire
face of the earth now is that really it
seems to me that that's wrong that's
Rousseau yeah it's or so but I mean you
quoted it and the question is do you
agree that I mean it seems to me that in
fact one of your former colleagues Steve
Pinker has written a book the better
angels of our nature that in fact
if you wanted to choose a time to be
around and have a happy nonviolent life
today is a lot better than when you
being around at Neanderthal times well
that's what he claims but the weight of
evidence is strongly against it you
think so I think so there's very good
work by serious anthropologist Brian
Ferguson is one whose work through his
data and I think shown that it's
probably wrong for about 95 percent of
human existence namely the
hunter-gatherer periods it's really with
the emergence of state systems the
development of complex agriculture they
begin to get Wars that are very
destructive I'm this killing among
hunter-gatherers you know but it's
pretty limited but there has been moral
progress in fact he wrote well one thing
that he says is correct I think that's
about it since since the since the
Enlightenment there has been moral
progress in our own lifetimes there's
been moral progress so consider for
example the status of women's rights
today and in 1950 very different status
of civil rights very different the gay
rights very different that's progress
and it's been going on slowly since the
Enlightenment but that's a pretty brief
period of human history it's and in fact
right at the same time have been the
most murderous destructive Wars ever and
even the 70 years ago the creation by
some of the smartest people in the world
of a device that may destroy us all and
is on the verge of destroying us we'll
get to that as you know I'm a chairman
of the board Boeing the Atomic
Scientists it's an issue that's really a
great name for me
you actually just reproduced a quote I
was going to talk about where is it that
there that there has been moral progress
in many ways status of women in
particular to talk about your daughters
versus your grandmother but it and you
say it's fairly brief but don't you
think it's interesting that that
coincides with the rise of science do
you think that's coincidental
no it's not coincidental part of the
contribution of the Enlightenment was to
free inquiry from constraints which led
to the rise of science so breaking free
of these fetters that society had
imposed did permit the rise of science
it did permit moral progress also
permitted massive destruction well now
we're going to get to the massive
destruction and you're interested in
that you wrote at one point and the
transition in this length in this length
language and freedom which is really
trying to understand what whether your
scientific and intellectual background
somehow motivated in some sense your
social activism today maybe you can say
whatever you want take a look at the
first sentence the first sentence of
this article says I've been asked to
talk about language and freedom there's
a lot to say about language there's a
lot to say about freedom but I have
almost nothing to say about and ok but
here's one of the busy connected here's
one of the things you did say which I
find interesting which I want to ask if
it motivates you ok
I mean it's it I like to believe that
the intensive study of one aspect of
human psychology human language may
contribute to a humanistic social
science that will serve as well as an
instrument for social action I would
like to believe
well chatroom is yes I would like that
vote but has that been a motivator no no
I'm not saying you say it has but in a
personal sense do you think that makes a
connection in your own personal activism
well if you look at as a historical fact
no they're separate but there is a kind
of a connection not a logical connection
nothing you can prove
just a suggestive relation and it shows
up in Rousseau so if you take a look at
say the work of or so that I quoted
which is the second discourse on
equality that's his most libertarian
right again he begins with a pretty
strictly Cartesian
view of animals as being machines just
reflexive machines compelled to do what
they do by internal and external
circumstances without the without the
creative character of human thought and
behavior and he then says again in
roughly Cartesian terms that what is
unique and distinctive about humans is
this internal creative capacity that's
what makes humans different from the
rest of the natural world then comes a
thesis which is not proved but I think
it's plausible namely any social
arrangements that inhibit or constrain
that free creative capacity are
fundamentally illegitimate unless they
can justify themselves that means any
structure of authority domination
hierarchy whether it's in a patriarchal
family or in international affairs or
anything in-between should be subject to
challenge it's not self justifying
there's
you could see the chain of thinking
notice it's not a proof but beginning
with the observation that specific to
human nature a term which I don't object
that we talk about that yeah inherent to
human nature what's special about us is
this creative character the free the
need to inquire to create to act to
choose what you do to know how you speak
I interact and so on the this is kind of
a chain of thinking from that to the
conclusion that associate which is in
were so in fact that social structures
which inhibit that are illegitimate
unless proved otherwise like sometimes
you can give an argument in favor of
Authority so if I'm walking down the
street with say my three-year-old
granddaughter and she runs into the
street and I grabbed her arm and pull
her back I think I can give a
justification for that but the point is
that any the argument is that any form
of authority and domination requires
justification and usually you can't
justify it in which case you have to
dismantle it and replace it by something
more free and just
