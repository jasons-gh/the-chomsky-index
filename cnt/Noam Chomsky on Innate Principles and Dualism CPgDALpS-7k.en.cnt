every time I hear about your assertion
that certain principles of language are
innate I can't get over my response that
that seems an explanation of sorts of
last resort and I keep wanting to think
to think to say instead that we have not
yet figured out how we can extract those
principles from experience and that's a
common reaction and I think it's an
interesting fact that people have that
reaction so it's very in fact what
you're saying is very characteristic and
it's an interesting fact about the
intellectual culture which goes back
hundreds of years and notice that you
have I assume we would have a very
different reaction to say let me ask you
the following question suppose that as
far as I'm aware nobody knows anything
about the biological factors involved in
puberty okay I suppose that somebody
comes along and says and also as far as
I'm aware every embryo in every
developmental biologist assumes that
puberty is basically programmed I mean
it'll happen it will happen can be
affected by the nutritional level or
something and so on suppose somebody
came along and said well that's an
explanation of last resort it really
results from peer pressure but we just
haven't figured it out I mean it really
results when the fact that you know
these young people ten years old see
their friends going through puberty and
everyone else that's why they're doing
okay well you know that's conceivable
now the point is when you make that
proposal every day last now the question
is what's the difference why do we think
it's ridiculous in one case and
plausible in the other case as far as
you know the evidence is about the same
in fact the evidence for a rate
structure is probably better for things
above the neck because there were not in
total ignorance you actually have some
four strong proposals about the innate
principles and some explanatory force to
them too so that estandares de sciences
at least we have more reason
to believe in the innate principles of
both the neck and below the neck and in
fact they also did in 17th century the
one case that I even mentioned if you go
through it about the Cardin Hume is an
example of that you know there were some
phenomena around every agreed on the
phenomena there was very strong evidence
by the criteria the science Sciences to
take the Karp's solution that it's you
need that's why it happens
nevertheless the long-term consequences
were acceptance of Joan's solution with
its self refutation that we don't have
the concept of a straight line now I
think that reflects that same strange
intuition that people have above the
neck we insist that everything's got to
be experienced below the neck were quite
willing to accept the idea that
everything is the way in a rational
person would think if you have things
that happen without information that
must be coming from inside and I think
the question is why the dualism well if
there were any rational support for it
you could look at that argument but
there isn't any what it comes down to is
exactly the feeling that you expressed
and that's the standard opinion so we
have to ask a question about irrational
attitudes why this particular irrational
attitude that's what it is
and you could have various speculations
about it not my extra Frank opinion is
that it's a reflection of a kind of
something which also showed up in
traditional dualism so I mean as humans
it's very natural to think of people as
having a mind and a body which are
separate to connect them you know
traditional mind-body dualism was very
common sensical I think it's probably is
the way we think about people that's why
we would regard someone as being the
same person if their body underwent oh
you know what we call their body
Wonderland all sorts of changes that we
will think of them as a different person
if you write coded their brains and they
had somebody else's memories and
language and so on okay that's just the
way we look at people and it's very hard
to get out of it just like it's very
hard to look at the Sun setting and to
tell to tell yourself it's not setting
the Earth's turning I mean you sort of
know that at some level but there's no
way for you to look at that and stop
seeing it as the Sun setting you
can't and I think when we look at people
it's extremely hard for us to look at
them and not see them as Minds inside
bodies well traditional dualism
metaphysical dualism collapsed for
scientific reasons but that doesn't mean
we can get out of our skins we still
look at people this way and I think
we're as replaced traditional dualism is
a kind of an epistemological dualism
which comes out pretty much like this it
says below the neck I mean that
metaphorically like you know on the
things that people call physical we're
willing to pursue the methods of
Sciences and if they lead us to conclude
that things are internally programmed
will accept it above the neck we're
going to be completely irrational we're
going to insist on what we would never
dream of in the case of things that are
fall on our side of the intuitive
boundary physical and I think that's
probably correct I don't see any other
way of explaining this strange
phenomenon for the last hundred just
over 100 years that the very that even
that the very same kind of evidence in
fact even better evidence than that
which would make us laugh about puberty
and peer pressure has made people think
we can't do that in the case of metal
activity there's another explanation no
but I think we're in the domain of
trying to account for irrational human
beliefs
