well I think the European integration is
one of the great achievements of the
post Second World War period the it was
designed in recent years in a way which
is dysfunctional the establishment of a
single currency without the proper
political structure is a recipe for
disaster
so take say the United States where
there's a common currency you know the
federal structure if say the state of
Missouri or Mississippi which is a
poorer state is in financial difficulty
there are transfers from the rich states
like New York and Massachusetts that
doesn't happen in Europe in Europe there
are no mechanisms for the rich sectors
to assist the poor sectors in times of
difficulty now if there were different
currencies that wouldn't matter so much
States could youcould
devalue their currency to export their
way out of problems but you have a rigid
structure in the euro zone in which
countries like say Greece or Italy and
so on do not have control over their
currencies and there is also no
compensatory system of the kind that
exists say in a federal structure like
the United States so you're bound to
have disaster this has been exacerbated
by the extreme forms of austerity which
have been imposed particularly since
2008
even the IMF economists recognize that
this is economically observed the IMF
political actors are different from they
reject their own economists advice but
this has been very harmful and
destructive of democratic participation
The Wall Street Journal for example
pointed out correctly that in Europe
whoever is elected no matter where they
are in the political spectrum the
policies are going to be the same
because they're not determined by the
populations in their countries the major
policies go back to the bureaucracy the
euros of the European Commission other
well you know the pen says whether she
means it or not that she'll call the
referendum which might lead to friction
that'll destroy the European Union
I don't think Germany would initiate it
because their beneficiaries of the Union
but if the Union falls apart I think it
would be a tragic development I think
that's the importance of
that groups like of our focuses m25 they
want to preserve the European what's
good about the European Union and
overcome the problems within it that
seems to me the more constructive
approach take a look at what's happening
the French election that's coming up
they're basically two candidates one of
them ultra right the other one far-right
of both of them to the right of the US
political system it's pretty dramatic
fact in Austria
the candidate of the freedom party which
has I feel neo-nazi roots may win the
presidential election
