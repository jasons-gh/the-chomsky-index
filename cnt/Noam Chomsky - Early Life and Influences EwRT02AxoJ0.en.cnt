my father was they were both
first-generation immigrants my father
came when he was about 17 he came in
1913 from the Ukraine
he came essentially to escape the czars
draft which was almost a death sentence
for Jewish boys they lived and he lived
in a village which was later wiped out
by the Nazis nothing left and he when he
came to the United States didn't know
any English he worked in a sweatshop and
Baltimore man should get to learn the
language got some education finally went
to Johns Hopkins got a degree ended up a
pretty important Hebrew scholar did a
lot of work on medieval Hebrew grammar
in fact when I was a child I was reading
his the draft of his dissertation on
david kimba the 13th century medieval
grammarian and he went on to be an
educator kind of a dewy-eyed
educator and then ran taught in a hebrew
college and then the Graduate University
of Jewish Studies in Philadelphia dropsy
College it's my father
my mother was also an immigrant she came
when she was a baby about a year old and
she came from what's now Belarus family
was in New York also a both families
extreme super Orthodox I mean my I
remember my mother telling me that when
she was with her friends and in the
streets of New York it's a young
teenager if she saw her father coming
towards them they would cross the street
because she didn't want to be
embarrassed and in front of her friends
by having her father passed by and act
as if he didn't recognize her mere girl
you know she the girls she was not she
was very smart
independent but she couldn't go to
college that's only for boys so her
younger brother was allowed to go to
college but she could already go to
Normal School she became a teacher an
educator also a Hebrew educator
workbooks actually two of us even wrote
a play together once in Hebrew but she
became a pretty influential educator in
the Hebrew I wouldn't say you know
ghetto isn't exactly the right word but
there wasn't it where we they lived in
Philadelphia where I grew up though
there was a segment of the Jewish
community mostly first-generation
immigrants who were deeply engaged in
revival Hebrew revival of the
modernization of Jewish culture they
want this split from the Diaspora
tradition of Eastern Europe and split
from Yiddish yeah they might both my
parents their native languages Yiddish
but they wouldn't let us hear a word so
all I learned of Yiddish was what
everybody learns from Woody Allen or a
secret language of your parents
you dropped the only dish wood into your
public performances though don't you
occasionally yeah so who influenced you
the most politically some or dead
politically really neither I mean they
were this is the 30s so they were fairly
conventional New Deal Democrats I mean I
can remember listening to Roosevelt's
fireside chats and Friday even I think
Friday evening that was kind of a mood
of calm settling over the family you
know everything's gonna be okay
but the influences on me politically to
the extent they came from the family
came from different part of the family
my my mother's relatives were all in New
York New York's a short train ride from
Philadelphia and by the time I got old
enough to travel myself about 11 or 12
had take the train to New York all the
time stay with a couple of my relatives
and they were mostly they were
working-class mostly most of unemployed
at the time and there was a pretty
lively there was a very lively working
class culture in the 1930s sort of
forgotten but
like my uncle when uncle who was maybe
the biggest influence on my life at that
age actually never went past fourth
grade and others had some education but
not much your uncle was a Trotskyite
wasn't he he had been through every sect
that there was and had checked but so he
wasn't it he was an extra suit but an X
everything else's will you what you were
never seduced by the Communist Party in
the Soviet Union where time I was about
12 years old I was not only
anti-stalinist but aunt Edie Leninist
from the left and I was being led
towards the anarchist movements and
towards the left Marxists there was a
major component of the Marx tradition
which was very critical of Bolshevism
from the left there was another one from
the right the Mensheviks but that was
important one on the left
people like Anton Pannekoek who was one
of the leading intellectuals of the
social democracy but a left critic of
Bolshevism and others and those are the
people I read and they were not too far
from the from components of the
anarchist movement they were sort of
close to the anarcho-syndicalist who I
was also interested and I became very
much interested in the Spanish
revolution right around the early around
1941 that well that was one of that was
one of the Buhl the impulse to Rodge
pretty much your first column or your
first article when you were 10 I don't
know if it was the first one but it was
yeah an early one I was the editor of
the fourth-grade newspaper and I'm
probably the only reader and except
maybe for my mother I don't know but I
did write an article which I was from
half remember right after the fall of
Barcelona so that would have been about
February 1939 it wasn't specifically
about the Spanish Civil War it was about
the rise of the spread of fascism in
Europe which he mimics as a child it
seemed very frightening and ominous I
mean
you know I listen to Hitler's speeches
on the radio and understand anything but
you'd pick up the mood and the threat
and sort of knew some of the things that
were happening and the article was about
the fall of Austria then Czechoslovakia
and now Spain it looked at the time it
looked as if fascism was unstoppable nor
spread over the world was frightening in
itself but it also had a it tied in with
personal experiences which incidentally
my parents never even knew about those
days you didn't talk to your parents
about personal things not the least boys
didn't it's not done but we lived in a
neighborhood where we were the only
Jewish family and the neighborhood was a
pretty professed partly it was Irish
Catholic when they just hated the
British and partly was German they were
for a Nazi but I was boy in the streets
you get to run into these things and I
grew up with it just a visceral fear of
Catholics I know when the kids came out
of the Catholic school down the street
they were going to be braving any
Semites and maybe later in the afternoon
they'd calm down I could play ball or
something but it's just part of
experience was fear of antes violently
anti-semitic mostly Catholic kids coming
from this Jesuit school well with this
momentum with this background
why didn't you study politics when he
went to university why did you suddenly
opt for linguistics I didn't study
politics because I really didn't believe
in what was being taught I thought I had
better insight from other sources and I
in retrospect think that was probably a
wise decision and actually I got into
linguistics through political contacts
it's a just a personal story my office
of any general pictures while I'd love
to hear I in I went to a do experimental
school as I said my father was very much
interested in do we do E's educational
theories and practice them it was run by
Temple University
Department which have a progressive
education department it was a terrific
school I was there from infancy really
but 18 months old since my parents
worked until the high school so until 12
and it was a very exciting experience
the there was no you weren't graded
there were no ranking actually I didn't
know I was a good student until I got
into high school I knew I had skipped a
grade but okay that's just meant I was
the smallest kid in the class nobody
paid any attention to it and it did the
teachers kind of an inspired creative
work often cooperative he worked with
other people or he's pursued your own
interests there was a curriculum you
followed it and I can remember the
school very well then I got into the
academic high so there's one academic
high school in the city actually two one
for boys one for girls my life went
future wife went to the girls woman and
it was it's kind of like a black hole
and I don't remember a thing
I everything was great it had to pass
exams you know yeah everything was
ranked they were extremely boring I was
looking forward to go to cut going to
college the local college of course
there's no thought of going anywhere
else live at home you work go to college
but and I looked in the cap I was 16
when I got into college and the catalog
look very exciting that's going to take
courses and stuff when I started to take
the courses I discovered it's it's high
school you know it's just boring routine
and I was ready to drop out after about
a year I didn't see any point going on
and I happen to run into through
political contact through left what's
now would be called anti-zionist then it
was I honest left zionist and a state
radical activism I ran into a professor
at the this is zellig harris zellig
harris who was very much involved in
these things in fact was at the center
of many of these movements
and had a big influence a lot of young
Jewish intellectuals at the period he
didn't write much so nobody knows about
it was very influential and kind of a
charismatic person I got to know him and
he in retrospect I think he was trying
to convince me to get back into college
he didn't say anything but he just
suggested that I start taking some of
his graduate courses so I I took them
isn't life serendipitous strange you
have absolutely arbitrary eyes no the
whole thing for me is totally so I don't
even have professional qualifications
which is when I'm teaching at MIT they
didn't care but I had no professional
qualifications in a field through
Harrison influence I started taking
graduate he directed me to faculty
members at the University were pretty
exciting people but in different fields
the one was at mathematics another in
philosophy and I ended up with a strange
hodgepodge of well you did pretty well
because you finished up as institutional
professor and professor emeritus of
linguistic and philosophy at MIT which
isn't too bad for a sort of an
autodidact it was serendipitous uses
it's mostly accidental when I got out of
I did go for four years of at Harvard
Graduate work site a fellow's kind of a
graduate in sub institution at Harvard
for select students and that was very
free also it's kind of like elementary
school again but when I was finished
with that I had no profession and I had
no particular job prospects and I had
friends at MIT and they just suggested
that I come to the electronic I get a
job in the electronics lab and I can't
tell our radio from a tape recorder this
day if I something goes wrong with my
computer I've check with my
grandchildren but so I had an interview
the head of the our research lab
electronics a person became pretty well
known Jerry Wiesner he became Kent
Kennedy's science advisor shortly after
and we had an interview he was
interested and talking about what I was
interested and he thought it was
interesting he
jested that i work in a project that
they had there on machine translation
and I told them I thought it was a silly
project I wasn't going to work on it but
the way to solve it was just brute force
there was nothing else you could do
which turned out to be correct here's a
later but he thought that was a pretty
good answer so he said okay I want you
to just work out what you're interested
in and it kind of went on from there but
it was locked you know otherwise I would
never have ended up in the academic
world it's interesting that even if you
had never made a public utterance on
matters political that you were going to
be a trailblazer because I vividly
recall your great contribution your
great theoretical contribution to the
notion of language that it is innate and
not learnt and you argued discovered the
role of hormones in the emergence of
human language in much the same way as
hormones play such a part in the
emergence of puberty in a sense that's
correct there was a kind of a general
atmosphere in Cambridge Mass which was
all over the place but in Cambridge was
kind of the the peak in philosophy
social sciences psychology linguistics
or frankly all fields it was called
behavioral science they there was a
belief there was an interesting period
that an American life altogether it was
an interesting period it's worth
remembering that before the Second World
War the United States was far and away
the richest country in the world but it
really wasn't a major player in world
affairs
you know Britain was the dominant power
and intellectually it was a kind of a
backwater if you wanted to study the
physics or philosophy or math you went
to Germany or England if you want to be
a writer he went to Paris you know the
United States was like central Iowa he
wanted to get out if you wanted to do
anything so much so that after the
Second World War when I was teaching at
MIT we were still teaching French and
German to the graduate students
because as I hold over from the pre-war
period they had to know them because
that's where the work was after the
Second World War changed all that
dramatically the power shifted to the
United States it became the major
technological center intellectual center
a lot of European Emma grace came they
fled fascism Europe was devastated so
there was a kind of a sort of a Rome
Greece attitude towards Europe yeah it's
there and say your personal timing was
perfect with your personal timing was
perfect like that look at it but it was
more than that I mean there was a sense
in the United States and the 50s if you
read back the literature then that we
can discard all of that old-fashioned
stuff that was all old European stuff
we're gonna do it the right way we're
Americans we'll do everything from
scratch and it had an objective basis of
the United States at that time was you
know the by farther it had literally
half the world's wealth and incredible
security and it was in a position to
dominate the world and planners knew it
there were careful plans laid for
running the world but in the
intellectual spheres and it was kind of
at its peak and places like Cambridge
you know Harvard and MIT and so on there
was a sense that we can start everything
all over and there were there were a lot
of new discoveries that the early 1950s
that was discovery of DNA oK we've
somehow in the 1930s there was and it
included a major American scientist
Linus Pauling that was kind of a it was
became possible to unify chemistry and
physics with the new quantum theory and
that was a step forward then during the
war a lot of technological development
after the war came in the late forties
an information theory which looked like
could be a unifying concept for the
human sciences and then came radical
behaviorism Skinner's work late forties
it looked like kind of the answer to
human behavior
couple years later came Crick and Watson
discovery of DNA it looked as if somehow
biology was going to be integrated into
a chemistry which already somehow had a
link to physics and the concept of
unified science you know we can unify
all of science and march on what was
very dominant it's still just beyond
their reach is by now saying for Ava's a
lot more modesty now and properly in the
human sciences including linguistics
there was a sense that everything was
basically solved you know just kind of a
few touches here and there but the basic
ideas are understood the most
influential philosopher of the period it
happened to be at Harvard WV Quine one
of the very influential philosopher his
view was that as he put it languages
just essentially an arbitrary collection
of conditioned responses it's a fabric
of sentences connected to one another
and to stimuli by conditioned response
and scary and lines and that was
virtually Dogma that together with
information theory you know the
computers were just coming along it
looked as if it would be possible to
automate analytic techniques that's
where the machine translation interest
came from there were a couple of us
actually three grad students who didn't
believe a word of it at Harvard and
early 50s and we try to work at our own
views one of the one of them died some
years ago it was the founder of modern
biology of language and others my
officemate
still after 60 years at MIT is retired
also but we thought first of all that
with regard the language that the core
problems were just being ignored and not
even studied I mean the core the most
elementary property of language when you
think about it and it was kind of
understood in the 17th and 18th century
is that the core is a capacity which all
humans share and no other organism has
to
act creatively with language to produce
an unbounded number of expressions which
have very specific meaning and very
specific sound not determined by stimuli
either external or internal appropriate
to situations not caused by them
intelligible to others who recognize
that they could have expressed the same
thought the same way that that record
them before and it can go on without
bounds that's a kind of an elementary
aspect of human nature and a very
distinctive one you should go back to
see the cart that was kind of the core
of a Cartesian philosophy and it it
spread and found its way into all sorts
of directions like classical liberalism
much enlightenment thought a lot of it's
been forgotten since but it was quite
real it was forgotten in the 19th
century in the 20th century it was
became much became turned into what I
just described behavioral science
analysis of data and so on but it was
missing all of these points and then the
three of you come along and well the
three of us you know just a little a
couple of other friends you know it was
mainly the three of us thought first of
all but this ought to be the core
problem for the study of language and
the other thing we thought was that
language should not be divorced from
biology that the capacity for languages
of biological capacity much like I say
the visual system or the immune system
and so on just some subsystem of the
cognitive faculties which should be
studied chemistry on its own but also
integrated with others that later came
to be called bio linguistics and
pursuing those two directions a new
approach to language and cognitive
science sort of began to develop with in
interaction with this around the same
time it's still a very little conflicted
it's it's not that everyone accept it by
any means I'm aware of that
you are under constant attack in that
area of your life as you were but so as
you are politically it's a contested
area but I think it I don't really think
there's much shouldn't be much
controversy on it but and out of that
came and then MIT just became the center
of it we were all at MIT and one of us
Erik Lana Berg that went off to medical
school and worked on biology of language
and Morris Howie is as I said still my
officemate
after all these years and we developed
the department and students came and so
on and so forth spread all over the
world and you were able to demonstrate
quite convincingly that the capacity to
learn language was as its greatest when
the human being is pretty young it was
kind of known intuitively but as the
topic became studied much more
intensively actually some of the best
works done by a couple of scientists who
are right here now Stephen Crane and
Ross Thorne by now this intensive study
of acquisition of language and yeah like
other biological capacities it it
appears to have what's called a critical
period that was it it functions almost
reflexively at a certain stage of life
later stages gets outside hotter doesn't
it has differently actions are
individual differences but it's
generally through
