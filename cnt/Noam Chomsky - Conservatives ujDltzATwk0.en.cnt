see you're strongly associated with
libertarian socialism with
anarcho-syndicalism but one thing that I
find interesting is that you call
yourself one of the few conservatives in
the United States because as you say you
actually believe in traditional values
now and I'm just amazed for the same
clarity when you stay conservative what
do you mean probably
well confirm conservative now it doesn't
mean anything like I realize it's been
used in many devalues ago memory stages
so takes a Reagan is supposed to be the
ideal of the conservatives he believed
that a very powerful state which
intervened massively in the economy he
was most by far the most protectionist
American president and post-war history
they believed in violence and oppression
you know I mean that's cold
conservatives and what I mean any
genuine conservative would turn over in
his grave that the term conservative
used to mean something like classical
liberal person who believed in classical
liberal values that is of the
Enlightenment the values
Smith David Hume and others and I think
there's a lot I mean I don't agree with
them
there's a lot of value in those in the
Enlightenment conception so there is no
and in fact I think in many ways the a
lot of the anarchist movement including
dinner
anarcho-syndicalism we know that grew
out of these classical liberal ideals
that's not my original view incidentally
one of the leading
anarcho-syndicalist thinkers Rudolf
rocker pointed out I think with some
plausibility that classic as he put it
classical liberalism was destroyed when
it was kind of dashed against the rocks
of capitalism which undermined it and
anarchism is a natural outcome of that
which tries to capture the fundamental
ideals and realize them in a modern
society it's complex but I think there's
something to that it's kind of
interesting if you go back a century
when the courts were beginning to
provide extraordinary rights to
corporations like the right of person
that was a big issue it's been a course
about a century ago that was condemned
by conservative supported by
progressives was condemned by
conservatives because they regarded it
as an attack on the fundamental
principles of classical liberalism and
the Enlightenment namely that rights in
here in human beings not organic
entities created by state power
progressives incidentally supported they
support a the personal rights
the corporation they supported granting
corporations more right overwhelming not
business is not doing the lines to
starkly but substantially okay so when
you're using term conservative you're
talking but an older kind of
conservative what's the word
traditionally met I'm not talking like
Ingrid I'm not talking to Reagan I'm not
talking about Fox News you know these
are not conservatives in any traditional
sense they're radical status
