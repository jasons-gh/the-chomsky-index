I apologize that I have a very tight
schedule international interviews coming
right at first I'll have to leave
abruptly and I'll just say a few words
and then leave as much time as possible
for discussion I agree with the previous
speakers that Latin America's be precise
South America is entering a period of
enormous promise in many ways it's the
most exciting area in the world of today
I think this is the first time since the
European contact first group in contact
and the horrendous collapse of the great
civilizations of the Western Hemisphere
first time since then that I think one
can look forward with some optimism
sorts of promising period ahead
regrettably I have to keep the South
America Central America has not
recovered from Reagan's terrorist Wars
and may never recover from them and of
course there's a long terrible history
that i'll have to recount it's a is a
question why the promising developments
in south america they have been so long
delayed to region with very rich
resources many great many advantages the
late 19th century the growth rate in
brazil that was actually higher than in
the United States which was foreign way
the highest in the industrial world
Argentina was none the richer
in the world in the 1920s it was
confidently predicted that the Brazil
was on its way to become what was called
the Colossus of the South counterpart of
the Colossus of the north for many
reasons that didn't happen one of the
reasons was that it was South America
was living under the shadow of the
colossus of the north which was not a
benign shadow but the primary reasons I
think were internal to South America and
all of these issues are now being
confronted the internal ones of the
external ones and addressed at least to
some extent overcome the internal
problems have to do with forms of
disintegration two games actually
internal to each country there's a sharp
bearish as you will know very sharp
split between a tiny wealthy elite
mostly white was a very close race class
correlation throughout the region so a
tiny rich wait mostly elite and ruling
over a vast sea of misery and oppression
and suffering the and the wealthy have
had no real responsibility for their own
societies differs from other regions in
this respect we see it in many
dimensions so the falafel comparison
with Eastasia in the last half century
is revealing pics a imports imports to
South America have been skewed or luxury
consumption by the rich East Asia have
been directed to capital
import capital productive investment
with regard to export say export of
capitals that exports all together it's
Morris in South America is still saddled
with the raw materials export tradition
in the past East Asia course not through
the quickly up the technological ladder
as a man export of capital I have sort
of capital capital flight from Latin
America's roughly on the scale of the
depression debt which suggests suede
overcome that commenced bird East Asia
it was quite different export of capital
was strictly controlled effect in South
Korea during its major growth period to
get the death penalty for exporting
capital the same is true of Fayette
taxation South East Asia relatively
egalitarian South America's quite
different Bechtold old Latin America
observed by perfect custom data when he
was appointed for the Fox administration
he was asked how with Lisa Social
Democratic background he was willing to
demand the taxes on essential goods like
that food medicines and so on his answer
was pretty sensible he said that in our
countries the rich avoid taxes the mass
of the poor
nothing so the only choice is to skim
the major resources of those who can
barely get by and there's more than a
little truth than that unfortunately and
the same polls in general with the
attitude toward the applicable rule
paddle Washington Consensus go out
several decades Latin America adhered
them rigorously the only region the
comparable ringer was sub-saharan Africa
both were disaster East Asia simply more
and followed the path of the developed
countries with heavy reliance on the
state secretary of state intervention
it's still true of the United States the
US economy relies dramatically on the
dynamic state sector and I think it's a
significant component who's not
disgusting economic modeling sort of the
true facts the that's one form of
disintegration internal to each country
related to that is another kind
countries were separate from one another
the wealthy elites those societies were
oriented abroad not some other countries
second homes cultural relations papal
exploration and so on was the west and
that kind of disintegration is that it
is a very serious problem for the site's
themselves but it's also a barrier to
dependence independence as a virtual
prerequisite for
dependences in his integration society
so they said it can't be a graph one
after another by external forces as is
happening too often and sell in the past
but all that is changing its changing in
quite dramatic ways in my view of the
one of the most dramatic ways it's
changing has to do with just popular
organization there are massive popular
organizations in South America the kind
of don't exist here and they are the
basis for a real progress and democracy
they were a lot to learn from South
America in that respect the most
dramatic example is the first country of
supplemented by the living in december
two thousand five they had an election
free election of a time the beginning
three LMP it's a comparison that
political scientists in fact the general
public would pay a lot more attention to
so in there is a model of democracy here
and she was reasonably articulated by
the White House Christmas tree broad
consent the white house spokesperson
bina Farina was asked by journalists of
why the administration is pursuing the
Iraq war so intensely of the police post
would and she answered properly she said
you had your input the American people
have an input every four years that's
the way our system works the rest of the
time shut up I think that's correct
that's the way the system work every
four years you have a chance to choose
between two candidates whose views you
oppose and we know that the public
poses the views by extensive studies of
public attitudes but that's the way the
system works and the public's aware of
is no illusion so eighty percent of the
public thinks the country has run the
words of the polls are by a few big
interests looking out for themselves and
not for the benefit of the people the
public overwhelmingly opposes the model
that arena correctly described which is
a consensus across the spectrum educated
statement ninety-five percent of the
public thinks the courage to pay
attention to public opinion all the time
we heard this morning that it took
eighty percent of the public thinks the
country's going the wrong way but they
don't think they can do anything about
it even though it's a light bill year
because that's not the way the system
work well Olivia was quite different
there there was a mass popular movements
which elected somebody from their own
ranks first time that the majority in
the population was able to enter the
political arena actively and
successfully the issues were series
resource control Cultural Rights it
wasn't justice and so on it wasn't just
a matter of pushing a button once every
four years and then shutting up these
were struggles that have been underway
for a long time very active
the men to violent repression and there
was a fun election of real consequence
well you know that is a model of
democracy that's foreign to the United
States not totally in the past that's
happened but contemporary United States
which means that we can learn quite a
lot about the democracy promotion by
looking at the poorest country in South
America it's not the only case
