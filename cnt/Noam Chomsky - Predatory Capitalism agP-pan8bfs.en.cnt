but it's not what the whole new
libertarian movement would tell you is
that precisely again the government is
being used as an extension of the market
to protect this kind of like a regular
form of capitalism that's hand in glove
with the government we just need to kind
of free up government regulation and
light capitalism work on its own first
of all the business world would never
tolerate that they rely heavily on
government but if you did follow the
libertarian prescriptive what are called
liberty remember what's called
libertarian in the United States is has
nothing to do with traditional
libertarianism it's a kind of
ultra-right capitalist
anarcho-capitalism they call it if that
was allowed the function hull society
collapse and we turned that total
tyranny we would have tyranny of
unaccountable private institutions a
private concentration of capital
it's totally unaccountable to the public
absolute Tyranny the only thing that
protects the public from predatory
capitalism is some degree of state
intervention so it's true that the state
intervention does support the capitalist
institutions it also protects the
society from total destruction
predatory capitalist system just simply
couldn't survive I mean for example I
mean for perfectly obvious reasons for
one thing it wouldn't care about
externalities effects on others so
within no time it would destroy the
environment simply by destroying
resources pouring carbon dioxide into
the atmosphere
who cares furthermore there would be no
public goods the markets I mean there's
an ideology that which claims that
markets provide freedom of choice so
they're kind of democratic that's not
true and we all know it's not true so
for example suppose I I want to get home
this evening the market does offer
choices
a four-door Toyota doesn't offer the
choice I want which is a public
transportation system that's not part of
the market the market focuses you on
individual consumption of consumer goods
period that's is that what you want in
life just more and more gadgets around
there lots of other things in life which
the market doesn't even offer so what's
called libertarianism is a prescription
for complete disaster I'm not I don't
think the people advocating it
understand this I'm not criticizing them
but just think it through and I should
say it's very anti libertarian I'm in
traditional libertarianism which was
always on the Left I was opposed to the
master-servant relation people giving
orders and other people taking them
that's libertarianism and not in this
