Now, as far as 'socialism' is concerned, that term has been so evacuated of content over the last century that is hard even to use.
I mean, the Soviet Union, for example, was called a 'socialist society'. And it was called that by the two major propaganda operations in the world.
The US, the Western one, and the Soviet one. They both called it 'socialism', for opposite reasons.
The West called it 'socialism' in order to defame socialism by associating it with this miserable tyranny.
The Soviet Union called it 'socialism' in order to gain whatever... to benefit from the moral appeal that true socialism had among large parts of the general world population.
But this was about as remote from socialism as you can imagine.
I mean, the core notion of at least traditional socialism is that... what you mentioned,
that working people have to be in control of production and communities have to be in control of their own lives and so on.
And, you know, this is... this goes...
The Soviet Union was the exact opposite of that. Working people had no control over anything. They were virtual slaves.
And the collapse of the Soviet Union is in fact a small victory for socialism, in my opinion. It eliminated one of the major barriers to it, and should have been recognized as such.
But the term has been, as I said, so... become so meaningless that is hard even to use.
If we use it in the traditional sense, which you brought up, that goes -you know- that goes straight back in American history.
You read the working class press in the mid-19th century, -you know- the press published by artisans and what were called 'factory girls',
young women from the farms working in the textile mills and... Eastern Massachusetts which was center of the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
Their press was calling for... they said that their theme was that 'those who work in the mills ought to own them'.
Wage labor, which was called 'wage slavery', was regarded by most Americans as not very different from slavery.
Even the Republican Party regarded wage labor as just at best a preliminary to free labor, but intolerable. Because it's kind of servitude.
Large part of the Northern population fighting Civil War was fighting under that banner.
This goes straight through the 20th century, the idea that people should be in control of their own destinies and lives,
including the institutions in which they work, the communities in which they live and so on.
Call it what name you want, but that's traditional socialism, and there are today attempts to describe -kind of- a detailed vision of the future, based on these notions,
the most extensive and detailed one I know is by Michael Albert at ZNet, which you mentioned, that's participatory economics.
And there are others such proposals...
But I think this is deeply ingrained in people's understanding and consciousness and barely below the surface.
In fact, it's a call for, essentially, extension of democracy to the industrial sphere and to communities as well.
We should also bear in mind that the leading American social philosopher, John Dewey, who's -you know- as mainstream as apple pie,
and his main work was concentrated on democracy,
he pointed out over and over again that as long as we have what he called 'industrial feudalism', that is, a tyrannical private power controlling production and commerce,
democracy would be very limited.
We have to move to what he called 'industrial democracy' if we hope to have significant democracy.
As for politics, his position was that, until that happens, politics will be 'the shadow cast over society by big business'.
Whatever the...
And I think most of the population recognizes that and accepts it.
