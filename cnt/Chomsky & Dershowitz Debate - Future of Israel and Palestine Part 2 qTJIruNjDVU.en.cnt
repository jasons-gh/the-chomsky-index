worth every sane Israeli hawk understood
that it was absurd for Israel to leave
8,000 settlers in Gaza protected by a
large part of the army while taking over
scarce water resources and arable land
the same conclusion was to withdraw from
Gaza while expanding through the West
Bank and that will continue as long as
Washington insists on marching on the
road to catastrophe by rejecting minimal
Palestinian rights I'm quoting the
warning of the four former heads of
Israel Shin bait security service there
are clear alternatives and if that March
the catastrophe continues we will have
only ourselves to blame thank you
in the spirit of discussion of this form
we are now going to open the floor to
your questions so there are four
microphones one here one got it there
one here in the intermediate stage and
one on the floor directly in front of me
we're going to proceed as follows and so
I want you to listen carefully to
respect this ability of the discourse
that I intend to make sure that we
follow here I'm going to ask you to
introduce yourself and to ask just one
question as the Dean of our school
always reminds people questions and with
a question mark and out of respect for
all of our colleagues and students here
this evening waiting patiently at the
mics I will insist on only one brief
question I would also ask that you wear
appropriate direct your question to one
of the panelists after that panelist
response i will invite his colleague for
a brief comment and then we will return
to the floor so that you know what's
coming I will begin over here go up
across and then back down hi my name is
Misha Harmon I'm from Jerusalem and this
is a question for asking professor
Chomsky I wanted to know if you think
that it actually is relevant to dwell
upon forming a shared narrative of both
sides in going forth towards any any
solution of peace between us is it
important for us to actually agree what
what what 48 represents for one one side
and what 48 represents for the other in
order to live together in peace
the future yes I think it's very
relevant to understand history if you
want to understand the present professor
Dershowitz akong agree and I think the
history has to be objectively verifiable
and it doesn't become true because
professor Chomsky says it's true there
was a two-state solution proposed by the
United Nations in 1948 and if the
Palestinians had accepted what the
Israelis accepted a small non contiguous
state with banta stands to quote
professor Chomsky and instead had not
invaded and if the Egyptians had not
occupied the Gaza something that nobody
complained about it was literally a
prison for 20 years and if their
Jordanians hadn't occupied the West Bank
literally a prison for 20 years and had
the situation gone forward as it was
supposed to go forward in 48 we would
not be here we'd have a two-state
solution but what happened is it's clear
that the palestinian and arab leadership
was more interested in destroying the
nascent jewish state of israel than in
establishing a palestinian state that is
simply the truth and there is no way to
deny that and no amount of rhetoric can
undercut that reality you'll notice that
this case with 1948 and I'd be glad to
discuss that if you like though it's not
relevant okay I began with 1967 for a
good reason because it's in 1967 that UN
through 42 was passed and a framework
was laid for peace settlements and since
then it's the way it well let me briefly
respond we can cuss I was slow well I
participated in the drafting in a small
way of 242 I was off the Goldbergs
assistant at the Supreme Court he
drafted 242 he conferred with me and
consulted with me 242 clearly
contemplated Israel retaining some of
the territories needed to create secure
boundaries in 1967 the UN rejected a
formulation of Israel returning all the
territories of the territories and kept
only territories and as the result of
that Israel accepted to 42 and at
khartoum all the Arab states and the
Palestinians unanimously rejected 242
and issued the three knows know which no
compromises no recognition no peace if
we can do the truth of the matter is if
we can cover the friendly concern
relations their united states which
points out that are as old very
approached the Jordanians and the others
and agreed got them to agree to to
accept a qualified acceptance of two for
two on the condition that there would be
minor and mutual adjustments with no
substantial change to the mat okay there
were curved lines and it was agreed that
they should be straight all right what
you can't see behind the podium is that
both of my colleagues are armed with
several dozen maps and that could get
that could that could get dangerous in
this part of the conversation so I'm
going to ask for some restraint so we
make sure that we go directly to our
participants yes sir thank you ken
sweeter I'd like to bring it to the
present and I'd like to ask professor
Dershowitz since this was a major point
made by professor Chomsky whether or not
you believe Israel is ready to negotiate
for a contiguous state not one of three
separate Bantu stance yes are now
contiguous depends of course on whether
it means contiguous with in the west
bank or contiguous including a
connection between the West Bank and
Gaza now it was the UN that created the
lack of continuity between the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank in fact the
original proposals for Israel required
complete non contiguity the north was
separated from Tel Aviv tel aviv from
jerusalem yet israel accepted a
non-contiguous state under the clinton
parameters there would be complete
contiguity with a circumferential
highway around jerusalem much like route
128 it would take nine extra minutes to
get from Ramallah to Bethlehem then in
the middle of the night through
Jerusalem because the shortest distance
between two lines taken into account
traffic is not a straight line now there
are all kinds of creative proposals for
functional contiguity between the West
Bank and Gaza including a high-tech rail
line recently designed by the rand
foundation I have
picture of that in in my book it also
looks much like the Danish railroad a
high-tech waterway all kinds of ways of
connecting all the Palestinian states do
we cities to each other under this
proposal no point in Palestine would be
more than 90 minutes away from any other
point in Palestine including Gaza it
would take 34 minutes to get from Hebron
to Gaza City on the rail line that is
functional contiguity and the fact that
the leader of the Labour Party for years
has quit his party to join a new party
and the leader of Lee could has quit his
party both in the interest of making
peace persuades me plus an hour I had a
loan in Israel not so long ago with
Prime Minister sharone and much time
that I've spent with the form of Prime
Minister Perez that the will toward
peace is absolute in genuine having said
that I also believe the will to peace by
a boss and many of the leaders of the
Palestinian Authority is genuine to
thank God Israel has to make peace with
the Palestinians and not with the
professor's comment from 23 from whether
those hander Cox tea for those of you
who want to see the maps that lie behind
mirren been dynasties and Sara Roy's and
Human Rights Watch in the European Union
and other comments I have them here but
there's a very simple test that we could
try let's if those are if that's a valid
approach to contiguity for the
palestinian state in twenty-two percent
of the former palestine let's propose it
for the israeli state in seventy-eight
percent of the former palestine let's
ask who would dream of proposing that it
was proposed the peel commission
proposed and is now accepted it in 1937
well you know relevant period Wainwright
we're talking about today Wednesday who
would oppose that for Israel thousands
of people have been killed by terrorism
you don't expect a country to go back to
a proposal that was offered and rejected
many many years earlier options change
when rejection ISM sets in ok let's go
to our next question
going back to 2005 you mentioned the
connection between author professor dash
boots my name is Collison man whether
you mentioned the connection between
Gaza and West Bank right but I think to
follow up on my on the on my colleague
I'm not sure if this is what he meant
what about the pieces of West Bank we're
going to end up with elements are
continuing to be built inside the West
Bank the wall is being built inside the
borders of 1967 so now please talk to me
about peace about pro-palestine when it
comes to building walls and actually
separating the West Bank from East
Jerusalem okay here is what a
Palestinian state would have looked like
had Camp David and taba been accepted it
would be a completely contiguous West
Bank with an area that including my
laddoo mem and some of the other areas
right side of Jerusalem which would
become part of Israel and would remain
within the wall the ultimate goal is to
have a separation fence that is on the
border the accepted border and i'll tell
you what i think the real options are
today the real options are if this new
piece party wins if the char on paris
peace party wins it will offer the
palestinians a very good deal a deal
much like that what was rejected at Camp
David and taba and by the way if you
think it was the Israelis who rejected
it just ask Bill Clinton he has told me
Dennis Ross has told me it was
completely in the fall completely in the
hands of the our thought and that's true
of prince bandar as well but if it gets
accepted this time there and if the
peace party prevails again they will be
offered something very very close to
that it will be a viable Palestinian
state much more viable than anything
Israel was offered and accepted in 38
and in 47 and I think every reasonable
person today would urge the Palestinians
not to repeat the disastrous mistakes
they made in 48 they made in 67 they
made in two thousand they made in 2001
this time say yes except the Palestinian
state build it create an economy create
political system and finally peace can
be achieved Thank You professor Tom so
those who you would like to see the map
I have it it says I said from wrong pun
back the leading israeli scholar the
head of the Shema and Paris Peace Center
it shows that this is Camp David map
which was which Clinton recognized was
impossible which is why they went on to
Tubba and it cuts through the West Bank
completely it's not that it is here it
is this is Ron ok that's the one the
Palestinian or everyone could know
there's not a Palestinian he's the head
of the Shema in Paris is Dennis Ross's
map yes Dennis Ross was the US
negotiators right where it is
meaningless run gun doc is wrong twin
doc is for leading israeli scholar and
if you want to go into why russ's book
is worthless i'll be happy to say it
it's obvious to any reader it stops you
know right obvious to you about copyist
other kids well I'll tell you what it
stops notice that his book stops
immediately before taba why because
Clinton's parameters and what Clinton
said about the acceptance of them by
both sides and the top on negotiations
completely undermines Dennis Ross's book
so he therefore terminates it right
before that and can therefore make these
absurd claims if you want to learn
something about it look at Israeli
scholarship it's much more serious thank
you good evening i like to thank both
professors for Speaking so eloquently
tonight my name is Josh sauce coats I'm
a recent alarm of Harvard College and
I'm really glad to be back I have sort
of a simple question for professor
Chomsky it seems to me that you left out
in your analysis the element of violence
psychological physical against Israel
against Jews and it seems to me also
that the history that Professor dish was
described a lot of that is dictated by
what what happened the Terrorism the
wars against Jews especially considering
the immediate history right before the
establishment to the State of Israel the
Holocaust and
has happened since I'd like you to
address the effect of the psychological
effect in the physical effect of war and
terrorism on Israel that's a half of a
very important question the other half
of it is what's the effect of war on
terrorism on the Palestinians now if you
take a look at that we are not supposed
to talk about that question here but if
you look at the both you'll find that
what penny Mars described is in fact
correct the balance of terror and
violence is overwhelmingly against the
Palestinians not surprisingly given the
balance of forces and that's even true
that's true right to the present I mean
for four decades Israel was able to run
the West Bank virtually with no forces
as Mars point out others point out
because the population was so passive
while they were being humiliated beaten
tortured land stolen and so on just as I
quoted finally there was a reaction and
it's interesting to see the u.s.
reaction to it in the first month of the
Intifada this one october two thousand
in the first month of the Intifada at
275 palestine 74 palestinians were
killed four israelis were killed so in
the occupied territories the Israeli
army according to its own records fired
a million bullets in the first day which
disgusted the generals when they learned
about it Israel first few days of the
Intifada was using us helicopters they
don't make them us helicopters to attack
civilian complexes apartment houses and
so on killing and wounding dozens of
people and the US did respond to that
Clinton responded by sending the biggest
shipment of military helicopters in a
decade to Israel the press responded to
by not publishing it i should add
refusing to publish it because it was
repeatedly brought to their attention
well while the ratio was 20 21 which is
pretty much what it's been for a long
time there was no concern here then over
the next 2-3 years the ratio reduced to
closer to three two one and then came
enormous concern
about the one not three and this goes
back for a long time what I quoted from
Mars is accurate well ready no no
following a very brief response the idea
that there is this vast conspiracy
between the American media and both
Democrats like Clinton and Republicans
like Bush to hide the truth from the
American public just does not bear
reality Israel's an open society any
newspaper can come and cover it why
would not the newspapers cover these
stories well for one reason they are
figments of Chomsky's imagination well
then and there just never happened now
listen I want to talk about another
figment of his imagination chose the
part of the RFI them constantly quotes
constantly quotes many Morris as if many
Mara supports his position what happened
is Benny Morris was asked whether or not
I accurately quote him in my book the
case for peace and Benny Morris
responded as follows uh he still holds
the views that I attributed to him that
I am right about his views and that
someone could read Morris's books this
is a quote from Morris and arrive at
exactly the same conclusions and yet
professor Chomsky by selectively quoting
and by picking tidbits out of context
knowing that you're not going to check
up on him tells you essentially that
what you believe in the American media
whether it be the Washington Post The
Boston Globe where the New York Times is
not true in order to get the true
meaning of the world you have to move to
Planet Chomsky where the news reflects
his perspective on reality well I urge
you to move to the real world read the
real news don't read the Selective
Israeli journalist that he talks about
listen to Dennis Ross Dennis Ross
actually helped to draw the maps he was
there when I have to finish I haven't
done my two minutes when he said when I
asked dennis ross a lot at any minute
about these maps and what what
apparently Chomsky would say in response
Ross said ask professor Chomsky one
thing were you there Dennis Ross was
there he knows what maps were presented
to the Palestinians and what they
rejected thank you
the head of the shitty peridot the head
of the shame on Paris Peace Center wrong
twin doc is the leading scholar on this
and doesn't cut it are you quote rightly
for Taylor right we know her right
before he's refuted the way Venice
rusted presents he was involved in
negotiation since before Oslo right
through Camp David up to the present the
long historical account of it you can
read it if he can read Hebrew some of
its in English the one all this smoke
that was blown had to do with one fact
that i mentioned one and you can check
it and please do in the earth in the
first month of the Intifada I'm now
using Israeli sources 74 palestinians
were killed for Jews in the occupied
territories the first few days this is
reported in the press here Boston Globe
Israel was using us helicopters to
attack apartment complexes Clinton
reacted with the biggest deal in a
decade check it out it's in the public
record not it not questioned by anyone
to send military helicopters to Israel
the there has been a database search of
the u.s. it was reported in Europe it
was reported by Amnesty International
it's reported in Jane's Defence weekly
the main military magazine in the world
there was a database search for the u.s.
press and they found nothing i know of
explicit cases and i'll be glad to tell
them to you where the press was
approached and asked just to report the
fact why did you okay Chomsky why didn't
they report it are they bad reporters
what's their motive explain why because
times of the post wouldn't report this
great story from Planet Chomsky
gentlemen if I could change offense
weekly from the international press and
so on yeah they wouldn't you have to ask
them why they didn't report it i'll give
him my opinion in fact I've written it
lets you given that the JFK form is here
for the purpose of creating educated
citizens and participants in a very
important debate I would ask each of you
to exercise a bit over
drink so that we can have more of our
questions from the audience please and
identify yourself Nancy Mary and if you
want the answer why didn't they reported
see peace propaganda and the promised
land now my question getting back to
today and your functional continuity
good contiguity I would like to know
have you seen not just the wall but the
eight terminals that are being built
under your vision under your compromise
will the terminals be dismantled will
the wall be dismantled will Jerusalem
East Jerusalem be under the sovereignty
of Palestinians not just under the
control and will the Palestinians have
their water resources back will they
have freedom of movement I mean is this
the kind of vision you have is a genuine
one or are you talking about Sharon's
plan well I can work it was so-called
palace I can only tell you what my
proposal is and I think it's a proposal
it's today widely supported within
Israel that is that the ultimate the
security fence I've been through not
only the terminals but the most recent
terminal the most recent high-tech
terminal that was just built I proposed
actually that the security fence be
placed on wheels and constantly be able
to be moved consistent with Israeli
security needs the Israeli Supreme Court
the israeli supreme court ruled last
year and Chomsky misstated it no Israeli
justice has ever said and I challenge
you to find a statement that Barack has
ever said that Israeli law trumps
international law that is simply not
true what he said is that Israeli law
enforces international law but
international law is not determined by a
body the International Court of Justice
which excludes Israelis from serving on
it and which will not allow an Israeli
ever to be a member of that court it
would be as if southern black in the
1930s accepted as the correct statement
of American constitutional law a
decision by an all-white court in a case
involving a black and a white man no
Israel accepts international law and
forces international law and the goal of
course of my peace proposal is that the
security fence will eventually be
dismantled when terrorism ends but
before that it would be on the border
the way the Gaza fence is now on the
border and that water rights would be
respected it would be complete and total
freedom of movement within the
contiguous West Bank and between the
West Bank and Gaza even today Israel has
given up control over the Rafah crossing
it now has a video which it can watch to
see as Palestinians monitor exit and
entry through the Rafah a gateway that's
going to be the future and if there is a
will to peace if there is a desire to
make sure that there are two states not
simply one state a Palestinian state
then all of these issues can be resolved
and will be resolved Israel has shown
the will to resolve these issues
certainly I support a resolution that
gives dignity gives economic viability
gives political freedom and freedom of
movement to the Palestinian people yes
the other and sovereignty over that's
what once again I purposely quoted
justice Bergen to all because I know of
mr. Dershowitz his opposition to the
World Court I therefore a cut coach
quoted the US Justice not the World
Court who stated that the segments of
the wall being built to protect the
settlements are if so facto in violation
of international humanitarian law that's
eighty percent of the wall two months
later Israel's high court stated in
contrast that the separation wall must
take into account the need to provide
security for Israelis living in the west
bank including their property rights
that's in direct contradiction to
justice Bergen thaal's separate
declaration unanimously by the World
Court that's right and if you would like
his comment about how international law
Israeli law supersedes international law
in East Jerusalem because I was annexed
to Israel illegally I'll be happy to
provide it to you just a minute but
that's not what you said please
let's go to the next me I'm a second
year student at the law school professor
Chomsky it seems like you've done a lot
of remembering and very little imagining
and a lenders witches ideas if they seem
funny to have a train or you know some
type of other high-tech connection at
least they're creative and at least
they're moving us forward how do you
deal with the issues of refugees how
would you connect Gaza and the West Bank
or is the only solution in your mind a
one-state solution what would you do
about Jerusalem well as you would know
if you looked at anything I've written
and civic if you would know if you look
at anything that's written I've been
supporting a two-state settlement since
the early 1970s and in print and perhaps
you can show me some of mr. mr.
Dershowitz ooze material in print
supporting it I haven't found it but yes
that's my position since the early 70s
all in print as for connections the
issue recall at Camp David and at taba
and today is territorial in the West
Bank okay if the and the current
proposals are exactly as i described go
through the sources i mentioned or find
any other ones that you think are
serious those are the major israeli and
Western academic sources and human
rights organizations and so on yes they
break up the West Bank into three vantiv
stands as benveniste said with a
virtually no organic connection to East
Jerusalem which is the center of
Palestinian life that's why the EU and
Europe in the European Union and Human
Rights Watch and others flatly reject
them now it is possible what Israel is
in fact doing now is developing a huge
infrastructure system in the West Bank
with highways for Israelis and paths for
Palestinians so that they don't have to
interact with one another which means
that this network around the West Bank
which will be a next to Israel roughly
forty to fifty percent people can travel
in it in great comfort from the suburbs
around color vivre including all the
water resources including
arable land they can get to Tel Aviv and
Jerusalem the Palestinians will be
following paths actually I can read to
you if you like how israeli journalists
are describing that and if you'd like to
check it out for yourself I'd suggest
some time that you take what's
officially called the Palestinian Road
from Bethlehem to Ramallah which takes
like 10 minutes on the Jewish highway
I've taken it it's a little a winding
road that the road goes right next to a
Wadi if it's not raining you're lucky if
you don't fall into it and often the
hill you can see the pads where people
are sort of moving on the days when the
settlers are not traveling the roads are
empty because there's no eating anywhere
I mean you're going up broken-down
taxicab up to a barrier and then you
transport someone who needs dialysis say
they are pregnant woman caring over a
ditch and as you go to another cab and
so on yeah that's kind of contiguity and
again I say the same thing if that's
reasonable then fine let's impose that
kind of contiguity on Israel okay hold
please like that very very brief first
of all listening to the words there's an
element of racism in one of the phrases
we've heard today in describing this as
a Jewish highway 1.2 million israelis
are Arabs many of them are Christians
there is no such thing as a Jewish
highway in Israel there are Jewish there
are Muslim highways in Saudi Arabia
there are Muslim only roads in other
parts of the world but there is no Road
there's nothing in Israel that is opened
only to Jews even synagogues everything
is open to Israeli Arabs every road is
opened to an Israeli rare Arab when the
peace solution is finally proposed had
the Camp David and taba Accords been
accepted the Palestinians would be free
to build any super highways they choose
and indeed Israel has offered now a
super highway in a super roadway between
Gaza and Jerusalem becomes right between
Gaza and Hebra
and the idea of it's very difficult I
acknowledge how to connect East
Jerusalem to Bethlehem to Ramallah and
to Jericho will require a challenge but
people are working on it there are
creative solutions being proposed I am
waiting along with the student who asked
the question for some creative positive
imaginary imaginative solutions from
professor Chomsky all we're hearing is a
recitation of the past and a pessimist
Aikido show love of all is the evil
American Empire and Israel are involved
there will be no pic that's good I
congratulate mr. Dershowitz again for
one true statement they are not to its
roots their Israeli roads that is they
are roads of the sovereigns when i'm
quoting the high court the sovereign
state of the Jewish people in Israel and
the Diaspora oh that's right that's like
saying that British roads are roads of
the sovereign Anglican people on I mean
I written is an Anglican country as well
we can have it i agree your
qualification their Israeli roads there
are a leak I way zand Palestinian pads
if you want to create a solution i
mentioned one let's go did I mentioned
her the Geneva Accords the Taba
agreements which is a real cancelled I
