the past of humanitarian intervention
the history's not very glorious the
future that actually depends on us the
concept itself is that the phrases has
become fashionable quite recently but
the concept is very old in fact just
about every act of violence and
aggression in history that falls under
the category of humanitarian adventure
intervention at least if we believe the
voices of the perpetrators so and that
that shows up there is scholarship
academic scholarship on the topic and it
shows up very clearly there so for
example one of the main scholarly books
dealing with the humanitarian
intervention in modern period by shaun
murphy finds three examples of
humanitarian intervention in the period
before the Second World War the first
was Mussolini's invasion of Ethiopia the
second was Hitler's takeover of the
Sioux Dayton land and the third was
Japan's conquest of Manchuria and North
China now of course he didn't mean that
these were real humanitarian
interventions but he meant that they
were the the standard kind they were
claimed to be humanitarian interventions
so Mussolini invaded ethiopia to uplift
and Christianize and civilize the
backward people of the country actually
the same phrases that President McKinley
used when he invaded the Philippines
earlier in the century uplift and
Christianized them yup lifted a couple
hundred thousand of them all the way to
heaven
and the Philippines have yet to recover
from the humanitarian gesture
Mussolini's invasion was horrendous and
atrocious Hitler invaded took over the
su Dayton land in order to for the
noblest of purposes to end ethnic
cleansing to allow the conglomerate of
people there to live in peace under the
framework of the superior technology and
culture of German civilization when the
Japanese invaded manchuria North China
their goal was to create an earthly
paradise and to protect the poor people
of the region from the Chinese bandits
who were trying to undermine this noble
project at least those of them who
survived the slaughter a huge monster
slaughter and that's pretty typical of
the early history of humanitarian
intervention is quite similar actually
one of the earliest modern cases and one
of particular interest to us should be
as happens to be right here in 1629 the
King of England gave a charter for the
bake Bay Area colony colony the Bay Area
and the goal of the goal of the
settlement was to save the natives here
from their fate bitter pagan fate the
goal was the principal end of this
plantation king said was too civilized
and Christianize them and if you look up
on the internet you can find the Great
Seal of the bay colony of Massachusetts
that's us it depicts an Indian with
holding two Spears that pointed down in
a sign of peace and there's a scroll
coming out of his mouth which says come
over and help us
so the colonists who came were just
responding to this plea from the
benighted natives to please come over
and help them well a strange thing
happened the it was actually discussed
the later years Supreme Court Justice
Joseph's story in the two centuries
later in the 1820s expressed as a
surprise at what happened he said that
the wisdom of Providence which is
inscrutable to mere mortals caused the
natives to disappear like the withered
leaves of autumn even though the
colonists had constantly respected them
it's just one of those mysteries we
can't understand the Lord's wisdom and
depth actually the perpetrators new much
better so revolutionary war hero a
general henry knox he was first
secretary of war in the newly liberated
colonies he described what they were
doing what they're doing he said is the
utter extirpation of all the indians in
the most populous parts of the union by
means more destructive to the indian
natives than the conduct of the
conquerors of mexico and peru and he
warned that a future historian may mark
the causes of this destruction of the
human race in sable colors short hasn't
happened shortly after Joseph stories
musings on Providence another one of the
perpetrators the architects of the extra
patient John Quincy Adams lamented the
fate of what he called that hapless race
of Native Americans which we are
exterminating with such merciless and
perfidious cruelty among the heinous
sins of this nation for which I believe
God will one day bring it to judgment
earthly judgment awaits
these are not the staples of taught
history they're only the staples of
actual history on the contrary what we
constantly hear is ODEs to our unique
magnificence called American
exceptionalism also not unique to the
United States but very striking right
now the later history of humanitarian
intervention is not very different after
world war two there are actually a few a
few cases of military intervention that
had a very benign outcomes after their
two in the post-world war two period of
us in the 1970s in 1971 in the India
invaded east pakistan now bangladesh and
terminated a monstrous slaughter of
millions of people by the Pakistani army
at the end of the decade 1979 of vietnam
invaded cambodia and put it into paul
potts atrocities drove out the Khmer
Rouge just at the moment when they were
peeking but these two examples don't
enter the Canon of humanitarian
intervention because they had a problem
the problem is wrong agency it's only
humanitarian intervention when we do it
we are our clients and there was another
problem with these two cases the u.s.
bitterly opposed them and moved very
quickly to punish those who had carried
out the crime of ending the slaughters
and atrocities in the case of India that
was Kissinger Nixon at the time the
Kissinger particularly was outraged by
this it was threatening to undermine a
secret trip he was planning to Pakistan
he'd already set up all the photo ops
and so on it looked like this might
undermine it we know from recent White
House tapes that were released that the
Kissinger was so furious
he was calling he was proposing the
Nixon that they used nuclear weapons to
stop it what he said is that if we don't
use nuclear weapons the Russians will
attack China and we'll be finished
that's the great diplomat Henry
Kissinger the Nixon was a little more
restrained he thought that mass famine
in India would be enough of a punishment
for this crime and Kissinger went on to
mock those who as he put it who bleed
for the slaughter had been galleys the
millions of them who cares about them
well fortunately Nixon prevailed there
was no Armageddon although the United
States did send an aircraft carrier into
the sea of Bengal to warn the Indians of
the punishment that they deserve for the
crime of one of the two crimes of
intervention that actually had the major
benign consequences the other was 1979
Vietnam was bitterly condemned for the
crime of ending Paul Potts atrocities
New York Times denounced them as the
Prussians of Asia the United States
imposed harsh sanctions sorry not Loudon
the United States imposed harsh
sanctions and in fact supported a an
immediate Chinese invasion that the
punish the criminals who ended the Paul
Pott crimes and the United States
immediately turn to supporting the
Camaro erosion on the borders and their
attacks against Cambodia diplomatic and
military support so those two cases
can't qualify as humanitarian
intervention if you look on there after
the collapse of the Soviet Union the
concept of humanitarian intervention
became very popular and there was a good
reason for it prior to the collapse of
the Soviet Union every US intervention
it could be justified
defense against the Russians didn't
matter how ludicrous the pretense was
you could always claim defense against
the Russians so you didn't need any of
the pretext but with the Russians gone
some new pretext was gone was needed to
carry out the same policies which of
course was done so humanitarian
intervention was called upon the 1990s
were a very interesting period of
American history and in fact general
intellectual history there has never
been a period in mind not to my
knowledge of such a few civ praise for
the magnificence of any state on the
part of the most respected intellectuals
of respected figures of give you a
couple of examples from the highest most
respected people the United States was
an idealistic new world bent on ending
in humanity everywhere its foreign
policy entered a noble phase with a
saintly globe that's Clinton for the
first time in history a state has arisen
that is dedicated to principles and
values that's fossil Havel acting from
altruism alone and moral fervor hence
free to use force where its leaders
believe it to be just supported by the
enlightened states who are it's
respectful allies that's a small sample
of a deluge again from the most
respected and honored liberal voices
while all through the years the crimes
and atrocities mounted I have time to
run through them well there was a jewel
in the crown which the final triumph of
this noble phase and saintly glow that
was the bombing of Serbia in 1999 the
COSAFA intervention there was an
enormous chorus of self-congratulation
there was even there was an
international commission led by judge
Goldstone Goldstone commission of south
africa which did can of the
tinguished lawyers concluded that the
bombing was illegal but it was
legitimate not phrase illegal but
legitimate has haunted us since why was
it legitimate because it was undertaken
to stop an ongoing ongoing atrocities
there are a couple of problems with that
story which is uniform it's repeated
today constantly but one problem is the
chronology it happens to be the other
way around the bombing was the cause of
the atrocities it didn't it was not a
consequence of them the we have
extensive documentation of this one of
those richly documented cases in history
to huge State Department publications
the United Nations reports monitors on
the ground British parliamentary inquiry
and they all say the same thing it was a
 who was an unpleasant place until
the bombing but the bombing set off the
atrocities in fact if you look at the
indictment of militia vich for the
crimes in Kosovo you look closely you'll
notice that with a single exception they
all follow the bombing because that's
when the atrocities took place
furthermore it was anticipated the
general General Wesley Clark informed
Washington a couple of weeks earlier in
a discussion about what would happen
that if the United States NATO meaning
of the United States did bomb of course
the Serbs would react with atrocities on
the ground he also informed the press as
the bombing began that it was
predictable that there would be a sharp
increase in atrocities so these horror
stories you've seen are real but they're
the consequence of the intervention so
that's one problem that one is easily
handled just by suppressing the
historical record almost totally
suppressed richly documented almost
nothing about it there was another
problem that the traditional victims of
intervention vigorously objected there
was a major meeting shortly after of
South Summit that's basically the non
lined countries about eighty percent of
the world's population and they bitterly
condemned what they called the so-called
right of humanitarian intervention
referring to Kosovo which they describe
the simply old-fashioned imperialism in
a new guys well that one could also be
handled he wasn't reported a few
mentions of it were derided but it did
cause a slight problem the one problem
was that the notion humanitarian
intervention was somewhat tainted in
insignificant parts of the world mainly
eighty percent of the world but it was a
little hard to maintain so the
intellectual classes had the ride to the
rescue with some new notion and the new
notion is what's called responsibility
to protect r2p that was concocted right
after Serbia to try to deal with this
problem well that's I should say that
Kosovo is also regarded as a precedent
the recent debate over bombing not much
of a debate over bombing Syria did point
out that it would be illegal but
legitimate because international law has
changed and many commentators even the
president of France pointed out that
international laws of flexible notion it
changes as a result of actions that are
taken actions of state that set
precedents and the United States set a
precedent by bombing Kosovo actually
this is not quite accurate so for
example when Saddam Hussein invaded
quate that didn't set a precedent when
the Russians invaded Afghanistan of
course not present what is really meant
in this discussion is when the most
powerful and violent states carry out an
action those who are in a position to
control and shape the way history's
presented that sets of President
that's the reality of it nevertheless
there was a problem you needed something
to r2p responsibility to protect came
along constantly invoked its claim to be
legitimate because it was supported by
the United Nations which is about half
true there was a recent article you may
have seen in the New York Times by
Michael Ignatieff lauding humanitarian
of r2p and saying we have to invoke it
as a book about him by Derek which you
should look at recent book on this great
humanitarian ignitee f like others had
to ignore a slight problem here to there
are two versions of r2p one of them in
fact is was adopted by the united
nations 2005 UN General Assembly adopt
that our responsibility to protect
doctrine but that one has a condition it
says it has to be within the framework
of the United Nations Charter so you can
have intervention to protect people but
only on the condition that it is either
authorized by the Security Council or
that's it's an immediate response to an
ongoing armed attack otherwise as
illegitimate before fortunately there's
another version of r2p that's the one
that the West appeals to while appealing
to the UN for legitimacy the second one
is the concept developed by commission
led by Gareth Evans Prime Minister of
Australia who's a noted violent
interventionist himself but this one is
the operative version of r2p it's the
same as the UN version with one
exception it has a paragraph stating
that in the event that the Security
Council does not agree on the use of
force a regional organization
can carry out military intervention
within the area of their jurisdiction
subject to subsequent authorization by
the general sent by the United Nations
well there's only one regional
organization that can do this namely
NATO and it's area of jurisdiction is
the world so what the second what the
u.s. the Western version the operative
version the naughty aversion and others
what that says is that NATO can do
whatever like independent of
international law if Tex a Libyan olivia
is an African state that's within the
African Union that's the regional
organization they were not silent about
the bombing of Libya they were strongly
opposed to it you didn't read it here
but they were strongly opposed the
African Union gave a series of proposals
sensible proposals for diplomacy and
negotiations to try to achieve the end
of the civil strife without leading to a
humanitarian crisis as the bombing in
fact did they were disregarded they are
not the kind of regional organization
that is authorized to take a a position
in the Kate under the responsibility to
protect doctrine Libya's you know is now
a total ruin and read about it in the
paper this morning it's such a disaster
that they've even had to stop exporting
oil almost entirely well the fact is
that whatever term is used the accepted
canon of humanitarian intervention
1accepted here at Harvard by
distinguished intellectuals by Western
powers that's the one that authorizes
aggression and violence by the powerful
whatever name is given to it the real
hit that's official history the real
history is an annoyance which
is easily ignored if we of course allow
it to be ignored
