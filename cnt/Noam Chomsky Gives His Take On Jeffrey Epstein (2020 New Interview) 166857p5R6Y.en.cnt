one of the things that I did make sure
to want to make sure that I ask you
about a lot of these issues we've been
talking about in many ways seem to fall
back to a lack of accountability for
especially people in power and it really
does seem like when you get through a
certain level of wealth and power that
you're really just not going to face the
kind of consequences that ordinary
people would face and one of the cases
recently that has really underscored
that phenomenon in a dramatic way was
the case of Jeffrey Epstein and I only
asked you because he was vaguely
affiliated with MIT where you had taught
for many years and he had donated to the
Media Lab interacted with top scientists
and intellectuals and this is after his
first conviction which the MIT Media Lab
knew about conviction but also after his
serving instant there's a principle of
Western law that once a person has
served the sentence he's the same as
everybody else
hmm seems to be forgotten so there's
some other interesting questions Jeffrey
Epstein gave and a million dollars to
MIT is he the worst person who's
contributed to MIT in my office at MIT
when I was they're not there anymore I
looked out the window was my office then
I saw the David Koch Cancer Center David
Koch 10 it's surely a candidate
forgotten one of the most extraordinary
criminals in human history correctly
what he did he was personally
responsible for shifting the Republican
Party for being a moderately saying
minimally saying on global warming to
being the most dangerous organization
human history which may destroy us all
is that serious
pretty series does anybody say anything
about that let's take a look when
David's just a president produced water
Torrey intro me about how he's one of
the model MIT graduates he did such
wonderful things from MIT now he even
funded the basketball team which is
striking strange abilities well there's
certainly hypocrisy there I'm sorry good
I don't know if the Apocrypha is a great
word I mean think about what why this
obsession but not much more significant
well the the only reason why it was
intriguing to me was the fact that
Alexander Acosta the labor secretary and
the prosecutor who had given him what
people regarded as a lenient sentence
said that he was told he belonged to
intelligence by dafair enough but then
the criminal is requested sure nothing
not the person who is that is that
something worth exploring or I know you
have a deep well knowledge about the
intelligence services is that the idea
that they could be having some sort of
sting operation with some guy involved
is that just crazy talk or is that
something that could happen I mean I
haven't followed it closely to a lot of
strange things about the alleged Susan
just a couple of days ago a report came
out saying that the cameras were off and
the backup cameras were off
day after day some very strange things
come right and there's there's no real
way of answering that question well at
least right now with the information we
have
