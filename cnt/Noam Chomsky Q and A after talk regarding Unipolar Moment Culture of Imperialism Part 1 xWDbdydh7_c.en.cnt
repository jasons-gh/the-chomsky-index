well these comments barely scratched the
surface of the formation and
implementation of policy during the
unipolar moment but I think their
characteristic one significant element
is the continuity of planning and
interpret and interpretation since World
War two when the United States
shouldered the responsibility that was
eloquently described by Winston
Churchill the responsibility to protect
the interests of the satisfied nations
whose power places us above the rest the
rich men dwelling in peace within their
habitations to whom the government of
the world must be entrusted now under
Washington's guiding hand and that
remains the operative meaning of the
fashionable praise responsibility to
protect
good
every let me say that professor Chomsky
we have time to four people from the
audience to pose some questions for him
they are I see a couple of microphones
here and given the unsteady acoustics in
this room it would be a good idea for
anyone who wants to pose a question to
just come up to one of these two
microphones in the center aisle so I
invite anyone who wants to ask a
question to just come up and we will we
will hear you go ahead why do you think
that we the United States is in
Afghanistan what do you think the real
mission is go back to the original
invasion you heard a version of the
story from Obama a couple of nights ago
but there's also reality just attention
and it's pretty easy to check it's not
obscure I mean I can find it in the
front pages but a little work and you'll
dig it out it was supposedly a reaction
to 911 we had to defend ourselves from
terror well let's imagine that
protection of the population from terror
was a high priority of the governor is
almost unimaginable but suppose it were
true whether it was at some very
straightforward ways to proceed I'm sure
they're specialists in the State
Department could have informed them that
the the jihadi movement was highly
critical of Obama bin Laden they
bitterly condemned 911 and there were
fought was coming out from the
radical clerics and al-azhar university
and of the most important University
denouncing Obama bin Laden and so on so
there was a perfect opportunity to split
the jihadi movement isolate us on bin
Laden and roots significantly reduce the
threat of terror instead they chose
through the opposite to act in a way
which United the jihadi movement and
then invasion dating Iraq of course it
so even more as one of innumerable
examples that protecting the population
is not a high priority of this
government or governments in general so
that would have been one reaction now of
course there was a serious crime not as
serious as 911 1973 but still very
serious so what do you do when there's a
crime well you try to identify the
perpetrators capture them it's an
international issue you know use
international forces no problem in this
case and bring him to trial and have a
fair trial well they couldn't do that
didn't try to do that and there's a good
reason which was explained later on
eight months after nine eleven the head
of the FBI the robert miller had a
interviews with the washington post and
which he told them that we really don't
know who was responsible it says we
believe that the plot was hatched in
afghanistan but implemented in the
United Arab Emirates and Germany well if
they only could believe it in April they
didn't know it the preceding October
which is why they did not respond and
presumably that's the reason why they
didn't respond to the Taliban when they
who had made tentative offers to
extradite Osama bin Laden but wanted to
see some evidence yes what you do when
you asked for extradition and of course
this was contemptuously rejected so we
went ahead and bombed that's a major war
crime first of all is no there was no
international authors
vision of any kind totally violated
international law but it was a marvel
war crime in a deeper sense you have to
go back to that time at that time there
were fought an estimated five million
afghans right at the edge of starvation
and it was predicted the aid agencies
which all had to flee warned repeatedly
and loudly that if the US mom that would
put at risk another two and a half
million people well you know fortunately
the world worse didn't happen but that's
not the way you estimate the moral
character of an action you estimated on
the basis of likely consequences so they
were willing to take a risk of killing
another two and two and a half million
afghans in order to achieve their ends
well what were the ends not to end
terror plainly actually i think the ends
were pretty well described by some of
the leading anti-taliban afghans
including the u.s. favorite of the hawk
its leader killed they strongly abstruse
lee object to the bombing they said the
bombing is just killing innocent
civilians it's undermining our efforts
to overthrow the Taliban from within
which they thought very reasonably could
succeed and you're only doing it because
you want to show your muscle and
intimidate the world and of course
Afghanistan has unfortunately for
Afghans a strategic location right on
the periphery of the major oil-producing
regions in the Middle East and Central
Asia and of course South Asia that goes
way back in history and they've suffered
for it so I don't have documents yet
internal documents maybe we'll get them
someday but it looks as if those were
the reasons well why is it continuing
well we don't have documents from today
either incidentally you heard the other
night that the world supported us in the
bombing well you know it depends very
much on how you define the world so for
example if the world includes the people
of the world we know the answer I have
two little work to find the answer but
it's not really difficult on these
internet days and their books mine
others to talk about it but right after
the bombing was announced but before it
started there was an international
gallup poll all over the world which
asked people whether they were in favor
of bombing now the question was asked on
the assumption that it would be
selective it would go after the
perpetrators and those civilians would
be attacked which of course was never
happened and on that assumption there
was very little support only two
countries had even majority support the
one was India the other was Israel both
Indian Israel I don't think we're even
thinking about Afghanistan India was
thinking about Kashmir and Israel was
thinking about the Palestinian so yeah
you want to go bomb people great that's
a bomb Pakistan but in every even in
Europe the numbers were like in the
twenty twenty to thirty percent I'll but
most interesting were the Latin American
answers Latin America has a little bit
of experience with us intervention in
Latin America the figures range sport
range from two percent in Mexico that is
the half of Mexico that we didn't
conquer two percent support their went
up to i think eleven percent in colombia
and even in panama expect the US colony
it was like sixteen percent or something
well that was the popular support for
the bombing on the assumption that it
wouldn't
civilians of course it did it well but
the media clap cooperated by not
reporting an international Gallup poll
on an issue like that is kind of
important so therefore better suppressed
why are we staying as I said we don't
have internal documents but I suspect
it's partly the same reasons the
strategic locations on and so forth
there's probably another factor it's
what Dan Ellsberg called the movie call
it the stalemate machine I think when he
was writing about US policies in Vietnam
through the 60s he said kind of
accurately i think the document
supported that the idea was to just keep
it going so you don't lose the next
election if you wanted to win the word
i'm the one in my opinion it was
actually did win the war in vietnam but
that's another story but if he wanted to
reach the maximum goals you would have
had to move up the nuclear warfare or
something like that and to reach the
maximal goals here it's not even clear
how you would do that but you don't want
to you know be attacked as soft wimpish
not courageous like Theodore Roosevelt
and those good guys that we honor so so
probably that the stalemate machine is
probably a factor I mean the plans that
were announced the other day make
absolutely no sense on any grounds but
wearing them suffer from it except pain
the Afghans will suffer as usual and the
Pakistanis you make be in real trouble
if this continues I'm gonna get do you
want to sit up a little bit ok ok the
next next question what now
nubiles and resources inking deals part
of the pod Middle East unipolar version
of the official story are you turning
your are they the new Aryans are you
turning your attention to them these
days my attention to this but they're
they're pursuing now you can like you
can like them or hate them whatever you
like but on these issues they're
pursuing peaceful means like they're not
overthrowing governments you know they
don't have eight hundred military bases
around the world they don't out spend
the rest of the world combined and you
know military and intelligence
expenditures they're not pursuing the
militarization of space in fact they're
leading the way in global opposition to
it they're not occupying two countries
as we are so you know they're pursuing
their own interests trying to gain
control over resources many a lot of
it's very ugly select supporting the say
the Burmese military which they do by
getting oil from Burma as incidentally
does the United States under Chevron has
contracts there and even more so Britain
and France so yeah that's ugly but it's
a long way from military intervention in
fact you know did they do a lot of
rotten things inside but outside the
borders there nothing much a complaint
of it okay text on be very doctor I have
a broader question ever seen the
Caribbean for in situ sated room for
everyone at audience victor another kind
of musical opponents evening us had ever
going to be quick they're not your place
fine
more motivation do you think that our
unipolar Germany will eventually be
replaced by some multipolar system at
some point or is it well you know the
world is for the last several decades
economically at least on the economic
dimension the world's becoming
conservatively more diverse so you know
in 1950 after the war the United States
had literally half the world's will but
by nineteen seventy it was down to
twenty-five percent announced maybe
twenty percent and centers of economic
power have been developing like Europe
is roughly comparable to the United
States some respects Richard Northeast
Asia you know the Tigers and now China
India to an extent are becoming another
center of world power other than over
near the power of the United States so
like I chyno a historian who teaches in
a state college who asks her students
every year freshman what they think of
the richest countries in the world and
their answers are India and China okay
you read the newspapers you might think
those are the richest countries in the
world you look up the Human Development
Index they find that indie I think is
around one-hundred and thirtieth or
something and China's around maybe 90th
and it would probably be lower if it
wasn't so totalitarian and you could
actually find out what's going on inside
but but the other growing powers in a
symbiotic relationship with us they're
not in one dimension the world remains
completely unipolar the military
dimension I mean there's no other power
this even shouting distance or even
trying but and there are now articled
the BRIC countries Brazil Russia
India China ok that's a unit the world
is becoming more diverse and the most
striking case I think talked about much
as Latin America I mean Latin America
has been you know the backyard Nixon
when the next administration was getting
ready to overthrow a nd the National
Security Council pointed out that if we
can't control Latin America how are we
going to control the world this is take
for granted we got to control Latin
America well that's that's declining the
South America for the first time in five
hundred years is moving towards us some
kind of integration and towards facing
its horrific internal problems virtually
every Latin American countries kind of
like Honduras where we just prayed as
the democratic election there's a tiny
rich elite mostly white Europeanized
there just in a sea of misery and the
rich have no responsibility for the
country it's one of the main reasons why
Latin America doesn't develop any stage
it did but it's changing I mean this
their moves towards integration their
moves towards facing some of these
problems different ways in different
countries the u.s. is having a hard time
with it I mean in 1964 Kennedy could
just organize a military coup to
overthrow the social democratic
government and Brazil well you know cool
arts president's policies were not very
different from Lula today but now they
can't do that in fact Lula is sort of
the fair-haired boy because he's less
he's presented as being less extreme
than the bad guys it's mostly
presentation so for example like if you
know Chavez praises of modern age odd
ours when Lula praises of mudd nejat
even more
silence they couldn't keep it completely
silent when I'm on the judge visited
Iran a couple of weeks ago so they know
some tapping on the wrist but that
difference is a striking one and what it
reflects is the fact that the major
weapons for controlling Latin America
have very much declined in efficacy the
one is economic strangulation and that
kind of declines as the world becomes
more diverse and the other is just plain
military power so the US has been kicked
out of all of its basis in South America
the last one was a couple of months ago
in Ecuador but the u.s. is reacting as
you'd expect so the u.s. now has seven
new bases in Colombia and Obama has
quietly added two more to naval bases in
Panama the fourth fleet which was
disbanded in 1950 covers that region has
been a reconstructed training of Latin
American military officers as going way
up their mission is to combat radical
populism and everybody in Latin America
understands what that means I saw their
efforts to rebuild the weapons but it's
not as easy as before so yeah that's a
shift in world power and a significant
one there also south south relations
developing much a couple of days ago
there was a trade agreement with Brazil
India China and a couple other powers I
forget but a kind of like a South trade
agreement okay those are all new things
and they do diffuse world power so it
might lead to a more multipolar world
which I think it'd be very good thing
great against this a movement for change
how I mean we saw happen to want with
the king so what happened
Malcolm X and even Fred Hampton very
articulate you started to you know the
FBI when right in a half to get hat is
impossible to create a some kind of
movement or a political party should we
be supporting greens is there any hope
that the Democrats can be brought
further left do we need to create a new
left in the United States the highly
organized left like it did exist in the
1960s up until very recently way of what
mechanism can we do to translate your
brilliant ideas into action or your you
name the problems so well how can will
we leave here tonight what can we begin
to do the same way as over I mean I
think we know the answers it involves
organizing which is hard work you know
you have to keep at it doesn't happen in
one day you've got to be dedicated to it
if I'd say take the civil rights
movement which you mentioned yes Martin
Luther King was killed but you know he
would have been the first to say that he
was he did not create the civil rights
movement he was writing on a way of lots
of that action which goes way back I
mean we're kind of not allowed to say
this but a lot of it was the Communist
Party but you know quiet I'm say it but
there was you know this decades and
activism which and even in the sixties
the movement was led by people whose
names we don't even know like every
popular movement like the snake workers
who were writing freedom buses and
sitting in at lunch counters and that
created a substantial support which
gains the Kennedy administration tried
to block it but you know finally Johnson
kind of you know authorized it it had
support from the north crucially as long
it was as it was attacking racist
sheriffs in Alabama
if you take a look at the reactions in
the north at the same time it was quite
differently talk about that if you like
but it didn't create it followed the
Imperial ideology you know their crimes
not airs the but it was significant and
Martin Luther King was very important
person remember when he was assassinated
that he was assassinated when he was
organizing the poor people's movement it
was he was killed that a in support of a
sanitation workers strike okay that was
too much you know he stopped being a
hero when he wasn't just attacking
racist sheriffs in Alabama but was
talking about organizing people of
course opposing the war in Vietnam then
his reputation trying to decline the
Hmong important people like us you know
the people who write books and articles
but it was a real popular movement a
major one made many successes and there
was a lot more I mean this is a very
different country from what it was in
60s I mentioned just one thing you
couldn't write that diplomatic history
that I quoted for 1969 and nobody could
write that today even and anywhere in
the country okay that's a change in
consciousness but it's also a change in
it changed the behavior attitudes
understanding I mean probably the most
important movement that grew out of the
60s in terms of its effect on the
country was the women's movement well
didn't start in the 60s that germs were
there but it really picked up in the
seventies and later of the Solidarity
movements which are very important
that's the first time in the history of
imperialism there's no other country
that I know of who'd ever had anything
like the American solidarity movements
like people in France didn't go to live
in a Vietnamese village to or Algerian
village to help people and protect them
from the white predators but that
happened in the United States in the 80s
in a very substantial level that mostly
it's kind of Main Street you know is
coming from mid west southwest
evangelical movements and it's still
there you know
solidarity workers all over the place
very brave and okay the anti-nuclear
movement took off in the 1980s it's kind
of interesting to see the way elites
respond murdering them today's financial
times British papers this the new
European Union foreign minister Lady
Ashton was being grilled on her past and
one of the charges against her was that
she had to kind of apologize for this
was that she was a supporter of CND
committee on nuclear disarmament which
was a part of a mass popular movement
they'll reach that he percent in the
United States against nuclear weapons so
that's a charge against her in elite
circles but as a lot of public is there
so we're in a much better pick an easy
to go on but it were in a much better
position now than people were in the 60s
to carry all this forward you know we've
got their legacy to build on and the
methods are the old ones you know no
nobody's got a magic key I think it's
absurd the claim that we can't do it I'm
just take a look at some of the South
America South American countries like
the poorest country in South America
okay Bolivia I mean that's had
democratic elections of the kind we came
in dream of so like in 2005 the majority
of the population the most repressed
people in the hemisphere of the
indigenous population actually entered
the political arena elected someone for
their own ranks were present on real
issues which everybody knew you know not
hope and change but the real issues
control of resources you no justice no
cultural rights complex society and this
an election day was not a of any
particular importance it was just one
day in a constant ongoing struggle and
it's one of the reasons why the United
States is well the coverage of Bolivia
you know is so harsh and critical I mean
they had real democratic achievements
that's
well it's ridiculous to claim that we
can't do it living peasants can of
course we can it's not going to happen
by itself you know never has thank you
thank you next question here and
includes a 10 why am I recipe realist
when the difference in some way some
festival your imperialism or even the
way we were in a slogan Europe was
hoping you could articulate an argument
is that you how the US Washington who
called it an infant Empire nism I mean
conquest of the national territory is
imperialism they didn't doubt it in the
19th century there is what some
historians of imperialism call a
saltwater fallacy meaning you call it
imperialism only to cross a saltwater
just like if the Mississippi were like
the Irish sees a call in a fury ilysm
but that doesn't make sense if you ask
the victims of course it was imperialism
just as George Washington said yeah it's
different from other countries and
Germany was different from England and
so on and so forth and there are some
real innovations if you look at the
history I don't have time to talk about
it as a terrific book that just came out
which is very illuminating about this
it's by Alfred McCoy who's historian at
the Wisconsin is a Philippine specialist
they just came out with a very
interesting study which has a lot of
current implications on how the United
States it's the first real study on what
the United States did in the philippines
after conquering it i'm going to invaded
conquered it you know Christianized them
all the usual stuff killed a couple
hundred thousand people but then i had
to do something and that part hasn't yet
been studied that he went through kind
of archival records and what was done
was quite interesting the u.s. used the
highest available current technology it
was then telegraph radio
that sort of thing to create to
construct a surveillance society of a
kind that not never existed until the
present there was a total they tried to
establish total control over individuals
they also worked out techniques to break
up nationalist groups by infiltrating
and sewing rumors you know all sorts of
things of course they had to had to
co-opt and filipino a lead if it's
always easy they established they had
you have to have a mailed fist so there
was the Philistines philippine
constabulary you know if things got out
of control and that lasts until today I
mean the Philippines are still under
that system it's one of the reasons they
are the unique part of the region that
didn't undergo the you know the rise of
the Tigers furthermore it there was a
blowback of Woodrow Wilson imposed
something similar using similar
techniques during and after the First
World War and it's coming now so you
know surveillance societies there takes
a Britain is more advanced than the US
and disrespect but the most striking
example in fact is Israel in the
occupied territories it's exactly what
