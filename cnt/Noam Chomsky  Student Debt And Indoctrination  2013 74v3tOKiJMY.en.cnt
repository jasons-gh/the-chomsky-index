okay welcome all Nye students and
students around the world
my name is Eddie rods of Alaska Deputy
opinion editor at washington square news
on behalf of wsn Thank You professor
Chomsky for doing this interview I also
want to extend a special thanks to the
Liberal Studies Program for their
support and to my fellow student Alice
Sholto Douglas for her collaboration in
the project and technical assistance
today despite the impending blizzard and
a cold professor Chomsky has generously
obliged to readjust the schedule for
this interview for which we are
incredibly indescribable grateful before
I begin with the questions I just want
to note for the viewers that professor
Chomsky is the eighth most cited scholar
of all time joining the rings of Plato
Aristotle Shakespeare and Freud so onto
my first question and this is a topic
that specifically concerns me as a
student since the start of the Occupy
movement many protesters have put
matters concerning rising tuition costs
and student loans among the top of their
demands during her campaign Jill Stein
provocatively compared student debt to a
modern form of indenture and you have
expressed a similar view arguing that
student indebtedness is a technique of
indoctrination and control could you
please elaborate on that well the first
question that arises is whether there is
an economic necessity for student
I mean not to tell students what the
numbers are right it's over created
dollars it's beyond credit card did so
is that is there an economic
justification well there are number of
ways of testing that so for example we
happen to be right next door to a poor
country Mexico quite a good university
system it's not doesn't have all the
things we have support country but very
high quality I don't know
high level of instruction I've taught
there have been there it's free
the was an attempt by the government
some years ago
10-15 years ago to raise costs slightly
led to a national student strike the
country was practically closed down and
they backed off in fact last time I was
there about two years ago there was an
administration building that was still
occupied by students from the student
strike long before had been turned into
a community center that's Mexico were
country just in the West in our northern
border than Quebec where tuition is
higher the madness another is tuition
but it's not at our level there was an
attempt by the government a couple of
months ago to raise the tuition there
was a student strike in Quebec joined by
much of the population that it led not
only to backing off on that proposal but
actually changing the government a lot
of changes and protests against liberal
policies much more
there are rich countries that have a
very high level educational systems
among the highest are fit
Germany in both free I should go back in
American history they go back to the
1950s a much poorer country did than it
is now well but that tuition wasn't
exactly free that was pretty close to it
under the GI Bill a huge number of
people the width the school the
government expense meaning the
Commission essentially very low fees I
mean I was a student back in the 40s at
an Ivy League college tuition was about
$100 maybe equivalent of 800 today or
something oh these comparisons suggest
very strongly that there's no real
economic reason for a high student debt
so we have to ask what it's doing well
it is hard to fade much more general
process over the best generation
essentially 30 odd years there's been a
major assault on the population
basically the neoliberal Europe that's
one of the reasons why there's now a
slogan than 1% 99% we're back to levels
of inequality that among the highest in
the history before the first
imprisonment and the Great Depression
there's been economic growth during
these years but it's overwhelmingly
going into very few pockets that's by
now latest figures I saw there are 400
people in the United States who have as
much wealth more elephants a than the
lowest under navy minion wages have
pretty much grown very slowly more or
less speculative through most of the
population sometimes decline well
meanwhile there's been enormous wealth
going to a tiny percentage of
ladies I'm at the 1% 99% imagery is
amenity right that's more like 1/10 of
1% industry look at the way that graphs
actually work and that's led to lots of
consonants it's not a economic necessity
like it's not happening in comparable
countries that it's having there are a
lot of other effects so for example the
OECD the organization of the affluent
countries that develop all developed
countries they just did a study of
social justice in 31 of acd countries
the u.s. was 27th right above Mexico you
have to remember this is the richest
country in the world with enormous
advantages that no one else says there
are other studies of infant mortality
maternal health lots of measures and the
United States is way down at the bottom
of the rich countries Rome 20th 21st
which is just totally scandalous in fact
the health care is a remarkable case we
have about twice the per capita costs of
other rich countries and relatively poor
outcomes in addition to tens of millions
of people dying every year because they
don't have insurance the new program
will dig into that a little bit lower
near where it should for people who are
worried about the deficit which they
shouldn't be it's declining it's not
that serious
the deficit would be erased if we had a
health care system like comparable
countries and the reasons they're not
terribly obscured it's the only private
virtually privatized lightly regulated
system in the world so it's highly
inefficient with huge
of costs advertising profit for the
private companies huge salaries a lot at
least cherry-picking all kinds of things
the in fact there are a couple of parts
of the u.s. system which are
government-run that one is the VA system
that our demonstration so that's kind of
like European countries the same level
of costs and efficiency the Medicare
which is government-run it is a much
more efficient than the private system
the costs are going up and there's a lot
of talk about that burden on Medicare
but that's because it doesn't work
through the privatized insurance system
its own administrative costs and others
are quite low in comparison that's kind
of interesting to look at the proposals
that are now being discussed so one of
the proposals for dealing with the
deficit problem which again is not a
major problems the banks care about it
the population doesn't then they're
right but if you one of the proposals
it's being routed around is that though
the age for Medicare eligibility should
be increased that's quite an interesting
proposal for one thing it's got a class
basis professionals white-collar workers
and so on then they live longer then
truck drivers and construction workers
and people doing the hard manual labor
so as you move up the level of which
Medicare eligibility comes you're
essentially harming the poor working
people and benefiting the more wealthy
educated Specter but even more
interesting than that it's the fact that
raising the age is above from a more
efficient system to a less efficient
system so it's actually more costly but
the way cost is measured and that's just
ideological
economic necessity if costs are
transferred to individuals they're not
considered cost it's only if it's if
it's a business then it's a cost if it's
the government it's a cost because the
rich don't like to pay taxes and the
business of course must have profit so
if you can find a way to transfer cost
individuals that's called savings but
you came up here today on the train yeah
the train from New York to Boston
it takes about the same amount of time
that's when my wife and I flip it 60
years ago if you were in any European
country or almost any country we're
taking 1/3 the time probably and that's
a cost but it's a cost to you
not a cost damn tractor to the to the
government and it's the same if I had to
fly yesterday for some talks a lot in an
airplane in order to save money for the
private carriers but they don't
circulate air well the cost of that -
like what you're hearing look at the
costs of not circulating errors at
certain places eases so if somebody in
the plane I was cold
everything ends up the cold the flu or
something but that's of course that's
transferred to individuals and therefore
it doesn't count you don't count it and
when you may
your efficiency sniffily this is
happening at the universities to as the
universities get more corporate dice
that's been during this period of sharp
rise in tuition is not for economic
reasons I think there's also been an
enormous in pretty soon
ratio of administrators to the faculty
couple of studies of this pension
against Berg well-known sociologist does
a book on it called the fall of the
faculty discusses the sharp rising
number of administrators and the
tendency to have professional
administrators the universities used to
have administrators from the faculty it
took off for a couple of years and went
back but a lot of the dignitaries are
calmer professionals they're people come
from business schools you know they have
a business school mentality and you have
to keep the you have to look at the
bottom line way to save money you have
to get what's growth efficiency and they
use the corporate economic model of
efficiency so if the costs are less for
the institution it's more efficient for
example if you can reduce the proportion
of faculty to teaching by getting temps
you know low paying teachers like say
graduate students who live low salary
will have low salaries no benefits if
they could take over the work of highly
paid faculty that's efficient it's not
efficient for the students they're not
getting on the same level of education
surely that's not good for the graduate
students either but that that's called
efficiency well all of these things
there's a lot more like this and all of
this going on in parallel as part of the
whole deal liberal on slope which is
that's very harmful to the population
very beneficial to the to the masters
the super-rich that define like after
the costliest financial crisis that the
big banks the perpetrators of Richard
never figure never the corporate profits
or the reaching records of bonuses are
huge and so on none of the population
suffers but not them
this relates intimately some things that
occupy is doing mm-hmm so among the I
don't want to go on too long should
continue well among the occupy concern
I'm sorry the seemlessly going affect
one of the projects that's coming up is
called occupied the economy right deal
with the tremendous concentration of
wealth which carries along with it the
concentration of political power
that's almost reflexive cost of election
skyrockets if to depend on rich donors
corporate donors ends up kind of
controlling the political system which
is shredding you know you can see it's
very clear late go through some of the
details and going after that is a
critical point yes so what kind of
actions should we students for example
at NYU pursue obviously we need to
organize and create student groups
addressing these issues that you have
outlined but what other more specific
tactics would you suggest so that we can
go beyond merely communicating this
message about death as a form of
entrapment and indoctrination and move
to demanding substantive change of some
sort you could look at the model of
other countries for example the ones on
our borders the Mexico and Quebec
the protests in Mexico remember was a
protest against a small increase in
essentially free education but it swept
a large part of the country didn't
Quebec it drew in the large part of the
population it was tied to concerns of
many other people it's not just the
students or suffering crew this this
attacker in the population is much
broader that's why you have a situation
in which like what I described what you
all know the it's a kind of stagnation
or something like it for a large party
for the majority of the population while
there is growth especially from the core
of people it's much worse I've heard the
black population the wealth was almost
wiped out by the last recession and if
the if the student movement and in many
places yeah I supposed to do
historically the student movements have
been kind of in the forefront of
large-scale social change so for example
the the changes in this country there's
been a lot of progress in the country in
the last 40 years or so
a lot of it came from student initiative
I take the civil rights movement there's
been a civil rights movement efforts for
a long time but one major spur to it was
from 1960 when a small group of black
students said in a lunch counter kicked
out and arrested brutalized and others
came pretty soon you had Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee
you get freedom buses students from the
north
no I wasn't bald story but it was the
cutting edge of what became a mass
movement that achieved some goals not
all but some goals the women's movement
a lot of it came from young women
organizing consciousness-raising groups
pressing demands on it spread the
environmental movement has a lot of it
has come from student activism no longer
person but they have a word movement it
was very clear was mostly students and
this is true of many other cases in this
country and elsewhere so the students
can become kind of a galvanizing force
not just for their own personal concerns
of you know I want to be in debt for the
rest of my life but because it's part of
a general social problems it's part of a
general attack really is an attack on
the population and should be possible to
link up with other sectors that are
suffering under the same attack in
different ways like say people work for
the minimum wage at the minima there was
a time during the period of growth
significant growth in the country
fifties and sixties when the minimum
wage pretty much tracked productivity
that started to separate about you know
30 plus years ago if the minimum wage
had kept up with productivity but
probably two or three times as high as
it is now
well that means people working at the
minimum wage are paying the costs of the
wealth of the one tenth of one percent
and when you pull down the minimum wage
you pull down all wages these are all
broad issues that the student movement
can help galvanize move forward what do
you make of the increased
professionalization and specialization
among undergraduate departments
in universities by professionalization I
mean that the curriculums are under more
and more pressure to respond to the
demands of the market such as getting a
job etc in addition and in in tandem
with this in some respects it seems that
there's a great push to make some fields
seem as much as exact Sciences Sciences
as possible
for instance the humanities seem to be
under great attack because they do not
produce tangible outcomes and
assessments that can be fit onto a
balance sheet determined by market logic
that should happen to traditional
humanities disciplines from your
perspective given these pressures that's
whether we want to live in a civilized
world really I mean the wealth and
richness of life doesn't come from
having more gadgets in your hands it
comes from literature arts decent
society decent human relations many
other things that don't have you can't
put a number on marketization of life is
another form of destroying it hey this
was well understood by the working
classes in the early ages of the
Industrial Revolution in fact all
through their modern history either back
to the 19th century this is quite good
scholarly studies of it the British
working classes you know in Dickensian
England wasn't very pretty I had a very
high level of culture but they were
reading yeah
contemporary literature what we call
classics now and the studies compared
the proletarian culture with the
Philistine ISM
the aristocratic culture aside the
United State we go back to the early
industrial towns right around the year
in fact eastern Massachusetts the the
young women from the farms were coming
into the mills were bitterly condemned
the fact that their culture was being
destroyed
they were turned into tools of
production it's been an independent
women an Irish artisan and ups a
blacksmith and Boston to get a little
money would hire young boy to read while
he's working the Macan remember it went
on into the 1930s my you know as a kid
my family the most wonderful working
class mostly in New York and it's
something to love and I'd never really
had much formal school in a couple of
years maybe but they were going to
Shakespeare plays and they talking about
the Budapest string quartet discussing
the latest debates and psychoanalysis
before that goal in every possible
political movement other words
working-class education and which is an
Emily a lot of quick good scientists and
mathematicians participated that was
work written for workers education that
were workers education programs a lot of
it run by the unions and so on but most
a lot of that's been eaten out of
people's heads but could be restored now
and that's a decent Society if you go
back to the 19th century labor press
which is very interesting it bitterly
condemned industrial society as turning
people into taking away their freedom
their independence their integrity as
human beings in fact wage labor in the
mid 19th century was considered
basically the same as slavery the only
difference was it was temporary the fact
that was such a popular position that
was a program of the Republican Party in
the middle
18th century this program of the Knights
of Labor the huge never movement that
was formed in fact it was an interesting
slogan that was emphasized by a lot of
working people the slogan that described
what they called the new spirit of the
age that they're trying to ram down our
throats the new spirit of the ages
gained wealth for getting all but self
150 years of massive efforts to try to
indoctrinate people into that belief but
it's so inhuman and silage that just
doesn't work because I've got the
periphery but that's a marketization of
every aspect of life as part of this
it's if you look at the colleges the
state colleges in the country a lot of
them are actually reducing in order to
preserve the profit profitability you
know look at the bottom line are
actually reducing expensive programs
with our jobs like they're reducing
engineering computer science and nursing
because they're expensive but they
happen to be the programs with jobs and
turning to cheaper programs and as you
say the humanities are the kind of
marginalized you can't put a number on
developing the creative writers or
individuals who can enjoy that can
appreciate them contribute to the arts
of general culture and that that's it
very harmful effect on the society
altogether this is like what kind of a
society do you want to live in I think
these are among the reasons why the u.s.
ranks so hope there's a general social
justice and in a recent public forum
with Angela Davis a veteran activist as
well you reiterated one of Martin Luther
King's juniors most famous statement
is that the arc of history is long but
it bends towards justice and of course
it takes a lot of people to bend their
arctan as well but my question is what
role do universities serve in a just or
democratic society universities ought to
be the place where as many people as
possible like saying the GI Bill have
the opportunity to develop their
creative capacities their independence
their Joe f discovery they're our
ability to work with each other to
achieve socially desirable social ends
that they can figure out a student's our
University they're really the freest
time of their lives they're out of
parental control they don't yet have to
devote themselves to putting bread on
the table but a lot of freedom and
opportunity and that's the point of the
university actually going back to Mexico
for country a couple of years ago there
was a leftist mayor in Mexico City he
actually opened the university in Mexico
City which is not free that has open
admissions with support for students who
aren't quite up to the academic
standards and it's pretty impressive
that was there visited what students
talked to faculty
that's just what he university ought to
be used to be able to be open to active
in our be open to the community drawing
people in just like corporate education
programs did but these opportunities
ought to be available to everyone
they're at the forefront of creating the
opportunities for a decent society in
which the same person won't want to live
and I'd like to shift to a different
topic in in light of Barack Obama's
second inauguration what is your opinion
about the role of the left in the United
States it seems to me that there is an
effort among the Democrats specifically
to depict the president as a victim of
capitalist machine ations is this effort
and mistake
should the left in the United States
Barack Obama more accountable
accountable to what there's no
indication that he has any intention or
ever had any intention or interest and
the bringing about progressive changes
is basically a moderate Republican
mm-hmm in fact you know it's it's
commonly said now that the moderate
Republicans have disappeared the party
is a party in fact it's what did
Governor Bobby Jindal called them couple
weeks ago he said we're becoming the
stupid party thank you off the spectrum
would but what happened to the moderate
Republicans there are no mainstream
Democrats the Democrats fits pretty well
within that Specter but he came into
office and says me with a huge popular
support and the country was going into
an economic tailspin at noon on so the
first thing yet it was like an economic
to deal with the problems well take a
look at who we picked he picked people
who had created the problems we were
called the rubin voice know the ones who
were at the forefront of deregulation of
you know building the big banks of
providing the government insurance
policy which in
just risk remember too-big-to-fail
policy and so on these are the people
who were picked there are other highly
competent economists including them
Nobel laureates the people like say
Stiglitz or many others that they
weren't they were never invited in fact
the business risks Bloomberg News
Business Journal actually reviewed the
appointments when they were made an
interesting article about that went
through each person who was appointed
and ended up concluding that half of
these people shouldn't be on an economic
team they should be getting subpoenas
they're the ones who are the
perpetrators of the crisis that were now
in that gave it away pretty quickly when
he came in Obama with huge labor support
and the labor movement had a few serious
requests with right was one of them was
you know carjack the ability to form has
been a big huge attack on unions and
they wanted to go back to a rational way
of organizing which most workers want
exactly Obama promised to forgot about
it right away
same on health care because a majority
of the population favored some kind of
rational national health care system it
was one residue of that left in Obama's
program public option which he gave away
with about two-thirds of the population
supporting the United States is I guess
the only country where there's
legislation that bans the government
from
creating drug prices so drug prices are
way higher than else remember the way I
found out in one poll on that which
found that about 85% of the population
was opposed no effort to deal with I
mean the you know claim was well I can't
get it through Congress and so on but
the prison has a lot of power in the
field with the population be a leader
there have been president did do that
but you have to want to do it mm-hmm or
the pressure to do it by large skill
popular movements and you you often
associate that justice with democracy or
democracy with justice working in
conjunction together however some may
argue that the concept of justice and
the concept of democracy are the
antithesis of each other in other words
the protections of personal liberties
and majority rule are not compatible NYU
professor of politics Pascal de pastino
argues that by using the word democracy
to encompass a broad range of things the
word loses any real value and this can
have a detrimental effect when we want
to make substantive change happen how do
we resolve this paradox I think we
resolve at what Aristotle didn't go back
to the first major book um political
theory Aristotle's politics he dealt
with he was dealing with Athens estate
and he was talking about freemen you
know I'm not people so not slaves not
women but he discussed various kinds of
systems decided that democracy was maybe
the least bad so that's what we should
prefer nobody find out there's a real
problem with democracy the problem is
that if the voters if everyone's free to
vote the ones were enfranchised the poor
will use their voting power to
redistribute the property the rich in
other words to achieve justice and of
course we don't want that he had a
solution but first I should notice that
Madison raised the same problem in the
Constitutional Convention he was talking
about
Eggland's model they're thinking of and
in the Constitution convention need
discussed the fact that in England if
everyone had the vote again excluding
the people were not love the book like
women but everyone had to put them
clearly the poor would use their voting
power to carry out what we call
management these are mostly agricultural
societies and that's untrue so Aristotle
in Madison faced the same problem as the
professor here mentioned conflict
between democracy and justice and had
opposite solutions mm-hmm Aristotle
solution was to reduce inequality hmm
and he proposed what amount to welfare
state measures now on a sea scale are
still common little meals you know
things like that that would reduce the
level of inequality and then he wouldn't
have the puter of the masses of poor
that take away the property of the rich
but Madison's solution was the opposite
we should reduce democracy hmm that's
the way our system is constructed you
look back at the Madisonian system the
constitutional system power was to be in
in the Senate the Senate of course was
not elected remember powers in the
Senate which is Madison explained
constitutes the wealth of the nation the
more responsible set of men those who
sympathize with property owners and
their right the executive was mostly an
executive not some parts in the hands of
the wealthy there is a house of
representatives and that's more
democratic that was them isn't know that
for all sorts of reasons but and that
had much less authority and power
because was a democratic so we and there
were their devices defection alone is
the population and so on well the
population didn't really accept that it
was a radical population we've not in
this long struggles through American
history to try to the achieve the
justice within the democratic system and
it's a bitter glass war that puts on all
the time we're now in a period less
roughly generation where the class horse
turned sharply in favor of extreme
wealth so you not only have the
distribution of wealth that I described
but it also has an immediate
consequences for democracy
and they're not good work in the
political science and professional
political science studying attitudes and
policy and the correlation between them
we have a lot of information about
public opinion
snes's bowling you know quite good polls
and the basic result that comes out of
the kind of gold standard work
Larry cartels and others is that about
70% of the population is essentially
disenfranchised the lower 70% of wealth
and income but their attitudes have no
influence on policy mm-hmm and as you go
up the income level you get slowly more
influence when you get to the very top
essentially get what they want well it's
a kind of democracy
everyone's a lot of the pusher its this
is nothing like a functional democracy
and that's probably one of the main
reasons why a lot of the population just
doesn't bother voting mmm and it tends
to be the Porter port nobody's really
investigated it but probably it's just
an intuitive understanding it doesn't
make any difference why should I bother
and when you get to the House of
Representatives it's quite interesting
but that began in the constitutional
system as a word democratic part of the
government now it's the opposite some of
the last election 2012 the Democrats got
a considerable majority but a small a
small minority of the seats for all
kinds of reasons including legislative
gerrymandering
the role of money in the pot and
politics this very good study but Thomas
Ferguson to the main and political
scientists who studied the role of money
in elections and he's found that in the
last congressional elections there's
almost a perfect correlation between the
percentage of the funding that candidate
receives and the probability of the
candidates being elected second state
Republicans and you look at the
proportion of funding they received as
it goes up were elected almost a
straight line
the presidential election you know it
was over two billion dollars this time
now there's a lot of talk about how
money didn't work because you know
Sheldon Abelson spent a hundred million
dollars and didn't get what he want
that's not true everyone got the funded
got what they want the candidates who
were in office thanks to the huge
funding or beholdin to the funders they
they're the ones who what their
positions effectively and if they want
to stay in office they're gonna have to
go back to them so that means have to do
what they want wasn't a big surprise
that Obama when he came in 2008 a huge
support for the financial institutions
they'll turn to shining their shoes
doing what they thank you so let's have
to either democratic nor just and the
point you made about border apathy I
think who are apathy the point you made
about that I think it resonates a lot
especially with students in universities
such as I'm what you there's not only
voter apathy at NYU to vote in general
elections I think there's just apathy
about what students can do within their
schools to demand some kind of change
for example NYU is considering its next
huge massive expansion plan it's called
2031 and of course tuition is going to
keep on rising but virtually students
are completely not involved in the
decision making process faculty as well
are not are not involved very much so
the administration is making moves and
it is expanding and the student sort of
feel well there's nothing I can do about
it I don't have a voice therefore
there's nothing I can do
drilled into our heads from childhood
did nothing we can do but it's all too
big I think that's one of the reasons
for the crazy gun culture in the country
a lot of people feel
look I got to defend myself from right
from the government from power or
something so get it done
mm-hmm it's not my government like I
can't organize with other people and
vote right actually an interesting
reflection of this is the attitude
towards taxes let me think of a kind of
a thought experiment and imagine a
functioning democracy mm-hmm
what would people feel about taxes well
April 15th would be this celebration
we're getting together to fund the
projects that we decided on what's
better than that but here it's a it's a
damn morning mm-hmm because some alien
entity you know think thing out there is
hovering over us and it's going to steal
our money from us that's an indication
of how low the conception of democracy
hmm it's substantially because it
doesn't bring about justice if you want
people to feel the functioning of
democracy it's gonna have to lead to
test out all right yes and professor
Chomsky
thank you very much thinker you have a
very tight schedule I will call thank
you for making this election
