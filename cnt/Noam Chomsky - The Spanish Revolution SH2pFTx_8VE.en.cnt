when peasants and workers took control
of production consumption and social
life across much of the country
world leaders united in opposition
against them their system of
self-government threatened not only the
fascists and Stalinists but liberal
democracies in America and the rest of
the world
the rebels called themselves anarchist
in the media and general commentary the
term anarchy is used to indicate chaos
bomb-throwing disruption criminality the
actual meaning of the term is quite
different it involves mutual aid
cooperation as close as you get to pure
democracy real popular control over all
institutions sometimes a resistance
usually in leaderless resistance that's
partly ignorant and partly a way to
undermine efforts to try to achieve
cooperative society with popular control
which of course is obviously very much
posed by elite interests en este caso

okay is last seen that door that people
how do the liberal democracies respond
them exactly as you'd expect them to
they despised arson for very good
reasons
the masters do not want the ignorant and
meddlesome outsiders to run their own
affairs because they'll do it at their
own interest and you lose hierarchy and
domination and centralized control all
the values that the Masters naturally
want so the liberal democracies
essentially joined forces with the
fascists and the Communists to destroy
the revolution after they destroyed the
anarchist social revolution then they
started fighting among themselves but
the first task for the first year was to
make sure that the popular revolution
was crushed
and of course the comic the Communists
were in fact in the lead
and the fascist of course had their own
interests the United States was a little
bit marginal at that time it wasn't the
major world power was muscling late in
France but Roosevelt also played a role
so there was an embargo passed which
prevented arms from going to the
Republic
however Roosevelt tolerated breaking of
the embargo illegally to provide oil to
the fascist the State Department
pretended it didn't no of course they
didn't I remember this is a child
left-wing press was reporting it the
government said they never heard about
it of course the media went along with
the government years later the documents
came out they conceded and happening all
along so yes Rosa was basically
supporting the fascist but primarily
destroying the the anarchist revolution
which was a real threat
