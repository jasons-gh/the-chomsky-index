what do you think religion is depending
what you mean by religion I mean if you
believe if you mean the Abrahamic
religions we're a week round here
because of course I'm religiously
illiterate but Judaism Christianity no I
mean I guess yeah and and the other such
religions of what are those Buddhism is
different spiritual beliefs among Native
Americans was different I mean there's
no kind of religion distinction that
we're talking about there we're talking
about the Abrahamic energy that's the
Kundu I guess no no Hindus are different
that's quite different that Buddhism is
quite different I mean if you really
look at these systems of belief they
differ a lot in fact belief that there's
something in the world which is beyond
my grasp which is determining the way
things happen and it's going to you know
it'll be a consolation for me maybe you
know if my child is dying I'll see him
again in heaven somewhere I mean these
kinds of beliefs and that there's a sort
of a spiritual force somewhere beyond my
grasp and that explains why things are
happening that's probably a big Buddhist
that's perfectly understandable yeah I
mean you know the weird things are
happening like the Sun is moving around
the earth you can see it I'm gonna have
that happening but you see it well
something must be making it happen okay
so it's Apollo on his chariot pulling
the Sun and the same with everything
else goes on you don't understand
anything that's happening in the world
in personal life and you know why are
why is my child
sweet little wonderful kid dying he
didn't do anything so there's got to be
some explanation somewhere so it's a
stead of stories to make sense of
reality except not science I mean Apollo
pulling the Sun with a cherry it's early
science it's a kind of a scientific
theory and I was going to worked out you
know was not not trivial like you know
for example the classical Greek so did
discover a lot of things but if you say
it now when there's lots of evidence
other than that then it's no longer
science you know it just means that our
understanding is deepened right but you
know the transition from magic to
science is a pretty smooth transition
and it just I mean even the word the
word science in English didn't even
appear until the mid 19th 19th century I
mean there was a word that meant
something else just meant knowledge in
the 19th mid 19th century there was a
divorce between science and philosophy
before it was just philosophy in fact if
you study if you go to Oxford let's say
you can study natural philosophy and
moral philosophy natural philosophy is
what we here call the natural sciences
moral philosophy is what we call the
humanities but through that in German
you know it's the same thing so the
whole concept of science in our sense is
a pretty recent one and it's it began
and that there was a an intellectual
revolution you know so it begins with
Galileo and goes on and led to enormous
insights and after a while science just
took off and became a special domain
we've been in the early 19th century it
was that takes I can't
he couldn't have told you where there
was a philosopher or scientist he taught
astronomy I mean he thought the moral
philosophy yeah an intelligent educated
gentleman did all those things well by
the mid 19th century becoming very hard
to do all those things the sciences were
reaching a point where you really
understand things and you couldn't be a
gentleman who knows everything so okay
things got professionalized and we get
you know what we call science separate
domain but recall how recent this is a
prior to that people were trying to
figure things out and we we might now
call what they're trying to figure out
the magic but these are pretty smart
people if they say Isaac Newton you're
not a fool exactly I mean he's now kind
of people laugh about the fact that he
would spend most of his life working on
chemistry in church
that was alchemy and church fathers
I was probably reasonable I mean in
terms of the corpuscular Aryan theories
that everybody accepted the world is
made up a little building blocks like
bricks as if nephew
yeah shift a few and you get gold from
lead it makes perfect sense that's where
the church fathers that made perfect
sense to I mean he was coming right
after the humanist period when there
would have been a sudden discovery of
the wealth and richness of classical
civilizations which hadn't been known so
the belief expanded that these guys
really understood something and they
were kind of keeping it secret for us so
they were doing it in esoteric way and
if we in decode what they were doing
we'll get all kind of wonderful
discoveries so it wasn't an irrational
pursuit
