the current moment not just political is
the most grim moment in human history we
are now in a situation where this
generation in fact in the next few years
is going to have to make a decision of
cosmic significance which is never
arisen before will organized human
society survive and there are two
enormous threats it's a threat of
environmental catastrophe which at least
is getting some attention not enough of
the other is the threat of nuclear war
which is increasing sharply by the Trump
administration in fact these have to be
dealt with quickly otherwise there's
nothing to talk about and notice that
the wrecking ball in the White House
just doesn't give a damn he's having fun
he's serving his rich constituency so
what the hell let's destroy the world
and it's not that they don't know it
some months ago maybe a year ago by now
the one of the Trump bureaucracies is
the National Transportation
administration came out with what I
think is the most astonishing document
in the entire history of the human
species got almost no attention it was a
long 500 page environmental assessment
in which they tried to determine what
the environment would be like it's at
the end of the century and they
concluded by the end of the century
temperatures will have risen seven
degrees Fahrenheit you approximately
that's about twice the level that
scientists regard is feasible for
organized human life
the World Bank describes it as
cataclysmic so what's their conclusion
conclusion is we should have no more
constraints on automotive emissions and
the reasoning is very solid we're going
off the cliff anyway so why not have fun
has anything like that ever appeared in
human history there's nothing like it
