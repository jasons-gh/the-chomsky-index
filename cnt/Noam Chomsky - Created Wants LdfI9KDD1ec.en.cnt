the goal for corporations is to maximize
profit and market share and they also
have a goal for their target namely the
population they have to be turned into
completely mindless consumers of goods
that they do not want you have to
develop were called created ones so you
have to create once you have to impose
on people what's called a philosophy of
futility I have to focus them on the
insignificant things of life like
fashionable consumption I'm just
basically quoting business literature
and it makes perfect sense the ideal is
to have individuals who are totally
dissociated from one another whose
conception of themselves that the sense
of value is just how many created wants
can i satisfy with huge industries
public relations industries monsters
industry advertising and so on is which
are designed from infancy to try to mold
people into this desired pattern
