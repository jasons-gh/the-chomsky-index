and it's nothing on the case I totally
take that one but I met the guy who the
China guy who is equivalent of our press
guy Alastair Campbell it used to be and
they used to publish this report about
how dreadful America was over people who
died were killed the rapes the race
killings and whenever you raised human
rights with them they'd say with respect
kind of what you said you know America
look at all the violence look at Rodney
King is it sort of all was an
appropriate response because it seems to
me all that happens is you just say Oh
what Russia does is bad with China does
bad but my goodness look at America does
I mean it seems to be kind of Dodge of
the criticism is that I don't see why
it's dodge we accept that we accept that
principle uniformly with regard to enemy
States so for example if Serena body
criticizes Iran but doesn't criticize
Israel or if I Weiwei criticizes China
if it doesn't denounce the United States
or suffer of Havel anyone we admire them
for that that's what they should be
doing they should be concentrating on
the crimes of their own countries and
for us that's even more significant for
the reason I mentioned we can influence
these policies I weiwei can't do much
about the policies of China we admire
him for condemning them we don't want
him nobody wants him to write about you
know the US and British crimes wasted
his time he should he should be doing
exactly what he's doing and we have a
far greater responsibility to do it
because we are responsible for these
policies in a way which dissidents and
harsh states are not and we can
influence them but it's pretty striking
that we recognize this principle
reflexively with regard to enemy States
and we can't see it with regard to
ourselves where it's much more
significant yeah
