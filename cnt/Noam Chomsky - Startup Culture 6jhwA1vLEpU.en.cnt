can you offer a critique of startup
culture and entrepreneurship which which
offers many of the character if the
seeming characteristics of autonomy but
isn't so seeming characteristics I mean
startup culture is you know it's ok
people like their apps and so on but
it's based very heavily on state subsidy
it's not it's kind of a narrow form of
entrepreneurship now so take for example
the Silicon Valley culture where what
are they using whether using computers
or the Internet
mic electronics and so on and so forth
almost all developed in the state sector
for decades before it's handed over to
private power to for commercialization
and application so yeah there is
initiative there people are having fun
and doing maybe interesting things but
relying very heavily on the background
state subsidy which takes many forms
actually everyone at MIT ought to know
it it's paid our salaries for years you
know that's you know for decades
computers in the internet and the whole
base of the IT culture were being
developed right here similar places and
orally and so on and finally after
decades it was handed over to Bill Gates
and Steve Jobs to mark it and
commercialize and make profit and make
little things that you carry around with
you but so it's it's kind of a it has
entrepreneurial aspects but it's a
parasitic but it's parasitic on much
more fundamental development the really
hard work the hard research and
development the creative work is is
quite substantially in the state sector
and so it's not just subsidy there are
many other devices
a taxpayer support for the private
enterprise one of the main ones is
procurement so for example in the early
60s at IBM through the 50s had learned
mostly in government laboratories and
places like this had learned to switch
from punch cards to digital computers
and they built the world's biggest
computer in the early 60s
stretch computer fastest computer but it
was much too expensive for business so
the government bought it that's the
purchaser of last resort and I think it
went to Los Alamos and that goes on all
the time procurements a major form of
public subsidy to private enterprise and
there are many other ways that's one of
the reasons why private capital does not
want markets they want markets for other
people but not for themselves for
themselves they want a a nanny state
powerful nanny state that will support
them what the significance of the
entrepreneurial culture is you can judge
I'm not overwhelmed by the fact that
there's thousands of new apps coming
every day I think they're more important
