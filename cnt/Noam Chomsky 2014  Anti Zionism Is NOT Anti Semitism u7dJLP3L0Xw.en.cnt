how would you respond to the charge that
anti-zionism is the new anti-semitism
actually the locusts classic us the best
formulation of this was by an ambassador
to the United Nations Abba Eban
Israel's ambassador to the United
Nations in an article that he wrote
about forty five years ago which I urge
you to read which appeared in an
American Jewish Journal Congress weekly
a major journal of the more liberal wing
of the American Jewish community he
wrote an interesting article in which he
was then UN ambassador from the State of
Israel he advised the American Jewish
community that they had two tasks to
perform one task was to show that
criticism of the policy what he called
anti-zionism that means actually
criticisms of the policy of the State of
Israel where anti-semitism that's the
first task second task if the criticism
was made by Jews their task was to show
that it's neurotic self-hatred needs
psychiatric treatment and he gave two
examples of the latter latter category
one was I have stone the other was me so
we have to be treated for our
psychiatric disorders and non-jews have
to be condemned for anti-semitism if
they're critical of the State of Israel
it's understandable why Israeli
propaganda would take this position I
don't particularly blame all the heaven
for doing what ambassadors are sometimes
supposed to do but we ought to
understand it there is no sensible
charge no sensible charge there's
nothing to respond to it's not a form of
anti-semitism
that's simply criticism of the criminal
actions of the state very well as we
