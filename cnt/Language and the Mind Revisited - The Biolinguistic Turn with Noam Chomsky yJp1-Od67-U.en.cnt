(soft music)
- Almost exactly 35 years ago,
I had the opportunity to give several lectures here,
same auditorium I think
on the topic language and mind.
And quite a lot has been learned in the intervening years
about language and the brain,
hence the mind in the sense in which I used the term then,
the term mind, and mental and such terms.
And those lectures,
(audience member speaking off mic)
Pardon.
Aw, thank you.
(all laughing)
And we'll continue to use them now,
always nice to have a friend in the audience.
(audience laughing)
I'm using these terms as just descriptive terms
for certain aspects of the world,
pretty much on a par with such descriptive terms
as a chemical or optical electrical, and so on.
These are terms used to focus attention
on particular aspects of the world
that seem to have a rather integrated character,
and to be worth considering for a special investigation
but without any illusions
that they cut nature at the joints.
In those earlier lectures,
I took for granted that human language
can reasonably be studied as part of the world,
specifically is a property of the human organism
mostly the brain and for convenience, I'll keep to that.
Both then and now, I'm adopting what Lyle Jenkins
in a recent book calls the biolinguistic perspective,
that's the framework within which
the approach to language that I'm considering developed
about 50 years ago.
Also for convenience, I'll use the term language
to refer to human language,
that's a specific biological system
there is no meaningful question
as to whether the communication system of bees
or what might be taught the Apes,
or mathematics or music,
there's no question as to whether these are languages
or whether airplanes really fly
or submarines really swim,
or whether computers think or translate languages,
or other comparably meaningless questions
many of them based on a misinterpretation
of a important paper by Alan Turing
little over 50 years ago in 1950,
which has spawned a large and to my mind
mostly misguided literature,
explicitly, despite Turing's very explicit warning
not to pursue that direction
which has apparently been overlooked.
From the bio linguistic perspective,
language is a component of human biology
more or less on a par with mammalian vision
or insect navigation, and other systems
for which the best theories that have been devised,
attribute, computational capacities of some kind,
what's in informal usage sometimes called rule-following.
So for example, contemporary texts on vision
describes the so called rigidity principle,
it's formulated about 50 years ago as follows.
That says if possible, and other rules permit,
interpret image motions as projections
of rigid motion in three dimensions.
In this case later work provided substantial insight
into the mental computations,
that seemed to be involved and when the visual system
follows these rules in informal terminology.
But even for very simple organisms
that's no slight test.
A great many issues remain unresolved in these areas
which are quite obscure even for insects.
The decision to study languages part of the world,
in this sense should be in my view uncontroversial
but it has not been, on the contrary,
the assumption that this is a legitimate enterprise
was rejected pretty forcefully 50 years ago
and continues to be rejected.
Virtually all of contemporary philosophy
of language and mind is based
on rejection of the assumption.
The same is true of what's called
the computer model of mind
that underlies a good deal of theoretical cognitive science
denied in this case not only for language
but for mental faculties generally.
It's explicitly denied,
and the technical linguistic literature
and what are called plate mystic, accounts of language
and also in a different way denied by the conceptualism
that was devised by the same authors
inaccurately attributed to many linguists including me.
It's also apparently denied by many sociolinguists,
it's incompatible with structural,
behavioral approaches to language.
It's a little to my surprise rejected
by current studies of language by leading neuroscientists
most notably Terrence Deacon and recent work
which has been favorably received
by eminent biologists, again little to my surprise.
The approach therefore seems to be controversial,
but I think the appearances are misleading.
A more careful look will show
I think that the basic assumptions are tacitly adopted
even by those who strenuously reject them,
and indeed have to be adopted even for coherence.
I'm gonna put aside this interesting topic
of contemporary intellectual history,
and I'll simply assume that language
can be studied as part of the world,
continue in other words to pursue
the biolinguistic approach that took shape
about half a century ago,
heavily influenced by ethology, comparative psychology
and intensively pursued then along
quite a few different paths, including much of the work
that claims to reject the approach.
Well, assuming that turn to some things
that ought to be obvious.
It can scarcely be denied that some internal state
is responsible for the fact, that I speak
and understand some variety
of what's loosely called English,
but not say Hindi or Swahili at the borrow
and in fact adapt a traditional term,
we can call this the state whatever it is,
it's internal to me,
a state of the human faculty of language
primarily a state of the brain.
We can call each such state an internalized language
in the technical literature
often called an I language for simplicity I'll call it that.
It should also be uncontroversial,
that the Faculty of language has an initial state
part of our biological endowment
which permits a certain range of options,
the attainable I languages.
The Faculty of language then is a special property
that enables my granddaughter, but not her pet kitten
or chimpanzee to attain a specific I language
on exposure to appropriate data,
data which her mind in some obscure way
is able to extract from the booming,
buzzing, confusion and to interpret
as linguistic experience,
that's no slight task nobody knows how it's done
but it obviously is.
More accurately every infant acquires
a complex of such states, that's a complication
that I'll put aside.
The expectation that language
is like everything else in the organic world,
and therefore is based on
a genetically determined initial state,
that it distinguishes say my granddaughter from her pets
that assumption has been called the innateness hypothesis.
And there's a substantial literature
debating the validity of the innateness hypothesis.
The literature has a curious character
there are lots of condemnations of the hypothesis,
but it's never formulated and nobody defends.
It's alleged advocates of, of whom I'm one,
I have no idea what the hypothesis is.
Everyone has some innateness hypothesis concerning language
at least, everyone who's interested
in the difference between an infant and say her pets.
Furthermore, the invented term
innateness hypothesis is completely meaningless,
there is no specific innateness hypothesis
rather there are various hypotheses,
about what might be the initial genetically determined state
these hypotheses are of course constantly changing
as more is learned, that all should be obvious.
Confusion about these matters
has reached such extreme levels,
that it's becoming hard even to unravel
but I'll put all that aside.
The bio linguistic approach takes mental faculties
to be states of the organism.
In particular, internal languages, I languages
that are states of the Faculty of language.
I'll focus on language, but most of what follows
that should hold as well for other cognitive faculties
and in fact for far simpler organisms,
say a bee communication or navigation for example.
Well, when we adopt this approach,
several questions arise at once.
The central one is to determine
the nature of the initial and attained States.
And though the matter again appears to be controversial
I know of no serious alternative
to the thesis that these are
in substantial measure computational states,
whether we have in mind insect navigation
or what you and I are doing right now.
Again, that's held to be controversial
but since there's no alternative ideas
I don't understand why.
It's held to be controversial for humans
it's not held to be controversial for say,
insect navigation but the questions about the same.
Investigation of the brain in these terms
is sometimes called psychological,
and it's contrasted with investigation of term
in terms of cells chemical processes,
electrical activity and so on that's called physiological.
These are again terms of convenience,
they don't have any sharp boundaries,
chemistry and physics were distinguished
in pretty much similar way, not very long ago.
So, the formulas involving complex molecules
that we now study in school.
These were pretty recently considered to be,
I'm quoting merely classific story symbols,
that summarize the observed course of a reaction.
The ultimate nature of the molecular groupings
was held to be unsolvable,
and the actual arrangement of atoms within a molecule
if that even means anything,
was never to be read into the formulas.
I'm quoting from a standard history of chemistry.
Keiko Leong whose structural chemistry paved the way
to eventual unification of the chemistry and physics,
he doubted that absolute constitution of organic molecules
could ever be given,
his own models his analysis of valency
and so on were to have
only an instrumental interpretation as calculating devices.
The actually large parts of physics
were understood in the same way, by prominent scientists
including the molecular theory of gases
even Bohr's model of the atom.
In fact, only a few years before physics
and chemistry were united in Linus Pauling's
account of the chemical bond,
America's first Nobel prize-winning chemist,
dismissed talk about the real nature of chemical bonds
as in his terms metaphysical twaddle,
this was nothing more than a very crude method
of representing certain known facts about chemical reactions
a mode of representation only, just a calculating device.
The rejection of this skepticism by a few leading scientists
whose views were incidentally condemned
as a conceptual absurdity,
that paved the way to the eventual unification.
These are fairly recent debates,
this is talking about the 1920s.
These fairly recent debates in the hard sciences,
I think have considerable relevance
for today's controversies concerning computational theories
of cognitive capacity, that's from insects to humans.
Important topic, one that discussed a little bit elsewhere
and I think deserves a good deal
more attention than its received.
Well, with the biolinguistic approach in place,
this framework in place,
we wanna discover the relationship
between psychological states and the world
as described in other terms.
We want to know how computational states
are related to neuro physiological states,
states of the brain were represented
in them and one terminology.
We also want to find out how these mental states
relate to the organism external world, as for example
when the motions and noises produced by a forager
be direct others to a distant flower,
or when I talk about a recent trip to India
or when I say that I recently read
Darwin's Dissent of Man, referring to a book,
all of this is called intentionality
and philosophical jargon.
The broad issues were raised prominently
at the end of the decade of the brain,
which brought the last millennium to a close.
The American Academy of Arts and Sciences
and at the end of the millennium year 2000
published the volume to mark the occasion,
that summarized the current state
of understanding in these areas.
The guiding theme of the volume was formulated
by a distinguished neuroscientist Vernon MountCastle
in his introduction to the collection.
It is in his words, the thesis that things mental
indeed minds are emergent properties of brains,
though these emergences are not regarded as irreducible
but are produced by principles that control the interactions
between lower-level events,
principles we do not yet understand.
That same thesis has been put forth in recent years
as quoting as an astonishing hypothesis
of the new biology, a radically new idea
in the philosophy of mind,
the bold assertion that mental phenomena
are entirely natural and caused
by neuro physiological activities of the brain,
opening the door to new and promising inquiries and so on.
Contributors to the American Academy volume,
were for the most part quite optimistic
about the prospects for overcoming the remaining gaps
between psychological and physiological accounts.
Mountcastle's phrase, "We do not yet understand."
Reflects that optimism suggests we will soon understand.
Wilson wrote that, "Researchers now speak confidently
"of a coming solution to the brain mind problem."
Similar confidence has been expressed for half a century
including announcements by prominent scientists,
Nobel Prize winner in one case
that the brain, mind problem has already been solved.
We may recall usefully similar optimism
shortly before the unification of chemistry and physics.
So in 1929, Bertrand Russell who knew the sciences well,
he wrote that chemical laws cannot at present
be reduced to physical laws.
In his phrase at present, like Mountcastle's word
yet expresses the expectation,
that the reduction should take place
in the course of scientific progress, perhaps soon.
Now, in the case of physics and chemistry
it never did take place,
and what happened was something different
and totally unexpected.
Namely, unification of a virtually unchanged chemistry
with a radically revised physics.
And it's hardly necessary to stress the fact
that the state of understanding
and achievement in these areas,
50, 80 years ago was far beyond anything that can be claimed
for the brain and cognitive sciences today,
which oughta give us pause.
The American Academy volume
reviews many important discoveries,
but the leading thesis should arouse our skepticism.
And not only for the reason that I just mentioned,
another reason is that the thesis is by no means new.
In fact, it was formulated and virtually the same words
two centuries ago, late 18th century,
by the eminent chemist Joseph Priestley.
He wrote that properties of mind
arise from the organization of the nervous system itself,
and those properties termed mental
are the results of the organical structure of the brain,
just as matter is possessed
of powers of attraction and repulsion that act at a distance
contrary to the founding principles
of modern scientific revolution
from Galileo to Newton and Beyond.
Half a century before Priestley,
David Hume had casually described thought
as a little agitation of the brain,
and shortly after the French philosopher, physician
Gabonese wrote that the brain must be considered
a special organ designed to produce thought
as the stomach and the intestines
are designed to operate the digestion, the liver,
to filter bile and various glands
to prepare salivary juices.
Lemetri, he had similar proposals,
they were suppressed at the time
but they're well known today.
A century later, Darwin asked rhetorically,
why thought being a secretion of the brain
should be considered more wonderful than gravity
which is a property of matter.
Actually, these and many other conceptions
developed from an inquiry,
into what was called thinking matter
in part developed from what's sometimes called
by historians of philosophy Locke's suggestion,
John Locke's suggestion.
That is, his observation in his words
that God might have chosen to super add to matter
a Faculty of thinking, just as he annexed effects to motion
which we can in no way conceive motion able to produce
the theological apparatus,
may well have been for self-defense.
So Locke's correspondent suggests.
By the late 18th century,
the thesis was widely regarded as inescapable.
Newton had demonstrated to his considerable dismay
that matter does not exist,
in the sense of the Galilean revolution
and of the scientists of his own day and his own sense.
That being the case, the mind-body problem
could no longer even be formulated,
at least in anything resembling the classical form.
Current formulation, as seem at best to restate
the problem of unification of psychological
and physiological approaches, and to do so
in highly misleading terminology.
There was no mind-body problem,
any more than there was a chemistry physics problem
in the 1920s.
Unification of Newton's discoveries
led to, they really left no coherent alternative
to the conclusion that was drawn by Hume Priestley, others
and rediscovered today in pretty much the same terms.
But with the problem of emergence,
as unresolved as it was two centuries ago
and that includes the question whether this notion,
with its reductionist connotations
is even the right notion, maybe it's the wrong notion,
as proved to be the case for chemistry and physics.
The traditional mind-body problem
is often ridiculed as a problem of the ghost in the machine
but that's misconception.
Newton exorcized the machine,
he left the ghost completely intact.
A similar observation is made very recently
by two physicists Paul Davies and John Griffin
concluding a book of theirs, called the Matter Myth.
They write that during the triumphal phase
of materialism and mechanism in the 1930s,
that Gilbert Ryle derided, mind-body dualism
in a pithy reference to the mind part,
as the ghost in the machine.
But already when he coined that pithy expression
in the 1930s, the new physics was at work
undermining the materialist worldview
on which Ryle's philosophy was based.
By the end of the 20th century they continue,
we can see that Ryle was right to dismiss the notion
of the ghost in the machine,
not because there is no ghost
but because there is no machine.
Their point is correct, but the timing is off
by at least two centuries, actually three.
Although, it did take some time
for Newton's demolition of what was called
at the time, the mechanical philosophy, the belief
that the world is a machine,
it took a little time for that to enter
scientific common sense.
Newton himself was well aware of the conclusion
and far from pleased by it.
He regarded his own conclusion as an absurdity
that no serious person could entertain,
and he sawed away around it to the end of his life
as did prominent scientists of his day,
and much later always in vain.
Over time, it just came to be recognized
that Newton had not only effectively destroyed
the entire materialist,
physicalist conception of the universe,
but he had also undermined the standards of intelligibility
on which the early Scientific Revolution was based.
The outcome is familiar at least in history of science,
it was described very well in the classic
19th century history of materialism by Friedrich Longa.
He pointed out that scientists have accustomed theirselves
to the abstract notion of forces,
or rather a notion hovering in a mystic obscurity
between abstraction and concrete comprehension.
A turning point in the history of materialism
that removes the surviving remnants of the doctrine
far from the ideas and concerns
of the genuine materialists of the 17th century,
and deprives them of any significance.
That too is now a virtual truism,
at least among historians of science.
One of the founders of the modern discipline
Alexandre Corre he wrote 40 years ago
that a purely materialistic or mechanistic physics
is impossible, and we simply have to accept
that the world is constituted of entities
and processes that we cannot intuitively grasp.
The problems of emergence and unification
take on an entirely new form, in the post-newtonian era.
A form that's furthermore unstable, changing
as science comes to accommodate new absurdities
as they would have been regarded by the founding figures
of the Scientific Revolution including Newton.
And I know of no reason to suppose
that the process has come to an end.
It's worth pointing out that the only part of our knowledge
or what we take to be knowledge,
for which we can claim much confidence
is our mental world, that is the world of our experience.
As reflective beings, humans try in various ways
to make sense out of this experience.
One part of this effort is sometimes called folk science
when it's conducted in a more systematic,
careful, controlled way we nowadays call it science.
One standard conclusion of contemporary science,
is that each organism, humans in particular
reflexively develop what ecologists call and unveiled
the particular mode of constructing
an interpreting experience given the data of sense,
it's quite different for us and for bees for example.
Furthermore, there is no great chain of being
in fundamental respects,
insects have richer experience and more sophisticated ways
of dealing with it for action,
using it for action than humans do.
Among other standard conclusions of modern science,
are those that Priestley and many others
drew the conclusions they drew centuries ago,
about thinking matter reiterated
at the end of the decade of the brain, just two years ago,
that without notable change or maybe surprisingly
without much awareness that its revival, not innovation
and that its revival of something
that was taken to be an unavoidable truism,
two centuries ago for quite good reasons.
Given the lack of a positive determinant account
of the non mental part of the world
of the world, what sometimes called the physical world.
Talk of the hard part of the mind-body problem,
recent years that's been taken
to be consciousness conventionally.
That talk of that kind is misleading at best,
if it's even meaningful.
It may not be, sometimes the problem
is not very clearly posed, that is it's posed
in terms of questions to which
we can't even of wrong answers.
So for example, there's no sensible answer
to the question, what is it like to be me?
Or, what is it like to be a bat,
and quoting Thomas Nagle's famous paper.
There are no bad answers to that,
they're no good answers, none at all.
Formal semantics inquiries,
often take the meaning of a question
to be the set of propositions that are answers to it.
And if that is at least a condition on meaning,
then it follows that if there are no sensible answers,
the question has no meaning.
Even when legitimate questions are posed,
we don't have any good reason as far as I can see,
but to suppose that they are intrinsically harder
than lots of other problems, say the problems posed
for our understanding by quantum mechanics
or cosmological theories of an infinity of universes.
Or for that matter by the properties of motion.
We don't have any reason that I know of,
to question the opinions of Newton, David Hume,
and other not inconsiderable figures
who in various ways reached Locke's conclusion
that motion has effects which we can in no way
conceive motion able to produce.
Even before Newton puzzlement about motion was profound
his precursors or William Petting
described springing or elastic motion
as the hard rock in philosophy,
philosophy means what we call science.
The obscurity was so great, Robert Boyle felt
as to prove the existence of an intelligent author
or disposer of things.
Even the skeptical Newtonian Voltaire
felt that the impenetrable mysteries of motion
proved that there must be a God,
who gave movement to matter rather like Locke suggestion.
One cannot say that the hard problem was solved,
it was just abandoned in the course
of a significant revision of the enterprise of science,
that is the recognition that in some fundamental sense
the world is just unintelligible to us,
and that we have to reduce our sights to the search
for intelligible theories,
that's something quite different.
And even that goal has been strongly contested
by prominent physicists.
For example, in the critique a century ago of atomic theory
or even of the idea that physics
should go beyond establishing quantitative relations
between observable phenomena.
The significance of that shift,
should not be underestimated,
it was recognized soon enough for example by David Hume
who wrote that in his words,
"Newton's discoveries reveal the obscurity
"in which nature's ultimate secrets ever will remain."
These mysteries of nature as Hume called them,
referring to the phenomena of motion.
Will remain beyond our cognitive reach,
perhaps we might speculate, he didn't for reasons
that are rooted in the biological endowment
of the curious creature, that alone is able
even to contemplate these questions.
Well, I did talk a little bit
about these topics 35 years ago,
and what's happened since including incidentally
my own belated self-education inclines me to believe
that what I said then, should be reiterated
much more forcefully, and in much greater depth
and with much more explicit connections
drawn to contemporary discussions
about problems of language and mind.
Well, let's return to the narrower question
of emergence of mental aspects of the world,
or perhaps the development of an account
of the non mental world that can be unified with them
if the physics, chemistry model turns out to be accurate.
The scale of the gap that remains
and the very dubious grounds for the general optimism
about overcoming it, are revealed very clearly
in the American Academy symposium
that reviewed the state of understanding
at the end of the millennium.
One leading specialist on vision
who was toward the optimistic end of the spectrum,
and nevertheless reminded the reader
that how the brain combines the responses
of specialized cells to indicate
a continuous vertical line, is a mystery
that neurology has not yet solved.
Or even for that matter how one line
is differentiated from others or from the visual surround.
Sameera Nzeki,
the AAAs journal American Association
for advancement of science, journal science.
A year ago they devoted an issue to
neuroscience.
The summary article was co-authored by Eric Kandel,
Nobel laureate, it was subtitled
Breaking Down Scientific Barriers
to the study of brain and mind.
The article covers a lot of interesting ground
but it ends up with the conclusion
that the neuroscience of higher cognitive processes
is only beginning, it's surely beginning
from a higher plane than was constructed
by Descartes who was in many ways,
the founder of modern neuroscience
but nonetheless, it's still beginning.
Fundamental questions remain
beyond even dreams of resolution.
That includes those that were traditionally
considered at the heart of the theory of mind,
such as for example at choosing some action
or even thinking about doing so.
There's been very valuable work
about the narrower questions.
For example, how an organism executes a plan
for integrated motor action,
say how a cockroach walks or how a person reaches
for a cup on the table.

For example, how an organism executes a plan

Say how a cockroach walks,
or how a person reaches for a cup on the table.
But no one even raises the question
of why the person or the cockroach executes one plan
rather than some other one,
that question is raised only for the very simplest organisms
single-cell organisms.
In fact, the same is true even of a visual perception
which is often considered a passive process.
A couple of years ago, a few, two cognitive neuroscientists
one a colleague of mine, published the review of research
on a problem that was posed in 1850 by Helmholtz, his words.
"Even without moving our eyes we can focus our attention
"on different objects at will,
"resulting in very different perceptual experiences
"of the same visual field."
There's been interesting work on that
but the phrase at will points to an area
that's beyond serious empirical inquiry,
it remains as much of a mystery
as it was for Newton at the end of his life
when he was still seeking what he called a subtle spirit
that lies hidden in all bodies,
and that might without absurdity
account for their properties of attraction and repulsion,
the nature and effects of light sensation
and the way members of animal bodies
move at the command of the will.
These are all comparable mysteries for Newton
that perhaps even beyond our understanding
he thought like the principles of motion,
and the classical problems of the theory of mind
at least since Descartes,
who incidentally also regarded them
as possibly beyond human understanding.
Even if we restrict ourselves to the study of mechanisms,
the gaps are quite substantial.
One of the leading cognitive neuroscientists
Randy Gallistel pointed out recently,
that we clearly do not understand
how the nervous system computes,
or even the foundations of its ability to compute
even for the small set of arithmetic and logical operations
that are fundamental to any computation.
He happens to be talking about insects
but obviously extends beyond.
In another domain, one of the founders
of contemporary cognitive neuroscience Hans-Lukas Teuber.
He introduced an important review of perception
and neurophysiology, by writing that,
it may seem strange to begin with the claim
that there is no adequate definition of perception,
and to end with the admission that we lack
the neurophysiological theory.
Though this was the most that could be said.
Now, it's true that that was 40 years ago
and there were dramatic discoveries,
right at the time that he was writing and since.
But I suspect that Tueber who's since died
would have expressed much the same judgment today.
Tueber also outlined a standard way
to move towards addressing the problem of unification.
He explained that his purpose in reviewing
the perceptual phenomena and offering
a speculative psychological account of them
was because this may suggest directions
in which the search for neural basis of perception
should proceed, namely by clarifying the assumptions
that those neural basis must satisfy.
Now, that's a classic approach,
along with the restriction of the scientific enterprise
to more modest goals, namely intelligibility of theories
rather than of the world.
Another consequence of Newton's demolition
of the hopes of the Galilean revolution,
for a mechanical conception of the world.
Another one was recognition that scientific inquiry
is gonna have to be local in its expectations.
Overarching unification, may take place
but perhaps over a long term,
and in ways that can't be anticipated.
The 18th century English chemist Joseph Black
set the tone for subsequent scientific work
by recommending that chemical affinity
be received as a first principle,
which we cannot explain any more
than Newton could explain gravitation,
but let us defer accounting for the laws of affinity
till we have established such a body of doctrine
as Newton has established
concerning the laws of gravitation.
And chemistry in fact proceeded along that course,
separating itself increasingly from physics.
Physics followed Newton's admonition
that nature will be comfortable to herself
and very simple, observing a few general principles
of attraction and repulsion
that relate the elementary particles
of which all matter is constituted
more or less in the way that different buildings
could be constructed from the same bricks.
The goal was therefore to understand to quantify,
to reduce the whole of nature to simple laws
as Newton did for say astronomy.
I happen to be quoting Arnold Thackeray
in his history of Newtonian matter theory,
and the development of chemistry.
He goes on to say "This was the compelling,
"the enticing, indeed the almost bewitching goal
"of much work pursuing the thoroughly Newtonian
"and reductionist task of uncovering
"the general mathematical laws
"which governed all chemical behavior."
There was a distinct chemical tradition,
followed the path that was outlined by Joseph Black
Lavoisier Wallace founded modern chemistry,
that tried to keep neutral probably to avoid controversy.
But his own work helped to found the separate chemical track
Dalton abandoned and entirely the Boyle,
Newton corpuscular theories of matter.
He adopted the radically different view
that matter could exist in heterogeneous forms
with varied principles.
His approach, Thackeray writes was chemically successful
and therefore enjoyed the homage of the history,
unlike the philosophically more coherent if less successful
reductionist schemes of the Newtonians.
By the end of the 19th century,
the fields of interest of chemists and physicists
had become quite distinct,
including a standard history of chemistry.
Chemistry dealt with a world consisting
of some 90 material elements,
with many and varied principles and properties,
while physicists handled a more nebulous mathematical world
of energy and electromagnetic waves
that were perceived in light radiant heat,
electricity, magnetism, later radio waves and x-rays
the chemists matter was discrete and discontinuous,
the physicists energy was continuous
and the gap appeared unbridgeable.
Meanwhile, chemists developed a rich body of doctrine
achieving chemistry's triumphs in isolation
from the newly emerging science of physics, Thackeray again.
As I mentioned the isolation, ended only recently
in a completely unanticipated way, not by reduction,
but by unifying a radically revised physics
with the bodies of doctrine that chemistry had accumulated
which had in fact provided important guidelines
for the reconstruction of physics,
basically towards this point about perception,
and that's happened often in the history of science
and we cannot know whether something similar
might be required for unification
of the study of brain and mind,
if assuming that to be a task
that is within our cognitive reach,
and that we don't know either.
Well, I've already suggested and will repeat
that there are interesting and important parallels
between the debates concerning the reality of chemistry
up to the unification which was just 65 years ago.
And current debates in the philosophy of mind
about the reality of the constructions
of psychological approaches.
The former debates, chemistry physics
they are now understood to have been totally pointless,
based on serious misunderstanding.
We simply have no grasp of reality
other than what our best explanatory theories can provide.
If they happen to be computational theories,
okay that's reality.
My own view, I've discussed it elsewhere,
is that current debates very much alive right now,
are also largely pointless
and for essentially the same reasons,
this includes central topics of philosophy of mind
and theoretical cognitive science,
which those of you in the disciplines will recognize
or even in the general literature.
Well considerations of the kind that I've been reviewing
these were in the background
of the so called cognitive revolution of the 1950s,
at least for some of the participants.
Although it was unknown at the time,
in many ways the shift of perspective
brought about by the cognitive revolution
actually recapitulated the first cognitive revolution
of the 17th century,
that includes the focus on vision and language
in the latter case adopting the bio linguistic approach
that is shifting the focus of attention
from phenomena like behavior and its products, say texts.
Shifting from that to inner mechanisms
that enter into producing the phenomenon.
Now, that's a shift but it's actually a shift
that was taken in the 17th century.
Notice again then there was regression for a long time.
Notice again that that shift still leaves us
a long way from the problems of action,
that's a vastly different matter.
I've myself often quoted
though Hume from Humboldt's aphorism,
that the core problem of the study of language
is the infinite use of finite means,
so it was a leading concern
of Cartesian philosophy before him,
and a problem that really couldn't be posed
very clearly at least until the mid 20th century
that when the concepts of recursive generative procedures
that was fully clarified.
These procedures constitute the finite means
that are put to infinite use,
but it's important to be aware
I don't think I've stressed this enough.
It's important to be aware
that despite quite a lot of progress
in understanding the means,
the means that are employed for infinite use
the question of how they are used,
is scarcely even addressed and it was that question
that was the fundamental one for Descartes Humboldt
and other early modern figures,
and again those questions aren't even addressed
for say insects, let alone humans.
It's reasonably clear that the human capacity for language
is what's called a species property,
that is biologically isolated in essential respects
and close to uniform across the species.
That actually seems less surprising today
than it did not long ago,
in the light of very recent discoveries
about the very limited genetic variation
among humans as compared with other primates,
suggests that we've all descended
from a very small breeding group,
maybe 100,000 years ago.
So, humans are basically identical
from the point of view have say,
an outside biologist looking at us.
The bio linguistic approach adopted from the start,
what has been called quote,
the recently published encyclopedia
of cognitive neuroscience,
what's called the norm these days in neuroscience,
the modular view of learning,
that is the conclusion that in all animals
learning is based on specialized mechanisms
instincts to learn in specific ways
happen to be quoting Randy Gallistel again,
"These organs within the brain," as he calls them,
"Perform specific kinds of computation
"in accordance with specific design.
"Apart from extremely hostile environments
"the organs change state under the triggering
"and shaping effect of external factors,
"they do so more or less reflexively
"and in accordance with internal design."
That's the process of learning,
although growth might be a more appropriate term
avoiding misleading connotations of the term learning.
The language organ the Faculty of language
fits that pattern, the normal pattern.
according to the best theories we have
each attainable state of the system
each I language, is a computational system
that determines, generates in the technical sense.
Infinitely many expressions each of these expressions
is a store of information,
about sound and meaning which is accessed
by performance systems.
The properties of the I language,
result from the interplay of several factors,
one factor is individual experience
which selects among the options
that are permitted by the initial state.
A second factor is the initial state itself,
which is a product of evolution.
And a third factor is general properties
of organic systems, in this case computational systems
incorporating it's reasonable to expect
principles of efficient computation.
The general picture involving crucially the third factor,
is familiar in the study of organic systems generally
this classic work of Darcy Thompson and Alan Turing
on organic form and morphogenesis
is an illustration the topic currently
and contemporary biology.
One example, current example that might be suggestive
in the present connection, present context
is recent work by Christopher Juniac
mathematical biologists at Maryland
who's been exploring the idea that
minimization of what he calls wire length,
as in microchip design should produce what he calls
the best of all possible brains.
And he's tried to explain in these terms,
the neuroanatomy of nematodes,
one of the simplest and best studied organisms
and also various pervasive properties of nervous systems
such as the fact that the brain
is as far forward as possible on the body axis,
wants to try to show that that's just property
of efficient computation based on wire length minimization.
Well one can trace interest in this third factor
general properties of organisms,
back to a Galilean intuition namely Galileo's concept
that in his words, "Nature is perfect."
From the tides, to the flight of birds
and it's the task of the scientist to discover
in just what sense this is true.
Newton's confidence that nature must be very simple,
which I quoted, that reflects the same intuition.
However obscure it may be that intuition
about what Ernest Pickle called nature's drive
for the beautiful, has been a guiding theme
of modern science since its smart modern origins
and with a Galilean revolution,
perhaps even its defining characteristic.
It's hard to say exactly what it is
but that it's a guiding intuition is not a doubt.
Biologists however have tended to think rather differently
about the objects of their inquiry.
Very commonly, they adopt what Francois Jacob,
the Nobel laureate his image of nature
as what he called a tinkerer,
which does the best it can with the materials at hand
often a pretty rotten job, as human intelligence seems
to be keen on demonstrating about itself.
One well-known contemporary biologist
Gabriel Dover British geneticist,
he concludes in a recent book that biology
is a strange and messy business
and perfection is the last word one could use
to describe how organisms work,
particularly for anything produced by natural selection.
Though of course produced only in part
by natural selection as he emphasizes,
and as every biologist knows and to an extent
that can't be quantified by available tools.
Well, we just don't know
which of these conflicting intuitions is more accurate,
the Galilean intuition or say Jacob's intuition.
And we will not know until we know the answer,
and they seem very remote those answers.
The same author Gabriel Dover writes that
"We are nowhere near relieving our deepest ignorance
"about the biological world around us."
Now, he goes on to reserve his sharpest words
for those who seek to give scientific respectability
to complex behavioral phenomena and humans
that we cannot even begin to investigate seriously.
He calls that a sign of intellectual laziness at best,
and shameless ignorance at worst
when confronting issues of massive complexity
which far exceed the reach of contemporary science.
He gives some examples but for charity, I'll ignore them.
The long-term goal of investigating the third factor
that is the role of general properties of organisms
in determining the Faculty of language,
and the states that can attain internal languages,
that goal was actually formulated in the early days
of the bio linguistic turn,
but it was put aside as unfeasible
and attention focused on the first two factors
experience and the initial state.
In technical terminology that's called
the problems of descriptive and explanatory adequacy,
and the latter is the question of how the initial state
enters into determining the transition
to the final state, the state attained.
The earliest attempts 50 years ago,
to replace traditional or structuralist accounts of language
by generative rule systems, revealed very quickly,
that very little was known
about the sound and meaning and structure of language
and that huge problems had been unwittingly
swept under the rug,
rather as in the days when it was assumed
that bodies fall to their natural place.
As has often been the case,
one of the hardest steps in the development of the sciences
is the first one namely to be puzzled
by what seems so natural and obvious.
To gain some realistic sense of what had been overlooked
was an enormous task in itself, even more so
in the light of the recognition
that the apparent complexity and diversity of languages
that was very soon discovered,
just had to be an illusion.
The reason for that conclusion is a standard one in biology
namely as in the case of other organs of the body.
Experience can play only a very limited role
in determining the state that's obtained
in this case the attained I language.
So, even a young child has mastered a rich
and highly articulated system of sound
and meaning and structural properties.
that goes far beyond any evidence available,
and that's shared with others who have different
but also highly restricted experience.
So, it has to be the case, that the initial state
plays an overwhelming role, in determining the language
that the child attains in all of its aspects.
Experience surely has a role of triggering
and shaping role, as in the case of other organs,
but it has to be a limited one.
So, there's no reason to suppose that language
and other higher mental faculties depart radically
from everything known in the biological world.
The task was to show that the apparent richness
and complexity and diversity is in fact an illusion,
that all languages are test to the same mold
and that experience serves only to set options
within a fixed system of principles,
all determined by the initial state.
Much as in the case of other biological systems.
Well, a great deal of the research the last 40 years
in these areas has been driven by a kind of tension
between descriptive and explanatory adequacy,
that is the tension between the search
for true theories of I languages the attained state
on the one hand, and a true theory
of the invariant initial state
of the language or again on the other.
The invariant initial state is the topic
of what's come to be called Universal grammar,
it's adapting a traditional notion to a quite a new context.
The search for a descriptive adequacy
like a true theory of Hungarian,
that leads to complex intricate theories
of particular constructions and particular languages
differing from one another.
In contrast, the search for explanatory adequacy
seeks to find the common ground
from which the existing languages and all possible others
arise given the data that are structured is experienced,
by the operations of the initial States,
again in some unknown manner.
The first proposals from the 1950s
suggested that the initial state,
the topic of universal grammar.
That the initial state provides a kind of a format
for rural systems in their organization,
and a procedure for selecting one instantiation
of the format over another,
in terms of its success in capturing
authentic linguistic generalizations
and empirical notion that incorporates
also a kind of a theory internal version
of standard best theory considerations.
The rules themselves at the beginning
were adaptations of informal traditional notions,
which had proven to be utterly inadequate
when they were subjected to close examination.
So that meant for example rules for forming
relative clauses in Hungarian or passives,
or in Japanese or positives
and the Romance languages and so on.
The general approach did offer a kind of solution
to the core problem of the study of language,
sometimes called in the literature,
the logical problem of language acquisition
that is how does the initial state map
constructed experience, to the final state.
But as was emphasized, that solution holds only in principle
because in practice the conception was unfeasible
because of the astronomical computational demands.
Well, from about 40 years ago
attempts were made to reduce the scale of the problem
by seeking valid general principles
that can be abstracted from particular grammars
and attributed the universe grammar meaning
to the initial state of the language faculty leaving residue
that might be more manageable.
Actually some of those proposals were kind of proposals
that were then being explored.
I reviewed in the lectures here 35 years ago,
after that time, by then already
there was some progress after that time
then considerable progress,
but it still left the tension unresolved.
That as the general picture
was somehow fundamentally defective,
there was no true solution, feasible solution
to the logical problem of language acquisition.
Well, a possible resolution of the tension was reached
after a good deal of effort about 20 years ago,
with the crystallization of a picture of language
that marked a very sharp break
from a long and rich tradition
of tracing back to classical Indian and Greece,
is sometimes called the principles and parameters approach
that dispenses entirely with the core notions
of traditional grammar notions,
like grammatical construction or grammatical rule.
From this point of view,
categories such as a relative clause or passive construction
are understood to be real enough,
but only as taxonomic artifacts.
So for example, aquatic organisms
which would include say dolphins, trout, eels
and some bacteria it's a category
but not a biological category.
The phenomena, the phenomenal properties of these artifacts
result from the interaction of invariant principles
of the initial State, Faculty of language
with parameters that are finite number of parameters
fixed in one or another way.
It would incidentally follow
that there are only finitely many possible human languages
apart from idiosyncrasies and choice of lexical items,
and even these are sharply constrained.
That means that the problem of unfeasible search
is eliminated it's a major conclusion if correct.
The conception has now been applied
to typologically different languages
of just about every known kind,
it's led to many discoveries a host of new questions
that were never before contemplated
sometimes suggestive answers.
This principles and parameters approach
is an approach, it's not a theory.
Within the general approach, there are many diverse theories
there is actually a very good introduction
to the topic just published by Mark Baker,
called Atoms of Language he himself has made
major contributions to the approach,
that he's been working primarily on languages
that appear to be at opposite ends
of the spectrum of typological possibilities,
picking that on purpose of course.
Mohawk and English that's the pair
that he studied most intensively,
trying to show that although they are about
as different phenomenally as two languages can be,
there in reality virtually identical
apart from very small changes in a few parameters,
so that's a Martian observer
who views humans as we view other organisms,
would conclude that they're essentially identical
dialectal variants of the same language.
There's been extensive work of a similar character
carried out worldwide with quite revealing results.
One major program funded by the European Union
is studying the vast number of languages in Europe,
huge number in fact misleadingly called,
things like German and Italian and so on
though they're totally different languages.
Included by those in those characterizations
and it's happening being done elsewhere as well.
I don't wanna suggest that the approach has been established
that's very far from true,
but it has been very successful as a research program
as a stimulus to empirical and theoretical inquiry
that progress towards the goals of descriptive
and explanatory adequacy, has far surpassed anything
that precedes, that not only in depth of analysis
of particular languages,
but also in the range of typologically different languages
that have been investigated.
And also a new areas of linguistic structure
that had barely been explored before.
Related fields such as the study of language acquisition
have also been completely revitalized
within a similar framework, they now look
totally unlike anything that was around 20 or 30 years ago.
There are some important steps towards convergence
although it's certainly gonna be a long and difficult course
even if the approach turns out
to be more or less on the right track,
we're far from having a clear idea
of what the principles and parameters actually are.
But I think it's fair to say that the study of language
in the last 20 years, has moved to an entirely new plane.
Well, I wanna pick up these topics tomorrow
and then move on to the issues,
particularly the role of the third fact
there are general properties of organisms
and say something about that.
And then to move on to the work called
the questions of intentionality,
now that is the question of how language now understood
within the by linguistic framework
relates to the rest of the world.
(audience applauding)
- Professor Chomsky has agreed to take a couple of questions
that were submitted by the audience.
Since these questions were submitted
at the beginning of the lecture,
they may not have been part of what's covered today,
it might be a sneak preview of tomorrow.
"Do you still believe that the human language faculty
"evolved all at once in a sudden evolutionary leap?
"Doesn't this conflict with the general finding
"that evolution is gradual?"
- This idea sometimes called the monster mutation
was invented as far as I'm aware by Elizabeth Bates,
and has been repeated by many other people,
that's been attributed to me for some reason
I haven't got the slightest idea why,
I've never said a word about it.
And I have no idea whether it's true
nor does anyone know anything about these topics in general.
Why it was invented,
why it was attributed to me you can try to figure out.
The fact of the matter is no one knows
anything about these things,
even for much simpler questions.
So for example there, one well-known fact
about biological organisms
is they all you know above the level bacteria,
they all seem to have essentially
the same body type, same body forms.
And it's now kind of understood how that works
certain regulatory genes have been master genes
have been discovered that create the forums
and it just runs through the whole organic world of animals.
Well very recent work, actually a couple of papers in nature
just a few weeks ago, show
laboratory experimental work
that shows how this might have happened
in one monster mutation.
Well, okay maybe maybe not.
There's recent work about the evolution of the human brain
articles in science a couple of weeks ago,
suggesting in fact that one small mutation took place
which suddenly led to explosion of brain cells.
Maybe, maybe not these are you know,
I don't have anything to say about these matters,
I just repeat what's in the technical literature.
But why this conception was attributed to me
is a total mystery as far as I know.
- I hope this is not at the same you like it,
so do you still question again.
"Do you still view language as self-contained module
"that is independent of other cognitive systems?
"Wouldn't it be simple to assume that language ability
"is grounded in the same cognitive mechanisms
"as other forms of human cognition?"
- Well, I take for granted that the human language,
I mean it's kind of like asking
whether the visual system is distinct
from other systems of the body.
Of course it isn't or say the immune system.
Of course, it's not distinct from the rest of the body
like you can't cut the immune system out
and leave the rest of the body, I mean it's impossible.
Every subsystem of the body
that's isolated for a particular inquiry
is isolated because it has a kind
of an integrated character,
and you think you can learn something about it.
It doesn't mean that it's in a little box
that you can pull out, right?
So the immune systems in every cell,
but it's still a system.
And presumably the same is true of the language faculty.
I mean, it's brings together, many different components
which come from all over the place,
for example the language faculty
what you and I are now doing,
makes essential use of the delicate architecture
of the bones in the middle year, okay.
They're terrific for wonderfully designed
for understanding language.
Of course they evolved for reasons
having absolutely nothing to do with language,
they evolved from the fact that they apparently
that the skulls of early mammals about 160 million years ago
were getting bigger, and as they got bigger
blowing in the reptilian jaw started migrate
and for mechanical reasons apparently,
it ended up in the middle of the ear
which turns out to be great for language.
And the same is true of, it could,
I mean the computational principles
that are at the core of language,
and we might discover that those
are the same computational principles
that are used by insects for navigation,
if we did that the fascinating discovery,
would mean that it's one of the things
that was recruited to form the language faculty.
The idea that the language faculty is isolated
from other cognitive systems
just makes no sense at all, can't be.
I mean we use the language faculty to express our thoughts
to think to ourselves to communicate,
to have and communicate attitudes, to perceive the world.
Of course, it's integrated with the entire collection
of cognitive faculties and other faculties.
Again, the interesting question
that should be asked about that question
is why it says do I still believe,
because nobody could possibly believe this.
There's a huge mythology about these things
which has been developed.
It's kind of characteristic of studies
of human higher mental faculties.
They are pursued at a level of irrationality
that is just hard to deal with.
In fact centuries ago, the hard sciences
were dealt with in a similar way,
but we should be able to escape from that.
- [Moderator] Have your views regarding poverty
of the stimulus change in light of these studies?
- There are no such studies.
(audience laughing)
All studies show what everybody knows in advance,
that the amount of data available
for language acquisition is extremely small.
This notion of poverty of stimulus is a little bit
like what I call the innateness hypothesis.
Everyone believes in poverty of stimulus,
not only for language but for everything.
There was a certain embryo once upon a time
that turned into my granddaughter okay.
Why didn't it turn into a worm let's say?
I mean is it because of the nutritional input?
Like what a different nutritional input
to the cell have turned it into a worm?
Well you know, nobody even takes questions seriously
they're so idiotic.
What is assumed automatically by every scientist
is what's called poverty of the stimulus,
in the case of language.
It's considered controversial
in the case of human mental faculties,
but taken for granted without even any discussion
throughout the rest of biology because it's so obvious.
I mean it cannot possibly be that
what you and I are now doing, is based on early
or for that matter late input for the environment
because there isn't any, virtually none.
In fact, it's easy to demonstrate
that the things that even a young child do
have a statistical level that is barely
at the point of noise in an actual discourse.
The point is kind of obvious,
there's nothing to discuss about it.
Everyone agrees that there is poverty of the stimulus,
the only question is well what is the initial state
that in fact, first of all structures data as experience
which is no trivial task,
and then takes that experience and almost instantaneously
and reflexively as Gallistel points out,
constructs an attained state, that's the problem.
Somebody has some ideas about it, be my guest
it's a great topic.
- [Moderator] You have suggested that human beings
possess a language acquisition device,
is this device a real entity or a metaphor?
- Well, kind of like asking whether the genetic endowment
that leads to an immune system
is a real system or a metaphor.
I mean we end up doing what you and I are...
Well, let's go back to my granddaughter
and her imagined pet chimpanzee.
Let's suppose that the two of them
are exposed to exactly the same data okay.
One of them ends up doing what you and I
are now doing, the other one does nothing.
Suppose that she also happens to have a pet bee, okay.
Well, the pet bee and my granddaughter
exposed to the same visual data
in the case of the bee, it'll end up
with a complicated intricate system of communication,
the humans can't possibly duplicate
it's way beyond their cognitive capacities
to communicate the distance and height
and quality of a flower, humans simply can't do that
but the bee does it reflexively.
Well, observing facts like that,
every scientist just takes for granted,
there's something special about my granddaughter,
or the bee and the chimpanzee
which uses the same data to end up in very different states.
And unless it's miracles,
that has to do with their genetic endowment.
So, therefore we can talk about
a language acquisition device
a chimpanzee call acquisition device,
a bee communication acquisition device
these aren't metaphors,
these are just descriptions of sub components
of an organism which you try to understand,
there's nothing metaphoric about them
and there really should be nothing controversial about them.
I mean unless one thinks that the bee,
the chimpanzee and my granddaughter
should end up the same way with the same data,
unless anybody thinks that,
then the answer should be obvious.
- [Moderator] Is there any evidence of evolutionary change
in the historical record of human language?
- No, that's why I mentioned before the current,
at least current understanding is that
there's extremely little genetic variation among humans
as compared with other primates.
Meaning which can only, is taken to mean
that we're basically all kind of cousins
coming from the same small breeding group not very long ago
like a 100, 1,000 or 200,000 years
is essentially nothing in evolutionary time.
There's been no time for any evolution
nobody knows exactly when language got into the picture,
but probably about the same time
roughly plus or minus a 100,000 years.
And there's been just no time
for any evolutionary change to take place,
that's why say my granddaughter
and don't know why I'm focused on her.
But my granddaughter if she'd grown up
say in Tokyo, would be talking perfect Japanese
because she's genetically identical
to the kids who grow up in Tokyo,
as far as this capacity
or probably just about every capacity is concerned.
So then if that's true, there can't have been evolutionary
any meaningful evolutionary change
in the history in the brief history of language,
it's just way too short.
- [Moderator] Now this is the last,
and it's a very open-ended question
so feel free to ignore it or do what you like.
"what details are results of current neuroscience
"bear on your current biologically based language theories."
- Well currently neuroscience is providing
some new ideas, not so much neuroscience
as new techniques, for example imaging,
brain imaging is providing
rather interesting suggestive results
you know FMRI and things like that.
You don't exactly what to make of them
because you know these are investigating
systems that are just not understood
on the basis of signals that are detected from the outside.
Some of the results are quite in a way startling,
so for example Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences,
just recently a couple of months ago published a paper
by Laura Patito, an investigator
who's was in Montreal now and Dartmouth.
She apparently has seems to have shown
that sign language, the deaf children who use sign,
the neural centres that are involved in processing the sign
are close to identical, as far as you can tell,
identical with those of hearing infants
who are processing auditory input.
That's a very surprising result.
I mean a little less surprising
than it would have been 20 years ago
because work has shown that these systems
are very similar in many structural respects.
But that there neurally represented in the same place
is quite interesting, if it's true
it would mean that whatever our Faculty of language is
it's probably independent of modality,
sensory modality, some analytic computing system
that could use one modality or another.
The fact that say vision and hearing
end up analyzed in the same place
is a little bit surprising,
because of what's known about the projection
of sensory systems into the cortex.
But that kind of inquiry is pretty interesting
and suggestive, and there is work of that kind coming along.
As for neuroscience itself,
remember that very little is known.
I mean, I quoted the encyclopedia,
the current edition of the MIT encyclopedia
of cognitive neuroscience is pointing out
that we do not understand the neurophysiology
of even the most elementary computations,
that are used throughout the animal world,
say for insect navigation.
Even the simplest ones, the neurophysiology
is completely obscure.
When you try to get to human language
you're off in some in outer space somewhere.
It's an important problem maybe someday it'll be understood,
but it's pretty remote.
- [Moderator] Well, thank you very much
for a most stimulating lecture.
