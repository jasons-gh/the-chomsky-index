let's go back to 1989 November 1989
which I mentioned end of Soviet tyranny
if anybody believed the propaganda that
they had heard for the last 50 years
they would have predicted that NATO
would disappear I mean the justification
for NATO was its protecting the west
from the Russian hordes okay Russian
hordes are gone what happens to NATO
should have gone as well it did it no it
expanded and that teaches you something
actually what happened in detail is of
quite interesting Gorbachev made a
remarkable concession to the West he
agreed to let Germany form a united
Germany join a Western military alliance
a hostile military alliance now if you
just look at history it's pretty clear
what an amazing concession that was I
mean Germany alone had almost destroyed
Russia several times in the preceding
century and now Gorbachev was saying
okay united Germany can be rearmed and
can join a hostile military alliance
which makes it much more powerful well
of course there was a he thought he made
an agreement he thought that the West's
meaning the United States was agreeing
not to let NATO expand to the east the
phrase was not one inch to the east
meaning NATO would not extend to East
Germany and of course would not extend
further and also he thought he had a
promise that NATO would become a more
political organization so the president
President Bush and the Secretary of
State James Baker did promise that they
promised NATO would become a more
political organization it would not
extend one inch to the east
however gorbachev made a serious error
and if any of you her intending to take
on a course in diplomacy you might pay
attention to it he only got a verbal
promise it was he thought it was a
gentlemen's agreement
you don't make gentlemen's agreements
with savage violent powers so they made
sure not to write it down it was never
written in words it was just a
gentlemen's agreement we have no doubt
about what was said Helmut Kohl said the
same thing dentures said the same thing
yeah we promise not to extend an inch to
the east well what happened
NATO immediately expanded the East
Germany another Clinton that expanded
much farther through East Eastern Europe
right up to the borders of the Soviet
Union well you know Gorbachev was pretty
upset naturally and the Russians reacted
they were there was more that Gorbachev
had offered a nuclear weapons free zone
from the Arctic down to the
Mediterranean the the US didn't even
consider that it wasn't even discussed
and NATO has in fact expanded well it's
now not only going to the east the the
happens to be Dutch Secretary General of
NATO announced that about a year ago
that NATO has to take responsibility for
the entire global energy system so it
has to what's called protect mean
meaning ensure that we own the sea lanes
the pipelines and so on and there was
just a conference about two weeks ago
and Washington headed by former
Secretary of State Albright which had a
new got the name of it it had a new
mission for NATO to expand worldwide
well NATO is a us-run military force and
it's now becoming an international
global US intervention force and the
purpose of it one purpose of it is to
exactly as the quench questioner said to
integrate Europe into the u.s.
a military system that's what NATO was
for in the first place the one goal of
NATO from the very beginning was to
block golestan ishutin
to make sure that Europe would not move
in an independent course and as the
pretext for NATO disappeared namely the
Russians we can now see what it's all
about
now NATO has expanded no Russians but
it's expanded to a global us run
military intervention force in which
Europe is absorbed now Europe is
dragging its feet it's not doing it
enthusiastically enough and about a week
ago there was an important article by
Richard Haass he's the head of the
Council on Foreign Relations it's kind
of like the main non-governmental
Foreign Relations establishment
institution he's a former high
policymaker the title of the article
which appeared in the London Financial
Times if you want to look it up the
title is goodbye Europe
it says Europe is no longer playing its
proper role as a major actor in world
affairs because it's not violent enough
meaning the point is NATO is rupees
refusing to provide sufficient military
force for the us-run global programs of
controlling you know the world by force
so goodbye Europe you're not violent
enough so we don't want you anymore
we'll take somebody else actually he
doesn't really mean goodbye Europe it's
just a chastising Europe for their
failures to have an adequate commitment
to violence but you still have to be
absorbed in the us-run system
