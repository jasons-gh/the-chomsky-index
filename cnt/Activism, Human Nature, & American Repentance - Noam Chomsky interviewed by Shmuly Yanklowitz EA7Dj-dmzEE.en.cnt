Institute professor emeritus the

MIT and laureate professor at the
University of Arizona and as the author
of more than a hundred books on the
topics of linguistics war politics and
mass media professor Chomsky thanks so
much for taking this time pleased to be
with you
so just to jump right in you are trained
as a linguist how did you become more
involved as an activist okay was an
activist long before I heard of
linguistics and as a child in fact in
fact my discovery of linguistics
happened to be through activist
connections long story but they've been
side by side frankly all my life
fascinating and in in what ways did your
Jewish upbringing contribute to your act
to your activism or activist outlook
well my initial activism for many years
and as part continues to the present I
had to do with what was then Palestine
which is now Israel I grew up in a and
my parents were heavily involved in the
revival of Hebrew Jewish education the
development of a Jewish Center and what
was then Palestine I this is from my I
was a went to Hebrew school Hebrew
College was a Hebrew teacher organizers
Hebrew youth groups this was I was very
much involved in what at the time was
called Zionism it's now called
anti-zionism it was an effort to try to
move towards some form of Arab Jewish
operation in Palestine aiming perhaps to
some kind of by National Federation of
something like that of course that ended
in 1948 and things took on a different
complexion but I just very very much
involved in its the other the other
aspect of the Hebrew education studying
the Bible and some study of Talmud of
modern Hebrew literature all of that is
just part of my general background as in
life were there particular Jewish values
that resonated most for you that
continue to animate your thinking well
as in any complex culture there are all
sorts of values so you pick and choose
and the ones I would like to pick and
choose or for example the a line from my
HUF Torah portion Lobo - oh before you
like to think that that's the slogan
delivers very nice so we obviously live
in very divisive times today and I
wonder is it possible to act in the name
of morality and be above the partisan
politics of today oh well first of all
them the partisan politics are a little
bit misleading oh there is polarization
but if you take a closer look I think
what you actually find is that both of
the major political groupings political
parties have drifted to the right during
the last roughly 50 years mostly the
neoliberal theory
today's Democrats mainstream Democrats
are pretty much what used to be moderate
Republicans meanwhile the Republican
Party especially since
Engrish has gone way off to the right
far off the spectrum if you look and
they're very militant and committed
there are good reasons for this there's
a sharp split in the Republican Party
between the mainstream establishment
position the actual policies and on the
other hand the voting base they're quite
different other their policies are so
dedicated to the welfare of the very
rich and the corporate sector that they
can't get votes so what they've
therefore done is organized the voting
base on other issues and it can be a
pretty unwholesome mix when you look at
it yeah a bit there and that has led to
what's called polarization but the
polarization is coming from the right
far right exemplifies it but certainly
one can be outside of the system and
take one's own independent position on
it so what what what what trends in
American life right now do you give you
optimism and in in and it's ideal form
what would we see of the role of America
in the 21st century global order oh
right now painful to say but right at
the moment the United States role is to
take the lead in laboring to destroy the
possibility of organized human life on
earth sorry to say that but it's a fact
yeah we're facing serious existential
crises two one is the global warming
crisis it's very severe imminent I don't
have much time to do something about it
most of the world isn't trying to do at
least something inadequate but some
steps the United States
alone side from side kicks like Brazil
today but the United States alone
basically is racing toward the precipice
it static the policies are dedicated to
maximizing the impact of a critical
catastrophic outcome that will in fact
make life organized life on Earth
impossible than any form that we know
now that has to be changed
turning to optimism yes there are very
strong popular groups mostly young
people acting to try to change the
climate strike last month which brought
maybe seven or eight million people out
into the streets mostly one that was a
remarkable critical event
well it's led to efforts to change
policy or they may be effective they'd
better be effective and we're in trouble
that's the only one of the series for
crises that one at least is discussed
the other had much less discussed and it
may destroy us before environmental
crisis does that's rising threat of
nuclear war is again taking the lead in
increasing the extraordinary threat of
nuclear annihilation
just in August president Trump
dismantled the Reagan Gorbachev INF
treaty which had significantly lessened
the threat of war in Europe which would
quickly spread to the whole world tore
that up and immediately carried out a
test of a missile which violated the
treaty treaty basically entreating
Russia and the rest of the world to
develop comparable weapons to destroy us
the Open Skies treaty initiated by
Eisenhower that's now on the chopping
block the New START treaty the last of
the major treaties
Trump administration's already said if
there's still an office they won't sign
it
that's tremendous gift to the weapons
manufacturers but for everyone else on
earth
it's a opening the way to disaster
it's and of course the Russians are
responding the Chinese will respond
other factors in Luther's name
that's only one thing oh there's another
the Middle East which is a very volatile
dangerous area one thing the Trump
administration has done is to pull the
rug out of the major agreement which the
constrained infected ended any Iranian
weapons production if there was any
immuno no being talked or that part
that's gonna lead to increased its
already leading to increased tensions we
don't know where that will go
I should mention at this point something
that's never discussed it's not
permitted but it's critically important
there is a way to end any concern that
anyone might have about Iranian nuclear
weapons production very simple way
institute a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East with verifiable
inspections and that can be done
why doesn't it happen well who's opposed
not the Arab states they've been they
initiated the proposal then strongly
advocating it for decades not Iran which
strongly supports it not the non-law
so-called non-aligned movement global
South it's most of the world strongly
supports it Europe supports it's blocked
by one country the United States the
issue comes up at regularly at the
regular meetings of the
non-proliferation treaty the review
meetings the last one was 2015 when I
was blocked by Obama
no doubt that the next one it'll be
blood well why everybody knows the
reasons nobody says the reasons are that
if there is such a zone established
first they'll have to be inspection of
Israel's massive nuclear weapons program
Western Israel don't want that secondly
and most crucially the US will have to
admit publicly that Israel has a nuclear
weapons program of course they know they
do and everyone else knows - but you're
not supposed to say because if it's
formally admitted under US law all US
military aid Israel's mine I have to
cease signing Tenth Amendment so a lot
to the state and for that reason the
countries of the world cannot move to
end what is claimed to be a major threat
and are allowing serious dangers to grow
which might end up in terrible
devastating war we should face that fact
especially those of us who are
interested in Israel and the region you
argue quite convincingly in your article
the responsibilities of intellectuals
that America American or more broadly
Western intellectuals need to leverage
their privilege in order to call out
their respective governments on various
atrocities and I wonder what are some of
the ways you've seen this be successful
over the past decades in America and and
today there have all through history
back through the biblical prophet take a
look at that period who were the Prophet
I mean the word prophet is a bad
translation of an obscure Hebrew word
but from there if we look at them from
our perspective the Sufis are pretty
much what we now call dissident
intellectuals so prophet Elijah was
called a no hairiest rail hater of his
like King Ahab aha well because he was
criticizing the crimes of the evil Quran
okay
prophets were driven into the desert
jail punished because they were calling
door condemning the geostrategic
strategies of the Kings which were going
to lead the disaster they were calling
for mercy for widows and orphans and so
on they were carrying out the role of
what we now call dissident intellectuals
and they were treated very harshly well
the people who were treated well at
those years were the flatterers of the
court the ones that were later called
false prophets many years later that's a
pattern that is existed through history
but roughly the same time it was
happening in classical Greece another
person who had to drink the hemlock
suicide was the one who was corrupting
the youth of Athens by asking too many
questions and brazing tried to get
people to think all through it's the
same right up to the present take any
country you like you'll find there's a
large majority of the intellectual class
educated classes are basically
inherently and they inherit the legacy
of the flatterers at the court
supportive of power there's a fringe of
critics usually treated pretty badly how
badly depends on but they have had
impact in fact they're a large part of
the reason along with popular movements
that they're linked with for progress in
human life that goes back to the
prophets of classical Greece run the
role through history we see it right in
front of us today I think oh we're just
talking about the climate strike and the
general popular movements to deal with
not only environmental crises but other
major problems that faces mostly its
popular move
there is a group of activists call them
intellectuals if you like people with
some degree of privilege a confirmation
of access to modes is a reaching out to
the public and so on
they are part of it that's their role
and that's what called what Gramsci
called
organic intellectuals linked in popular
movements have made changes brought
about changes in the past will in the
future let's take just as an example the
what I mentioned the Reagan Gorbachev
INF treaty 1987 take a look at the
background for that the background was a
huge popular uprising in Europe and the
United States many millions of people
demanding an end to the nuclear
confrontation against that background
two leaders were able to reach a
historic agreement which did contribute
substantially to 20 years of peace
without men on the court one of the
William Perry former defense secretary
spent his whole life in dealing with
nuclear issues and was a very sober a
conservative commentary commentator not
given to exaggeration he really said
recently said he's terrified in fact
doubly terrified terrified by the
growing threat of nuclear war terrified
by the fact that intellectuals and
others are saying very little about it
and we should want them triply terrified
because our leaders are racing towards
destruction well this is happening but
as we've seen in the past
I just gave one example there were
thousands engaged active public with
participation of privileged people with
access to information and
public forums that can make a difference
yeah
so before we can think about repenting
for the past sins of the of the u.s.
obviously we have to stop the enormous
you know problems that are occurring
today that you that you've only touched
on if we were to begin with a new order
of 2020 in 2020 and beyond what would it
look like for the u.s. to repent for
past for past social ills but so I
didn't hear the last words what would it
look like for for the u.s. to begin a
process of repentance for our historical
political shortcomings well there let's
take one particular taste at two groups
of Americans one of them African
Americans oh they have a 400 year
history here the first part of the
history was the most vicious system of
slavery there's ever existed in human
history
and flavor goes way back but there's
been nothing like this like the the
concentration camps in the south where
the African Americans laboured under
hideous conditions not never before seen
in slave society that also happened to
create the basis of their own wealth and
privilege the cotton was the oil of the
19th century
not a cheap cotton produced by slavery
visual slavery was the basis for the
creation of manufacturing textiles
finance commerce of course retail trade
for the United States for England also
for and directly for other countries on
the wrong on their own development what
happened at the end that was in formal
end of slavery
okay 1865 there were ten years in which
blacks had relative freedom
reconstruction
year that ended they with a compromise
with north and south was basically
allowed of the southern slave states to
do what they wanted they were instituted
slavery in fact one of the major books
on the topic is called slavery by
another name a process of legalized
slavery was reinstituted blacks were not
only intimidated by vicious atrocities
but black life was essentially
criminalized if a black man was seeing
standing on a corner he could be accused
of vagrancy ordered to pay a fine which
he couldn't pay spent the rest of his
life in jail in fact working and working
in manufacturing in agriculture that
went right on til the 1930s then there
was a period during the Second World War
on the first couple of decades after the
war when there was a kind of an
beginnings of an opening for African
Americans to enter the general society
black man could get a job in an auto
factory make a fairly decent Sattar
salary maybe get enough money to buy a
small home one problem a federal housing
was legally segregated into the late 60s
what man couldn't get a home and the new
developments that were being built by
the government that we're benefiting the
most early post-war generation by the
time that ended let's tack the
neoliberal stagnation setting
manufacturing jobs began to disappear
wages stagnated the opportunity was lost
I mean while extreme racism has
maintained in many ways well that's and
you can see the legacy I mean black
families have practically no no will
they live in offer conditions and so on
a lot of the formal barriers have been
eliminated but not the cultural
structural ones well that's one part
major part of the population there's
another part that people who used to
live here with the Indian nations
they've the United States is pretty
unusual country in many ways many
achievements many many to be proud of
but some that are pretty ugly the United
States is an unusual country that has
been at war for almost every year since
its founding one of the major reasons
for the American Revolution was a royal
proclamation by King George which barred
settlement the west of the Allegheny
Mountains settlers weren't where the
Indian nations lived settlers weren't
having any of this said like colonists
wanted to go to the left to the west
land speculators like George Washington
who wanted to purchase lands and the
West for speculative reasons the
revolution one of the main reasons for
the revolution wasn't revoke that as
soon as it was won the aggression into
the Indian nations began went right
through the 19th century leading to a
virtual extermination then comes with
broken treaties all kind of atrocities
and so on we don't have to go through it
the end result the remnants of the level
of massacre is overwhelming there are
remnants they live under deeply
impoverished conditions little
educational opportunity it's another
sector of American society that's not
all poor whites have you know what are
sometimes called white trash that lives
under pretty awful
what about them what about the general
population a study just came out major
study a couple days ago on studying the
quality of work in the United States
we're supposed to be happy at which were
low unemployment take a list of jobs by
hit but you go back to say 1990 about
50% of jobs were above the median you
know sort of relatively the jobs you
could live on almost two-thirds are
below the new jobs that are formed are
precarious low salary service no
benefits yes there are jobs but not jobs
of any decent quality for most of the
population oh that's part of the general
impact the liberal programs that largely
instituted under Reagan extended by
Clinton's and since which have led to
radical concentration of wealth
stagnation or worse for much of the
public majority the population by now
the figures are stunning them 0.1% not
1% 0.1% of the population I have over 20
percent of the wealth half the
population as negative net worth that's
larger than acid you can't if some
emergency takes place among the
realizing that you're stuck the health
system is a international scandal that's
almost twice the cost of comparable
countries with relatively poor outcomes
getting worse in many ways all of these
and here we're talking about the
majority of the population not just
sectors that have had a particularly
brutal history so there's plenty to do
and there are plenty of resources
do it this is the richest country in the
world that has actually incomparable
advantages there's no other country that
has basically a homogeneous population
and culture you can go from Boston to
Los Angeles and think you're in the same
place attack unparalleled agricultural
resources mineral resources scientific
resources achievements many very
progressive achievements which were
unfortunately now under threat the Tecla
public education system mass public
education was an American innovation and
a very very significant one
Mahmut had opened opportunities from
kindergarten to college land-grant
colleges to large masses of the
population in a way which didn't exist
anywhere else
I mean even in England this something
comparable didn't really start until
after the Second World War the United
States it goes back to the 19th century
that's a major Jesus under attack one of
our major achievements is now undersold
efforts to defund marginalize regiment
the public education system this is
pretty shocking well we have the point
as we have the capacity in resources we
have to mobilize them unfortunately
there are growing sectors of the
population mostly young which are
engaged in such efforts you have things
like the Sanders well we only have three
minutes left here and I want to honor
your time and my last question is one
you could talk about for hours but maybe
you could just offer a brief reflection
for a minute or two and it has to do
with how we create change whether it's
once through education what's through
government structure and the
intersection of how you understand human
behavior you know if Marx talked had
thought it was about our socioeconomic
status and Freud about our early
childhood experiences and people like
Spinoza and Einstein you know about our
DNA or our inner disposition how do you
understand what makes people
fundamentally make the choices they make
and how should that account for how we
think about the type of massive society
today well that's a question that can be
answered in three minutes
fact in 30 seconds yeah nobody has a
clue you know we understand at the level
of science at least organized verifiable
knowledge there's very little
understanding of human being in their
fundamental characteristics we know a
good deal about the range of
possibilities that are open to them that
they can exploit but what should they do
that's for them to choose there are
values many of them go way back to
classical times I mentioned a little bit
to go to a modern period the say the
Enlightenment formulated ideals which it
can be pursued one of the leading
theorists of the Enlightenment figures
in the Enlightenment belong to a noble
great humanist a founder of the modern
research university great language to
his conception was that human beings are
born to inquire and create that's the
essence of human nature to explore to
create to investigate and to change to
change the world so that it will meet
those values so when he talked about
very fundamental parts of our existence
like take simply the fact that most
people spend their most of their working
hours under what amount to totalitarian
conditions you go into your workplace
you're under totalitarian rule
of a kind that hotel it's a stolen
inhibitor never even dreamed up but they
didn't tell you with how many minutes
you have to go to the bathroom to talk
to a friend or something like that so to
control your ever promotion home both
talked about of course didn't envision
the industrial age much before that but
he talked about artisan said that if an
artisan creates a beautiful object under
command we may admire what he did but we
despise what he is not a free
independent human being but a serf under
control with others that's the way we
spent a lot of our lives that's not
because people always wanted it that way
to go back to the early Industrial
Revolution American workers had bitterly
objected to this systems domination and
control well those are values that can
be realized - there's many ways in which
we could create a just fair decent
society in which people should be proud
of what they had achieved instead of
disgusted by the oppression and violence
it does he in front of them the choices
in their the means are pretty obvious
I'll have to talk about them it's a
pretty free society you don't get sent
to the gulag if you do what we're doing
right now there are plenty of
opportunities if we can be clear willing
to crush Professor Noam Chomsky thank
you so much for your time and insights
and inspiration wishing you lots of
blessings for a long life and good
health and lots of success in all your
endeavors
