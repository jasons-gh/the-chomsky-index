Kissinger has some really remarkable
lines and what's important about them is
not just that he produced them and that
they led to actions implementing them
but that there's no reaction to it
among the intellectual classes so for
example one at one point and must be in
1971 he calmly transmitted orders from
probably half drunk Richard Nixon to the
US Army and Air Force referring to
Cambodia and the orders were anything
that flies against anything that moves
in rural Cambodia it's pretty hard to
find in the archival record any
statement advocating genocide at that
level of clarity and explicitness and
those orders were carried out with
horrendous effect now all of this
appeared in the new york times when the
Nixon tapes were exposed there was an
article about what was in them mostly
about gossip but if you look closely one
of the things in the revelation was this
order there was no reaction to it that's
the part that's significant that we
ought to think about
