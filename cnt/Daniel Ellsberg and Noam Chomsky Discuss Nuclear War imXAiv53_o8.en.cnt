good evening everyone my name is John
Paul Jones I'm the Dean of the college
of social behavioral sciences and it's a
great pleasure to welcome everyone here
tonight there Howry conversation on
nuclear war and featuring here tonight
of course
senior fellow for the nuclear age Peace
Foundation Daniel Ellsberg of the
intercept editor-in-chief Betsey Reed
and Noam Chomsky laureate professor of
linguistics and Agnes Nelms Harry
chair at the University of Arizona thank
you all for joining us this January my
colleagues in geography hosted a talk by
distinguished climate scientist Alan
robock of Rutgers University he's one of
the leading scientist and strongest
voices for nuclear disarmament and he
and his colleagues have demonstrated
that even an imited nuclear war would
would abruptly change the climate and
starve billions of people in nuclear
winter and yet everyone in this room has
lived their entire life under the threat
of nuclear war their entire adult life
we're not all activists so how did we
manage the psychic stress of living in
the nuclear age through work perhaps or
social or familial diversions or perhaps
resignation or complacency or perhaps we
came to trust that our political and
military leaders have built and
maintained well-designed institutional
and technological safeguards against
catastrophe if that's your answer then
you haven't read Daniel Ellsberg's new
book the doomsday machine
it is a harrowing first-person look into
the manifold contingencies of nuclear
war planning we might be lucky but we
are not secure so when valaria Chomsky
offered to facilitate Daniel Ellsberg's
visit to Tucson to talk with Noam I was
delighted and I'm very grateful Thank
You valaria
and now a few other thanks first to the
outstanding professionals from the
College of Social and Behavioral
Sciences and tech and development and
outreach and marketing and communication
to our long-term partners Arizona public
media and to Peggy Johnson in the law
cinema where daniel ellsberg will appear
for a special event tomorrow evening and
forth to michael bloom in SBS alum and
CEO of first look media the parent
organization of the intercept Michael
took an interest in this project and
shared with us the talented author and
journalist Betsey Reed who will moderate
tonight's discussion the intercept is
live streaming tonight's conversation to
a worldwide audience not last I want to
thank the AG nice nomes Howry program in
environment and social justice for for
first supporting Nome position here at
the University of Arizona and second for
sponsoring tonight's Howry conversation
mrs. Harry's work on behalf of
international peace lives on through
tonight's event and now I'd like to
invite former dean of aua College of Law
Regents professor and chair of the Howry
program Advisory Council tony Massaro to
introduce tonight's panel
[Applause]
this program is entirely consonant with
the future that we want to leave to the
next generations and that's a big thing
that the hary program is about how to
find the courage and the creativity and
the political will to make a better
world for those who come after us with
special attention to how academic
institutions and community actors can
link arms in authentic partnerships this
is the land-grant mission writ large and
today's topic strikes deep into our
concern about the future the possibility
of not having won tonight's program also
is consonant with the spirit of mrs.
Harry
she had a keen intellect she believed in
questioning conventional knowledge and
she was committed to free and open
debate of important matters of public
concern mrs. Harry would have been right
in front leaning forward with her
piercing blue eyes and afterwards she
would gently but firmly buttonhole every
member of this panel at the close of the
talk and ask important questions tonight
you have all of you the unique privilege
of hearing three people engage about the
threats of nuclear war given the global
advances in the creation and possession
of this doomsday machine first we have
our own feels very good to say that
professor Noam Chomsky dr. Chomsky is
considered the father of modern
linguistics he's a towering figure in
analytical philosophy and one of the
founders of the field of cognitive
science I love this story I can't resist
at age 10 he writes his first article
the topic the spread of fascism
following the fall of Barcelona to
Francisco Franco's forces
this is exactly what all 10 year-olds
are thinking about one of his earliest
memories consisted of watching security
officers beat women's strikers outside
of a textile plant the memory of
injustice in the apprehension of fascism
shaped him forever thereafter and this
always wedded with an uncommon intellect
and the ability to see things anew as he
once described what true science is it's
the willingness to be puzzled by simple
things he has that spark which has
enabled him to forge new fields and to
speak out eloquently on many topics of
urgent concern he received his PhD from
Patton he then was recruited to MIT
his first book opposed the dominant
approach to the study of linguistics and
has been described as a revolution in
1959 he published a critique of verbal
behavior and challenged the author's
entire view of language which cemented
his academic reputation is one of the
most creative path-breaking and
intellectually daring people in his
field also one of the most prolific I'm
pretty sure he's a hologram he's
authored over a hundred works since and
he remains amazingly productive but of
course dr. Chomsky did not stay in his
academic linguistics Lane oh no he was
an outspoken anti Vietnam War veteran
were activist he wrote multiple pieces
on the abuses of the US military
overseas and he participated in many
protests some of which ended with his
arrest he wrote manufacturing consent a
really powerful critique of government
propaganda he spoke up early and often
and still not everybody loved what he
had to say he was named to President
Richard and Nixon's enemies list you can
see that this deterred him
he continued to publicly and vigorously
oppose military interventions from the
Reagan administration's interventions in
South America to the war on terrorism
but he also maintained the apprehension
first expressed at age 10 about fascism
and in particular he objects to the way
in which repressive regimes right and
left suppress discourse he's a
passionate defender of free speech even
those he would go so far as to defend
the right of a Holocaust denier to
espouse anti factual views for all of
this he's earned countless honors and
accolades which he calls absurd but his
name is in indispensable and enduringly
significant adjective in the field of
linguistics to be chomskyan is to signal
something a distinctive approach to
language and thought almost no
intellectuals leave such a deep and
distinctive mark on their fields so
there are many honors for the work but
here I can't resist with the wink and a
nod to our own red and blue and beloved
Sonoran Desert
some have been heard to say that his
greatest achievement is joining us
others would say not really there's a
species of bees named for mr. Chomsky
that's pretty cool also suffice it to
say we're very happy that he's here
among us and that you thought of this
program for us tonight mr. Chomsky thank
you so much and now his friend and
co-conspirator Daniel Ellsberg former
consultant to the Department of Defense
in the White House responsible as
everyone knows for the release of the
Pentagon Papers
senior fellow of the nuclear age Peace
Foundation he earned his degree in
economics from Harvard and then attended
Cambridge for a year studying on a
Woodrow Wilson fellowship and he went
back to Harvard to complete his graduate
studies in 1954 he enlisted in the
Marines
mr. Ellsberg was discharged in 1957 as a
first lieutenant and went back to
Harvard as a junior fellow for two years
his PhD dissertation was rooted in
decision theory which is a branch of
economics related to game theory his
work gave rise to what's now known as
the Ellsberg paradox basically people
prefer the devil they know and we'll
take a known risk with low chances of
winning over an unknown risk that could
guarantee a win and the paradox has
given rights to a large body of
scholarship another intellectual who
became an adjective he worked at the pin
in the Pentagon and then overseas in
Vietnam and on his return he contributed
to the top-secret study that became with
respect to the conduct of the Vietnam
War that became known as the Pentagon
Papers he grew this increasingly
disillusioned with the war and he says
that upon meeting a draft resister named
Randy Keller
he had a life-changing reaction quote it
wasn't what he said that changed my
worldview it was the example I was
setting with his life how his words in
general showed he was a stellar American
and he was going to jail as a very
deliberate choice and there was no
thought no question in my mind that our
government was involved in an unjust war
that was going to continue and get
larger thousands of men were dying each
year and I left the auditorium and found
a deserted men's room and wept for over
an hour that's the only time in my life
I've reacted to anything like that
he began producing copies of the
Pentagon Papers thereafter and you know
the rest of the story in 1971 the New
York Times published the first of nine
excerpts he was charged with violation
of the Espionage Act but all charges
eventually dismissed you know - that the
publication of the papers sparked a
furor that helped to contribute to the
end of the war and the diminishing
support for it it also resulted in as a
teacher of the First Amendment I mean
I'm very proud to meet you and say
a canonical case by the United States
Supreme Court that to this day protects
freedom of the press his latest book is
doomsday machine I commend it to you
these are his words sober bipartisan
messages about the American presidency
if you can't handle the thought that the
president lies to the public for all
kinds of reasons you couldn't stay at
government at that level or you're made
aware of it one week
the fact is presidents rarely say the
whole truth essentially they never say
the whole truth of what they expect and
what they're doing and what they believe
this historic conversation we're
extremely lucky tonight is going to be
monitored moderated you try to monitor
that well good luck with that bye miss
Betsey Reed editor-in-chief of the
intercept this is an online news source
dedicated to what it calls adversarial
journalism here's what she believes she
believes in transparency and government
institutions in her eyes her role as a
journalist is to create a shift
government incorporations she's written
have a penetrating gaze on all of us and
they're gathering all this information
and they're allowed privacy and secrecy
so she believes her job is to turn that
around and apply some transparency to
them she's written several books
editorial contributions to Blackwater
and dirty wars she's talked about
written about the private military
industry the Obama administration use of
drones
she's been editor for the essay
collection going rogue Sarah Palin an
American nightmare which examined the
effect of Palin's vice-presidential run
on politics she also worked at the
nation which has a long and storied
history of progressive politics but his
read believes that the magazine was
preaching to the choir so she made the
jump to the intercept because that's not
associated with particular political
leaning or silos she believes that the
intercept is a way to make a difference
to reach a wider audience like the one
tonight please join me in welcoming
three people who share a passion for
discovery and communication of matters
of urgent public concern people who are
human adjectives and agitators who seek
disclosure of things that have been both
intentionally buried and that hides in
plain view before our eyes
often clouded bipartisan cataracts
[Applause]
can everybody hear us yes so I'm
delighted to be here with the father of
modern whistle blowing and and professor
Chomsky and I think it's the first time
the two of you have sat on a public
stage together even though you've had a
dialogue for some 40 years as friends
and co-conspirators and one thing I
think is extraordinary is that you then
really sat in the belly of the beast and
and and and you professor Chomsky are
the foremost critic of that beast of
American Empire so we're just thrilled
to be able to see you in in dialogue in
public for the first time tonight so I
want to start with Dan Ellsberg relating
to your book the the the doomsday
machine the Pentagon Papers is your most
famous contribution to American history
but at the same time that you were
collecting the thousands of documents
that were then leaked about the Vietnam
War
you were also collecting thousands of
other documents right which you've
written about now for the first time can
you tell us a story what of what those
documents mean why did it take almost 50
years to get them out and are they still
relevant to the youth the world today
mm-hmm
well at that very good introduction here
of all of us been mentioning my book she
mentioned the name of the title the
doomsday machine but didn't give the
subtitle confessions of a nuclear war
planner and when I chose that title it
really was more rhetorical in a way you
know I thought attention-getting and so
forth but in the course of writing
finishing it and rereading a lot of my
old work and so forth I realized there
was more to confess than I had started
out by thinking it was a more serious
confession as he's in the book in fact
people used to think that I had given
the Pentagon Papers out of guilt and I
would always say no my feeling was not
guilt it was one
responsibility I was trying to help into
war and I felt that I participated in it
and that gave me a special
responsibility once I realized how wrong
it was I smell hopeless him wrongful it
was to try to end it and so it wasn't
something that I feel particularly
guilty about it my wife used to say
Patricia you know and she'd hear me and
you should feel more guilty than you do
as I as I think no would but in fact
soon after I started copying for which I
expected to be charged with counts that
would send me to prison for life and in
fact it was 12 felony counts for
possible 115 years in prison but having
started that I realized it was really
more important it seemed to me to inform
the world about nuclear matters the
dangers of the nuclear era and I had in
my safe thousands of pages of notes and
estimates and files that I had written
over the years that I worked on nuclear
war planning in I had been a specialist
in the command and control of nuclear
weapons starting in the Pacific and then
elsewhere the possibilities of
unauthorized action and the
possibilities of the effects of accident
things like that and that got me into
looking at the war plans I probably read
more war plans in the in the Pacific
Command then any civilian had been given
access to as far as I ever knew and as a
result I was in once the Kennedy
administration was in I was given the
task of rewriting the Eisenhower
guidance for the war plans that had
prevailed through the 50s and into early
61 and what I wrote eventually became
Secretary of Defense McNamara's guidance
to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for the
annual operational war plan for general
war for general nuclear war and that's
but a lot of this book is about I had a
lot of notes on that and so forth and I
really copied everything in my top
secret safe that was something that I
didn't tell anyone until this book came
out really except my one main lawyer not
the other lawyers and not my wife
actually at the time I didn't want to
implicate her in it or my co-defendant
Tony Russo and or even the other lawyers
so none of them knew that I had done
this and really I missed some of what
was said here in the introduction
because it is my left ear and I didn't
get all that but I don't know if she
mentioned I heard her talking yes about
when I went in the men's room and wept
about Randy Keeler I don't know if she
used the name did she uh who was a young
man who was on the way to prison for
graft resistance actually for simply
telling his draft board that he would
not no longer cooperate with giving his
address change of entrance to the draft
board that's all it took to go to prison
for a twenty year old or 19 year old in
those days and as she said I was
thunderstruck by this I had just gotten
an impression of him as of an exemplary
young American or was at a conference of
the war resisters International with
people from all over the world and I had
been thinking I'm glad they get to see
it a chance in the Vietnam War that they
get a chance to see an American like
this and as I was thinking those
thoughts I was hearing him saying that
he was going to join his other
colleagues from the men from the war
resisters League office in San Francisco
in prison there would be only women left
the others were in prison and he said oh
I'm happy that I'm about to be joining
him then and I hadn't known that that
was in prospect and I was totally struck
by it and as she said I went to a men's
room I cried for a long time at what my
country had come to in fact there's a
there's a Leonard Cohen song dress
rehearsal rag actually what a guy who's
about to commit suicide but the chorus
of it is
his poem is so it's come to this
it's come to this and wasn't it a long
way down and wasn't it a strange way
down and I thought this is my country
now where my 13 year old son is bound
for prison because that's the best thing
that these young men can do against the
war and I suspect he will do it too and
actually the war was still on five years
later when he became 18 and he did turn
in his draft card but I I cried as I
said at the thought of where my country
was and then when I got up from that I
thought okay now what can I do to help
shorten the war now that I'm ready to go
to prison and actually copying the
Pentagon Papers were not the first thing
I thought of doing because they were
history they ended in 1968 is now 1969 a
new president a new Nixon he claims
during the campaign he was going to end
the war it wasn't clear that this
history would really do very much and I
tried other things to get Democrats to
do which they were not willing to do
that's another story not for tonight but
in the end I felt okay this is a history
of 7,000 pages of Lies and crimes and
broken treaties deception of the public
aggression essentially and maybe it will
help to get it up well that's as I say a
story I don't want to go into tonight
because we have a new subject of the
nuclear war but having started that I
then decided okay I'll copy all the top
contents of my top secret safe and and
put that out but what I was leading up
to or I said I did see Randy Keeler in
San Francisco on his way to prison
basically you went there a little after
and I told him what I was going to do oh
he was the only person I can think of I
told that not Tony Russo my helpfully
copy by the way when as I say later my
chief lawyer but I wanted him to know
that he'd had an effect on me you know
and that to know that when he went to
prison it had not been without effect he
was a model for me so he said forget the
pen at the Vietnam papers it would call
the Pentagon Papers yet we know enough
about Vietnam as as know was saying to
me this afternoon you know it didn't
reveal all that much that was not known
to critics of the war what it revealed
was that what the critics were saying
was well known to insiders and they they
understood it but they were going they
weren't going on
despite that in consciousness of it but
despite it so that was the secret in
Hawaii but as Randy said the nuclear
papers are much more important put those
out forget the Viet Nam's front and my
answer was I agree with you the nuclear
papers are more important but Vietnam is
where the bombs are falling right now
and I've got to do what I can to try to
shorten that and when they've when that
is one that of course like I didn't know
it that even fact meant after my first
trial or during my first trial then I'll
put out the nuclear papers and I knew
that would put me in prison forever for
sure well as you mentioned I gave her
implied I gave him to my brother
separately for safekeeping and he
briefly it's in the book put them in a
wooden box inside a green garbage bag
and buried them in the town dump in
Tarrytown and in a bluff
over a road and with a green stove on
top of it
happened to be there that he couldn't
move but it was there and that would
mark where he buried the documents so
fine so during the that very summer when
I was on trial and indicted by that time
he informed me that tropical storm Doria
hurricane had hit New York and had moved
the stove a hundred yards
and the the bluff had gone down over the
over the side of the road and they were
searching for it though but I was I was
sure that with his searching he would he
would find these and I didn't worry too
much about it because he was working
every weekend to just find it he had
someone actually who used the dowsing
rod in parts on weekends and they got a
backhoe at one point to shovel up the
contents of the dump and they found a
lot of garbage bags but not one with
top-secret documents inside so
eventually it became clear by the end of
my trail they were gone and the answer
to your try H to your question is when
the war ended I did summarize really the
first third of this book you know the
story about my but I'd file from the war
plans and the dangers and was told by a
publisher with about nuclear and without
documents she said this'll sell 1400
copies so I said well that's one for
every member of Congress and just
journalists and some academics okay fine
she said no that means we won't publish
it and that was basically true for for
really the last 40 years now pretty much
I've done various things in the course
of arrests for civil disobedience I've
testified under oath to the lot of the
contents that was in that book actually
in hope that doing it under oath would
get a little attention for some of the
things they'll talk about tonight but it
didn't and I think that the lack of
documents was critical to that but this
very book was turned down by 17
publishers a few years ago and
Bloomsbury finally took it up so this
was not a subject that readers were
anxious to you know that this would not
make the book fly off the shelves but
you were able to obtain the documents
that were lost through yes well now when
you say over time actually a lot of the
documents have become Declassified now
Freedom of Information Act suits and the
National Security Archive of
the university has gotten a lot of these
out including some of the most sensitive
stuff but not not everything that I had
and so that helps at least establish
that you know what I'm telling is in
basis I was afraid that people would
would challenge this in reviews you know
what does he know it's 50 years ago and
things have all changed and no one has
said that because all the evidence is
from insiders as well it hasn't changed
that nothing essentially has changed so
the risks are there in fact the the
response of those who have read it is
pretty good I wanted to ask professor
Chomsky I mean you have written
extensively about the period that is
covered in Dan Ellsberg book did you
learn anything from it what did you find
anything new I agree with Randi Keller
that this book I think which is a
central reading I do strongly recommend
that you read it is actually more
important than releases the Pentagon
Papers that was a major contribution but
this I think that was even beyond and
the topics that are in the book are
issues that I've been studying working
on for 70 years I thought I knew a lot
about it but I did learn from the book
and things that I learned were
hair-raising so for example I learned
and did not know that during the
Eisenhower period and basically carried
on that was one war plan and the war
plan was that if there was a
confrontation with the Russians in
Berlin whatever may be a small
confrontation then immediately we wipe
out every city in China I mean the
enormity of that idea it takes a while
to sink yet
there was no alternative plan that was
the plan then tried to develop
alternative plans but something like
that remains another discover other
things kind of confirmed surmises that I
couldn't really establish but I had the
sense all through the forties fifties
sixties and on that the scale of the
alleged Russian threat was being greatly
exaggerated and it turns out from what
dad released that the estimates of
Russian ground forces were wildly
exaggerated the bomber gap didn't exist
the missile gap did exist but as then
published it was in our favor and the
huge buildup of armaments on the US side
and the fear mongering and population
control that was involved was based on I
can't say fraud because people actually
believed it but on gross Mis estimates
which themselves I think can only be
explained by ideological commitments
that compelled interpretation of data in
a extremely negative fashion some of
some of this you could figure out just
by reading the documents but the the
confirmation from the inside is
extremely important and that led to
another revelation in the book that I
found extremely shocking it turns out
that after the fraud the falsity you'll
recall the missile gap the when Kennedy
was elected there was he was claiming
that in fact they and the Air Force
actually didn't round agreed that there
was the Russians were way ahead of us
missiles weapons and could wipe us out
at no time soon it was exposed and then
was instrumental in exposing it and
after it was exposed
he points out in the book policies
continued with no change it turned out
that we were far ahead of the Russians
in armaments in technology they had
literally no deterrent but the policies
of that were based on assuming massive
Russian overwhelming force ready to an
intent to conquer the world after that
was all exposed as untrue the program's
remained we continued to follow exactly
the same programs and that continues
until today this is a an example which I
hadn't known of something that you do
find I think when you look through the
record carefully there's almost we're
told all the time that everything has to
be done in the name of security but
which find is that security at least
security of the population that just is
not a concern it's so low on the ranking
that you can't even find it in the
records and this is another kind of
striking confirmation of that there are
other examples another revelation which
is almost unpronounceable and five words
for Dan discovered he he demand he
requested answers to certain questions
which had never parently been asked such
as in the one Bork general war plan that
exists how many people they expect to be
killed when it's carried out turns out
maybe a billion you know if you think it
through
come as he says in the book how can even
how can people even dream of having a
war plan like this and it could the war
could be set up just by inadvertence
there's case after case many are
discussed in the book where we came
extremely close the war just by
inadvertence sometimes reckless actions
on the part of leaders but sometimes
just accidents that happen so one
example that I didn't know that comes
out in the book is with when the first
early warning system was established to
detect incoming missiles which would
have been 1958 I guess 60 yeah turns out
in this new sophisticated system to
detect incoming missiles in the first
week of operation or stay when they
evaporate started on the first day of
operation it detected a Russian missile
attack with 99.9 percent certainty first
day of operation and fortunately nobody
paid attention but but that kind of
thing happens over and over and the war
plans are set up so that if somebody
acts on that 99 percent a billion people
died
I mean this is what we've been living
with for 70 years and are continuing to
live with today and bear in mind that
the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists the
Doomsday Clock that they established in
1947 shortly after the first the atom
bombing in Japan the Doomsday Clock I'm
sure most of you know sets the men of
hand a certain distance from midnight
midnight means terminal disaster for the
species at the beginning 47 it was said
at 7 minutes to midnight it's kind of
oscillated up and back since then
the closest
it came to midnight was in 1953 when the
United States and then Soviet Union
exploded thermonuclear weapons and one
of the things I learned from the book is
that the there was an expectation on the
part of US scientists probably Russian
scientists that the thermonuclear
weapons might set the whole atmosphere
on fire and destroy everything they
thought it was a pretty low probability
but not zero and it turns out some of
the estimates that then reviews in the
book are everything but and in fact they
miss s at they miscalculated the impact
by a factor of three I think it was and
but and then the minute hand went to two
minutes to midnight it's never gotten
that close again until last January when
it was moving when President Trump was
inaugurated it went to two and a half
minutes to midnight last January went to
two minutes to midnight I think if they
had had a chance to look at the Nuclear
Posture review which came out a couple
months later they might move it forward
what you think about that but this is
what we've been living with on the page
after page of the book contains graphic
examples of this kind of you can only
call it insanity and in fact n at one
point describes the book as a chronicle
of human madness which I think captures
the character of the era that we've been
living with very accurately and we
should bear in mind that this is only
one of two existential threats the other
which is run in parallel fact through
the same years is another dramatic
illustration of human men
the threat of global warming is
extremely serious it's not far off right
this generation is going to have to
decide whether to deal with it seriously
and we have this astonishing phenomenon
amazing phenomenon of the most powerful
country in world history which is
refusing to participate in global
efforts to address the crisis and worse
than that is dedicated to accelerating
the crisis it's really hard to find
words even to describe this but it's
another testimony to human madness
alongside but then record so fully and
eloquently in doomsday machine and one
point in the book and mentions that this
seems to be a species pathology
something about the species and I think
that's something to think about it's
very dramatic in fact if you look
there's a lot of information looking
back into the history of the human
species which suggests that somehow
there's a lethal streak in the species
of extraordinary savagery but just
sometimes control sometimes breaks out
and shows up in what then rightly calls
a chronicle of human madness we received
some questions from the audience
ahead of this event and a lot of them
centered on Trump for understandable
reasons there's a lot of fear that that
was something was talked about in the
campaign in him having his finger on the
button this spectacle of the nuclear
football and of course that is
terrifying and combined with his foreign
policy approach but one thing you write
about in your book is the the phenomenon
of the the
sub delegation of authority to to
actually initiate a nuclear strike I
thought maybe you could one
qualification to the idea of the finger
on the button is another revelation in
the book which is pretty shattering
turns out it's not a finger on the
button it's lots of fingers on the right
that's Eisenhower President Eisenhower
as part of the his enquiries actually
led to the discovery of this fact the
revelation of it that President
Eisenhower had had delegated sub
delegated authority to launch a nuclear
war to the main the the major figures
the Admirals and head of SAC I mean the
main Admirals they had the authority to
launch a nuclear war and the logic was
compelling if the logic was that if
Washington was suddenly destroyed in a
nuclear attack somebody had to retaliate
so therefore it was sub delegated but as
the influence out there was a problem in
that logic the problem is that every one
of the people to whom authority was sub
delegated followed the same logic
suppose I'm wiped out I better have
other people down there who were have
the authority to launch a nuclear war
and it turns out when you look at the
details that even bomber pilots said
during the who were flying b-52s over
half the world during the Cuban Missile
Crisis had the possibility of launching
a nuclear war and the chances are that
none of that has changed so it isn't
really a finger on the button is bad
enough but it's the reality is much
worse and of course the idea that the
person with the biggest finger is a
Littlefinger totally doesn't make
anybody every size figure so he is a
remember nobody bigger bigger than he
noticed the president's hands were not
unusually small but big enough for the
for the but it says it's his button
that's bigger remember what he said it's
good for kim jong on my button is bigger
than I guess I don't know what you think
you presume that other nuclear powers
have the same system that other nuclear
powers have the same oh yeah so
delegation and I think no no nuclear
power probably well certainly not the
major when certainly not Russia allows
themselves to be paralyzed by a single
bomb on Moscow let's say or on
Washington so they've made arrangements
and my guess is very strong that Kim
jong-un has not allowed it to be
possible to paralyze their retaliatory
power I attack on him either which we
rehearse in fact that's one of the
issues of the summit that I hope will
take place but to address the fact that
we do rehearse invasion of North Korea
every year and assassination of Kim
jong-un and if that's in the belief that
that would decapitate them quote I think
that's probably as false as it is always
been for Russia or the u.s. they've
always made arrangements that other
people will have both Authority and
capability to retaliate in that case
whether you know when you were saying
you started to say that here we are with
the second existential problem of
climate but you certify and we're not
even negotiating and are taking part in
discussions in fact we're going in the
wrong direction I actually thought you
were going to end the sentence
differently when I heard it the fact
that this last summer a hundred and
twenty two nations you know that signs
you know in a treaty prohibiting nuclear
weapons now that is not likely to affect
the bay
Denine nuclear states very quickly if at
all but very striking me and this is
what I thought you were about to comment
on the u.s. refused to participate even
in the discussion of this and in fact
used every kind of muscle it had to keep
other its other allies successfully from
even participating in the discussion of
eliminating nuclear weapons which we are
bound by article six of the
non-proliferation treaty going back to
68 and 69 nineteen we have a treaty
commitment you know the supreme law
basically ratified by the Senate that
says we will take part in we will
negotiate in good faith for the
elimination of nuclear weapons on the
one hand we are in no such negotiations
whatever you know at this time but
second there really has never been a day
since 1968 when any American leader in
good faith thought about eliminating
nuclear weapons with the possible
exception of the of the brief discussion
between Gorbachev and Reagan actually at
Reykjavik where even where I think
Reagan was amazingly enough we didn't
know from outside but he was abhorrence
of nuclear war nuclear weapon he didn't
sound that way but he was apparently and
he did have some discussion of
eliminating the only one that's ever
been held my knowledge it at almost any
level but what took priority of his mind
was the air bubble the idea that there
would be as Star Wars a Strategic
Defense Initiative SDI that would
protect us from any nuclear weapons
altogether and he he could not give up
the idea of space-based tests which
would abrogate the anti-ballistic
missile treaty so he always had like
every other president a higher priority
than reducing the threat of the doomsday
machine and that's been true for all the
presidents so to get back to your
question but see it your original
question if this didn't start with Trump
it has attracted people's attention and
that in itself is a good thing
if it if the world doesn't blow up as a
result people are thinking about it now
because Trump has scared them the way
that Reagan scared them of course will
help build mobilize the freeze movement
but back in the 80s but it didn't start
with jumping it won't end with Trump as
I say no every president is engaged in
some discussion of possible imminent use
of nuclear weapons mostly in secret from
the American public and sometimes in
public like what you point out about
Iran that every candidate with the
acceptance of deception of Dennis
Kucinich and Ron Paul yes I said with
regard to it 1% that all options are
open meaning nuclear weapons as an
option incidentally that's even those
statements are in violation of
international law they take a look at
the UN Charter the foundation of modern
international law article 2.4 core parts
as bans the threat or use of force in
international affairs we're constantly
every president every candidate with
those minor exceptions has violated this
by calling by spite threatening the use
of unlimited force including nuclear
weapons in the case of Iran and there's
a lot to say about this particular case
but it's another example if we look into
the details if this time we could of how
the United States is basically alone in
undermining a very constructive approach
to whatever threat anybody thinks here
on mypos we will not permit it this is a
critical fact which ought to be very
prominently discussed I don't know if
there's time to go into it people ask
whether and what worried them is that we
have a president that they think might
use nuclear weapons might actually use
well they're missing the point I in fact
I haven't heard anyone say he is using
them he has used them he says even the
way that every president has actually
not just Trump but use it the way you
use a gun when you pointed at somebody's
head in a confrontation whether or not
you pull the trigger you're using a gun
in fact that's a major person reason why
people with guns have them who use them
at 7-elevens or wherever mugging
well they hope they'll get their way
without having to pull the trigger but
and we haven't pulled the trigger but in
a way coming to the with the number of
threats that have been made many secrets
from the American public not from the
people who received the threats as in
the case of Vietnam under Nixon now what
Trump is doing is saying rather publicly
unusually actually we haven't had that
he is threatening fire and fury it's
interpreted as nuclear weapons or at
least a conflict it will likely escalate
by one side or the other to nuclear once
it gets started it's a conflict that
must not get started I would say
absolutely not under any conditions
because this is the first president
since the Cuban Missile Crisis 55 years
ago to make direct threats of armed
conflict against a nuclear weapons a
state that has nuclear weapons most of
these other threats we made against
North Vietnam or Iran earlier as you're
mentioning and Korea and others did not
have nuclear weapons Soviet Union did in
1962 and later but North Korea does have
nuclear weapons and the smallest attack
on North Korea is likely to lead to
counter actions that would lead one side
of the other to be using nuclear weapons
and that would mean a two sided nuclear
war for the first time in history and it
wouldn't be one that ends most life on
Earth like a war with Russia because we
don't have enough cities a rather North
Korea doesn't have enough cities to burn
we
haven't talked about nuclear winter here
particularly but that's a major aspect
of my book and they don't have enough
weapons to burn our cities to cause
smoke that will cause mass famine but it
will be more violence than the world has
ever seen in a day or a week or a month
millions of people dead
so it's of extreme importance that that
not happened but I'm just saying Trump
in this instance is doing publicly what
other presidents like Nixon did
privately in 69 threatening using the
nuclear weapons to threat yeah well
actually then and the book has a list of
25 cases where the threat of nuclear
weapons has in fact been used in actual
crises and as he says it's very much
like walking into a store with a loaded
gun and robbing the store when you're in
fact using the gun even if you don't
shoot it then this is constant
furthermore it's worth bearing in mind
that this continues after the collapse
of the Soviet Union so in 1995 of the
Clinton administration came out with one
of those shocking documents I've ever
read
that's the Strategic Command which is in
control of nuclear weapons published a
document called essentials of cult post
Cold War deterrence and that should
really be read it's a public diets may
been made public essentials of post Cold
War deterrence that what it says is that
we must maintain for the the right of
first strike four first strike meaning
devastating use of nuclear weapons and
we must make maintain arts our nuclear
weapons system because it nuclear
weapons cast their shadow over any
crisis meaning as long as others know we
have this and we might use it that you
as an advantage in any crisis and then
it goes on to develop the first time
I've seen an official document what's
known as the madman theory it goes on to
say that we must create a national
persona of being irrational and
vindictive and possibly out of control
so that US will really be terrified of
us and we must and that this isn't 1995
this is Clinton not from further under
it's after the collapse of the Soviet
Union an indication of the of what Dan
points out repeatedly in the book it's
an institutional problem it's not
particularly it's an deep institutional
problem and when he mentions at one
point a species problem I think that's
something to think about too you know
it's good you picked that up I'm not
sure I I quoted that in the book
remember I think not it was what I was
talking as I was so depressed as to how
much I had to leave out of his book yeah
I wanted to put in and that's one of the
examples and it would have been very
very pertinent now of course when I
wrote the book I didn't have Trump in
mind actually but Trump is you know
openly using this notion of
unpredictability impulsiveness temper or
whatnot to make himself more look more
dangerous to other people that is other
adversaries and it was been noted that
that was the Nixon madman theory which I
talk about in the book though which was
not known at the time that he had that
in mind it was revealed by HR Haldeman
later when Haldeman was in prison and
published his memoir for lawyers fees
and whatnot in reveal this madman theory
well Nixon had gotten it he said from
Eisenhower essentially in in Korea and
in other words it's pervaded the thing
something I'm not sure whether a I said
as clearly as I might have in the book I
am maybe or not but it's just that
our policy especially in NATO pointing
nuclear first use directly at Russia has
always been a threat of an insane action
you know it would destroy even when the
Russians didn't have many ICBMs against
the u.s. we thought they did but they
didn't they had hundreds of missiles
pointed at your short-range missile
medium-range missiles bombers everything
if we had carried out our commitment to
NATO virtually from the very beginning
starts you know around forty nine but
but the nuclear part of it doesn't get
to be the core of it till the early
fifties by the early 50s the core of our
NATO commitment was and remains first
use if necessary and it was assumed it
would be necessary against Russian
conventional forces which were thought
to be overwhelming well that was at a
time when the Russians by that time
already had the ability to annihilate
West Europe with what they had it was
kind of a suicide pact
not at first for us but for Europe and
in job in that sense
I'd say it's we've been relying on a
madman theory from the entire NATO of up
till the day now West Germany or Germany
I should say is no longer worried about
invasion but we've extended NATO to the
Baltics you know do only on the edge of
Russia - there's talk the Republicans
wanted order of Ukraine and Georgia
coming in on the borders of Russia - in
2008
like now in Poland already yeah so what
does that mean - to be threatening first
use it means to be threatening to blow
up and we haven't gotten to this but
certainly Europe let's just talk about
that at first Europe gets annihilated so
it's been mad from the very beginning
let me add a little concrete detail to
it and almost quoting earlier about what
I discovered when I asked when I drafted
the question which was given by Ken
in his in the name of Kennedy by his
actual assistant for national security
for the Joint Chiefs and that was if
your plan the existing plans the
Eisenhower plan in 61 our carried out as
planned hit the targets you have in mind
how many people will die in the USSR in
China now I won't go into the reasons
that are in the book why I narrowed it
just to the USSR in China but I did it
was actually in the belief that
amazingly enough I thought but I'd been
told they didn't have an answer to that
well I was wrong
and people have told me that were wrong
because they did have an answer and they
gave it without apology
within days to the White House and it
was top secret it's on the second page
of my book erection top secret sensitive
eyes only for the president and I was
seeing it because I've written the
question so in the White House I was
shown their answer and the answer was in
the form of a chart with a simple linear
model of a rising line from the vertical
axis a rising line one numbers of dead
though it was writing over six months
because radioactive fallout would
increase the deaths and I've often asked
I can say what answers when I've asked
this what do you what do you think they
told the president and I could do that
tonight the lights are in my eyes but
I've asked you very actually just the
other night I got a unusually low answer
a hundred thousand said well no it's
higher than that but rather commonly
people will say ten million our 1
million ten roots it's higher and so the
answer was 325 million people if we
struck first so they had an answer it
clear they had a model and so I drafted
the question in the White House office
and send it back down okay how many
altogether will be killed
and that came back quickly - without
without apology or embarrassment or
anything else and it was in the form of
a table and a cello was in the book so
but to fill out because what he was
saying another hundred million would be
killed in the captive nations slave
nation of East Europe Hungary Bulgaria
Romania and so for the East Germany East
Germany a hundred million from their air
defenses attacks on those air bases or
not they had to hit the air bases there
in praevia they didn't hit the cities in
East Europe that the air bases were all
nitrous cities and the air defenses were
annexed the city so a hundred million
would be killed in addition to the 325
million in the USSR in China and then
another hundred million in contiguous
areas to the Soviet Union and China like
neutrals like Afghanistan Austria
Finland Japan a neutral India so a
hundred million there from radioactive
fallout and without another or head
landing on West Europe naturally from
our attack a hundred million of our
allies would be killed by radioactive
fallout from East Europe and the Soviet
Union depending on which way the wind
blew and supposedly dependent which
depended on the season but that added up
there to 600 million or a hundred
Holocaust so I thought this is familiar
as Norma said the answer is how do you
there's no language
he's the linguist here there's no
language in human experience first
before they like that renter was before
nuclear winter was understood that's
before I guess before a nuclear winter
I'm gonna come to that but you know we
comment on with you of all people you
know on this question of language
remember this was impossible 75 years
ago or in the millennia before that you
couldn't do that
I would I would put to you and I'll ask
you whether you know we have language
concepts that can really deal with it
crime murder but genocide well that fits
genocide wait a minute this is a humble
humble aside what on the side it's on
the side is done Somerville said but
well it's strict on the side leader at
first not on the side just one third on
the side because here's Wade came out
they weren't including fire and they
never have because they said it's too
hard to calculate and you say what that
was deliberately excluded yeah it's very
well if we do senator warheads you
needed for the same effect okay now they
weren't including fire so as has been
estimated since then like lynnie that
would add at least another several
hundred meetings so you get up to a
billion there and moreover not depending
on which way the wind blew Soviet Union
would with weapons we could not
annihilate people could not tell her
because they're too many of them their
mobile they're hidden
short-range weapons medium-range weapons
they would annihilate West Europe for us
anyway a hundred million our allies so
it would be a billion out of then three
billion population so it would be
one-third of what John Somerville called
on the side which is killing everybody
and however what we didn't know for
another twenty years till nineteen
eighty three twenty two years later when
Sagan turbo tuned several taps came up
with the estimate of having looked at
the question of well weathers fire
there's smoke and how much smoke would
would be generated but what they really
were looking at was not so much how much
would be generated but how much by
nuclear weapons would be lofted into the
stratosphere or it wouldn't rain out
like for example the Gulf or fires when
they put all the oil things on fire that
did not cause what I'm about to say
because it stayed loathe it that rained
it not rained very much came down
nuclear weapons loft the smoke by the
150 million tons possibly of toxic black
soot from cities into the stratosphere
where it doesn't ring out and where it
quickly goes around the globe with him
days and brought some 70% of the
sunlight which it's your freezing
temperatures every night all year and
actually possibly much more than that
freezing all the lakes and rivers and
giving you conditions we haven't seen
since the last ice age but above all
killing all harvests and it turns out in
the last 10 years 11 years since 2007
the studies have shown this lasts a
decade or more but a year is enough to
starve
nearly everyone people some people will
probably live Elam Roebuck at Bryan tomb
tell me in Australia eating fish and
mollusks but it turns out they put it
this way I just thought of it rather
simply if you're hitting 50 or 100
cities or more and that plan hit every
city in Russia at USSR over a hundred
thousand and eighty percent of the
city's over 25,000 and every city in
China all that well if that's hundreds
and hundreds you know maybe a thousand
city if you hit something like a hundred
or two hundred the biggest effect is
going to be not the fire that they
hadn't accounted for but the smoke from
the cities which was never listed among
the effects of nuclear weapons why you
know a blast prompt radiation heat kill
people radio and radioactive fallout
they realized something especially from
the h-bomb
smoke no nobody had figured it for
another 20 years
well that was 35 years ago people have
now told me who are insiders on the plan
and quite authoritative Lee
plans have never reflected this never
taken into account any more than they
take the fire into account which means
that our own attacks that our own attack
would kill nearly everyone and we've
known this for 35 years and the plants
are still there now if you thought of
them as well they're just threats you
know the garden is if it weren't loaded
it'll never go off you can rest easy I
told my wife if I didn't know more than
most people know about the accidents you
were describing the false alarms how
close we've come I wouldn't worry either
but and I could think like other people
with some other people it's been 70
years we haven't had a two-sided nuclear
war since the one-sided one at Hiroshima
so we'll go another 70 another 700
whatever you know it's all right I think
it's been a miracle that we haven't had
a truce at a new pre-war in that period
and it will be another miracle if we go
another 70 years and that doesn't mean
it's impossible it happened but it means
it's very unlikely and we have we have
gotten away with it so far but as
normally saying it's taking a gamble
that when you realize it it's hard to
describe in moral terms you know you
just say immoral evil yes criminal but
these words don't seem am I wrong they
don't seem quite adequate here we're
talking about something that just was
not possible before and most people are
still unaware that it remains possible
35 years after the Cold War and it's
worth bearing in mind that in the face
of all of this understanding which is in
fact shared by maybe not in detail but
in general terms with the a large part
of the political class that's involved
in decision-making in the face of all of
this we are now escalating the danger
so if you take a look at the latest
Nuclear Posture review of the Trump
administration a couple of weeks ago it
lowers the threshold for use of nuclear
weapons and lowers it in a very
dangerous way says we can use nuclear
weapons in response to cyberattack a
cyber attack can be of all kinds and you
don't know where it's coming from
you could be almost anywhere so there
could be some kind of a cyber attack
maybe a tax a little the electrical grid
and we blow up the world okay we destroy
the world including ourselves
it adds new nuclear weapons which are
very dangerous
like submarine-launched tactical weapons
but as was immediately pointed out by
the arms control specialists the country
that's being threatened with those
weapons doesn't know that there are low
yield weapons they can't tell all they
know is the United States is enhancing
the capacity for submarines to have
weapons that maybe are not just warning
weapons but lethal destructive weapons
we're putting the the simple fact of
advancing native to the Russian border
as George Kennan and others pointed out
years ago is virtually asking for
disaster I mean if the Warsaw Pact were
carrying out maneuvers on the Mexican
border we wouldn't tolerate it not in
fact it's unimaginable but we're doing
that in a way which sets up situations
where jet planes jet fighters from the
two sides are buzzing each other
what if they crash all kinds of things
could happen which it's funny you know
when you say that I think of the fact in
Syria today yeah
five
of the nine nuclear powers there's nine
nuclear weapons States five of them are
engaging in conflict in Syria right now
US Russia Britain France and Israel okay
in the air space and in fact if you look
at take Syria the latest missile attack
after the alleged chemical warfare use
alleged remember nobody still knows for
sure what it was was apparently mostly
symbolic my guess is it was probably
coordinated with the Russians because it
seemed to have been designed to avoid
any anything beyond symbolic
significance that they may have hit a
medical research facility and destroyed
it's not quite known but it had
consequences one of the consequences was
that Russia threatened I'm not going to
do it but they threatened to a SAP it
install advanced anti-aircraft and
anti-missile systems in Syria Israel is
not going to tolerate that if they come
in Israel they announced right away and
we'll do it we'll do whatever they can
to destroy them that point they get into
confrontation with Russians what goes on
then what happens at that point I mean
these are playing with fire that point
after point where in fact diplomatic
options are available in North Korea
diplomatic options have been available
for years in Iran there has been a
diplomatic success which is now being
probably in a couple of weeks blown up
and there are many other diplomatic
options which have simply not even been
explored because the US won't allow it
overall there the and the D emphasis on
diplomacy is now becoming a kind of
pathological like the State Department's
have practically been eliminated the
diplomatic services no function just
bigger and bigger weapon knowing very
well what the consequences might be of
even an accidental event of the kind
that has happened hundreds of times in
the last in the past years if this is
not institutional madness as you call it
it's hard to imagine what no how do you
how do you understand no you know we're
how do you understand that it it has
come to this it's come to this you in
other words why how can you understand
at this point in your life well I think
part of the answer is given by kind of
casual mention in your book when you
talk about Los Alamos before the the
nuclear weapons bombing Los Alamos was
the place where they were putting them
the the atom bomb had two phases the one
was the Chicago project where they were
basically making the ammunition the
other was the Los Alamos project where
they were making the gun that used to
fire it
so the Manhattan the Manhattan Project
the cargo part was finished earlier the
Los Alamos component wasn't finished
until the gun went off till the actual
bombing it was known at that time that
the Germans were not making a bomb they
were out of it in fact at the end the
Germans were had or even been occupy
conquered and occupied though Germans
Los Alamos the people at Los Alamos were
the collection of the most brilliant the
humane cultivated educated people that
you could gather in the whole world she
tried to make a collection of such
people it's approximately what you had
at Los Alamos turns out that there was
no discussion at Los Alamos
about what they were doing even after it
was known that the Germans were out of
the war they were focused entirely on
the technical the exciting technical
problem of seeing if this would work
now there's something about us which
allows us to get involved in solving
interesting technical problems within a
framework in which we never asked the
question what's next what's outside it
and I think we're probably all familiar
with this in one at one level of another
but here is a case where it's just a
spectacular example of how the most
remarkable group of people you can
imagine bringing together and isolating
were subordinated to the technical
problem of seeing if this gun would work
and not asking what they were doing in
fact there were questions serious
questions raised like by Leo Gilardi
which comment on but they were raised
from Chicago after their phase of the
enterprise was over these are very
interesting things to contemplate to ask
ourselves what is it about our our
culture our our picture of the world our
understanding that allows us to function
in this fashion you know I very okay
good
good response and I think there's a lot
there I would take issue with one word
you used these men were brilliant
intellectuals scientific it's funny the
word okay I think of my friend and
mentor here as in a class by yourself
know himself the word genius
is something that I apply to people like
these people it los alamos generally
hard sciences or artists musicians
artists a sorcerer and really I only
only one person in the social sciences
that I know I've never said this to you
but I've said it to other people that
that's the word that I use for you I
think you know in social sciences it's a
in a class by yourself but and now
here's something that came to me this
afternoon the word that they were
brilliant among hard scientists among
mathematicians among physicists and
always they were at the top but you said
humane not particularly as individual as
I think they were well you could I'm all
right that's your it's not the way I
would use the word particularly because
let me make a point that for a quite a
while I've had a linguistic semantics
issue with people who taught who use the
word inhuman as a synonym for inhumane
and they use human as a synonym for
humane and I think that's a mistake it's
a misconception it's a it's a wrong
self-image that we have generally have
that to be more human is to be more
decent concerned caring compassionate
truthful all these things actually not I
would say it's not a it's not a joke
it's it may do as him very well as you
know and I'll tell you something ahead
this afternoon from from your from our
discussion together which I loved
we had a several hours which are always
marvelous for me with my ears to nose
lips here so a very good discussion but
I'll tell you something in the head
afterwards I thought of I've been having
a discussion with another friend of mine
who's very much in favor of
evidence-based thinking and supposed to
just feeling and just emotion you know
and so forth ideology Authority and
whatnot no reason rationality I think of
myself in recent years as having belong
very long to
religion of reason of rationality the
Vatican was RAND Corporation actually
with decision theory and rationale my
honors thesis at Harvard was theories of
rational choice under uncertainty and
I've come as I get older and I mean we
can talk tomorrow about this but you
know what we've all learned since we
were 15 what not what what I've learned
I've learned to be much more skeptical
of the degree to which were protected by
rationality and reason because that is
so often so often in the service of a
stakin terrible premises or just
terrible desires you know unless it can
be the people I was with in the office
of Secretary of Defense and we ran were
very very right but we were working on
problems that were making the world more
dangerous while thinking we were doing
the opposite and that's that's not
uncommon it's very common and now okay
I'll tell you what I thought of this
afternoon no it really wasn't
okay no one more capable of intellectual
analysis than you and so really over the
years our information has mainly been a
one-way flow from from known to me
except on a few subjects forehead
personal experience as and it's strictly
not happened to have been having this
argument with somebody about reason and
rationality and the idea of evidence
look the people who had evidence of WMDs
in Iraq no weapons of mass destruction
there was evidence actually and I think
they actually believed what they were
saying that there were WMDs
there weren't any but of course that was
very familiar to me because the Tonkin
Gulf had been an example of a war
started on a false alarm which I happen
to know huh no one could know from
outside but I think the people inside
McNamara and LBJ like myself believed on
August 4th 1964 which was my first day
in the Pentagon
that there had been an attack there was
evidence for it it was not that there
was no evidence was the question what do
you believe and what do you want to
believe and what they said was by the
way was there was unequivocal evidence
as of these WMDs and a years later well
that was a flat line we knew it was
unequip it was equivocal it was
ambiguous there was contradictory
evidence but they believed it for a day
or so until more and more evidence was
accumulating and so forth and that is an
example actually where we started the
bombing on what was effectively a false
alarm and WMDs to the extent that they
really cared about those I think there
was a belief by Cheney and the others
that there must be WMDs here what these
weapons of mass there must be because we
wanted that they had to be there to
justify what we were doing
yeah so it was not that there was no
reason and no analysis but it was based
on these selective evidence you know
okay that's very much like the estimates
of Russian military OHL you want to
believe okay well wait it's a perfect
example if I may say you you mentioned
it but without giving actual figures let
me give you the figure which by the way
you mentioned that I revealed this
actually not I revealed it to the RAND
Corporation yeah but in the Pentagon or
any intelligence you know I was reading
the estimate but I didn't come to them
but here I'll make it brief as I can
it's a great detailed in the book but
the estimates I was working on the idea
of a missile gap at Rand that the
Russians had as everybody all my
colleagues believed very much
superiority of Russian missiles and they
were the first to test an ICBM ours came
considerably leaders are kept collapsing
and whatnot so they were ahead of us
fear they put a satellite up there which
showed that they could you know was
accurate enough for an ICBM and so forth
so there was there was reason to believe
they were ahead of us but then the
estimates became that how much ahead of
us well we had 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs
in 1961 and about 120 Polaris
missiles in range of Russia we had a lot
more than that in a way of planes the
estimate was that they had at least a
hundred and sixty some said 120 but the
Strategic Air Command in August of 1961
when I went out there to discuss the my
draft of the plans I was informed that
the head
Tommy powers of Strategic Air Command
was sure there were a thousand Russian
ICBMs this was in August 1961
well that was much higher than the Air
Force estimate even which was like 160
he was very much higher but a thousand
he believed he was telling that to the
president a month later they discovered
satellites or the corona of the system
and code name just had full coverage of
their sights for the first time then
cloud cover before they've been flying
them for about a year but they didn't
have full coverage they finally had full
coverage and what they turned out the
Russians had were four I see now at 160
and not a thousand but four we had 10
times as many you know I don't know if
you notice I I think I mentioned in the
book that Richard Rhodes is the best and
a Pulitzer Prize winning and deservedly
so
historian of the a-bomb and then the
h-bomb and others 30 or 40 years later
he was saying what we'd said at the time
that the Russians had about 40 well
that's about as many as we had ICBMs
that's 10 times more than they had
actually which meant they had
essentially nothing but anything or a
made public what it had already been
made public that they only had four well
they had a hundred many two bombers that
could reach the United States we had
something like 3,000 armors within range
of Russia and by the way in this year as
you mentioned something that struck you
in the book was I said you know 600
million altogether maybe a billion over
a hundred million of those were Chinese
every city in China was to be hit in the
event of a conflict over Berlin
and actually general Shoop who was the
common man to the Marine Corps and
actually had been he had been the
speaker at my graduation from basic
school and so happened it was the Marine
Corps commandant
he was the Marine Corps commandant and
he was he had the Medal of Honor by the
way because he had conducted the attack
on Tarawa from the beach under alive
Japanese bunker where they had snipers
just keep him from being shot while he
was directing the attack on the beach
anyway a very brave guy later very much
against the Vietnam War by the way okay
so Shoop it's the one person who raises
a question about this plan and they were
all describing at the Joint Chiefs as a
very good plan wonderful it's the
Eisenhower plan that I was modifying
which killed over a hundred million
Chinese and so Shoop is the one person
who said this is not a good plan any
plan that kills a hundred million
Chinese when they have not been part of
the fight it's not a good plan that is
not the American Way but it was the
American plan and it remained so and it
remained so for years thereafter well
the reaction what was the reaction to
troops coming well nothing you know it
just went on Conner is actually the guy
who describes this who was present said
things went on you know it was just
ignored essentially okay look I'll tell
you something I learned in the course of
the book of ready oh no after I'd
written the bulk of the Commodore
we actually are what are running out of
time so I was gonna suggest that you say
whatever you know we haven't said I know
we could go on for four hours and I was
hoping for you know at least a little
sliver of light
[Laughter]
I love reading the transcript I read all
interviews you know and in one case
somebody at the end of the thing said
professor Trotsky do you know any jokes
he said all I know are some George jokes
you've both dedicated your lives in
different ways to activism and I wonder
I mean it does seem like today the the
anti-war left is much more focused on on
various other threats on you know the
destruction of Yemen and and and all of
the sort of war mongering of this
administration but what so attention is
not focused on what we've been
discussing tonight on nuclear
proliferation so how I mean you you're
both contributing to that that raising
of consciousness that's so necessary but
what can citizens do I think we can do a
lot the if people understand these
things and also understand something we
really haven't gotten to that in every
single one of these crisis situations
there are feasible solution peaceful
solutions if you go through if we had
time you go through them one after the
other North Korea Iran Russian border
New START treaty you know cutting back
nuclear weapons every one of these cases
there are very clear in fact I might say
at some level well-known that means the
evidence is available means to approach
the situations from the point of view of
not threatening greater destruction but
pursuing diplomatic options they do
exist in every case and with enough
citizen dedication activism and pressure
I think governments can be compelled to
pursue those off
all right well I think that is a great
note to end on thank you I'd like to
thank the University the College of
Social and Behavioral Sciences professor
Chomsky Dan Ellsberg it's been a real
wonder to hear from you tonight so thank
you and thank you for for coming out
everyone
you should tell them about our fur hunt
meeting in October 67
