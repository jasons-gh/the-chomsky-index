let's suppose that for some perverse
reason that we're interested in ruining
an economy and a society so to make the
problem interesting we should select a
difficult case so say not the Central
African Republic where could be done
very easily so let's pick a rich and
powerful society and best of all let's
select the richest and most powerful
Society in history one with incomparable
advantages one that's fortunately close
at hand namely are wrong so a good way
to start is to ask what would be signs
of a successful economy well to begin
with it should have the people who are
eager to work plenty of badly needed
work that should be done and ample
resources to combine idle hands with
needed work and that picture helps us
sketch what a failed economy would look
like the opposite in all respects and we
don't have to look very far right here
there are tens of millions of people
eager to work but with no jobs many of
them have simply dropped out of the
workforce and despair there are ample
resources to provide employment but
they're hidden away where they cannot be
accessed in the overflowing pockets of
the super-rich and the corporate sector
particularly the big banks which have
been generously rewarded for having
created a crisis serious enough to have
almost brought down the domestic and
even the global economy and their vast
amounts of work to be done the
infrastructure is collapsing schools
badly need
teachers the transportation energy
systems have to be radically
reconstructed and is a great deal more
ranging from construction work to
scientific research but the system is so
dysfunctional that it cannot put eager
hands to needed work using the resources
that would be readily available if the
economy were designed to serve human
needs rather than wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice for a privileged few
it's actually hard to think of a more
serious indictment of a socio-economic
system well as you all know the
dysfunctional economy has been
accompanied by very highly concentrated
wealth and with it of course political
power follows at once from concentrated
wealth that in turn yields legislation
that drives the cycle forward inequality
has reached historic heights in the past
decade 95 percent of growth has gone to
1% of the population actually - a small
proportion of those meanwhile the
general population has faced stagnation
or decline median real income in the
United States is below its level in 1989
for male for males median real income is
below it was in 1968 the labor share of
output has fallen to its lowest level
since World War two and poorer sectors
have suffered severely the United States
has the highest poverty rate in the OECD
aside from Turkey and that's perhaps not
too surprising because the u.s. also
ranks near the bottom in measures of
social justice in the OECD for
african-americans household wealth has
virtually disappeared during the latest
crisis
we should recognize that the grim legacy
of slavery which is one of the original
sins of American society along with the
virtual elimination of the indigenous
population that legacy has never been
overcome there's some immiseration but
not much well these things didn't just
happen like a tornado
they are the results of quite deliberate
policies over roughly the past
generation the period of the neoliberal
so-called assault on the population
which has had similar effects elsewhere
as well and that's hardly surprising
either the fundamental doctrine of
neoliberalism is was well expressed by
Adam Smith what he called the vile maxim
of the masters of mankind all for
ourselves and nothing for other people
and if the Masters are given free rein
that we should expect the kinds of
social and economic disaster that we now
see before our eyes
well there are alternatives quoting
Nobel laureate Nick on economics Joseph
Stiglitz points out there are
alternatives but we will not find them
in the self-satisfied complacency of the
elites whose incomes and stock
portfolios are once again soaring only
some people it seems must adjust to a
permanently lower standard of living
unfortunately those people happen to be
most people in short the vile Maxim at
work these developments should not be
confused with idealized workings of
capitalism and free markets on the other
hand on quite the contrary policies are
carefully designed to protect the
masters from market discipline that has
always been true back to the 18th
century and to ensure that they can rely
on the beneficence of the powerful nanny
that they carefully nurture for their
benefit but let's continue the exercise
of this figuring out how to ruin an
economy I suppose we're intent on making
the scandal even worse there are some
good ways to proceed so modern economies
depend very heavily on R&D research
development fundamental work comes
primarily from the dynamic state sector
on which the advanced economy heavily
relies almost most of the IT revolution
biology based industries and much else
actually that's a pattern that traces
far back but it's become much more
critical since the second world war as
the impact of Science and Technology on
the society and the economy have greatly
expanded so a very good way to ruin the
economy and the society would be to cut
back on R&D on federal R&D and we can
read about how that's done from the
first issue of the triple a a sternal
American Association for advancement of
science journal science the first issue
in 2014 here's what it says the 2014
budget will continue what has been a
decade's long slide in the ratio of
federal R&D in the budget to the GDP
this ratio is often used as a measure of
how much a nation values basic research
it's fallen 20 25 percent in the last
decade alone and that's continuing in
the meantime elsewhere internationally
investment in science is rising as
nations throughout the world connect
investment and R&D to the development of
their human capital in their future
prosperity for example the European
Union's flagship research program
horizon 2020 is set to receive a nearly
30 percent boost in 2014 the Chinese
government's invest
Ardi has been increasing by percentages
in the double digits for the last
several years and is poised to become
the world leader you can draw the
consequences without any comment what's
happening here is a very natural
development of the imposition of the
business model of seeking short-term
profit the future the society there are
someone else's business another way to
undermine a healthy economy is to
encourage the growth of financial
institutions giving them free rein buy
deregulation and using state power to
underprice risk these are actually
crucial features of the neoliberal era
from the 1970s accelerating since
there's been an enormous expansion of
the financial sector of the economy by
2007 right before the latest crash that
had reached about 40 percent of
corporate profits
well economic growth has continued
during this period though not at the
earlier pace but it's a rather
artificial it's sustained by repeated
bubbles the each decade has had its
bubbly savings-and-loan bubble under
Reagan the tech bubble in the late
Clinton years and of course the housing
bubble under Bush when the last of these
bursts it created a financial crisis
that has had severe consequences for
much of the global economy and near
depression conditions persist for much
of the domestic population the costs of
the latest of the housing bubble itself
and loss of output are estimated by the
Congressional Budget Office to be around
twenty four trillion dollars that's
largely the fault of the Fed which was
mesmerised by quasi religious doctrines
about efficient markets and therefore
could not
pretend what was very obviously
happening happening right before their
eyes as housing bread presses rate rose
far beyond trend lines going back 100
years and the bubble that could have
been pricked wasn't well the primary
mechanism for rewarding the agents of
the crises is the government insurance
policy known informally as too big to
fail and that guarantee goes far beyond
the direct bailouts it extends to cheap
credit artificially high credit ratings
and many other devices and the scale is
huge as a recent IMF study which found
that virtually the entire profit of the
major banks traces to tacit government
insurance reaches the level of 83
billion dollars a year according to
analyses in the business press Bloomberg
News the insurance policy of course
leads to underpricing of risk hence
making the next crisis more likely after
the most recent crisis several prominent
economists cluding Nobel laureates
raised the question of the general
impact of financial institutions in the
casino economy of the neoliberal period
and they also pointed out that that had
not been much studied by economists
they suggested that inquiry would show
that these institutions might be harmful
to the economy and there are some who go
much farther so perhaps the most
respected financial correspondent in the
english-speaking world is Martin wolf of
the London Financial Times he concludes
that quote him an out-of-control
financial sector is eating out the
modern market market economy from inside
just as the larvae of a spider wasp eats
out the host in which it has been laid
well as in other developed societies of
the economy of the US economy it's
actually a state capitalist economy
but it's partially market based and
markets have both positive and negative
features so that tells us another good
way to ruin a economy in a society
undermine the positive features and
amplify the negative features and in
fact huge resources are devoted to these
tasks the great benefit of markets is
that they're supposed to provide
consumer choice it's only partially true
even in principle but I'll put that
aside this beneficial consequence
results from informed consumers making
rational choices as you learned in your
economics courses that's the core
principle of markets and as you all know
there's an enormous industry which is
devoted that undermining this principle
by creating uninformed consumers who
will make irrational choices it's known
as the advertising industry in a
functioning market economy ads would
provide information to consumers about
the products that are available all you
have to do is turn on a TV set to see
that the goal is exactly the opposite
it's to undermine markets by delusion
and manipulation making sure that there
are uninformed consumers it will make
irrational choices and in part these
efforts reflect another tendency that
undermines markets that's the rise of
oligopolies which has actually advanced
considerably in recent years now that
offers opportunities to avoid price wars
by tacit collusion that shifts the goals
of business to product differentiation
which is often quite meaningless and it
requires massive advertising to delude
consumers from anakata
point-of-view that's mostly waste and
it's enormous and scale well these are
among the ways to undermine the positive
features of markets there's a negative
feature of markets intrinsic to them
it's called a market inefficiency and
that's ignoring externalities so when a
firm makes a risky transaction if it's
paying attention it takes covers it
takes care to cover its own risk but it
does not cover it does not consider
systemic risk that is the risk that the
loss will affect others maybe bring down
the market let's say when AIG
insurance collapsed tanking the economy
or actually would have tanked the
economy if the nanny state hadn't
written to the rescue here the
government insurance policy plays a
crucial role in amplifying a harmful
feature of markets actually there is a
much more serious case of ignoring
externalities namely destruction of the
Commons there's a standard notion which
you've heard called the tragedy of the
Commons which is supposed to mean that
if the Commons are held by the general
public they'll be destroyed so therefore
they have to be privatized actually if
you take a look at the facts the
opposite is usually true its privatizing
that destroys the Commons and for good
reasons and we're certainly should be
aware of it today the most significant
case of destroying the Commons is
environmental catastrophe informed and
rational people can hardly ignore the
fact that the drive for short-term
profits is leading directly to severe
economic threats and imminent ones
within the next generation or two but
that's another externality that's
benefits ignored and in this case
there's no one around who can bail out
the perpetrators can't run
and hand of the nanny state that say
bail me out or the future generations
whose chances of decent survival they're
placing at great risk will the future
historian and there may not be one in
fact but if there is one such a
historian will look back on the current
scene with some amazement there are some
who are trying to impede the threat of
environmental catastrophe there there
are others who are devoted to
accelerating it who are they well in the
forefront of the struggle to overcome
the threat are those who we call
primitive the First Nations in Canada
indigenous people in Latin America
aboriginals and Australia tribal
communities in India and their
counterparts all over the world and
leading the race to disaster are the
richest and most powerful countries in
the world the ones that have unique
advantages primarily the United States
and Canada Canada in particular has
become the scourge of the world with its
activities ranging from tar sands to
mining activities that are destroying
much of the world these are countries
with unique advantages and they're in
the lead to the race to destruction the
suicidal Drive is conducted with
considerable euphoria about what's
called a century of energy independence
in which North America becomes the Saudi
Arabia of the 21st century the
excitement is scarcely tainted by
reflection on what the world will look
like as fossil fuels are consumed with
unrestrained exuberance
there's even gloating over the fact that
Europe is reducing its efforts to move
towards sustainable energy reason it
can't compete with US production based
on the cheaper energy that's
drawing this is the world in society the
corporate sector has announced quite
openly that it's carrying out major
propaganda campaigns to convince the
public that climate change if it's
happening at all does not result from
human activity these efforts are aimed
at overcoming the excessive rationality
of the public which continues to be
concerned about the threats that
scientists overwhelmingly regard as near
certain and quite ominous all of that
makes sense under prevailing ideology
and prevailing institutional structure
which is directed towards pursuing the
vile maxim of the masters of mankind and
in this case it goes well beyond ruining
an economy
from ski thank you for your remarkable
insights I remain curious however as to
what your thoughts are if any regarding
cryptocurrency and bitcoins general more
specifically their effect on the global
economy I've not been in about it I
suspect it said I suspect it's a fad
that'll lead to some crisis and collapse
but professor Chomsky and in cases like
in the southeast of Mexico in Chiapas we
have several communities you know whom
does the when gobierno and otherwise
that has tried to fight the corrupt
aspects of capitalism in their own ways
and although they suffer still attacks
from it they have managed in one way or
another some sort of autonomy but this
people first of all they live in a rural
environment and that identity is deeply
rooted in you know to the land and
indigenous practices that become
tradition and mysticism how do we bring
this aspect of attacks on capitalism to
the urban environment into cities for
example like Detroit or Flint or Camden
or Baltimore that have seen the worst
attacks of neoliberal policies and have
extinguished all identity as proletarian
unity through the attacks of vulture
capitalism well actually it's a Detroit
is an interesting case I mean Detroit is
overwhelmingly black and I'm I can't
find a document but I'm convinced that
that's the reason why it's being sent
down the tube if it was a white
community there would be plenty of
mechanisms available to bail it out just
as there mechanisms available to bail
out AIG other criminals but the and it's
kind of interesting how it's done so for
example this there's an attack on
pensions the pensions the in violation
of the state constitution pensions are
being cut back because of the crisis
this is not always done so it takes a
after their largely fraudulent the least
incompetent probably criminal actions
had practically destroyed the economy
and they were bailed out massively by
the taxpayer but but the executives got
huge bonuses and there was some protest
about that but it was pointed out by
eminent economists Lawrence Summers for
one that we have to recognize sanctity
of contract in that case and not in the
case of workers in Detroit who had
already paid River pension means a
cutback in wages you're cutting back
your wages you'd already paid you done
the work but in that case sanctity of
contract doesn't matter these are all
parts of the neoliberal ideology and
it's had a very negative effect every
just about everywhere in the world now
there are places where where there has
been resistant in fact there was an
interesting study that just came out of
the Economic Commission of Latin America
UN Commission on poverty in Latin
America and a very interesting results
actually the results strongly supported
a principle that the Cuban nationalist
leader Jose Marti had enunciated over a
century ago the farther you are from the
United States the better off you are
that's exactly what it showed there were
countries where in Latin America where
poverty had been very sharply reduced
namely in the Southern Cone where they
had abandoned the neoliberal doctrines
and had moved towards substantial not
total but substantial social reform but
Brazil and Venezuela were the outliers
the most reduction there were also
countries where poverty had not been
reduced like Guatemala and Honduras
those have been under US domination
forever the worst one and this gets back
to Chiapas was Mexico
the Mexico is held in the litter in the
general literature is a great triumph
I chose an economic disaster Mexico is
the only country in which poverty it
sharply reduced less increased last year
and so it's pulling down the average
well okay that's these are all you know
these are not small facts they're
significant facts and the answer to your
question is it's Nan's of people like
you just like trying to save the world
from the environmental catastrophe
that's coming is in your hands nobody
else is going to do it
again sir thank you all three or four
times um these are blood directly into
my question I was going to ask obviously
quite broad but what can we do what do
we focus on do we focus on working
through the system and try and work
through the government do we work with
social movements do we work with the
indigenous cultures within these smaller
localized communities abroad that are
the ones that are directly impacted by
the externalization like where do we go
from here now all of those are good
things to do and there's no one right
answer for everybody each person has
their own interests proclivities talents
and so on and every one of the things
you mentioned offers plenty of
opportunities to do important things and
what's going to be significant the
question is can this there are two
trajectories in process one of them is
towards destruction and it's not that
far off and it's inherent in the
institutions of the society I mean it's
almost an institutional requirement of
neoliberal capitalism that it destroy
the the destroy society in the economy
for the reasons I've kind of hinted at
but then we're mentioned before but
that's just built in another trajectory
is trying to overcome it well we can't
leave that to the indigenous people in
the world they happen to be in the lead
but they don't have the resources we
have the resources so therefore the
question is can we amplify that
trajectory but that's in the hands of
people like you and the opportunities
are there and they have to be taken and
without much delay
thank you
all right
okay thank you for your words professor
Chomsky what I would ask is that when
you mentioned the elites who as you say
sort of have been acquiring the wealth
of avarice in the past several of
decades
given your background as a cognitive
scientist I was wondering if you think
there's any way that these elites can
eventually be convinced
perhaps that their lifestyle and their
sort of greed for wealth is
unsustainable for society as a whole
this is possible but in fact you know
it's I mean I wouldn't count on it you
know it's got to be it's in fact it's
not if you go back say 50 years 60 years
there was a kind of a different culture
in management there was a sense in which
management had concern for the future of
the corporation so for example when
Charles Wilson said you know what's good
for General Motors is good for the
economy wasn't totally wrong they were
concerned with keeping the corporation
alive keep it making sure that the
workforce had some kind of income Henry
Ford was famous for that and that's gone
the neoliberal doctrine is the opposite
you have to have concern for the violin
accent and now that means concern for
short - very short term profit high
profit for the next quarter so you can
then get your bonus and maybe run away
and the corporation collapse who cares
in the society with it that's a
significant change in kind of corporate
culture and it conceivably could go back
but my own feeling is much more
significant changes are needed than that
one last question in the back all right
well the issues of corporate talks are
always discussed but how was our people
average people + - um how are their word
posed - go ahead of the big-money donors
and the corporate lobbyists in
Washington when they have all the
finances to fund these political
campaigns if they do
it's very it's very significant I mean
take almost anything that's happening
say the TPP the trans-pacific
partnership this is a you know about
this it's a a massive treaty it's called
a free trade treaty as nothing was
nothing to with trade and certainly
nothing to with free trade it's a treaty
probably don't really know much about it
because it's being carried out in secret
the way these things are done the
populations not supposed to know about
them not total secret for the reasons
you mentioned it's not a secret to the
hundreds of corporate lawyers and
corporate lobbyists who are writing the
legislation they surely know about it
but it's kept in secret from the rest of
us although parts have leaked out at one
part that leaked out a couple of weeks
ago is the part on what's called
intellectual property that's a fancy
term for robbery
it's a highly protectionist mechanism to
try to ensure that pharmaceutical
corporations and media corporations make
exorbitant profits which they have
absolutely no economic justification for
you can I think easily show this but
that's what you'd expect when a treaty
is being designed by corporate lobbyists
and corporate lawyers what else would
they be doing so well and the courts
have have helped on this by reducing the
there were some limits before on the
extent to which corporate wealth could
purchase elections this goes back to in
nineteen seven but they were they've
been pretty much dismantled and now it's
a free-for-all it's to be elected the
president you have to be able to spend
billions of dollars it also holds for
Congress was very careful is very good
political economist humph Thomas
Ferguson over at UMass who's been
studying this for years he's done the
and work on it and he just came out with
his analysis of the house of the
Congressional the House elections in
2012 as you probably know the the house
election had a Democratic majority for
the vote but through various devices as
a Republican majority in the house it
turns out there's almost a straight line
of the correlation between campaign
spending and victory is virtually a
straight line things have now reached
the point where to get a the chair the
chair that become chair of a powerful
committee significant committee in
Congress it used to be based on
seniority and service now it based based
on putting money into the party coffers
you have to buy it so the whole system
is being turned into something bought
that has very limited resemblance to
democracy
it's plutocracy and the only way to deal
with this is by mass public organization
to counter it and in fact that requires
associations the major association
that's always been in the lead on this
is unions so naturally during the live
neoliberal period in fact before there's
been a massive attack on unions to try
to undermine and destroy them that makes
sense
they're the one major organization that
allows working people for people that to
come together to work out their programs
formulate the demands that defend their
rights to press for progressive
developments elsewhere in society so
sure they have to be wiped out by now
private-sector unions are less than 7%
of the workforce so there has to be an
attack on public unions because they've
managed to survive and you see that
before you arise it's happening all over
but unless you know what sociologists
call secondary associations
groups of people can manage to get
together and organize then there's not
going to be any way to counter this
vicious cycle that concentrates wealth
concentrates political power leads to
legislation and Court decisions and so
on which ant which accelerate the
process and it does have a destructive
suicidal tendency so the question is can
that be reconstructed well again your
hands
thank you process Chomsky
