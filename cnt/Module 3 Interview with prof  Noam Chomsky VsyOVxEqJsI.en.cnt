Hello, and welcome to our expert interview for the third module. 
Today we are honored to have a linguist with us who needs no introduction, 
Professor Noam Chomsky. 
Thank you and nice that you could schedule us. 
>> I am happy to talk to you. 
>> Shall we start right away if that's okay? 
>> Sure, of course, yes. 
>> So first of all, and I am sure you have answered this question many times before, 
But I think it is something that certainly interests the participants of this course 
and that is the original reason that you have immersed yourself in linguistics. 
[LAUGH] >> The real reasons? 
>> Well. 
[LAUGH] >> I was 16 years old 
and student at the University of Pennsylvania, and 
I had gone to college with great expectations. 
The study offer seemed very exciting. 
>> [LAUGH] >> The high school was very boring, 
and this seemed like a way out, but pretty much every college I attended offered 
just more boring high school material and I lost interest. 
There was one college I was very interested in, Arabic. 
With a good professor. 
A learned scholar, an Italian anti-Fascist immigrant, it was 1945. 
Giorgio Levi Della Vida 
I was about to quit my studies, it was so boring. 
When I happened to meet Zellig Harris through separate relationships. 
Political, common political interest. 
And he was a very impressive person, and 
I always enjoyed talking to him. 
And he asked me a book from his hand that 
would appear soon to correct. 
It later appeared as 'Methods in structural linguistics'. 
It was my introduction to the field. 
Then he suggested that I attend his lectures, which I did, and 
then he suggested other lectures to other members of the faculty. 
Philosophy, mathematics, and I started this. 
I ended up with a very strange university education, 
which consisted of a mixed bag of lectures. 
[LAUGH] Without professional certificates, but 
I became more and more interested in the field. 
I had some background, my father was a Hebrew scholar. 
>> Yes. His dissertation covered 
Kimhi and Medieval Hebrew Grammar 
And when I was maybe 12 or 13, I read being 
dissertation and some works on the history of Semitic. 
I was interested in this and all this was taken into this common interest. 
>> Yes. 
So it all came together at some point? 
>> Yes. >> It felt- 
>> Real certificates and linguistics or 
anything like that would never be allowed into a respectable department. 
>> [LAUGH]. 
>> [LAUGH] Okay, so 
I think you have studied linguistics all your life and 
What is the language like 
fascinating that you continued to study it? 
>> Well, language has been recognized for centuries by philosophers, 
by scientists: Descartes, Darwin the whole list, 
>> Yes. >> as the essential human gift, 
the impressive ability that distinguishes people from other organisms. 
That is the traditional view, and I think there is extensive evidence for it. 
And it is an essential characteristic of man. 
It is the source of creativity or 
originality or mind and what not, 
the ability to plan something in a way that is unique in the animal world. 
And when we do, it also has some very strange features when you get there 
looks at it carefully. 
So language is one, what is considered a digital infinite system. 
It is infinite. 
There is no limit to the amount of expressions you can produce and 
mountain pipes. 
Which is always interesting because how do you obtain infinite capacity 
from a finite amount of data? 
>> Yep. 
>> And it is also digital, it is not continuous, 
as for example the communication system of bees is a continuous system. 
>> yes. >> Language is a digital system; 
sentences with five words, sentences with six words, but not sentences with five and a half words. 
And digital infinity is an interesting feature. 
This was fairly well established in the mid-20th century. 
The theory of computation, the mathematical theory of computation and so on. 
And it became possible, then, really for the first time to try 
accurately determine the nature of this property. 
And it is, there are many interesting, 
It is quite unusual in the organic world. 
You don't find such systems. 
And according to tradition, it was very difficult 
because the concept of digital infinity, computability, 
theoretically was not really clearly understood until 
about the middle of the 20th century, 
within mathematics and beyond it was-. 
>> So-. 
>> Yes-. 
>> So would it be appropriate to summarize it as follows 
that it is both the mathematician 
elements of the system and how, 
by studying language, you can study how we are put together. 
>> Yes, the essence of human beings. >> Yes, the essence of humanity. 
>> What kind of creature we are. 
This is our kind. 
It's not the whole story, but it's a ... 
But that combination of accessibility to formal issues, 
is carefully formal questions and human significance, I think, 
an irresistible combination. 
>> Yes, yes. 
Well, of course we totally agree. 
>> Yeah. [LAUGH] >> If, you know, beginning linguists. 
Yes, another question we have is what is most surprising 
what you know now, but what you did not know when you started linguistics? 
>> Well, in the very beginning ... 
First, I have to say the following, in connection with what you said before, 
that this was not the way language was viewed at the time. 
>> Yes. 
>> In fact, the general view was that languages 
may vary arbitrarily, and that each language was different from all others. 
You should not approach a specific copy with any presuppositions and that 
language simply ... A good example of how language was understood was actually 
Harris' book 'Methods in structural linguistics'. 
It was a collection of procedures, 
that a linguist can use in the field 
to organize the materials he collects from an informant. 
That's what linguistics was about. 
There was theoretically not much to say, 
and maybe some things about, you know, the structure of phonology, 
what characteristics there are. 
But beyond that, not very much. 
And that was because it was not possible at the time, 
it is not intended as a criticism to establish what a generative procedure is. 
What is an infinite generative procedure? 
>> Mm-hm. 
>> But most of all, it was pretty clear in the beginning, 
say around 1950, anything, any language 
had some sort of basic property that she should share with all languages. 
That is a generative procedure that 
produces an infinite collection of hierarchically structured expressions. 
>> Mm-hm. 
>> Each of them has a fixed interpretation of two, 
on the interface of two other biological systems. 
The sensory motor system for externalization and the internal, 
conceptual, planning thinking system that sometimes leads to a conceptual, 
intentional system. 
So there are two external conditions to which the generative 
procedure must comply. 
And this system had to evolve somehow. 
There was a time when it wasn't there. 
Now it is here. 
it is apparently uniform among men. 
There are no known differences in linguistic capacity within the human species. 
So for example if you take someone from an Amazon- 
tribe that has not had contact with other people 
in the last 20,000 years and you bring him to say, Boston. 
Then he will be like my grandchildren. 
Conversely, there is no known linguistic or other coginitive difference. 
>> Yes. >> So somehow something came up, 
that is certain. 
And it seems quite recent, but we didn't know it at the time. 
But now it is quite clear, fairly clear, that it is not 
has evolved in the last 50 or 60,000 years since man left Africa. 
And if you go back further, not long before in evolutionary time, 
there is no evidence that this existed, that would be anachronistic. 
What I say is now reasonably known, when it was not known. 
What was known was that it somehow evolved and 
that it seems the same to all people. 
Now that raises a very serious question. 
It suggests that when you try a linguistic, a grammar, 
to write a grammar of a certain language, it seems extremely difficult. 
>> [LAUGH] >> Each seems very different 
than the last one you tried. 
And that's why the mechanisms that you have to put forward are for 
this principle is extremely complicated. 
If you look at early generative grammars from the 1950s, 1960s, 
then the theoretical frame of reference 
very complex actions, mutual guidelines of actions. 
And that seemed necessary to be adequate at least in the description. 
to try to capture the data. 
But it was obvious that this could not be correct. 
For example, there is no way they could be taught. 
And for another reason, they couldn't ... 
it could not have evolved, the system, this complex. 
So the correct answer must somehow be that, 
there is an extremely simple system that somehow generates this diversity and 
this complexity, only for the interaction of extremely simple principles and 
general laws of nature, which are probably laws of computation. 
But that seemed like an idle dream at the time. 
>> [LAUGH] >> The most interesting discovery is that 
it doesn't seem like a vain dream. 
>> Hm. >> There is reason today, I think, 
to take seriously a thesis that can demonstrate, 
but I think we are close, that language is an almost perfect system. 
This means a perfect system would be a system that conforms to universal and 
linguistic conditions of arithmetic effectiveness. 
>> Hm. 
>> These are essentially natural laws that use the simplest possible 
generative action, combinatorial action. 
We know what it is. 
And then, by the way it works, it produces the visible diversity 
a complexity of languages   due to minor adjustments here and there. 
>> Hm. >> That sometimes leads to a strong, 
minimalistic assumption. 
And it would have seemed crazy 20 years ago, hopelessly 
impossible 50 years ago, but now more or less plausible. 
>> So, what you are saying is that it is actually all surprisingly simple. 
Or is it surprisingly orderly, perhaps? 
>> It's almost, it's a possible assumption, that maybe 
your generation proves that language approaches a perfect system. 
>> [LAUGH] >> It's close, at the core, 
it approaches the optimal way to meet the conditions of the interface. 
And there is more. At this time, 
I think this is, I'm not talking about consensus in the field at all. 
This is my personal opinion, and from a few other people. 
I think at this time, there is growing evidence that the relationship to the interfaces 
is asymmetrical. 
That is that in particular the relationship of the sensory motor system, the 
externalization, is secondary. 
It is a secondary property. 
The core system of the teaching of synthetic language and 
semantics and so on, 
is independent of the properties of externalization. 
So in particular, for example, it is independent of a linear word order. 
We need to speak. 
The words should come out in a linear order. 
>> Yes. 
>> But I think this is only a property of the articular system. 
But it is not a language, it is a filter through which language must pass. 
And if you look at other systems of externalization, like gestures, 
we now know, 40 to 50 years ago this was still unknown, but 
now it is known that gestures are essentially the same as spoken language. 
>> Right. 
>> Right. 
>> It has remarkable similar properties, however 
externalization differs because it is a different modality. 
So you can use simultaneity in gestures or 
spatial orientation, for example anaphors for a reference 
and so on, in ways you cannot use in spoken language. 
And if you have other modalities, different circumstances, 
but if this is correct, and I think there is a good reason to believe it is, 
then almost all current linguistic work is a peripheral system. 
>> It works on a system of externalization. 
And that makes sense in a practical sense. 
So for example if you want to, say, learn Dutch, 
they don't have to, they can't learn the fundamental principles. 
Nobody knows these so they cannot be taught. 
What you learn is the pronunciation, vocabulary, word order facts or 
such things that seem particularly superficial. 
>> Yes. >> Very complicated, but 
extremely superficial. 
And apparently 
this has no consequences for the core of syntax and semantics, 
which is independent of this. 
And so for example, the relationship between a verb and a direct object, 
a transitive verb and a direct object are semantically the same 
whether the verb precedes or follows the direct object, it doesn't matter, you know. 
And that seems to apply in general 
for some interesting properties of language. 
>> So if that's right, 
as I suspect, then the core principle, 
the basic principle that I mentioned at the beginning, 
an infinite collection of hierarchical structures continues 
the link to the interfaces should actually be link to one interface - the idea 
>> Yes, conceptual >> interface. 
Furthermore, there is another system that has to do with externalization, 
reveal what is going on internally in your mind. 
Which probably takes place mainly unconsciously. 
Well there is another option, I think, 
which seems to me increasingly plausible that many of the 
mental processes that work when you interpret something, 
understands, creates, expresses, not only unconsciously, 
but beyond the level of consciousness. 
>> Yes. Actually we had, 
this has something to do with another question we had. 
because you are currently also involved in bio-linguistics. 
And what is the focus of that field, we would like to know. 
And can you perhaps explain something about this topic? 
About bio-linguistics? 
>> Well, this also brings us back about 65 years. 
Around 1950 when this kind of work started, 
there was some sort of what you can call party policy. 
A widely supported >> [LAUGH] 
>> consensus in the field, it was, 
it was essentially behavioral science. 
you studied behavior, organized behavior. 
Within linguistics you study the organization and organization, 
and the patterns of data you collect ... 
and things, language learned through training, 
by habit, this development may not have been 
natural selection or something, but ... 
Only a few people and I had a different vision, 
actually three students. 
One of them is in the office next to me, Morris Halle, 
the other is Eric Lenneberg, the founder of the biology of language. 
The three of us were students at Harvard in the late 1950s. 
And we strongly disagreed with the prevailing view. 
Part of the disagreement was the acknowledgment of what 
a truth to me seems like a cow, but what is widely contested. 
And that is that language, your language is an internal property of you, 
that is within you, 
it is not in the world. 
It's in your brain, somehow rendered. 
nowadays sometimes described as "I-language" and internal language. 
>> Yes. >> As an internal language 
property of a person. 
Then it is a biological system. 
And you wonder what kind of biological system it is. 
It is bio-linguistics, and there was not much to say about it at the time. 
But over the years it has become a bigger topic. 
Eric Lenneberg's book 
Foundations of biology of language, or something like that. 
Released in 1967, and is still best in many ways. 
I think he offers the best treatise on the evolution of language, 
one of the best... 
out there, but on all these topics 
thought about it, but there was not much to say about it. 
So let's say the evolution of language, 
these were subjects that were simply discussed. 
It had to be recognized that the system evolved in some way, and 
that it had to be simple enough to evolve. 
It is a condition, sort of an overarching condition 
in the construction of linguistic theories. 
And it showed that they must all be incorrect. 
Because they are far too complex to possibly have evolved. 
That's actually the motivation to look for something, 
like what I call the Minimalist Program. 
>> Yes. 
>> It could have evolved, the question is whether it is possible. 
But there was not much literature about it. 
There were many meetings, conferences, symposia ... 
For many years I gave a lecture together with a 
laureate in Biology at MIT, however 
very little came out because there was not much to say about it. 
Linguistic theories were too complex 
to approach wisely, both in the area of   acquisition and 
evolvability. In the 1980s, 
1990 started to change that, there were things to say about it. 
A significant change came about 1980 when the so-called 
principles and parameters approach crystallized. 
That was an opening to many possibilities. 
The earlier approach to linguistic theory within this general 
The framework was that linguistic theory provided a kind of format for grammar. 
Every grammar of every special language had to fit in that format. 
And you chose that grammar based on an evaluation of measured data. 
The idea is that a child has data, there is a fixed format in his head, 
that is genetically determined. 
And then it picks the simplest grammar in terms of 
the technique of measuring, given the data. 
That basically produces an answer on how to acquire a language, 
but it doesn't work because it requires astronomical calculations. 
So it is totally impracticable. 
As it is understood, it is basically 
possible, but it may not be correct. 
The principles and parameters approach that 
crystallized in the early 1980s offered a different view. 
The principles are fixed, they are part of the genetic legacy, 
and we hope to make them simple enough. 
So that they can have evolved, that's what we have come to call the Minimalist Program, 
it's just the continuation of the effort since the early 1950s, 
which hopefully leads to the Minimalist Program or 
something like that as a possible answer. 
The parameters are the options available for the tests to determine the data given and 
there is quite interesting work in the field of parameter setting and 
the choices and arrangement of parameters and so on. 
Another interesting evolutionary problem has been added. 
Where did the parameters come from? 
And there are a few interesting ideas about this. 
One possibility that is being investigated is that there are actually no parameters. 
It is just that the principles 
are under-specified 
in some ways. 
>> And that specification of what 
underspecified gives the various options. 
If that turns out to be true, 
then that solves the evolvability problem. 
But it is very hard work. 
To show in detail that the hits, 
the superficial diversity and complexity you see are actually misleading. 
And that they can be reduced to a few basic, simple principles. 
And this is fairly well known in science. 
And I think in every science you look at, the data seems hopelessly complex. 
This was the case in physics when Galileo and 
his associates tried to find the basics of movement, 
they were mainly ridiculed 
because it is clear that it is hopelessly complex. 
Just look at the leaves blowing in the wind and so on. 
>> Yes. >> And it took a long time before 
they understood you 
can explain various and complex phenomena in terms of simple principles 
if you can find out what they are and how they function. 
>> The same goes for biology. 
In fact, at the time, when it was widely adopted in linguistics that 
languages   are arbitrarily different from each other and there is no limit to diversity, 
about the same was assumed for biological organisms. 
That the diversity and complexity of organisms is so 
great was that each had to be studied separately. 
It has been discovered over the years that this is not true. 
That there are striking similarities, preservation of fundamental forms, 
limited possibilities for organisms etc. 
In fact there is 
even a premise that is taken seriously, although not accepted, 
that there is a universal genome, a genome for everything. 
With only a few variations. 
It is no longer a strange assumption, 
it is like the Minimalist Program. 
>> Yes. 
So, I'm afraid we'll run out of time. 
And I am sure you have many other obligations today. 
So, [LAUGH] to wrap up the conversation, of course, 
there are people watching this video who are already interested in linguistics, 
they participate in this online introductory lecture. 
So, they will know a little bit more about linguistics after this course. 
What would you recommend to them? 
Do they have to read your work? 
>> [LAUGH]. 
>> Or is that still a bridge too far at the moment? 
>> They should do that, all I have said is the position of a minority. 
I do not represent a consensus in it 
the field and that should be understood. 
>> Yes. 
>> All my life, I've actually been part of a small minority of linguists who 
go against the flow. 
So that must be taken into account. 
>> Yes. >> It's the way I view it, 
it is not the way the field views it. 
But it is up to you, students, to find out for yourself. 
>> Yes. >> [LAUGH]. 
>> There are many different opinions about the right ways about this 
to think things through 
>> But that is -. 
>> But that's >> That's good, I guess. 
Okay? >> Sorry to interrupt you. 
That's good, I mean-. 
Disagreements lead to interesting new ones. 
>> Indeed, that makes the field exciting. 
>> Yes. 
>> And, which is very exciting, both because of the meaning of 
the study of language, as we said, at the core of human nature. 
>> Yes. 
>> The apparent contradiction and 
I think it is clear, between the diversity and complexity of the data ... 
and the recognition that for this 
should be a basic simple explanation. 
>> Because of 
the conditions of learnability- 
>> vulnerability, and so on. 
And that kind of superficial contradiction, 
makes it an extremely interesting field. 
>> Yes. 
>> Good. 
Yes. Thank you very much.
