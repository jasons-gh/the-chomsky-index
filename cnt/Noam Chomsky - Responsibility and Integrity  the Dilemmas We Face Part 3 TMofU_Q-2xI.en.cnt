weeks that can be approached and life
will be a lot more interesting if this
diversity in outcomes how come we live
in an open society with a lot of
information and yet we know so little
ashlyn sir how come we live in an open
society with a lot of information yet we
know so little okay add a little
personal touch about 25 years ago I was
asked by a publisher to write a book
that finally came out with a different
publisher called knowledge of language
the reason came out with a different
publisher was because I included in the
book one chapter that the original
publisher refused to publish it was
about in part about this question the
most of the book was about what I called
Plato's problem a problem of how we know
so much with some little information the
last chapter was about something I
called Orwell's problem this one how
come we know so little with how so much
information so those are the last and
then I went on and gave the reasons it's
not very profound the publisher wasn't
going to allow that so we gotta know
little but the answers straight forward
it's the kind of thing I was talking
about I mean there are concerted efforts
to make sure that you know very little
and understand very little which is even
more important even with so much
information about so when you go to
school you don't read about the first
911 you don't read about Reagan's war on
terror you do read about Solzhenitsyn
and hovel and others and about our
courage and supporting them but you
don't read about the Jesuit
intellectuals or the war against the
church or the effort to destroy the
attempt to bring back the Christianity
the gospel
other things you just don't read about
that there you can find them we live in
open societies you can go to library and
get the information about them but it's
a research project and that's conscious
it's a partly its internalized by
educated people your kind of brought up
that way yourself so that's what you see
things and it's more convenient and so
on and if you break out of the mold
there are difficulties in our societies
like ours the difficulties are very
severe but they're there and it's easier
not to face difficulties it's easier to
come to believe what it's convenient to
believe so these various factors on some
quite conscious so there's just sort of
normal human reactions and lead to a
situation in which there's tons of
information out there but you don't know
it or if you know it you don't
understand it several people are asking
you to express your opinion on the
WikiLeaks well the way it looks I mean I
I'm often asked do I think Julian
Assange was a hero or a devil I don't
think either I think it's just a person
doing a civic responsibility it's a
civic responsibility to help people know
and understand what the power what power
systems are up to they don't like it of
course no matter what power system it is
it rather have their workings be secret
from the public but what right do they
have to keep their working secret from
the public technically they're supposed
to our representatives we should know
everything they're doing you can imagine
there might be some cases in which
information has to be kept within which
there isn't it there's an argument for
keeping information secret but you have
to make the argument the burden of proof
is always on a power system that says
this has to be secret maybe sometimes
they can meet it
so for example take the Pentagon Papers
which were a very rich store of
information dan ellsberg who released
them did keep one volume it did not it
was one volume he didn't give to the
press people who I was one of the people
who distributed the papers a couple of
the friends of his so we had that volume
I was able to read it but we didn't give
it to the press I wasn't convinced that
that was necessary but made some sense
the volume was about negotiations and
there were ongoing negotiations so he
took the negotiation seriously and
frankly I didn't then it would have
there's an argument for not releasing it
might disrupt the negotiations but an
argument has been given and it's very
rare that that burden can be met it's
kind of like the burden that has to be
met by any authoritarian or hierarchic
institution as to justify itself it's
not self-justifying you take a look at
the WikiLeaks I think there's I can't I
can't think of anything there that there
would be any argument to have suppressed
and there's a lot of interesting
material very interesting maybe the most
interesting material that leads to me is
what it tells us what the WikiLeaks tell
us not about government's but about our
own intellectual communities the
communities that we live in the educated
sectors you know the cultural melee if
you like the press and so on and what it
revealed is extremely interesting that's
even more interesting that it hasn't
been noticed it's pretty transparent if
you I suppose the Dutch press was much
like the English language press in the
English language press what it got the
most attention you know big headlines
and everything was that the Arabs
support us on Iran crucial issue and a
lot of excitement you know the shows
we're doing the right thing even the
Arab support
strongly support us when I take a look
at what came out in WikiLeaks about that
what came out was statements by Arab
dictators they allegedly support us what
about the Arab population actually
there's a lot known about our public
opinion it's not recorded at least in
English maybe it was reported here I
doubt it but a lot is known about our
public opinion there recent polls taken
by the most prestigious us polling
organizations released by major
institutions Brookings Institute in
Washington others and what they what
they say is quite interesting they said
for example in Egypt ninety percent of
the public think their worst enemy is
the United States the figures are pretty
similar for the whole region United
States and Israel which are regarded
correctly is about the same thing so you
know on the order of eighteen ninety
percent throughout the region say that's
the main threat what about Iran that ten
percent think he ran as a threat in fact
support for Iran and rather hatred for
Western policy is so extreme that a
large majority think that the region be
better off if Iran had nuclear weapons
in Egypt eighty percent you know well
you know the Arab support us yeah the
Arab dictators what matters to the
editorial writers and the commentators
and the public intellectuals and so on
is the dictator support us if the
population strongly opposes us who cares
as long as they're quiet as long as you
keep them under control who cares that
reveals an attitude towards democracy
which is extremely significant it
indicates pretty strikingly the extent
to which democracy is absolutely hated
by educated sectors sectors that have
any connection to power or privilege
and it's very relevant to incidentally
this is not the first time this has been
true this has been true for decades and
there's plenty of evidence about it but
again it's not it's not what you're
likely to be caught in school or reading
the newspapers and so on but you can
find it out and you've learned something
about yourselves that's really important
knowing yourself is quite important
that's why that bad guy drank the
hemlock what is the role of intellectual
critique in a society like Holland where
critique and not positive policy making
is the standard we're what is the role
of intellectual critical not puzzle
there's the continuation Isaac should
intellectuals take on a more positive
role in making meet plans that can be
implemented in practice instead of a
critical approach well taking the last
part I don't see why there's a
distinction taking a critical approach
just in order to criticize and you know
it makes it maybe makes you feel good
but no point that taking a critical
approach because you want to see policy
changes you know that makes good sense
so go back to say the prophets when they
were giving a critical analysis of the
deeds of the you know evil kings they
were calling for a change in policies
and attitudes and that's what critical
people ought to be doing critical de
lectures if you like is the was the
first month you are women of an
intellectual critique in a society where
critique is nothing yeah change the
society that's worked
yeah thanks you said don't speak truth
to power is they'll know it already how
do you explain they don't act on this
truth don't speak truth but they do I
mean how the powerful oh sorry what you
argue for is reasonable very reasonable
to any human being how come people in
power don't act on it are they all
corrupted by power immoral perhaps a
moral they may be what whatever they are
that's you know for their families and
psychiatrist to worry about but there
but their institutions when you're an
institution and yet play a role in that
institution there are some limits on
what you can do so let's take something
let's take a couple of I think concrete
examples are good to think about instead
of abstract discussion we're in the
middle of a huge fan of fiscal crisis
economic crisis and where did that come
from well to a large extent it came from
a basic principle of market systems
which is an unavoidable property of
market systems namely if you're saying
suppose you sell a car to somebody if
you're paying attention you carry out
that transaction so that you make out
reasonably well and the other person
does too but there's some things you
don't consider lucky good you don't
consider the effect on her say that's
called an externality if you've studied
economic theory the effect of a
transaction on others is something you
don't consider in market systems right
there is an effect like if you buy a car
there's more pollution there's more
congestion a lot of things that affect
other people but those are externalities
you don't care about them well in
financial systems there's a big
externality which is well understood
it's called systemic risk systemic risk
is the risk that the whole
system will crash okay so if say Goldman
Sachs makes a transaction which they
will if they're doing their job they'll
cover the risk to themselves right
they'll take that into account they
won't take into account the risk of the
whole system will crash that's a
externality well you know that
externality happens to have big effects
like crashing the system repeatedly ever
since Rick during the 50s and 60s there
weren't any financial crashes because
there were regulations in place in the
70s on the 80's 90's the regulatory
apparatus has been dismantled as a
result systemic risk is always
ever-present and you have repeated
financial crises well these financial
crises are pretty bad crises the
financial crisis leads to a general
economic crisis so people don't have
jobs in the United States now probably
twenty percent of the population
qualifies for food stamps because they
can't get food you know that is pretty
serious but for the rich and the
powerful it doesn't matter because they
have they don't really this comes back
to talking truth to power they may
preach market systems but they don't
believe in what they believe in is a
powerful 90 state that works for them
not for anyone else but it works for
them so if the system crashes a Goldman
Sachs and JP Morgan Chase Barkley banks
and the rest of them if they crash the
system as they just did they have a
solution run to the nanny state you know
holding your copy of Hayek and so on and
tell them to bail you out meaning the
taxpayer to bail you out which is what
happens that's a government insurance
policy it's called too big to fail means
if you crash the system you just come
and say look I'm too big to fail bail me
out
and the taxpayer dutifully bails them
out right now they're richer than ever
right following what's happening in the
United States they're huge protests all
over the country in Wisconsin and
elsewhere and people are in real trouble
at the same moment and they're cutting
back collective bargaining pensions and
when I cut Social Security everything's
got to be cut luckier meanwhile the very
same moment the people who caused the
crisis are giving themselves fabulous
bonuses Goldman Sachs just quietly and
they're the worst of them announced the
17 and a half billion dollars in bonuses
for management 12 and a half million
just for the CEO triplets are and so on
that's happening right at the moment
when there's real suffering around the
country the same I just happened to be
in England front-page story every day
about you know the bankers gave
themselves a massive bonus probably the
same is happening here but but so that's
an externality you don't pay attention
to it now let's go back to the CEO of
Goldman Sachs is he a bad person no he's
I don't know who I don't care one way or
another was a good person or a bad
person like I say that's problem for his
family but his the role that he played
is it forces this decision decision
literally if he decides I'm not going to
make that decision he's out and somebody
else is in who will make it because
that's a property of the semi market
system that he's participating me now in
that case there's somebody around to
bail you out when everything crashes but
there's another case quite a critical
one in fact a lethal one where
externalities are ignored and
necessarily ignored and it'll probably
destroy the species that's the
environmental crisis the the business
world does not want to do anything to
deal with the environmental crisis for
good reasons
it harms their short-term profit then
I'll suppose you're the CEO you know
chairman of some mission in the United
States your task is to maximize
short-term profit and market share
period if you don't do that you're out
and somebody else is in in fact in
anglo-american law it's a legal
requirement but quite apart from that
you just have to do it or you're just
not in that position anymore it's a
crime of the position not of the
individual that means you've got to
ignore externalities in this case the
externality is the fate of the species
it means you have to try to convince
people have to run big propaganda
campaigns to convince people that global
warming is a liberal hoax and so on
which is exactly what's being done it's
quite effective I don't know what it is
here but in the United States maybe
about a third of the population thinks
it's a serious problem at this point and
you take a look at the new Republican
Congress just about every one who came
in as a climate denier it's all a
liberal hoax we don't do anything
they're already cutting down funding not
only for us programs but even for the
you know international scientists
organization been defunded that they
don't do anything about it because the
fate of the species is an externality
and if you're working in a market system
you know you don't pay attention to it
well in this case there's no taxpayer to
bail you out at once you destroy the
possibilities of decent human survival
kiss each other goodbye and that's where
we are right now this is not an abstract
consideration it's happening right
before our eyes you know right before
those are serious problems and it is to
make sense to ask is that person good or
bad there's an institutional structure
which is lethal harmful in the case of
say financial institutions but not
Lethal lethal and in this case and
not the only one can there be a society
without organized violence for instance
war Civil War dictatorship what do you
think the ideal world would look like
that was actually a question raised by
two great 20th century figures Bertrand
Russell and Alfred Einstein Albert
Einstein and they came out in nineteen
fifty-five with a memorandum a kind of a
statement to the people of the world
declaration of the people of the world
it was about nuclear war that's another
case like global warming it's it could
be and probably will be the destruction
of the species that their declaration
asks exact told forget the exact words
but it was exactly this they said to the
people of the world you're facing a
choice that is stark and unavoidable
either mankind will abandon war or the
species is finished that's their their
conclusion and I think it's plausible
they just can't be any more major Wars
it takes a Europe Europe for centuries
was the most savage brutal place in the
world the European spent most of their
time and creative energy and activity
and figuring out ways to slaughter each
other that went on for centuries the
Europe in fact created a technology and
a culture of savagery and barbarism
which so extreme that they could conquer
the rest of the world I mean if you look
at the conflicts between Europe and you
know India Mexico and so on Europe
always conquered the enemy but by
savagery in fact you look at read
military historians what they say is
that
for most of the world war was a kind of
a sport for Europe it was a science and
they want you know so small groups of
Europeans could Massacre huge numbers of
what they called barbarians people who
didn't think that war was a science well
that's the core part of European history
up to nineteen forty-five not sent did
genes change no no change in the genes
what happened is that Europeans finally
realized that the next time they play
their favorite game of slaughtering each
other it's all going to be over you
can't do it anymore the level of
savagery and violence has reached the
point where we just can't make use of it
so something has to be done to cut it
back so yeah that's an answer there's
it's not necessary in human nature I
mean unless these forces are constrained
they'll blow up but they can be
constrained so the chances of a major
war inside Europe are very slight which
is a huge change from centuries of
history mr. Chomsky says that we should
address the right audience but he also
says that people empowered try to make
dissidents be ignored in the least in
the light of this what will be the most
practical or efficient way to go about
addressing the audience and trying to be
heard by them that depends where you are
if you're if you were saying El Salvador
there wasn't really an answer to that
because you're you're going to get your
brains blown out which is what happened
if you're in say Turkey which is a
moderately repressive society you know
pretty free but not entirely probably
what they're doing is the best way
that constant protest civil disobedience
and so on I'm having I've been in Turkey
number of times over the past 10 years
and have actually participated in some
of these civil disobedience actions I
was there a couple months ago and it was
a major conference on freedom of speech
and the participants are mostly Turkish
were journalists artists academics and
others describing the activities that
they're involved in which are very
courageous a lot of them are working on
Armenian rights and trying to bring
about the recognition of the Armenian
Genocide and the repression of Armenian
sins and most of them are working on
Kurdish rights that's the big issue and
extremely brutal in the 1990s it's
improving some sense but still going on
well you know that's the best method for
them facing real problems the best
method for people like us is much easier
we have very limited constraints I mean
enough freedom has been won in societies
like ours so that it's not perfect and
you're not going to get lauded but
there's a wide range of opportunity to
do all kinds of things and without
suffering the kinds of severe penalties
that only Saints are willing to endure
is it possible to be well-intentioned
while committing atrocities if so should
these good intentions change our
assessment of these atrocities I think
it's not only possible to be
well-intentioned at least by self
perception while committing atrocities
but it's all almost universal you just
take a look at the record of major
criminals you know I mean talking about
people like Hitler and Stalin the rest
of them not just sort of garden-variety
atrocities but I mean world-shaking ones
you take a look at the record it's being
done with the utmost mobility I mean
Hitler invaded Poland to protect Germany
from what he called the wild terror of
the poles the Germans had no choice the
poles were terrorizing they had to
defend themselves slaughtering the Jews
with saving the purity of the of
civilization Hitler didn't talk about it
much but people like Martin Heidegger
did I remember you know I was kind of
surprised when in recent years it was
kind of discussion of discovery that
heidegger had been in Nazi and I started
reading him in the 1950s you read take a
look at introduction to metaphysics you
know you get in 20 pages he's talking
about how it's the role it's the task of
Germany to save civilization which comes
from the Greeks to the teutons Germans
are the inheritors and they have to
protect it from the barbarians of the
east and west and corrupt elements have
to be eliminated and so on so we can
what can be more noble than preserving
the civilization a handed to us to the
Greeks
it's the Nazis you read the Russian art
a lot of Russian archives have come out
in the light unit in the last since 1990
and they're pretty interesting reading I
mean you take a look at the internal
discussions you know Gromyko to talk
Molotov and all this business talking to
each other not trying to impress anyone
they're talking about the need to defend
democracy people's democracies from
Western fascists that's why you had to
control prove anything from happening in
Eastern Europe again perfectly Noble and
in fact it's very rare to find anyone
who says I'm carrying out terrible
crimes because I want to you know maybe
there are people like that but I think
almost always you find a way to justify
it and I suspect if you look at your own
experiences you'll find plenty of things
like that like maybe when you were six
years old and your mother wasn't looking
and took a toy from your younger
brothers nothing and he went and ran and
complained the your mother and she came
to see what's going on and you said I
didn't do anything he gave it to him he
didn't want it was mine anyway until
it's over you find a way to justify what
you're doing and you believe it you
really believe it convince yourself of
it and I think that's probably true
quite generally I think not nice maybe
but I think it's probably true I'm going
to commit a well justified abominable
atrocity and we've conclude this
discussion yeah
I would like to thank you know'm Chomsky
for coming here for giving your lecture
for telling us about your intellectual
life forgiving as an example of how an
academic our an intellectual could act
in this strange but nevertheless very
beautiful society let me remind you of
one fact before i close the army go to
gov coffee the building we are in is an
Armenian Church not an Armenian but an
Armenian Church which means it is the
church for the poor a branch of Dutch
Reformed people who are tolerant in
every way and I think that's very
appropriate place to have you at your
speech here I wish you a very good stay
here in Utrecht and hope to meet you
soon
you
