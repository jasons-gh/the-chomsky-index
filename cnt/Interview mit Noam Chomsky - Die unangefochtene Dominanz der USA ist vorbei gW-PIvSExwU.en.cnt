welcome to the broadcast in conversation with korea today we have a whole 
special guest one of the most influential thinkers of the week 
great scientist and professor i speak of noam chomsky his contribution 
linguistics has the approach to research in this 
science area that is known worldwide for 
his political commitment and his search for justice that he and the 
extremely unfair international politics of the united states always amine 
condemned for conflict and war and violence 
imperialism on the whole planet welcomes criticized professor 
our broadcast in conversation with korea thank you our invitation 
if they like it here how he is doing very well they live now 
here in arizona yes i live here in arizona i got some years ago 
married we are very happy wonderful i congratulate let us 
Talking about imperialism would help us a lot if you 
please define the term short six years an entire 
the term broadly speaking means the term in one or the other 
others form the ability to control and dominate what 
others can sometimes do so through extreme violence, such as that 
invasion of iraq sometimes through financial manipulation like that 
favoring the migration of capital or the imposition of 
adjustment programs are carried out in some cases, even the 
kidnapping a president as happened a few years ago 
Many different shapes are essentially what the term means 
ability to exercise control and get away with it in the least 
to be punished to say it critically 
I am thinking of the free trade agreements or the adjustment agreements etc 
there are the deals and also what my friend edward hermann deserves 
and unworthy victims make a distinction between the invalid victims and theirs 
fulfill obligations with the agreements 
the finished do what you want mr professor the world politics of 
the twenty-first century will consistently rise again from russia 
and china shaped as new economic powers, especially the usa will become china 
continue to be the hegemon of international order if you take the time 
after the second world war, the highlight was the united market 
states in 1945 at the time the united states owned 
probably the world's prosperity you had the certainty of control 
the two oceans and their coasts across the entire western hemisphere 
they also had an unprecedentedly strong military with nuclear weapons 
this is a degree of dominance for which there was previously no historical president 
gave as if crumbling started quite quickly in 1949 something happened 
what is interestingly in the united states under the term 
loss inas is known that is a very interesting 
formulation because I can lose my computer, for example, but not in 
yours but the prerequisite is only that we occupy the world and if someone has it 
then we lose independently and the loss of china had one 
the so-called magical repression had an enormous impact on the domestic market 
he is considering an enormous effect on foreign policy, such as kennedy 
whether he attacked us against south vietnam where it was all in china 
One of his concerns was that the loss of inter china 
accused it is not ours if we do not 
check strictly if you look at the 
period of 1945 you should see that it does 
the united states has steadily decreased there is one more factor 
who is usually not measured by economists and political scientists 
usa live international system in the form of us company 
meanwhile, the world has changed as a result of neoliberal globalization 
and if you now look at the property in the world 
us groups and international companies in the united 
states are home to around 40 percent of the global economy 
us groups are leaders in almost all categories of production 
finance trade in pretty much everything so the national power has in 
from a certain measure, but from a different point of view it is 
economic and political power in the united states is still changing 
and there is still the military area in which nobody is approaching the usa 
come they spend almost as much on armor as the rest of the world 
together they are technologically advanced 
advanced they may have around 800 to 
900 military bases worldwide but not in manta i will be yours 
wonderful comment in this regard will never be forgotten 
i repeat it again and again offer ecuador but has no base either 
in miami no other country is far from him 
team set up like the united states 
i think china certainly has a dynamically developing economy 
which enables him to have a say in world divorce 
but it is still a very poor country if you look at the 
United Nations Human Development Index View Who You Are 
china finishes at number 90 it has enormous internal problems 
this includes ecological and demographic problems as well as political ones 
repression then a lot of inner problems so the developed ones 
industrialized countries have not professor you mentioned that 
United States military power in the world exercise 
according to donald trump, this makes even bigger and better under his government 
become stronger what is the military strategy of the usa 
under the government of donald trump the opposite is actually the case 
in case of trump it becomes weaker less 
effective it disintegrates internally and loses its international authority 
and to see that you sat once the trump government moves 
Towards the destruction of the world by far the most important policy 
government is the approach to a driver's existential crisis 
climate change here the united states 
detached from the whole world every other country feels like it is something 
be clearing with regard to this actually growing and upcoming 
crisis the united states are under 
not only give up your efforts in this area but abandoned 
Aggressively increase the risk of escalation by becoming even more concerned 
concentrate the production of fossil fuels 
the united states are saudi arabia as the largest 
oust producers of fossil fuels 
this is devastating i understand it but how do you want the united states 
get, for example, to sign the environmental contracts if you have one 
have such strong military power 
of course, the united states have no capacity to destroy everything 
question any other nuclear power can do that but we also have to understand 
that we have reached one point is one of my argument 
between the leading nuclear powers atomic life for him on the whole 
extinguish planet worth the first blow he will also have that nuclear power 
meet him personally chosen because of the consequences of a very 
probable atomic winter including one out of sheer volume 
decades or even centuries we have reached an annihilation stand 
that is already beyond human imaginations 
based on many years and now it will always be dangerous to see them 
nuclear war clock in the report sheet the atomic scientists at the 1947 
was founded every year by a scientist 
political analyst tries to assess the threat to the world and the 
minute hand set at midnight 
midnight means the end of our style and, like many other styles, the watch 
was set up in 1907 and is set to seven minutes to twelve after that 
the pointer is moving and it reached two minutes before midnight 
That was in 1953 when the United States played and only these offer theirs 
atomic bombs have tested hydrogen bombs that were all capable of it 
quickly destroyed then the watch has been swinging back and forth for several weeks 
she is back at the next two minutes before midnight 
distance since the establishment of the eu very interesting professor that 
it was the twentieth century and the bloodiest in world history 
Have you claimed that the world is at even greater risk than the world? 
the countries' nuclear arsenal faces the war rhetoric 
between the united states around north korea concrete and predictable 
take shape 
it can be done very easily as in this case there is a very doable 
approach to coping with the crisis this is well known it is a 
proposal from china has been on the table for years and yes from russia and 
most countries will support North Korea as well 
potential support and that makes a lot of sense 
the approach has freezed david friesen in north korea 
weapons development and its nuclear weapons development 
in return you will be frozen hear the united states with theirs 
threatening military maneuvers on the border with north korea on the usa 
the most advanced aircraft of the type he once used as 52 can one 
atomic bomb is constantly transporting and flying over the north korean border 
that is a serious danger now back to the losers 
there is the un charter that prohibits a threat or the use of violence 
threats or violent use are a serious violation of the un 
charter they are a crime that happens all the time when you see them 
looking at the history of the united states and north korea is one thing 
meaningful threat the united states have the country 
practically flattened in the 15 years so the united states would have to 
stop these threats and north greens that its weapons development 
from freezing that could be a basis for negotiation 
create them in a reasonable and constructive way with the conflicts 
and the crisis bypasses whatever you can about the north korean government 
some may think they are the worst government in history 
It is known that the government is trying to move towards the 
to move economic development and she told some successes in 
this fight, however, the weapons programs and the constant confrontation risk 
if you are an enormous burden you have every reason to be one 
type of agreement to relax the tensions and a 
economic development and possibly an agreement too 
enable if you look at the history of the 
Negotiations looks really show a lot of propaganda on them 
That there are many possibilities, the professor considers the main subject of this 
talk is imperialism let's talk about the internal 
talking about american problems the same problems as for the 
rest of mankind violence for example violence is one of the biggest problems 
of american society how do we solve this problem why do 
we are not the obvious weapon control that is internal 
problem in the united states it's a real cultural and social 
illness the deaths from the north are about 25 in the united states 
times as high as in comparable countries in all countries that do not like 
Syria war is 25 times higher and there is one 
widespread i cant even believe it then a widespread kind 
passion in the usa that says that God has the right here 
To carry an assault rifle in a cafe if you want to drink coffee without 
curve youth but where does it come from that there will be a lot about the saint 
missed the commitments of the second additional article 
do you know when it started in 2008 it's not american 
history and now additional articles had existed 
but in 2008 it became a judgment 2a and gods do it 
judgment in the washington dc trial against helga was not only very interesting 
interesting what is but also the way it is handled 
the decision was very tight that is when you look at the second addition rtl 
it is said to maintain a well-organized civil service 
people have the right to carry weapons and the debate was about it 
whether it means that wearing the right weapons is a requirement for the 
founding the citizen via is or whether it is an individual right is independent 
from the civil defense that is the debate and the decision 
from richter scale to a highly respected lawyer is a so-called original 
says that we are on the intentions of those people who are the law 
have decided that it is a 
individual rights and is not dependent on animals, then there is 
the debate among lawyers whether it is a form of civil defense as a tea or not 
all of this is totally irrelevant if you are a real original 
goals of the founding fathers looking back why did people want back then 
examining weapons it's very easy to kill Indians 
and to control slaves why do you need a civil defense because 
The British came first of all, regardless of what history 
means that is somehow used today no 
the second additional article has no applicability these discussions are 
completely irrelevant for the facts if you asked why this 
Weapons needed so they had these larvae and I did 
cruelest belief system in human history under control 
keep going on the continent 
Spread honors to advise the population that is why they have weapons 
this is an interesting story in connection with the 
second additional article if you pay attention but what is discussed 
almost completely irrelevant and that is the reason why the decision from the 
year 2008 which has unexplained 100 years of traditional opinion 
which said that it is not an individual right but that it is only with one 
civil defense connected 
let's talk about the relationship between the usa and latin america 
speak professor as you know i come from 
Latin America will see the increase in right nationally oriented 
governments in latin america negatively affect relations with the usa from the 
achievements of the so-called pink tat have not yet been destroyed 
for example, there are no us military bases 
there is a certain degree of military interference but no direct one 
military bases not in ecuador is even more interesting that the iwf the 
actually part of the United States Treasury Department was exiled from there 
but they can still come back they try to come back just like 
the military tries to come back but it differentiates states and 
what was once the time when the united states was one 
overthrown government is over politician see eg the military 
delete and support that but you cannot do that by inserting a 
military dictatorship in brazil compare to the largest country in the south 
hemisphere you can in case of electoral fraud 
help but that can not be compared with the state he 
only recently the terror in central america dominated the sea cloud 
eighties hosted this horror as the usa date in every country 
and support every region and if they don't the army 
Then the guerrilla forces that attacked the country were able to control 
you can no longer do that so yes there were thunderstorms also social internal 
winner there is a regression a lot of problems 
but i believe that there were many achievements i have to give them 
contradict professor people have changed but 
you can still overthrow governments in latin america you used to 
example the mass media to destabilize governments governments 
by stabilizing but this is very different from the military coup 
ruin like it used to go unpunished for years 
without wanting to fall back on history for a long time 
or let's take, for example, the military 
optimal wave of repression since I was early 
60s riva latin america is in business and likes to be in the news 
arrived in guatemala something like that is no longer in the night of the united 
states 
how do you rate the politics of the usa in relation to venezuela 
in venezuela there are many international players from russia and 
china who have important interests there and the neighboring country is colombia 
an important military ally of the usa, you can stand up for venezuela 
similar scenario to imagine for syria i don't think so 
venezuela has very serious problems but the usa is unable to meet one 
to initiate military policy there or to attack the country 
i think this is highly unlikely the usa has this 
just doesn't do anymore you enjoy the support this 
The United Kingdom was afraid of another subject, Professor 
Julian Assange is not allowed to be the Ecuadorian embassy in London 
leave it to believe that with the demands 
the usa after its delivery, the usa has no connection 
explicitly asked for the design of the delivery but I think 
it is generally believed that he will end up panama someday if he does 
I'm pretty sure I'm leaving the embassy now 
professor let's continue talking about latin america 
that is the unbalanced government of the world there alongside both extremely rich 
as well as extremely poor people this is of course a distribution problem 
there is no shortage of resources we have many resources that are bad 
and technically we have solutions for it and 
more progressive tax system e.g. 
or at least tax recovery or tax recovery funding from 
starts initiatives to create equal opportunities for everyone 
state schools for everyone, for example a state health system and such 
further control of market power observance of freedom rights 
better distribution of national resources 
the problem is not technical but politics, that would be the elite 
damage that has always ruled us these elites own like factories and 
The mass media sees every government will try to solve this problem 
attacked 
but these attacks can be returned 
and there have actually been advances in preserving educational opportunities 
eg that has changed so much in brazil for example where my wife 
coming from under lula, large population groups had access to education 
and where is lula now that is his fight you know what is happening there for 
changes are not easy this is an ongoing struggle it is 
striking that he is by far the most popular politician in the country 
tried not to admit him to the elections but 30 years ago they had 
usa simply introduced a military dictatorship, so a lot has happened 
changed 
we come to my last question professor how would you solve this problem 
approach if you were an honest latin american president like that 
like you did in ecuador mother like julia in brazil or 
morales in bolivia there were many defects everything far from 
perfection for what a lot was wrong let us take that alone brazil 
most important country lula never succeeded 
basic economic countries who hasn't really tried it 
raw material export internal development which is very different from the east asian 
makes a difference but they did the opposite 
corruption was enormously widespread and that can be overcome and that 
is also the task thanks a lot professor it was a pleasure for me 
thank you for accepting our invitation 
I hope to see you again soon 
many thanks many thanks to all viewers that you 
have watched the show in conversation with korea until next time
