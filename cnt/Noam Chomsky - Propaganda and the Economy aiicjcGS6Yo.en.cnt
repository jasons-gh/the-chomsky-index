since the early 1970s there's been a
decline of real wages and they slow down
a growth and that's not just in the
United States it's throughout the
industrial world and it has very big
causes I mean to complicate it talk
about now there's big structural reasons
for that maybe mention but anyhow it's
been happening now in the 80s it
intensified the its policy run policy
driven you know that's not happening
bylaws of major and the policies of the
1980s particularly in Reaganite America
and in Thatcher England they were the
most extreme they accelerated so there's
a big I mean the England is now back to
the degree of inequality they had about
a century ago and the United States is
the degree of inequality measures are
one measure you can use of you know
what's happening in a society they were
improving up to about the 60s in the
United States then they kind of leveled
off and they got WAY worse in the 1980s
in every respect
I mean child malnutrition you know
income whatever you measure how was this
done partly by keeping the facts
I mean people knew what was happening in
their own lives you know everybody knows
what's happening to me but it's very
hard to find out what's happening
everywhere
and in fact the the picture was that it
was a period of great growth and
prosperity and Tom Wolfe call that one
of the great golden ages and human
history or something and there was a you
know there was there was indeed a veneer
of prosperity and for some people
probably people in my income bracket it
was great you know
gained a lot of money in fact there was
some income growth about fifty percent
of it or more went to the top one
percent about seventy percent of it went
to the top half percent and the bottom
sixty percent actually declined
huge differentiations but people only
knew what was happening to themselves
you know they didn't see it on
television no they didn't I mean finally
it actually broke through so you know
there were some even popular books about
it and so on but the general picture of
what's happening has certainly not been
explained I mean you can see that South
Central Los Angeles is exploding can't
keep that quiet but try to find an
analysis of why it's true and there's
some reasons why it's true you know take
away the jobs you send them overseas to
places region really screw the workers
properly and people who are left in
South Central Los Angeles they're going
to start no no no profound point and
that's happening all over the country
it's called the internationalization of
production for example and it's supposed
to be a good thing you know we're all
told about how it contributes to
economic efficiency and it's rational
and some economists like to see about
free-trade zone and so forth that's the
story here what's actually happening
people know from their lives and in fact
if you look at but they don't understand
the picture because that requires
putting it
together you know if you see take a look
at the public opinion studies you can
see the way people feel about it so for
example about 75% of the population
thinks that life is going to be worse in
the next generation than it is today now
that's a real turning point in the
history of industrial society that's
never been true I mean even the depths
of the depression which is way worse
than anything now there was a lot of
hopefulness you know people felt it's
gonna get better remember that very well
myself but now people don't think so
young people for example think they're
not going to live as well as their
parent they may well be right but that
aspiration that sense is very widespread
when polls ask people what they think
about the economy an astonishing figure
last ones I saw are over eighty percent
say that the economy is inherently
unfair meaning requires radical change
as for the political system about half
the population thinks both political
parties ought to be disbanded because
they're totally useless on the way so
you have a tremendous amount of
disaffection it goes on and on like this
and people just feel individually that
things are not going right but you you
are not going to find in the mainstream
establishment literature much of an
analysis of why or even that it is
happening and I think the basic
propaganda
method has been to focus basically to
distract people so you watch you know
sitcoms on television or you you know
look at nationally football or something
do anything except pay attention to
what's happening to you and and and
there is a strong effort to get people
isolated as you've been seeing over the
tube lately there's billions of dollars
being poured into the information you
know big information revolution which is
going to give everybody you know five
hundred channels which will all have the
same garbage the owned by the same
people but there'll be five hundred of
them now so you'll really be stuck alone
in your living room you know twiddling
that channels trying to find something
to do and not talking to the guy next
door with whom you might get together
and maybe change things well you know
that's a technique of propaganda and all
of these things are very effective
techniques I mean what I've been talking
about is indoctrination but that's
mostly aimed at leads that's like
tree-tops propaganda at the general
public propaganda is generally
distraction you know it's just to keep
the meddlesome Outsiders busy with
something else whether it's sex or
violence or gossip or sports or whatever
just keep them there then they won't be
any trouble and give them a picture of a
kind of a glitzy world you know that's I
think the way most of the Public
Relation system works
