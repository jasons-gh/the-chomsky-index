headman today in a democracy now special
we spend the hour with Noam Chomsky the
world-renowned political dissident
linguist author and Institute professor
emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology where he's taught for more
than half a century Noam Chomsky's
penned more than a hundred books his
newest because we say so a collection of
his columns on Saturday Noam Chomsky
spoke before a sold-out audience of
nearly 1,000 people at the New School's
auditorium here in New York City Chomsky
discussed the persistence of US
exceptionalism Republican efforts to
torpedo the Iran nuclear deal and the
normalization of us-cuba relations
professor Chomsky also explained why he
believes the US and its closest allies
namely Saudi Arabia and Israel are
undermining prospects for peace in the
Middle East his speech was titled on
power and ideology the role of
concentrated power in shaping the
ideological framework that dominates
perception interpretation discussion
choice of action all of that is too
familiar to require much common tonight
I'd like to discuss a critically
important example but first the color
words on one of the most perceptive
analysts of this process George Orwell
Orwell is famous for his searching and
sardonic critique of the way thought is
controlled by force under totalitarian
dystopia but much less is not known is
his discussion of how similar outcomes
are achieved in free societies he's
speaking of course of England and he
wrote that although the country is quite
free nevertheless unpopular ideas can be
suppressed without the use of force
gave a couple of examples provided a few
words of explanation which were to the
point the one particularly pertinent
comment was his observation on a quality
education in the best schools where it
is instilled into you that there are
certain things that it simply wouldn't
do to say or we may add even to think
one reason why not much attention is
paid to this essay is that it wasn't
published was found decades later in his
unpublished papers it was intended as
the introduction to his famous animal
farm bitter satire of Stalinist
totalitarianism why it wasn't published
is apparently unknown but I think
perhaps you can speculate Orwell's
observations on thought control under
freedom that come to mind in considering
the raging debate today about the Iran
nuclear deal which currently occupies
center stage I should say it's a raging
debate in the United States virtually
alone in almost everywhere else the deal
has been greeted with relief and
optimism and without even parliamentary
review this is one of the many striking
examples of the famous concept of
American exceptionalism the fact that
America is an exceptional nation is
regularly intoned by virtually every
political figure and I think more
revealingly
the same is true of prominent
academic and public intellectuals can
select almost at random take for example
the professor of the science of
Government at Harvard his distinguished
liberal scholar government adviser is
writing in Harvard's prestigious journal
international security and there he
explains that unlike other countries the
national identity of the United States
is defined by a set of universal
political and economic values namely
liberty democracy equality private
property and markets so the US has a
solemn duty to maintain its
international primacy for the benefit of
the world and since this is a matter of
definition we can dispense with the
tedious work of empirical verification
so I won't spend any time on that or
let's turn to the leading left liberal
intellectual journal the New York Review
there a couple of months ago we read
from the former chair of the Carnegie
Endowment for international peace that
American contributions to international
security global economic growth freedom
and human wellbeing have been so
self-evidently unique and have been so
clearly directed to others benefit that
Americans have long believed that the
United States amounts to a different
kind of country while others push their
national interests the United States
tries to advance universal principles no
evidence is given because it's hidden
matter of definition that's very easy to
continue it's only fair to add that
there's nothing at all exceptional about
this American exceptionalism was
standard for every great power very
familiar from other Imperial states and
their days in the Sun Britain France
others and this is true interestingly
even from very honorable figures from
whom one might have expected that better
so John Stuart Mill for example in
England to mention a significant case
which raises interesting questions about
intellectual life and intellectual
standards well in some respects American
exceptionalism is not in doubt I just
mentioned one example the current Iran
nuclear deal
here the exceptionalism of the United
States its isolation is dramatic and
starved there are actually many other
cases but this is the one I'd like to
think about this evening and in fact us
isolation might soon increase the
Republican organization I hesitate to
say party is dedicated to undermining
the deal in interesting ways with the
kind of unanimity that one doesn't find
in political parties though it's
familiar in such former organizations as
the old Communist Party democratic
centralism everyone has to say the same
thing that's one of many indications
that the Republicans are no longer a
political party in the normal sense
despite pretentions commentary and so on
