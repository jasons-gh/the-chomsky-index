Thanks really glad to be with you it's
actually a great privilege to be able to
take part in this commemoration of the
achievement 50 years of achievement
difficult times the voice of Canadian
dimensions becomes more valuable more
significant with each passing year and I
think we'll continue to I'm sure will
continue to do so what I'd like to I'd
like to discuss this is the world system
that's taking shape right now very
lively topic today rightly so the
discussion and debate in the leading
journals of International Affairs
provides essential insight into how the
issues are viewed in high places places
where decisions are made there is a
central theme
it's called sometimes America's decline
as power continues it's a long shift
over the centuries from its
Mediterranean Middle East origins to
Northwest Europe then toward their
offshoots across the seas then across
the Pacific what's happening now to the
rising Giants India and China which had
indeed been the leading industrial and
commercial powers before Europe's
industrial revolution and imperial
expansion typical illustration of the
prevailing theme as a recent year end
issue of the most prestigious of us
establishment journals foreign affairs
Journal of Council on Foreign Relations
that take a look at the front cover
boldface oversized letter
it reads is America over the lead
article several articles the lead
article
that calls for retrenchment I'm quoting
it retrenchment in the humanitarian
missions abroad that are consuming the
country's wealth that's so as to arrest
America's decline and to impede the
inexorable shift of power to China and
India there's a contrasting view a
couple of months later in the same
journal also in another in Harvard
University's Journal international
securities or of the gold standard in
the field scholarship and these
contributions set the bounds for much of
the bounds for mainstream discourse they
all share considerable common ground
they take it for granted they all share
the conception that's called American
exceptionalism that is that the United
States is unique in history and its
benevolence and its commitment to all
good things it's a contribution that the
world desperately needs and if the US
doesn't provide it the whole world is
going to be in trouble that's current
debate actually there was a gloss on
that by a British diplomat in the late
1940s that when Britain was ruefully
considering the fact that it was no
longer going to be the dominant global
power but it would be what the Foreign
Office called a junior partner - its -
the big guy across the seas the United
States and diplomat pointed out that the
United States assures the world that we
can provide what you need and what you
want and what you're going to get
whether you want it or not
that's more accurate than the official
version the within
if you take the two opposite extremists
that I was discussing the one that calls
for retrenchment the one says no we
better not because the world needs us
too badly they there are specific things
that they take for granted and they're
worth thinking about
I'll quote them they both take for
granted that after the United States
became the hegemonic power and the
global system the system that arose from
the ashes of world war ii replacing
britain since then its policies have had
certain constants that one of them the
main one is the effort to advance core
interests in security prosperity and
domestic liberties also common ground is
the assumption that quote during the
Cold War this commitment served
primarily to prevent the encroachment of
Soviet power into regions containing the
world's wealthiest potentially most
powerful most resource rich states and
therefore force and subversion are
automatically justified in self-defense
we've all heard this hundreds of times
and in fact disagreement on these basic
doctrines is so slight that it's
considered unnecessary that even to
provide evidence or to consider
alternative views just as you don't
trouble to refute the belief that the
earth is flat there are some things to
observe the waste time on well there are
those like Canadian dimensions who are
willing to step outside the framework of
rigid dogma of the political class the
media the mainstream intellectual
community and when you do it's not
difficult to come up with some pretty
obvious questions so for example one
question is is it true that containing
Soviet power was the primary goal of the
United States during the Cold War so
that the
actions undertaken or in fact in
self-defense for example the action of
invading and virtually destroying
Indochina it's the major crime of the
post-world War II period or carrying out
a brutal bitter terrorist war and
economic strangulation of Cuba for half
a century still going on or a long list
of other crimes that there's no time to
review and that should be familiar well
there is actually ample evidence about
all these matters even from the internal
planning record at which we have a
considerable access to there's a rich
store of Declassified sources that
explains very clearly the motives of
planners and they reveal very clearly
that in Indochina in Cuba Iran Guatemala
numerous other cases concerns had
virtually nothing to do with Soviet
power there was of course also always
invoked to frighten the population here
into obedience the concern was what was
called the domino theory was a good
paraphrase of it by Henry Kissinger he
points out that correctly in fact that a
region that drifts out of control is a
virus that can spread contagion and
might induce others to follow the same
path that doctrine that we've gotta kill
the virus prevent the spread of
contagion that actually is an authentic
constant of u.s. grant strategy it's as
old as the history of imperialism it's
familiar in many other contexts the
Mafia for example the Godfather cannot
permit a small storekeeper and not to
pay protection money because that virus
might spread to others and pretty soon
the system of domination might erode in
fact this mafia doctrine is probably the
leading principle of Internet
no Affairs the domino theory it's not a
joke incidentally the the domino theory
is commonly ridiculed when the dominoes
don't fall but it remains a leading
principle of policy actually never
challenged an actual policy that's a
good reason for that it's perfectly
rational the violent violent
implementation of the theory is what
keeps the Domino's upright so yes it's
the right policy to pursue in the case
of Vietnam we have a rich record we know
what the concern was the concern not the
Russians it was the virus de barro
Kissinger's terms the virus of
independent development which it was
thought might infect surrounding
countries crucially Indonesia in this
country they were really worried about
really does have rich resources unlike
Indochina which was of no special
importance in itself actually it was
feared that the in the late 1940s early
50s that the infection that might reach
Japan that was called the super Domino
by prominent Asia historian John dower
now the concern was that Japan might
accommodate to an independent Asia as
its technological and industrial center
that would be a system that would escape
the reach of US power if you think about
it that would mean that in effect the
United States would have lost the
Pacific War
the phase the Pacific phase of World War
two which was fought largely to prevent
Japan's outcome attempt to establish
what he called a new order in Asia and
these concerns were not alleviated until
the Vietnamese virus was eradicated and
the region was inoculated from in
action by the obvious means that brutal
tyranny is established in country after
country with us support and that
achievement was understood years later
McGeorge Bundy who is a national
security adviser under Kennedy in
Johnson they reflected about the
Indochina Wars and he concluded that it
might have been wise to end the war in
Vietnam in 1965 why 65 because in that
year the military backed us-backed
military coup in Indonesia installed a
murderous dictatorship and slaughtered
hundreds thousands of people mostly
landless peasants destroyed the only
functioning masked political party
blocking the threat of democratization
and if personally it opened in to
Indonesia's resources to Western
corporations and at that point it was
really pointless to continue the war in
Vietnam South Vietnam had practically
wiped out the dominoes weren't gonna
fall they were all protected from
infection including firstly Indonesia
and similar achievements throughout the
region it did end the perceived threat
the Russians had virtually nothing to do
with it the case of Cuba was pretty much
the same and again we know it from the
Declassified internal record quote the
concern from the very beginning was that
the Cubans the Cuban example might
encourage others to take matters into
their own hands an idea with great
appeal throughout the continent because
the distribution of land and other forms
of national wealth greatly favors the
propertied classes and the poor and
underprivileged stimulated by the
example of the Cuban Revolution and now
demanding up
opportunities for a decent living that
was arthur schlesinger liberal historian
who was john f kennedy's close advisor
and was in charge of the latin-american
mission that kennedy established as he
was coming into office to deal with give
an assessment of concerns and latin
america and that was the concern of cuba
go on with the internal record it
reveals that the basic concern was a
quote again the very existence of the
Castro regime represents a successful
defiance of the United States a negation
of our whole hemispheric policy of
almost a century and a half century and
a half no Russians referring to the
Monroe Doctrine 1823 which declared the
u.s. intention to control the hemisphere
couldn't be achieved at the time Britain
was too powerful but later it was
achieved as British power declined in
u.s. power that continued that's the
mafia doctrine pure and simple that's 50
years of torture of Cuba still
continuing around the same time early
sixties distinguished statesman Dean
Acheson he's one of the creators of the
modern world order he informed the
American Society of international law
that the United States would not
tolerate a challenge to its power
position and prestige so that legal
issues do not arise when the US attacks
on Cuba violate international law in
brief again no Russians except insofar
as they impeded u.s. objectives to
re-establish control and prevent the
virus from spreading contagion and
throughout Latin America as in Asia in
the same years appearance of the virus
led to policies to establish murderous
tyrannies throughout the region
the worst plague of repression in the
history of Latin America since the
European conquests actually at Justin's
basic thesis remains alive it was just
stated and restated a couple of weeks
ago but Secretary of State John Kerry
she's little received little notice but
worth thinking about this was right
after the kidnapping of a libyan tripoli
capital of libya the u.s. special forces
invaded libyan kidnapped a suspect
terrorist suspect al Libi
kerry happened to be in indonesia at the
time at a conference and he was asked in
a press conference whether it was legal
to invade another country and kidnap
somebody that you want and take him out
and put him on a navy ship to be
interrogated for a couple of weeks
without a lawyer and Kerry pointed out
quite accurately that it is legal it's
in conformity with US law which is
correct it is in conformity with US law
even Supreme Court rulings so that makes
it legal legal is one thing justifiable
is another we all know that a principle
of legal or moral principle is justified
if it can be generalized otherwise not
so it would be legal if in fact say that
Cuba was entitled to send special forces
to Miami to kidnap but luis rosado
careless or before him orlando Bosh
series confirmed terrorists not suspects
will don't have to comment on that what
Kerry is saying a couple of weeks ago
what Acheson said a couple of decades
ago many others have said is simply that
the United States is a rogue state it
owns the world by right it acts in the
manner of the Godfather who owns his
domains by right a striking fact is that
Kerry statement was reported so you can
read it in the back pages of the
newspapers elicited no detectable
that reflects the very wide acceptance
of the doctrine that you can tell me
whether there was any comment here
suspect not we find the same
case-by-case right throughout the Cold
War and in fact it's very striking that
as the Cold War ended in Washington
obliquely conceded that that that the
alleged Russian threat was not a crucial
part in fact almost any part of the Cold
War the reason was after the Soviet
Union decline collapsed you could no
longer invoke it to justify policies and
for people who want to understand the
nature of the Cold War that's most of
Cold War era that's the obvious place to
look take a look and see how policy was
affected by the end of the conflict
that's simple rationality and we know it
was public not even secret documents
that was at the time the first Bush
administration was in office they
quickly issued a new national security
strategy reflected the realities of the
post Cold War era and there was a basic
message the message was that nothing
essential would change
apart from new protections so it would
still be necessary to have a huge
military establishment not because of
the Russian hordes because they're not
around anymore but because of what was
called what they called the
technological sophistication of third
world powers now if you're well-educated
you're not supposed to laugh when you
hear that and if you look you find
people didn't laugh they nodded soberly
the strategy also stated that it would
be necessary to maintain what they call
the defense industrial base the defense
industrial base is a euphemism for
high-tech industry that which has to be
sustained by government power usually
under
a pentagon cover for the benefit of
corporate profits and what's about the
health of the economy so that has to be
maintained although you can't call it
defense against the Russians anymore
particularly interesting was what they
said about the Middle East
they said the strategy said it would be
necessary to maintain powerful
intervention forces targeting the Middle
East research rich area and there it
said the significant threats to US
interests could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door as had been claimed for
fifty years
so in short and sorry folks we've been
lying to you all along but now we must
concede that the threats to US interests
had to do with what's called radical
nationalism that is independent
nationalism very much as in the case of
Vietnam Cuba Iran in fact throughout
most of the world more generally a very
good case can be made that the Cold War
from its origins was basically a war by
each of the superpowers against efforts
to achieve independence in its own
domains for Russia that meant Eastern
Europe the additional invasion route for
the United States meant most of the rest
of the world now that's pretty well
supported by the very well supported by
the historical and documentary record
but such ideas are excluded from polite
discourse excluded from consideration
they're not condemned is it just
unthinkable and very similar questions
arise when you look at the other alleged
constants so take the core interest in
domestic prosperity obvious question
whose prosperity since the 1970s that's
about half the period under review
policies have been carefully designed to
enrich a tiny segment of the pop
they should fraction of 1% that well for
the majority incomes have stagnated
declined and the word designed is quite
accurate
actually these neoliberal policies are
reviewed in a recent study by the
Economic Policy Institute Washington
that's the main source the main missile
main source of reliable economic data on
these developments for many years the
document of the new this study is called
failure by design by design recognizing
that other choices have always been
possible and as the study points out the
failure is class-based there's no
failure for the designers they're doing
great rather the policies are a failure
for the large majority of the population
it's a very serious problem for working
people and the middle classes a real
disaster for the most oppressed so
african-americans who incidentally have
never escaped the legacy of slavery in
its ugly aftermath their meager wealth
virtually disappeared after the collapse
of the housing bubble in 2008 set off
the reason financial crisis the worst
one so far worse likely to come as the
system that has led to the regular
crises is being reconstituted it's worth
remembering that the financial crises
are a property of the neoliberal order
in the 50s and 60s there weren't any the
New Deal regulations were in place as
they began to be dismantled under
neoliberalism you get crisis after
crisis each one worse than the last the
public called upon to bail out the
perpetrators of time after time has just
happened and the neoliberal policies of
Washington Consensus
have had similar effects worldwide and
actually resistance to them which is now
significant there has been a major part
of the challenge to the post-war global
order in recent years the power of
established doctrine in the face of
massive counter evidence is extremely
interesting it provides a useful insight
into constraints on freedom of thought
and very free societies restriction of
oppression expression without state
violence which is a pretty interesting
essay on this by George Orwell not very
well-known it was written as the
introduction to his famous book animal
form but it's unknown because it was
unpublished it was discovered thirty
years later in his unpublished papers
the introduction is devoted to what he
calls literary censorship in England at
the book itself as you all know is a
satire on the totalitarian enemy but in
the unpublished introduction or will
comments the British readers that they
shouldn't feel that self-satisfied
because England is not that different in
free England he says ideas can be
suppressed without the use of force you
don't say much about the mechanisms a
couple of sentences but they're to the
point the first one is that he puts it
the presses owned by wealthy men who
have every reason to want certain ideas
to be suppressed but the second reason a
much more interesting one is a good
education if you've gone to the good
schools Eton Harrow Oxford Cambridge we
have our parallels if you've had a good
education you've internalized the
understanding that there are certain
things it just wouldn't do to say and we
should add even to think that's an
insight
that should be taken quite seriously and
pursued occasionally there's some
recognition of these intriguing
phenomena the the great American
humorist and political critic Mark Twain
once observed that it's by the goodness
of God that in our country we have those
three unspeakably precious things
freedom of speech freedom of conscience
and the prudence never to practice
either of them
there's also occasional notice of this
in serious scholarship in interesting
ways that one case particular interest
is hunts Morgenthau he's the founder of
the dominant hardheaded no
sentimentality really school of
international relations and his credit
he's one of the very few to condemned
what he called our conformist
subservience to those in power
speaking of the intellectual community
in the early 1960s you recall that was a
lot of exuberance about the Camelot
years kind of similar to the exuberance
when Obama was elected very short-lived
too long but short during that period
the Kennedy the Camelot image has
remained and partly because Kennedy was
assassinated so everyone forgets what
actually happened but it's not
dissimilar working at that time wrote a
book called the purpose of America
and book extolled the prevailing
doctrine called American exceptionalism
which holds that I said that the u.s. is
unlike other great powers because it's
guided by what Morgan's out called
an a transcendent purpose to uphold
equality and freedom in the United
States and throughout the world
now Morgenthau was an honest and
competent scholar and he recognized that
the historical record is radically
inconsistent with America's transcendent
purpose but he explains that we should
not let that mislead us rather we should
not I'm quoting and we should not
confound the abuse of reality with
reality itself the reality itself is the
unachieved Nash
purpose revealed by the evidence of
history as our minds reflected the
actual historical record is abusive
reality which is only of secondary
interest and he goes on to say that
those who confound reality with abusive
reality are committing the error of
atheism which denies the validity of
religion on similar grounds and it's an
apt analogy though not exactly in the
manner he intended the reigning
doctrines can appropriately be regarded
as a secular religion it differs from
other religious commitments and the
number of ways that one of them is that
it is so deeply entrenched that it's
invisible believers and say evangelical
Christianity are aware that they have
religious beliefs but not if you are a
believer in the second or religion
adequate education then it's kind of
like the area breeze there's no
conceivable alternative this is quite
unlike medieval theology to read
medieval theology you find very
interesting discussions of heresy Thomas
Aquinas and others felt that it was
critically important to refute heresy
but for the secular religion refutation
is not even necessary if necessary at
all it can be a few derisive remarks
about the veloute left or something like
that the transcendent purpose that
Morgenthau attributed to the United
States is often called wilsonian
idealism and Wilson's public discourse
it was in fact idealistic but not in
practice and practice he was one of the
most brutal and destructive
interventionists and his famous concept
of self-determination was quite sharply
restricted it excluded those
who he called those who in his words
were at a low level of civilization
those in the colonies they he said must
be given friendly protection guidance
and assistance by the colonial powers
that had hitherto cared for them with
such tenderness his Secretary of State
Robert Lansing understood the doctrine
very well referring to policies and
official discourse concerning Latin
America Lansing pointed out that the
idealistic flourishes were just a
rhetorical cover policies he said are
based on selfishness alone the United
States considers its own interests the
integrity of other American nations is
an incident not an end and Wilson in
fact agreed but he advised that it would
be in politic that to say this publicly
the public have no right to know what's
none of their business
the abuse the abusive reality in actual
history well let's turn from the
interesting topic of doctrinal
constraints on freedom of thought which
is I think quite valuable to consider
let's turn from that and look to what
look at what Morgan thell called the
abusive reality that is what actually
happens in the world well the United
States is one of the great virtues of
the United States is that it's an
unusually free country and we have easy
access to rich internal records so those
who want to learn something about
planning that can easily find out
there's no shortage of information about
how plans were implemented if it's not
used it's again the results of a good
education you're not supposed to look
but you can find out so let's look at
the American decline the American
decline that now play is such elicits
such concern
it does play an important role in the
emerging world order but it's worth
remembering that it's not a recent
phenomenon it traces back 75 years to
the end of the Second World War in 1945
the United States reached the absolute
peak of its power in fact power without
any precedent in world history other
industrial societies had been destroyed
or severely weakened the United States
gained an enormous Lee from the war
depression that was ended by government
spending
industrial production almost quadrupled
at that point the United States had half
the entire wealth of the world
incomparable security global reach
nothing like that in history and
planners were well aware of it they
recognized the enormous disparity of
power as they called it between the
United States and other countries and
they intended to keep it that way not
surprisingly they developed elaborate
plans for World Order each region was a
sign that's functioned within the global
system that was supposed to be organized
by US power and the idea was that the US
would control the Western Hemisphere as
a matter of course it would also control
the entire Far East the former British
Empire Britain would become a junior
partner including of course the Middle
East and as much of Eurasia as possible
but at a minimum the commercial
industrial centers Western Central
Europe these early post-war policies
were not unrealistic given the
distribution of power to make good sense
to pursue them but decline said in at
once in 1949 the China declared
independence that event is known and
the United States and Western discourse
generally it's known as the loss of
China in the United States they're
bitter recriminations this conflict
about who was responsible for the loss
that's a good part of what lay behind
the McCarthyism and the terminology is
quite revealing loss of China it's only
possible to lose something that you own
like I can't lose your cellphone I can
lose myself I can't lose yours but we
lost China and the question is who's
responsible for it
there's a tacit assumption the United
States owns China by right and it owns
most of the rest of the world just as
post war planners assumed and when Kerry
recently says that invading another
country and kidnapping people is legal
by American law and therefore illegal
he's essentially saying the same thing
and no comment on the loss of China was
a major step in America's decline a very
major step and have had major policy
consequences immediately the one policy
consequence was the decision to support
France's effort to reconquer its former
colony in Indochina
so that Indochina would not be lost and
as I mentioned there's good reasons for
that the rational choice as I mentioned
was to destroy the virus of potential
successful development independent
development in Indochina and to
inoculate the rest of the region with
brutal dictatorships and those tasks
were quite successfully carried out
although history has its own cunning and
something similar to what was feared has
since been developing in East Asia and
much to Washington's dismay well despite
many victories in destroying viruses and
maintaining control American decline can
by the early 1970s US the US share of
world wealth had declined to about 25%
roughly where it remains now that's
still colossal but it's not 50% far
below the end of World War two
by then the industrial world was what
was called tri-polar at three major
economic centres in north america based
in the United States German based Europe
and Northeast Asia
already the most dynamic industrial
region of the world by the early
seventies at the time it was Japan based
and now it includes the former Japanese
colonies at Taiwan and South Korea and
more recently China well at about that
time the American decline entered into a
new phase a phase of conscious
self-inflicted decline that's the
failure by design that I already
mentioned the economy was shifted
radically towards the financialization
production sent abroad great success for
the masters not for the population and
harmful to the economy and society
generally wealth concentrated within
that most reflexively leads to a
concentration of political power that
leads to legislation which carries the
vicious cycle forward that's what's been
going on for the last generation
particularly under Reagan and also his
successors well as also as as it's
pretty well known you all know the
neoliberal assault on the general
population has concentrated
extraordinary wealth in the hands of
literally a fraction of 1% of the
population for the large majority
incomes of stagnated or declined the
political influence of goes along with
it now you take a look at the mainstream
political academic political science in
the United States that one of the main
topics studies is the relation between
policy and opinions the policy you can
see opinions that you know pretty well
because of careful extensive polling and
so you can compare the two and there's a
huge gap between policy and opinion on
crucial issues the marginalization of
the public has become so extreme that
for roughly seventy percent of the
population the lower seventy percent on
the income wealth scale they literally
have no influence on policy political
leaders just pay no attention to them
and significant influence is
concentrated at the very peak of the
radically unequal income pyramid well
meanwhile losses continued to mount
elsewhere past decade has been quite
spectacular in that respect in the last
decade for the first time in five
hundred years South America has taken
successful steps to free itself from
Western domination that's a development
of truly historic importance and a very
serious blow to u.s. imperial power the
region had suffered severely from
neoliberal policies of the Washington
Consensus and it has in the last decade
sought with some success to dismantle
them the countries have begun to move
towards integration to prerequisite
independence and they have begun to
address some of the terrible internal
problems of societies that are ruled by
small very small mostly Europeanized
often white elites
the tiny islands of extreme wealth and
sea of misery and basically pretty rich
countries they've also almost rid
themselves of US military bases and also
of IMF controls that's pretty
spectacular and the effects are very
clear they were dramatically visible at
a hemispheric conference in Colombia a
couple of years ago there were the
conference couldn't reach a consensus so
no Declaration was ever put out and the
reason was there were two major issues
and on these issues the US and Canada
refused to go along with the hemisphere
so no consensus the issues were
admission of Cuba into the hemispheric
system US and Canada refused everyone
else was in favor of it and the second
was the drug war the u.s. drug war it's
devastated the continent that the
problem of the drugs is here United
States primarily that's the source of
demand it's also the supply and supply
of arms so you know tens of thousands of
people are killed in Mexico if you there
have been some studies of the arms that
were used the majority of them come from
the United States from the border states
Arizona Texas walk into a store pick up
an assault rifle and hand it over to the
guy from the cartel who's standing there
that's the source of the problem Latin
America is being severely harmed by it
and on both of these issues the United
States and Canada were isolated in
opposition to the rest of the hemisphere
and if there is another hemispheric
conference the two North American
countries might simply not even be
invited the traditional what's called
backyard is no more that's serious but
even more serious it would be the loss
of what are called the men our country's
Middle East North Africa
the Arab springs very far from having
achieved it's the promise that many
hoped for but there were treatments it's
another development of historic
importance which I'm sure is going to
continue and it might portend loss
so-called of Menna
the US and its allies have tried very
hard to prevent the major threat in the
region that's the threat of
democratization and so far they've had
some success their policies towards the
popular uprisings have kept very closely
to standard guidelines support the
forces most amenable to US influence
favored dictators are supported up until
the moment when it becomes when they
can't maintain control it's impossible
to sustain them any longer so maybe the
army turns against them okay then you
have to drop them send them off to
pasture somewhere and try to restore the
old regime and where you can maintain
control under dictatorships do it and
that's been achieved in the most
important places the major oil States
and the Bahrain the the general pattern
is completely familiar I said I won't
run through the detailed examples but if
you think of the record of some of the
Marcos Suharto case after case support
the dictators as long as possible
can't do it any longer send them off
somewhere try to restore the old regime
that's exactly what was done in Tunisia
in Egypt with varying degrees of success
one case was a little different Libya
there are the three traditional imperial
powers that France England in the United
States virtually alone and without world
support often
powerful opposition
enter the most powerful opposition
actually was in Africa Livia's an
African state the African Union had
positions that they were calling for
negotiations to try to avoid the
humanitarian catastrophe that was likely
to result and indeed did result from
intervention but the three imperial
powers didn't want that they wanted
intervention they achieved it they
participated in a rebellion to overthrow
a kind of a difficult character
unreliable dictator and they opened the
way it's hoped at least to potential
control over Libya's extensive oil
resources and also to a possible base
for the u.s. Africa Command and quite
significantly to reversal of Chinese
penetration in Libya there were tens of
thousands of Chinese technicians and
others who had to withdraw there's a
consequence the consequences that Libya
apart from the killings and so on
Libya's been left in the hands of rival
militias fighting turf battles pretty
severe severe enough to have almost
totally curtailed the export of oil
production of oil on which the economy
relies meanwhile the Syrian horror story
continues plunge towards suicide if you
look over the whole region as few there
have been few surprises very crucially
for Western powers it's important to try
to reduce the threat of democracy of
course they plead commitment to
democracy all the time but everybody
says that it's meaningless even
installing said the words or meanings
you have to look at the policies and
there's a very good reason why the US
and its allies strongly opposed
democracy in the region very simple
reason you can figure it out easily
there are extensive polls of public
opinion in the Arab world taken by the
major
US and other Western polling agencies
and they are pretty consistent over time
so for example right on the eve of the
Tahrir Square uprising in Egypt February
2011 the worm ate there was a major US
poll of Egyptian public opinion they
found that Egyptian although Egyptians
strongly dislike Iran most of the Arabs
do with old hostilities they don't
regard Iran as a threat only a few
percent regarded Iran as a threat that
they do regard other countries as
threats the united states and israel
overwhelming majorities regard them as
the threats in fact such a severe threat
that back at that time the majority of
Egyptians actually favored iran's they
hoped that Iran would develop nuclear
weapons
as a counterpart there's a counterweight
to the real threat that they face of the
US and Israel there are similar results
throughout the region varying slightly
but roughly like that in polls
consistently so of course it's natural
necessary to try to block democracy that
democracy means that public opinion will
influence policy certainly don't want
those ideas to become policy so
opposition and the democracy in the men
our countries is the same as opposition
to democracy at home you don't want
public opinion to influence policy well
there's a lot more to say about the
region particularly about Israel and
Iran which are the leading concerns of
policy but no time to go into that other
critical topics should be looked at are
the growing role of China and India and
world affairs it's real but you
shouldn't fall prey to illusions about
the potential global power of these
countries they're very poor country
they face enormous internal problems
unknown in the West and for the
foreseeable future at least there's no
challenge the u.s. global domination
even though it continues to erode a lot
to a large extent under self-inflicted
blows that became particularly evident
in the last few weeks during this
strange farce in Washington it
astonished most of the world it
astonished and frightened even the
international financial institutions the
World Bank and the IMF that was one
commentator and the Chinese press who
captured the general mood he said that
unless the United States learns how to
behave like a responsible adult the
sense of all participating participant
in global order and that incidentally
'he's not asking much but unless the
u.s. can reach that stage then he said
the world will have to become
de-americanized
it'll have to separate itself from the
erratic rogue state that's the hegemonic
military power but it's losing whatever
other credibility it might have actually
that's not entirely novel observation
you go back to say the late 90s the
professor of what was called the science
of Government at Harvard notable the
room flexural Samuel Huntington wrote an
article in foreign affairs made an
establishment journal in which he said
that this is 1999 he said that in the
eyes of much of the world he suggests
probably most of the world the United
States is becoming the rogue superpower
considered the single greatest threat to
their societies and he warned that this
is not a good idea
he had pragmatic objections counter
forces will develop it's pretty much as
the Chinese spokesman observed a couple
of weeks ago well just how far this
self-inflicted decline
we'll proceed it's not entirely clear
it's a matter of intense concern to the
corporate sector and to the Republican
establishment you've been reading that
in the business press in the last couple
of weeks they can barely manage to
control the extremist forces that they
mobilized as a kind of a battering ram
to carry the neoliberal assault further
they can't control them there are
similar questions elsewhere Europe's
policies of austerity under recession
are so destructive that they actually
make the u.s. look progressive in
comparison it's not a joke by now
they're even eliciting criticism from
the IMF well these are among many
significant developments some extent
imponderables that really do merit close
study but it's not enough just it's
important to study them and understand
them but of course we all know that's
not enough it's not enough to just
observe the world but also to act to
change it to remedy its severe ills
paraphrase Marx that's the commitment of
the journal and I know of all of you
