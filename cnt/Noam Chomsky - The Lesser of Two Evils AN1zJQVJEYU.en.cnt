you were pretty explicit when I
interviewed you earlier this year that
progressives should vote against Trump
and if that you were in a swing state
you would have voted for Clinton as the
lesser of two evils a lot of
progressives didn't agree with you a lot
of young Millennials they voted for
third party candidates like Gary Johnson
and Jill Stein or they stayed at home
and didn't turn out saying Trump Clinton
what's the difference they're all the
same what's your message to those voters
today who refuse to vote for Trump or
refuse to vote to stop Trump what's your
message them now that he's won and he's
in the White House same as before I
think they're making a bad mistake
first of all I missed it there are two
issues that one is a kind of a moral
issue do you vote against the greater
evil if you don't happen to like the
other candidate the answer to that is
yes if you have any moral understanding
they want to keep the greater evil out
second is a factual question
how to Trump and Clinton compared and I
think they're very different I didn't
like Clinton at all but her positions
are much better than Trump's on every
issue I can think of and I interviewed
Slava Dziedzic the leftist philosopher
Slovenian critic who you've criticized
in the past on this show recently he
said in a kind of Maoist revolutionary
terms he said Trump would shake up the
system and could end up being a positive
force in terms of undermining the status
quo does he have a point
terrible point there was the same point
that people like him said about Hitler
in the early 30s because it backfires in
the end he'll shake up the system in bad
ways
the what what the what it means is now
the left instead of if Clinton had won
she had some progressive programs the
left could have been organized to
keeping her feet to the fire and pushing
them through what it'll be doing now is
trying to protect rights that have been
gains that have been achieved from being
destroyed that's completely regressive
