that led the virtual hysteria in the
United States the Neiman fellows that
journalism fellows at Harvard off
immediately gave the owner of La Prensa
violeta chamorro an award The Washington
Post had a big editorial saying she
deserves 10 awards know that's a
newspaper of Valor that was the head of
thee that was the heading the Murray
Kempton the left liberal columnist in
the New York Review issued a plea to
people to provide funds for La Prensa to
keep its equipment going that this one's
could be added to the rather substantial
CIA subvention till the prince ever
since 1979 and on and on well what is La
Prensa the prince has an interesting
newspaper is probably unique in history
it's often believed that La Prensa is
the newspaper that courageously opposed
this the Somoza dictatorship and if you
read the press that's what you would
believe well it does have the same name
as that newspaper but that's about where
it ends in 1980 the right after this
under mr. revolution the owners of La
Prensa fired the editor and eighty
percent of the staff left with him
because the staff and the editor refused
to support their Pro contra policy now
the editor and the staff formed another
newspaper on the wave of the audio and
if a newspaper is constituted of its
editor and its staff that's the old la
prensa if a newspaper is constituted of
the money that's behind it well of
course the new the princess the old la
Princesse you just decide how to decide
know what a newspaper is is it the staff
and the editor or is it the owners and
the equipment this you'll never read
about but it's a fact now the new La
Prensa supports the overthrow of the
government by foreign power and does it
quite openly and it's funded by the
foreign power that is trying to
overthrow the government now that's
pretty unusual in fact I can't think of
any remote parallel in history of the
Western democracies so for example
during the Second World War
England did not permit Nazi Germany to
putt to fund and run a major newspaper
in London and the United States did not
permit Japan say to dominate you know to
invest in and run a major newspaper
coming out of New York in fact the may
not be 0 that far England and the United
States imposed harsh censorship they
wouldn't even let tiny little dissident
newspapers go through the mails or
appear and so on there's no power
there's no remote parallel in Western
history to this as far as I can see this
incidentally is never mentioned in media
commentary well nevertheless a true
civil libertarian will defend la prensa
from harassment even though this is
unique in human history this fact
because of you're a real civil
libertarian you think that the United
States should have allowed Japan and
Germany to dominate the American media
during the Second World War you're a
real civil libertarian but we now ask
when that we now make the obvious
question i mean we ask whether the you
know the great excitement virtual
hysteria of American intellectuals over
la prensa is reflects their libertarian
passions or whether it's because they
believe or whether it's because they're
serving power as a propaganda model
predicts that's a fair question and
there's a test there's an obvious test
and we all know how to apply it it's a
test that we apply all the time when we
look at our enemies so for example
suppose you take a look at the
productions of the East German peace
group or the world peace cannot slow
which is sort of communist front
organization you read their publicity
there and you'll see that they have a
lot of criticisms of the United States
often very valid criticisms in fact
their critical discussion of repression
in the United States and in US
dependencies not only is often valid but
it's often the kind of thing that's not
reported here well do we honor them for
that no of course not we regard them
with contempt and the reason is because
we apply a very simple and obvious test
we ask what do they say about the
repression and atrocities for which
they're responsible where they say about
Soviet repression and atrocities
as soon as we find out the answer to
that question we just simply dismiss
them with contempt rightly you begin by
talking about your own responsibilities
and then sort of you know on a footnote
somewhere you can talk about the bad
things done by other guys at least if
you regard yourself as a moral agent you
know somebody worthy of minimal respect
and attention we understand that in the
case of our enemies and we might have
enough honesty to apply the same test to
ourselves so let's try it we can now
apply the test we have this tremendous
libertarian passion / la prensa the
first newspaper in history to be funded
by a foreign power calling for the
overthrow of the government in which it
appears in which it's published and
remember this is not a major power it's
not like the United States which was
never under threat during the Second
World War there's a poor third world
country which is barely able to survive
the attack of the super power so that we
have that and we can ask how the same
press has reacted to other examples of
repression during the same period in
fact in the same area well there are
test cases so let's try a few let's take
out salvador right nearby except the US
client there once was an independent
press in el salvador two small
newspapers La cronica on elit
independente two small newspapers they
were not supported by a foreign power
trying to overthrow the government they
were not particularly left-wing they
were independent run by businessmen they
sort of challenged the distribution of
power you know they said maybe we should
have some land reform or something like
that well they're not around anymore
they're not around because the
government that we arm fun train and
support sented security forces to
destroy them one newspaper was
eliminated by the simple device of
taking an editor and a photojournalist
who were in a Sun Salvador restaurant
taking them out security forces went in
took them outside cut them to pieces
with machetes and left them in a ditch
at that point the owner fled and at the
Cara one newspaper the second newspaper
the harder took several bombings three
assassination attempts on the editor
finally the army surrounded the premises
with tanks and then
broke in and smashed the place up and
destroyed it they had previously a
machine-gunning attack had killed a
newsboy at that point the editor fled
that took care of the second newspaper
well that was eight years ago so we can
now ask how much attention did that
receive that's an example of a violation
of freedom of the press a little more
severe than the harassment of La Prensa
well doesn't answer to that you can
check the New York Times for example it
has never received one word of mention
in the new york times news columns it
has never received one editorial mention
in all of these years and the same is
true the other media simply doesn't
matter these are atrocities committed by
our clients the guys we pay and trained
to do that sort of thing so all of a
sudden they are concerned for freedom of
the press disappears or let's take
another US client in fact the major u.s.
client Israel which receives by far the
major US aid and is again not a small
country under attack by a superpower
well here here to history has set up
some interesting tests the same at
exactly the same time that Nicaragua
suspended La Prensa after the virtual
declaration of war in violation of the
world court proceedings at the very same
time Israel closed down closed down
permanently to Jerusalem newspapers Arab
newspapers of course closed down to
Jerusalem newspapers on the charge that
the security forces had claimed that
they were supported by a terrorist group
by a hostile group well that went all
the way to the Supreme Court and Supreme
Court judge that that was legitimate
because in it as it explained in its
judgment no state will ever permit a
business no matter how legitimate it is
that's supported by hostile elements and
although we have freedom of speech in
Israel it does not extend to activities
that might threaten the security of the
state we all how much cover that's much
more severe than what happened in a la
prensa k so how much coverage did that
get well actually that did get one
mention in the US press it was mentioned
in a letter of mine
Boston Globe commenting on the hypocrisy
the Neiman fellows notice that the they
did not give a prize to these editors in
fact that was never even reported after
the Central America peace accords La
Prensa was opened the week right at the
time it was opened Israel closed a
Nazareth newspaper that's inside Israel
closed the Nazareth newspaper
permanently on grounds that it had it
was supported again by hostile elements
the editor again went to the Supreme
Court pleaded that everything that
appeared in the newspaper passed through
censorship that was disregarded on the
grounds that if the state says it's
supported by hostile elements that's all
that's required you never need any
evidence when the state comes along and
says security reasons the courts just
accepted they also closed the news
office and noblesse on the grounds that
the editor who would our event who was
already in jail in fact he was in jail
for having alleged not without charge
without legal charge on the claim that
he had contact with hostile elements his
wife had been running in newspapers
claimed that she'd maintained those
contexts they closed the press office
well how much coverage did that get in
there in the US press answered as far as
I can find 0
