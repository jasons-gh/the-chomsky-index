while children yeah yeah well those are
again these are the so-called wild
children you know the wild boy they're
almost the famous example that we're
called children were supposed to be
raised by wolves or something about the
past stuff from the past you really
don't know how to evaluate very well
there were you don't know what the
history of the children was okay there
are modern cases that have contemporary
cases that have been studied carefully
like the one in Los Angeles Jeannie who
was a kid who was had you know kind of
psychotic parent father at least who
locked her in a room at around age two I
think and she never got out and never
spoke to her he just grunted at her and
threw food at her sort of thing she may
have heard some noises coming from the
window somewhere or other nobody knows
but basically she had no human
experiences you know the linguistic
experiences she was found by I think a
social worker or something when she was
around
I think around 13 or so and a person
immediately taken out put under care and
so on and one of the things that was
done was some of her caretakers were in
fact psychologists and linguists and
they try to take care of her teachers
much could you bring her into the world
as much as they could but also to
investigate what was going on so what
could you acquire and Coogi acquire what
already know without any experience and
so on and there's a lot of work on this
unfortunately it's not clear what it
tells you because naturally Jeannie is
completely psychotic I mean nobody could
go through an experience like that and
be anything like a normal human being so
you don't know how much of what you're
finding is just you know massive damage
again like hitting a computer with a
crowbar and how much is really specific
to these various faculties in the ways
they develop this is again one of those
natural experiments and I mean there's
some this interesting work of Susan
Curtiss
Susan Curtis did the most serious work
on this just booking a lot of papers and
it tells you what could be discovered
but the Summum grossly speaking it
turned out that she was very she was
quite intelligent she could do all sorts
of things and she was also apparently
quite you know appealing she knew how to
manipulate people and get them to do
things and so on and at first they
thought she was getting understanding
language but it turns out she was just
using her intelligence and you know
coquettish skills and various other
things to make people think she was
doing it and when they investigated more
seriously she couldn't really do
anything much with language on the other
hand she had lots of other rich
conceptual structure like she understood
all sources immediately without any
experience right in the hospital solving
complicated conceptual problems and so
on but you hardly know what this means
because any defect that was found you
don't know whether to attribute it to
late
language delay development of language
or to general psychosis
unfortunately the ends it was a very sad
story she ended up being kind of a
vegetable through various maltreatment
and so on and there are a few other
cases like there are some cases which
aren't that you know what you're less
RFI which are very instructive so a
couple of years ago some psychologist in
Philadelphia and students of lilac
Lightman whose very one leading
cognitive psychologists they discovered
the children that up until fairly
recently it was assumed that deaf
children didn't have any language it's
now known that that's totally false that
the language of the Deaf is very much
like ordinary language just the
different modality but it's a lot of
same properties and develops the same
way and so it's just another language
flexpa healing uses a different modality
they discovered a couple of kids cousins
who had been brought up in what's called
an oralist tradition fortunately mostly
did but it was the orthodoxy for a long
time the orthodoxy was that if kids are
hearing disabled you shouldn't allow
them to learn sign language
you should force them to lip read it's a
little bit like saying you should force
kids to learn English whatever
which is the and that was very damaging
it prevented normal mental and
intellectual and linguistic development
that's all gone for it mostly gone by
now
fortunately anyhow these kids were
brought up in this oralist tradition
their parents had been heavily
indoctrinated not to teach him sign
parents were speaking non you know had
spoken language in fact the parents were
told by the you know therapists and so
on not to even gesture to the kids so
you know walk around like this so that
they don't get any gestures so they're
forced to do lip-reading and this had
going on for a couple of years
kids right three or four when they found
them but they played together and it
turns out that they had invented their
own language with the zero evidence you
know this is a cake this is a perfect
almost perfect experiment that had no
input it just created their own language
a sign language and it turned out to be
it approximately approximately the
character of normal language ability you
know you take kids of the same age in a
normal environment that's about they'd
be doing about the same thing you know
same structures in complexity and so on
and so forth well ok the experiment of
course was ended as soon as they found
the kids then they just put on American
Sign Language but there are a couple of
cases like that
there's one really interesting case
which is being investigated right now
port but farmer student where they're my
team they found in Nicaragua a community
of non people who are seriously hearing
disabled who just over time had created
their own language and it's now just the
language that kids learn as the
when it's the languages use and so on
but again with no input so it just
developed and that's kind of a natural
case there are other things like that
so-called Creoles some of the same
properties languages that are created
you know but for example in slave
communities where you bring people
together from any different linguistic
groups and they're sort of stuck
together they can rather quickly in fact
to create a common language called
Creoles and these are just like ordinary
languages as far as anybody knows and
the way in which they're constructed you
know does it tell you something about
the the essential nature of language
just as these these other cases do
including Lee so hope you know while but
those are becoming heart that they are
restricted in what you can learn from
them because of the complexity of the
conditions in which they've developed
