Hello, first of all, thank you very much for your presence. I learned a lot by listening to what you said to us. 
My question is precisely about Iran and nuclear weapons 
And the discussion I raised about Iran and the international community 
I certainly understand the idea of   a state 
Possessing or developing a nuclear weapon to protect itself 
Or to be on an equal footing with other countries as is the case with the great powers 
Or at the same level as the super powers because they are countries that possess nuclear weapons in any case 
However, what do you do when a country tries to develop or acquire a Moai weapon? 
Quite frankly, it threatens to destroy another country and remove it from existence 
I mean, the two situations we're dealing with are completely different 
I am interested in what you put forward, but I do not think you touched on this topic 
This is true, but what do we do if a country has already developed a nuclear weapon? 
Outside the NPT? 
On a daily basis, it burns the resolutions of the UN Security Council and the IAEA 
This is a more serious problem 
This is another issue, because these countries do not publicly threaten to destroy another country 
Neither does Iran 
Let's take a look at the statements, those that I do not think belonged - as it is said - to Khomeini 
In the period of the alliance between the United States and Iran, I mean between Israel and Iran. And Israel did not give it any attention (Khomeini's remarks) 
(These statements) are still being repeated. These statements - as you know - mean that Israel will, with the passage of time, disappear 
Well, I really agree with that, too 
In fact, many in Israel also believe this, and believe that one democratic country must be established 
This is not an announcement to destroy anyone 
In fact, Iran supports international efforts to solve the two states (Palestine and Israel). 
In fact, there are two countries that not only declare that another country should be destroyed, but in reality they do so 
They are Israel and the United States 
This is their position regarding the Palestinians. They are not satisfied with saying that 
clap 
I confirm, they not only say it, but they practice it on a daily basis 
This is what Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza Strip mean before our eyes 
This is what we support and pay for 
Of course, you should not call for the destruction of another country 
You should not do that either 
It is the official position of Israel, and is backed by the United States 
They modified it a little, but considering the official position declared twenty years ago 
And issued by the coalition that arose between the Conservative (Likud) and Labor parties. And here I quote "There is no room" "I quote" " 
An additional Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan 
In other words, they are declaring, with the support of the United States, that there is an existing Palestinian state, Jordan 
And the Palestinians object, you know 
They say "Wait, no, this is not our country," but those who worry about them 
We (Israel and America) say it is your country, and there will be no other country 
Well, we have gone further than destroying another country 
I mean, this is just like a person would come 
Suppose Ahmadinejad (former President of Iran) said that the Jews do not need the State of Israel, because they have a state in New York 
Well, I mean, you know, we'll say he's a Nazi. But this is the official position 
The official position of Israel and the United States. So there is a lot about Iran's positions 
Of course, no one wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon, and of course any other country 
It is (the Iranian regime) undoubtedly a lost regime. In any case, there are worse regimes, but they are our allies 
I am not talking about Israel, but rather about other Arab countries 
For example, Iran is a paradise of rights compared to Saudi Arabia 
But of course, there is no doubt that it (the Iranian regime) is terrible 
There is a way to deal with it. For example, creating a nuclear-weapon-free zone 
But the strategists, among them Israelis 
They do not disagree about Iran's attempt to acquire the ability to acquire nuclear weapons 
Which is completely different from acquiring a nuclear weapon 
It is the situation that makes you able to possess a nuclear weapon (without obtaining it), as in the case of most developed countries 
Like Japan, Italy and others 
It is very simple. In fact it is described 
An Israeli military expert 
Martin Van Krefeld several years ago, after the invasion of Iraq 
He wrote an article in which he said he did not know if Iran was developing a nuclear weapon and he hoped it would not 
But he said that if they do not develop one, they are free 
This is what he said if they do not develop, then they are free. The United States has just announced 
I will attack whoever you like, and we will attack you if we can and with us immunity 
So it is better to develop a deterrent 
OK 
Maybe they develop a deterrent 
No serious expert expects (Iran) to use nuclear weapons 
Even if Iran possesses nuclear weapons, which no one wants 
I mean even if they possess and release nuclear weapons, their country will evaporate 
A moment and without a doubt 
The clerics in Iran as you know are terrible, but they do not appear 
Desire for devastating suicide, for everything they own and appreciate 
This applies to their diversion of nuclear weapons 
If there are real suspicions that Iran is doing so, with the safety of Iran 
The probability that he will use it, is equal to the probability that he will hit the Earth meteorite or something similar 
It is a serious problem, in fact, the Israeli writers are clear about that 
Iranian nuclear weapons are a threat to Zionism, not to Israel 
This is what they fear, if the area becomes very dangerous 
The residents of Israel will leave 
People who have money, education, etc. will leave 
Because they do not want to live in a place under threat 
In fact, migration is a serious problem 
Immigration of learners and trainers 
They will leave because they do not want to face danger 
But I don't think there is a strategist, at least I haven't seen one 
It is believed that Iran will use a nuclear weapon 
If they do, it is a complete regression
