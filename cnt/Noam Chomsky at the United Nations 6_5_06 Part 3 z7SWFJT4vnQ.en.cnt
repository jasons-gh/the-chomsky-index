professor Chomsky in recent weeks we've
seen fighting breakout within the
occupied territories Hamas and Fatah as
including some gun battles in the
streets and I'd like to hear your take
on that I'd like to know what that means
for the future of the
israeli-palestinian conflict well it's
it's it's a serious internal conflict
that's it's not the major issue they're
far from the major issue the most
important events that are taking place
in the occupied territories are the
us-israeli programs which are not
rhetoric they're being implemented
programs of an Xing the valuable land
and the primary resources including the
water crucial water resources breaking
up what remains of the West Bank into
unviable pretty much disconnected
Canton's with big infrastructure
projects and the wall and so on and
imprisoning the remnants totally totally
surrounding them with Israeli occupied
territory well that's really serious if
those u.s. Israeli programs are
implemented it's the end of Palestine
and that's the major issue that we
should be concerned with that is
described in the United States almost
universally it's described as a
courageous program of withdrawal it's
not a courageous program of withdrawal
it's an outrageous program of annexation
and perhaps the most extreme program
that has certainly been implemented or
even contemplated that's really serious
there are internal problems within the
Palestinian within Palestinian society
right now mainly in Gaza Gaza has been
turned by the occupation into an utter
hellhole is the main reason why Israel
pulled out it's a few thousand settlers
and it's almost none viable I mean it's
completely surrounded as no control of
its territories it's a huge poverty
unemployment and there's big split
between the old Fatah and the new Hamas
and it yes it's showing up in
military confrontation we should be
asking ourselves what can we do about it
I mean I'm not giving advice to the
Palestinians what can we do about it
well we can relieve the circumstances in
which these confrontations are taking
place and for example right now the
United States primarily Israel too of
course and to an extent the European
Union are carrying out a a really
vicious program of trying to starve the
Palestinians into submission because
they voted in a free election in a way
that we don't like I mean that should be
arousing a storm of protest well we can
relieve that and help create
circumstances in which maybe their
existence will be viable that's not
going to end the internal conflict among
the Palestinians but it would mitigate
it and that's a step that can be taken
it should be taken quite apart from the
conflict talk a lot about international
law in this book and in other books
there's Security Council resolution
15:59 on Lebanon which calls and on all
militias to be disarmed you recently
visited Hezbollah can you tell us what
you think of his behind that light and
does it violate the Security Council
resolution and international law and can
you tell us why elated but the
government of Lebanon does the
government of Lebanon has been unwilling
to implement that component of the
Security Council resolution should they
implement it well you know that's up to
the Lebanese there's Hezbollah is a
major political party in Lebanon in the
South it has allegedly about 80% support
and the rest of the support is mostly to
a mall which has very similar similar
programs the polls indicate that a
majority of the population does not
think that they should disarm but that's
for them to decide is for the government
of Lebanon
is it it's up for the get if you think
that the government of Lebanon is
violating international law then
convinced the Security Council to
sanction them that's right yes but yes
but militias are not responsive to any
more than I am I'm if the Security
Council says that if the security if
Security Council passes a resolution
saying that I should move to some other
part of the city I don't have to do it
that's up to no because an individual
doesn't violate international law
international law is imposed on States
okay and states can observe
international law or like the United
States and Britain and others it can
radically violate international law it's
up to the people of Lebanon and the
government of Lebanon to decide whether
they want Chris bola to disarm the
state's might if you have credible
evidence just as the United States right
yes just as the United States radically
violates international law by providing
massive by providing massive arms - yeah
I understand what you want you want to
understand you want to concentrate on
some minor footnote in the whole story
and I suggest that we look at the whole
story all right turning to your minor
footnote yes which is natural for
someone who accepts and purse and wants
to pursue the policies of powerful
States turning to that minor footnote
whether Hezbollah should disarm is a
matter for the people of Lebanon to
decide they have a semi democratic
government very sectarian but it's got
democratic forms and if they decide
that's Hezbollah should disarm yes then
it should disarm why aren't they doing
it well there's a reason that you may
not want to think about it but the
Lebanese think about it
the reason is that they know very well
that a guerrilla formation in southern
Lebanon is the only potential deterrent
to yet another us-backed Israeli
invasion there have been for us-backed
is Israeli invasions since 1978 violent
and brutal ones they were finally driven
out after 22 years of occupying southern
Lebanon in violation of Security Council
resolutions and they're driven out by
guerrilla warfare and the the retaining
remaining potential for guerrilla
warfare is the only deterrent for
another invasion
well should live in and decide that they
needed the turrent now it's up to them
to decide it's up to them to decide and
if if if they are violating Security
Council resolution then they should be
treated exactly the way the US and
Israel are treated when they radically
violate Security Council resolutions so
for example if you really think the
Security Council resolution should be
enforced then I'm with you but let's
take the big case so for example let's
start with the UN Charter which makes it
a which is the foundation of modern
international law and makes it it makes
it it calls aggressive war the supreme
crime that's the Nuremberg principle
accepted by the United Nations
aggression is the supreme international
crime gross violation of the UN Charter
so fine let's and remember the supreme
international crime encompasses all the
evil that follows right that's the
nuremberg decision accepted by the UN so
fine let's start punishing the serious
violators of international law like the
country people are sitting in the White
House yeah I think international law
should be enforced the major vial and we
can go down for a whole series of other
violations so for example I thought the
UN resolutions calling for Security
Council resolutions calling for Israel
to withdraw from southern Lebanon should
have been enforced for 22 years but they
weren't and I'm sure you didn't care
about it or if he did let me know that's
the that should have been enforced they
finally did with drove under guerrilla
warfare the separation wall which is
part of
the annexation program of the West Bank
has been declared illegal by a unanimous
judgment of the World Court including
the US justice country to what you may
believe if you read his independent
declaration you'll say that he agrees
with that so that's a unanimous
declaration of the World Court you know
that that's binding an international law
that should be enforced instead people
like us are helping to violate that law
by supporting the annexation program and
the US and tacitly European Union
support for it so sure I would like to
see all international law enforced but
if we're going to be serious about it we
don't just take some toothpick on a
mountain which happens to conform to
power interests in the powerful states
and say okay let's focus on that what we
do is look at the whole picture
start with the serious cases then when
we get down to the toothpicks on the
mountain we can pay some attention to
them also paying some attention to the
reasons why probably a majority of the
population in Lebanon thinks they needed
to turn
