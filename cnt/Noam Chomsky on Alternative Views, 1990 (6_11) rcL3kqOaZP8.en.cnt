in both cases well I gears to hear some
real controlled experiments that history
was kind enough to set up for us I
picked the week of the suspension of the
prints on the week of the opening of La
Prensa I picked a case and i'll solve
there just to round it off let's take
our other client state Guatemala and
let's come up to more recent times
Guatemala we the United States
enthusiastically supported a vast
outbreak of terror and violence in
Guatemala in the early 80s the Reagan
heights were positively passionate in
their enthusiasm for this maybe a
hundred thousand people were slaughtered
something like that maybe something
roughly that neighborhood however after
sufficient massacre had been carried out
they had what's called a democratic
election and they're supposed to be a
democracy in Guatemala that's what they
tell us well one of the piss period of
us-backed slaughter they didn't have any
censorship the problems of the press
were taken care of simply by murdering
journalists about 50 journalists were
murdered including you know television
journalists right in the middle of
broadcast and so on and for some reason
you didn't need any censorship when that
was going on in fact I was never barely
discussed you find bear mention of an
oppressed well after the return of
democracy which we pride ourselves on
one of the editors who had fled and was
living in Mexico decided to return and
he opened the small newspaper about a
year ago last februari called la epoca
again it wasn't calling for the
overthrow the government wasn't
supported by a foreign power it was just
a kind of a left liberal journal small
left liberal journal when he came back
to Guatemala there were immediately
death threats from the death squads
which are just adjunct to the security
forces warning him that he was either
going to be killed or flee he wasn't
gonna loud to run that newspaper he
nevertheless might ahead and the
newspaper published a couple of issues
and then in July 15 armed men broke into
the offices firebomb them kidnapped the
night watchman and destroyed the
premises the next day the editor
barrera held a press conference to which
no one came except some people from the
European press and said that plainly
there's no possibility for free
expression in Guatemala he then received
another death threat warning him he
better get out of the country it be
killed he was taken to the airport by a
European ambassador to make sure that he
could get out alive and he fled back to
Mexico well how much coverage that get
answer zero nothing in the New York
Times nothing in the Washington Post
that's just last year now it's not that
they didn't know about it we know
perfectly well that they knew about it
first of all because it was on the
international he was on the wires and so
on and so forth but also because they
themselves referred to it obliquely
later about a month later there was an
article in The New York Times on some
cultural conference in Guatemala back in
the arts pages and the correspondent
went there had some remark buried in
there about la epoca the triple point is
just doesn't matter I mean that's it's
not just harassment and suppression it's
it's you know destruction and physical
disruption and murder but it's carried
out by our clients so it doesn't matter
well those are the kinds of things you
find when you look
