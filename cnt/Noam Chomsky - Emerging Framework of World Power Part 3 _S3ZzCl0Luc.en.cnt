like dogs in the hope that they will
leave and ever since then the us-israeli
practice has followed the advice of one
of the leaders who was actually most
sympathetic to the palestinian plight
well none of this breaks new ground
these are familiar elements of
domination and repression humiliation
and degradation are at their core comes
second nature to anyone with their boot
on someone's neck it's well known anyone
who studied the history of imperialism
and conquest and it's not at all
surprising that the United States and
Israel should now be infuriated by their
loss of a monopoly of violence and
terror though by virtue of their power
they remain well in the lead well the
official justification for the
perpetuation of many years of repression
and terror is that the Palestinians
rejected the magnanimous and generous
offer of Clinton and Barack at Camp
David in the year 2000 so they deserve
their fate and there's a simple way to
evaluate that claim very simple have a
look at a map okay unfortunately it's a
difficult task to carry out because none
were published which is interesting it's
not that it's hard to publish Matt you
want to know if the offer was
magnanimous take a look at the mat
that'll tell you I the it's easy enough
I mean they were published in Israel and
Israeli press they were published in
marginal publications here and unless
there's something to conceal they would
have appeared regularly on the front
pages here along with the chorus of self
praise about our magnanimity and I'll
look at the maps it reveals very quickly
why they did not appear it is true that
the Clinton Barack offers registered
some progress at the time of the
negotiations Palestinians in the West
Bank were confined to over 200 isolated
canton's and the magnanimous offer
reduced it to four therefore it
approached from below remember it
approached from below the moral level of
South Africa in the depths of apartheid
forty years ago when the first band
stands were established bush and powell
have regressed even below that they are
offering no more than a vision of what
South Africa actually implemented 40
years ago there's also been no change in
the intentions which are openly
announced described by Barak's chief
negotiator at Camp David shlomo ben ami
one of the architects of the Camp David
Accords and a dove in the Israeli
spectrum he explained just before
joining the government in 1998 he
explained the intention of the Oslo
process namely to create a neo-colonial
dependency for the Palestinians in the
occupied territories with permanent
dependence on Israel meaning the
us-israel alliance so banter stands and
the analysis is correct and it should
have also made headlines right along
with the unpublished maps and along with
the actions which were taken at the time
to drive the point home the final
Clinton Barack year in that year
settlement programs expanded to their
highest peak since 1992 pre Oslo under
Sharon well I take a look at history at
again reveals the continuity of policy
so right now there's a great deal of
interest in the Saudi peace plan which
was adopted by the Arab League in March
and this is regularly described here as
a historic opportunity if only the Arab
states will at last accept the existence
of Israel as in fact they have
repeatedly done along with the PLO since
January 1976 when they join the rest of
the world in backing a Security Council
resolution which called for a political
settlement based on israeli withdrawal
from the occupied territories with i'm
quoting it appropriate arrangements to
guarantee the sovereignty territorial
and territorial integrity and political
independence of all states in the area
and their right to live in peace with
insecure and recognized borders so
that's in effect UN 242 the basic
document amplified to include a
Palestinian state
as usual the resolution was vetoed by
the United States which is a double veto
it vito's it from history similar
initiatives have regularly been blocked
by Washington right to the present a
majority of Americans also support the
political settlement that is now
reiterated in the Saudi plan but unless
they undertake a research project
Americans cannot know that the primary
barrier to the diplomatic settlement
that they support happens to be the
Washington Israel alliance as it's been
for 25 years actually longer if we look
closely well unless this changes and
that means changes right here the
prospects there are for descent into
even more bitter tribal warfare with
ominous consequences that are likely to
spread well beyond well finally looking
back over quickly very quickly over a
longer stretch at the end of World War
two the United States had a position of
global wealth and power that had no
analogue in human history with the
reconstruction of other industrial
societies the u.s. share of global
wealth declined from about half after
the Second World War to about a quarter
by the 1970s that's the time when the
major critical change in post-war policy
took place namely the post-war economic
system was dismantled and the current
neoliberal framework was established
it's been accompanied for the past 25
years by deterioration in major macro
economic indices part from countries
that didn't follow the rules and a
notable attack on the substance of
democracy these are important topics but
I can't go into them now well by this
1970 the world had become economically
tri-polar with roughly comparable
centers in North America Europe and East
Asia but it was militarily bipolar US
and Russia and
each of the superpowers imposed
constraints on the other and the cold
were conflicts which were of course
violent and destructive were within the
domains of the superpowers with the
collapse of the Soviet Union the world
became unipolar militarily remaining
tri-polar economically as it is now a
couple of years ago Harvard political
scientist Samuel Huntington wrote in the
main establishment journal foreign
affairs that much of the world he seemed
to imply most of the world considered
the United States to be a rogue state
the greatest threat to their existence
possibly a reasonable estimate and
possibly more so today it can also be
reasonably argued i think that the
evolving system of state corporate power
is a threat to its own based in
washington's threat to its own
population us there the tendencies that
lead in that direction are very real
they're not inexorable and there are
others that strongly counter them well
if you look over the centuries there's
been significant expansion in the realm
of freedom and justice there are periods
of regression but the cycle is generally
upward as always human affairs are
scarcely predictable very little is
understood and too much depends on will
and choice the emerging framework of
world power should not be an object of
detached contemplation but has to be
forged by dedicated work and struggle
always based on an effort to dismantle
doctrinal constraints to see what's
before our eyes which is not really very
deeply hidden
Thank You professor ever really gets to
the point always talks around the
subject you notice that we have just a
short period of time for questions we
have two microphones here and given the
v hour i'll ask if if you have a
question to be briefed to to get to the
point I'll think we should probably just
add a couple of questions I want to ask
but I get to do that every day so why
don't I give you guys an opportunity
starting down here hi could you talk
about the u.s. participation in the
recent coup against the Venezuelan
president including us participation in
the coup against the Venezuelan
including the active involvement of auto
rice and Elliott Abrams back from the
Reagan years and also about the removal
of the in Brazilian ambassador to the
organization against the proliferation
of chemical weapon let's take one if we
can I couldn't hear answer that as far
as Venezuela is concerned I mean you
know I don't know any more than you do
just what was in the newspapers the
everyone was expected four years
everybody's been expecting a military
coup in Venezuela and kind of like the
coup and Chile the only question is when
know that there have been plans for it
don't think we can seriously doubt when
the military coup took place it was
immediately welcomed in Washington all
the public and in the editorials and
everywhere else you know a wonderful
thing however something very surprising
happened there was a upsurge there was a
popular upsurge and the the generals and
the president they deposed had to back
off meanwhile the Latin American
countries had condemned the coup I think
Canada went along with the United States
will not mistaken but the Latin American
countries went along opposed the coup on
grounds that it was unconstitutional and
attack on democracy they don't like
Chavez but they were in favor of
democracy however the northern
democracies and certainly the United
States and I
Canada thought that the overthrow of
democracy was just fine and then when
the when it was restored they were kind
of embarrassed and then comes the
cover-up you know in which you read that
the United States was secretly telling
the generals this is not nice and you
have to follow constitutional procedures
but so secretly you can't find any
record of it well you can make of that
what you like the US is embarrassed by
its open opposition to democracy in
comparison with Latin America and it has
to cover up and they'll be a cover-up
but my suspicion like everyone else's is
there'll be another coup unless Chavez's
really tamed you know unless he's
willing to follow us orders okay over
here hi professor Chomsky or in one trip
to two questions and I'm actually more
interesting the second if you choose to
answer only one first the first raise is
just the issue of I did take a look at
the maps I'm sympathetic to most of what
you say but I'm just curious I read a
long analysis by shlomo ben ami of the
talks and it seems that like by the
point they reached tava there was with
exchange of territories and something
something between ninety seven percent
to a hundred percent with compensation
on the table and bananas complained
there was that arafat refused to come
back with a counter proposal well
there's one problem with that yeah I
read the same things first of all
remember that taba is six months after
Camp David it was january two thousand
one it was informal discussions and what
happened to the Taba we can talk about
what the Taba agreements were and we
know a lot about them because there's a
report by the European observer
Martino's approved by both sides which
describes in detail with the report what
they were talking about so I can go into
that if you like but it's kind of
academic because they were called off
not by arafat but by Barack okay Barack
called them off okay so there were
informal meetings in Taba which did make
some progress beyond Camp David but if
you take a look the major issues were
still there year is really my mother is
ok but you know you re know this
business you know the country and that's
everything ok well the main thing the
main issue was what happens to that big
salient east of Jerusalem that breaks
the West Bank into two and includes the
city of my lad to meme which was
established by primarily the Labour
Party in clinton in order to bisect the
west bank and they were still divided
over that one of several issues the end
the exchanges of territory were
meaningless who was pieces of the desert
however I agree with the point I mean
there could there was progress in the
informal meetings in Taba there were
huge problems and they might have maids
gotten somewhere if Barack hadn't called
them off ok and the will you forgive me
if I if I move to another microphone
there are a number of people and I'm not
sure we'll even get to the people who've
taken the time to line up right hi
consistent with the US foreign policy
there seems to be a two-faced policy in
regards to China on the one hand we're
becoming closer and closer to them as a
trading partner and on the other hand
we're beginning to demonize them as our
next great superpowers to build up our
arms race against I'd like to hear what
you have to say on that subject yeah
policy I think you're right i mean
policy towards china is kind of
ambivalent they're a major investment a
region for investment and trade as china
moves into the World Trade Organization
the West hopes that it's going to
subordinate itself to Western investors
kind of like Mexico which would be a
huge boon to us agricultural exporters
to you know financial institutions which
expect to take over the Chinese
direction of the Chinese economy this is
probably going to wipe out about a
couple hundred million Chinese peasants
nobody knows what will happen to them so
there are those that's the upside you
know on the other hand the downside is
that they remain a nationalist country
which with their own concerns and might
pursue their own objectives they're not
going to invade anybody but it's a it's
a powerful force that might be part of
an independent Asia
china and japan together especially
japan and its surroundings but now also
china in principle could be the dominant
economic force in the world they
probably have the largest financial
reserves in the world right now and they
don't they're not a military force but
that can change so yeah that's concern
just like there's a concern over a
Europe going its own way so it's mixed
pretty much like you said thank you to
back to this Mike hi um some
commentators say that we can you get a
little closer I'm please thank you hi
professor um some commentators say that
we have to wait for a new generation of
leaders in Israel to even begin to
achieve peace even with a new generation
of leaders you believe it's possible to
even achieve peace within the Middle
East could you comment on that I agree
no I think the main problem is right
here I think the main problem is right
here it's very easy to blame other
people for the terrible things they do
right so you can look at all these bad
people in the world and they're doing
all kind of awful things in fact there's
a new literary genre that's developing
which is very widely hailed in the
United States you can read you know
laudatory reviews and all the main
papers it's about it's a series of books
one by the head of the human rights
center at Harvard which do talk about a
flaw in the American character and
therefore are extremely courageous the
flaw is that we'd somehow don't respond
properly to the crimes of others okay
you take a look at those books and the
laudatory reviews and the indices and so
on you notice there's a slight gap how
do we respond to our own crimes well
that you can't ask okay so you can go as
far as saying well we don't respond
properly to the crimes of others and
that's an enormous act of courage and we
laud it and so on but what about the
vastly more important question about
ourselves and the same is true here
there will not be I mean there's
conflicting groups inside Israel right
now and there will be in the future but
those who want to move towards a
peaceful accommodation are not going to
get anywhere unless they have
in the United States and so far the
United States has for 25 years insisted
on blocking peace remember the Saudi
peace plan in essence was proposed at
Security Council 25 years ago blocked by
the United States the u.s. vetoed the
similar plan again in 1980 it blocked
along with his are blocked similar Saudi
plan in 1981 right through the 1980s it
was blocking PLO and the Arab state and
European initiatives more or less of the
same type you take a look at the General
Assembly records where there's no
technical veto year after year from the
mid seventies up till the 90s there are
regular votes over December session on
similar proposals with numbers like you
know 152 to US and Israel sometimes they
pick up you know dominica or something
micronesia but that's what's been going
on I the there's great praise for Baker
who is very forthcoming secretary of
state for George Bush you can read it in
the Christian Science Monitor this
morning big review of the so-called
peace process lauding Baker for really
going very far the only thing it doesn't
mention and is never mentioned is the
Baker plan that is the official US
policy in December 1989 called the Baker
plan agreed in the State Department
bulletin which endorsed I'll tell you
what it said it endorsed the coalition
position of the Israeli government
that's shamir in Paris their position
which has never been published in the
united states except in the dissident
literature but it is the Baker plan
their position says first there cannot
be an additional Palestinian state
between Israel and Jordan what does
additional mean well it means there
already is a Palestinian state namely
Jordan and there can't be an additional
Palestinian state between Israel and
Jordan second the status of the occupied
territories called Judea Samaria
Gaza will be determined according to the
guidelines established by the Israeli
government that's point two point three
is there we will allow free elections
under Israeli military rule and though
they didn't mention it with tens of
thousands of Palestinian intellectuals
in jail well that last point did get
some mention here showing how
forthcoming we are and how much we love
democracy but the first two but not
didn't describe it the way i just did
you know said free elections is not
wonderful but that's the Baker plan
which is now being lauded as
tremendously forthcoming in fact there
just isn't an exception you take a look
at the whole record it's a formal it's
this is not secrets no you don't go to
be classified records for these is all
public material there's simply no
deviation from that position I mean on
paper there is like you can read Jimmy
Carter in the New York Times a couple of
days ago saying yeah we all want we all
agreed in fact even says baig and agreed
on israeli withdrawal from the occupied
territories 1978 I mean if he believes
that I you know you just have to have
pity on him what bagan said in 1978 is
we're not going to withdraw from the
occupied territories we're going to
settle them you want to pay for it
that's fine and Carter did in fact US
aid Israel went up to half of total US
aid now maybe Carter believes he heard
big and say I'm going to withdraw but he
certainly didn't say it and he certainly
didn't act on it now until that changes
there will be no opportunity for
political leadership to develop an
Israel that will try to implement these
purchases thank you and back you
professor I think you've done a
marvelous job of deconstructing American
foreign policy and a lot of the myths
that are used to rationalize it I wonder
if you could talk some more about where
we go from here where the Israelis go
from here where the Palestinians go from
here we just pick one I just fell about
us I mean so I think you I if I can just
make a brief comment I think you would
find that in all those constituencies
vast
jority of the population out of fear in
some cases very justified feels that all
the actions are justified in terms of
self-defense which 911 sort of
underscores for most Americans well you
know I'm not interested in giving
lectures to Palestinians and Israelis I
mean when I'm in Tel Aviv or when I'm in
verse 8 I tell them what I think they
should do but I'm here ok so I think we
should ask what we should do what we
should do is very straightforward and
simple and within our reach first of all
break through the the doctrinal
constraints which are rigid and find out
what's going on ok once you find out
what's going on well you may be agree
that I'm right or you may think I'm
wrong but whatever it'll be at least
know what's going on when you look at
the maps and so on and if what I said
turns out to be more or less accurate
it's clear what we ought to do we ought
to change US policy so that no longer is
the major impediment to peace in the
region and that's a no
he's a pretty pretty conservative view
you know it means taking the position of
the majority of the American population
and even the formal position of the US
government saying okay let's do it and
we know how to do it there's no israel
will respond to what the US says they
have to in their choice and they always
do when it push comes to shove if
there's any resistance you just make a
hint that maybe we'll suspend the arms
shipments for a little while but there's
no real need if the US agrees to accept
the long-standing international
consensus on this and the position of
the its own population now you can move
towards the kind of settlement that
everyone more or less agrees is the only
short-term possibility some kind of two
state settlement on the internationally
recognized borders with all the wording
that I just repeated from the 1976
declaration that comes from UN 242 the
rights of both states in the region the
peace and security and so on and so
forth Palestinian state would certainly
be disarmed there could be some border
adjustment you know mutual adjustments
there might be some territorial trading
these are all technicalities the main
thing is to agree to the general point
that there can be a viable Palestinian
state unless that's agreed to there
won't be any progress in the USS so far
totally refused it over here good
evening professor Chomsky are you for me
with the house of representative cynthia
mckinney democrat from georgia her
allegations that certain segments of
government knew in advance about the
terrorist bombing and that the Bush
family in particular were in cahoots
with a so-called bin Laden construction
company well Cynthia McKinney is a great
person and I'm glad she's in Congress
she didn't actually make those
allegations the way I read it she raised
some questions and I think myself the
questions are off the wall you know I
don't think there's any conceivable
possibility that
this was known in advance by this by US
intelligence however the second part is
not even in dubious the Bush family and
those around them were certainly
involved with the bin Laden family in
all kind of projects in fact Dick Cheney
a lot of his money comes from dealings
through various intricate offshore
groups and so on dealings that is that
yet Iranian and Iraqi oil to the United
States and yeah the family there's all
kinds of intricate involvement there
which would quickly be discovered if
anybody looked for them on the other
hand that's separate from the
allegations about involvement in the
state world trade center bombing that
just doesn't make any sense my opinion
over here Michael phone number one
national ideas are in the works medical
history is open to anyone especially law
enforcement without your signature and
knowledge censorship cameras everywhere
a shadow government Cheney and hiding
and now less Friday is standing armed
military at the ready on US soil
illegally against a constitution
according to Jim layer of the PBS
Newshour now my question is this what
will it be used against will it be US
citizens and just exactly why do we need
a standing our military on our soil and
also how do we as citizens of the United
States fight despotism I know our vote
is important but what if I vote is
compromised as in Florida I see the
above list headed to a despotism how do
we as the people depose the despot let's
take the first part of the question I'm
much less alarmed about any of that to
tell you the truth I I think first of
all you know about the last election yes
there were Florida shenanigans and so on
but the fact of the matter is that a
much bigger factor in in that in the
Florida vote than all of the shenanigans
was the fact that under Clinton and gore
so many black males had
put in jail and disenfranchised that
that alone swung the vote you know what
would have easily swing the vote to the
Democrats and I tend to agree with the
large majority the American population
that this is not a big issue this is a
PEZ bennett Florida vote has been a huge
issue among intellectuals very
interested in it lots of articles about
you know this that know the thing that
went wrong and they've been kind of
intrigued that it's been commented are
the most of the population seems to
think it's a poor and I basically agree
with him the what the problem with the
election was not that it was other
things I mean the major issues that
concern the population never even came
up in the election literally never came
up because the populations opposed to
elites on them right before the election
you know like on the eve of the election
about seventy-five percent of the
population regarded it as a joke some
kind of game between among rich people
and party bosses and the public
relations industry so therefore they're
not much interested if you know the
Supreme Court made some crazy decision
to switch it one way or another over in
what was pretty near a statistical tie
so whatever was going on there was
serious but I think we're looking at the
wrong we're looking at the wrong problem
there was a problem but it was not the
stealing of the votes time the military
part you know look that civil
libertarian tradition in the United
States is by now quite strong there were
times and not in the very recent past
when the government was able to carry
out highly repressive and brutal actions
I don't think that's possible anymore
there's just been too many victories
especially in the last 30 40 years which
have established barriers to government
repression their face plenty of problems
but in my view at least that's one of
the least of them
