thank you Thank You professor Chomsky
what we're going to do is we'll go round
this way we have microphones all over
the the hall now I can't actually see
everything but let's start this way if
you would like to yes go on hello
professor Chomsky I am the turbed by two
questions of moral philosophy
the first one is concerning Peter Singer
is he right on animal rights and my
second question is on inequities at
birth we can't redistribute IQ height
good looks talent we can redistribute
wealth and income does this have any
moral significance at all thank you well
just out of curiosity I do kill insects
like mosquitoes when they're bothering
you or do you think that when mosquitoes
are carrying malaria we ought to develop
the means to kill them off question ok
that's part of the answer you can for
sure I don't want should have rights but
none of us believes that animal
including Peter Singer that animals
should have the rights of human beings
and there's good reasons for that a
rights don't exist in a vacuum if you're
talking about the moral philosophy the
rights are associated with
responsibilities we don't attribute any
responsibilities at all other animals do
we we don't say that a a lion has to be
ascent to the gas chamber if it kills a
gazelle let's say no they don't have
responsibilities and that of course if
in moral philosophy not just
abstract discussion relates to the
question of what their rights are and
you can I mean they should have rights
so for example it's a step forward in
our general kind of moral development
that animals are not subjected to a
torture in the way they were just a few
years ago so in Britain and the United
States there are now constraints on
torture what we call experiment torture
of at least animals that are closer to
us like primates than there were 30 or
40 years ago so yes we're developing
some sort of conception of rights but I
don't think anyone thinks that animals
have the rights and responsibilities of
human beings ok then we can enter into
the details oh you know about general
gifts that we are born with okay I mean
like you know somebody asked me to
before to sign a picture and told me
that she had only once before asked
someone to sign a picture some tennis
champion okay I'm never going to be a
tennis champion so good I'm not sorry
that he has those talents which I don't
have and I'm not sorry that people can
play the violin in ways I can't dream
over and so on I think that's great
otherwise it'd be extremely boring world
so yes people have all sorts of
qualities and capacities I think you
mentioned IQ that's one of the least
significant of them but whatever it is
some very marginal phenomenon
okay anyone that cider but there are
real ones and I think it's great
sure there should be a very complex
world in which people can do different
things and we couldn't admire and enjoy
what they do okay
go here since there's no one there
thank you
first stop see this is mei-chiao Mirza
from ceasefire magazine we did an
interview with you in the spring of 2011
as the revolutions were sweeping the
Arab world and at the time when I asked
you about Syria the picture was not very
clear and I was wondering two years now
down the line what your thoughts were on
this situation there and if I could be
allowed a second minor question Prospect
magazine runs a poll of the greatest
intellectual in the world and for the
first two polls
I think I'm sure you're familiar with
ten years ago in five years ago you were
either the top intellectual or number
two I think based on popular votes this
year they've asked a number of people
including people you know such
luminaries as Bernardo Alevi and and so
on to pick a shortlist of 65 on which
you do not appear and I was wondering
whether you have any comments on that I
didn't have any comments when the first
one appeared because joke don't have any
comments on the later ones though there
were some interesting reactions to the
first one that one of the main column
this is for the Financial Times Gideon
Rachman I think his name is it wrote a
blog and which he said we have to
organize people to make sure to prevent
me from getting on the list next time I
thought that was amusing there's any
other interest in it's a joke
as far as serious concern now it's a
tragedy the country's moving toward some
sort of suicide
as to what we ought to do I I think you
ought to turn around and ask him I'd
suggest reading Patrick Coburn's column
and the independent yesterday I think
that's about right
arming the factions is just gonna make
it worse every as far as I know almost
just that everyone who knows anything
about Syria and who cares about it
pretty much agrees on this I don't know
that much but in fact only what I read
but that seems to be a pretty general
understanding that the only hope is some
kind of move toward negotiations and
diplomacy which will settle a conflict
which otherwise is simply going to
destroy the society and there are
proposals elect are Brahimi's proposals
which you have to implement them is not
gonna be easy
I certainly can't be implemented if
nobody supports them as far as I know
the only countries that support them are
Russia and Iran Iraq maybe well we
should ask ourselves should we be
supporting wouldn't be a bad idea
okay number two there um does the
anti-zionist left risk undermining
itself it doesn't also highlight Hamas
is abuses of its own people including
violent crackdowns on suppose of Western
decadence and the recent banning of
women from the Gaza marathon so you're
asking whether Hamas is harming the
Palestinian culture I'm not a great
admirer of Hamas by any means when I was
in Gaza I met the you smell honey I
talked about some of these things
the
Islamic movements in general there are
many very negative aspects like
religious based movements everywhere I
mean I think to take something that's
closer to my direct interest the
enormous and growing power of the
Christian Right the fundamentalist
Christian right in the United States is
I think not only a danger to the country
but to the world because of us power and
it's a striking phenomenon it actually
revealed itself at the Hale earrings
wasn't much commented on but I'm sure he
followed those hearings but Jewish money
and Jewish votes overwhelmingly go to
Democrats okay but the Democrats
defended Hagel the Republicans denounced
him why well I think a lot of it is
appealing to their but to their popular
base extremist Christian fundamentalists
who have a theology that says we have to
have a war in the Middle East end up an
Armageddon
everybody slaughters each other the
souls that have been saved rise to
heaven everybody else goes to eternal
perdition that incidentally includes all
Jews except for some reason 144,000 who
discover Christ in time and they're
saved well in order to bring this about
you have to have a war so therefore you
have to support it you have to blow up
the Temple Mount you know you have to
goes on and on like this I'm just today
today this morning's paper and one of
their great heroes Rand Paul and
probably the presidential candidate
announced legislation to declare a
fertilizer to sell a person okay that
means that a fertilized cell can't
has all the rights of a person can't
can't be killed so no abortion for
example well those are the kinds of
policies that will indeed be implemented
as these groups become more powerful and
they're become more powerful for pretty
simple reason if you take a look at
American politics the Republican Party
over the last couple of decades has
pretty much abandoned the pretense of
meeting being a normal parliamentary
party they're in lockstep service to the
extremely rich and to the corporate
sector you can't kid votes that way so
what they've had to do is mobilize
sectors of the population that have
always been there it's in many ways very
strange Society
they've always been their religious
extremists nativists so Rand Paul again
is organizing a campaign to oppose the
UN's arms control treaty arms exported
arms are killing who does how many
people throughout the world and Mexico
you know 60,000 the last couple of years
and huge numbers elsewhere but we have
to oppose it because the UN arms control
treaty is a plot by the United Nations
and abetted by the extremists Obama and
Clinton to try to take away our arms so
then the UN can attack us and eliminate
our sovereignty you think that's a small
thing it's not you look at the guns and
the gun lunacy in the United States
a lot of it is driven by the fear that
we have to have guns to protect
ourselves from the government and from
the United Nations and other forces that
are about to take us over well this is
really important I could go on this is
really important you know what's what
Hamas is doing I think it's very
bad but this is incomparably worse
snakes - yeah and then we gotta
professor Chomsky do you think Israel
will exist in 50 years time well it's
interesting
I visited Israel during the First
Intifada and an old friend of mine is
really a very dovish Israeli it asked me
the same question do you think Israel
will exist in 50 years and I feel and
felt what I've been writing for the last
50 years or so that Israel's following
policies which maximize its security
threats and they're doing it for good
real Adak a lot of states do this
Security's not a it's not a high
priority for governments I'm you see it
right here England like when the if you
followed the Chilcott hearings the you
know reviewing the Iraq war the head of
former head of mi5 a testified that
would be more or less knew that when the
US and Britain decided to invade Iraq
they did it on the assumption that it
would considerably increase terrorism
well actually it did way more than was
anticipated about Sevenfold in the first
year according to US government
statistics but it's just not an interest
governments are not all that interested
in protecting their citizens from terror
and destruction as many cases like this
some of them are totally horrendous
we've just passed the 50th anniversary
of the worst moment in human history the
Cuban Missile Crisis when I go through
the details Kennedy President Kennedy
was willing to face what he considered
1/3 to 1/2 probability of what would
have been a terminal nuclear war in
order to establish
principle that we're allowed to have
missiles surrounding Russia including in
Turkey actually obsolete missiles which
are being removed favors more powerful
ones we're entitled to have that we're
entitled have recently emplaced missiles
on Okinawa facing China but nobody else
is allowed to have missiles anywhere
outside their territory that was the
principle I'm covered up in various ways
but it's hard to think of a worse moment
than that and that's Illustrated of the
way States think about the security of
their own population so in the case of
Israel I don't think they're breaking
any breaking any precedence when they
follow policies which choose expansion
over security and sometimes it's very
explicit so I think one of the most
fateful moments in Israel's history was
in 1971 when President Sadat of Egypt
offered Israel a full peace treaty full
peace treaty offering nothing to the
Palestinians incidentally in return for
Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian
territory well you know for Israeli
security that would have been like quite
a step forward but they preferred to
pursue the plans for rapid expansion of
settlements into the Sinai and they were
backed by Henry Kissinger you can always
count on him to take the position will
be the most harmful to human beings
rarely missed but so yes I think and
that's consistent ever since like a lot
of other states they're following
policies which lead to their moral
degradation their isolation their
d legitimation as they call it now and
very likely ultimate destruction that's
not impossible thank you for an
absolutely wonderful lecture professor
Chomsky I want to ask you to speculate
about how you see the future for the
conflict between Israel and the
Palestinians in particular I'm thinking
of the two state 1 state debate and
wondering where you stand on that as
somebody who's observed this for so many
years your opinion is extremely valuable
and important I think for this audience
and many other people well right now if
we're realistic about it there are two
options what's discussed almost
universally Israelis Palestinians others
is two states or one state but those are
not the two options the two options are
two States or Israel in the u.s.
continued doing exactly what they're
doing right now those are the two
options and I won't run through what
they're doing right now but you can I'm
sure you know you'd go through the
details basically systematically
continuing to separate Gaza from the
West Bank turning keeping Gaza as a kind
of a prison imprisoning what remains of
the West Bank in the way I described
then taking over probably maybe 40% of
the land anything that's valuable now
that's what's happening before our eyes
and that's the alternative and it's
backed by strongly backed by the United
States and that pretty much backed by
Britain and other European countries
whatever their rhetoric that's the
likely policy if there isn't a two-state
settlement now what about one state or
what didn't
my view of more reasonable days used to
be called a bi-national state because it
will be a bi-national state personally
all my life have supported that back to
the 1940s when I was what was then
called the Zionist youth activists
opposed to a Jewish state that was part
of the Zionist movement at the time so
yeah I thought the Jewish States a
really bad idea and groups I were with
kind of left groups were looking for
arab-jewish working-class cooperation
lead to a bi-national state well if
we're interested in this and we want not
just to talk about it but to try to
reach it which I assume we should then
we have to answer a question how do you
get from here to there okay you know
everybody can be in favor of say
eliminating nuclear weapons but then
help very much to say it and say how do
we get there you know all right so take
this question how do we get there
pre 1948 there was a straightforward
answer you just move immediately towards
establishing that and there were
prospects I think from 14 nine up till
about 67 there were essentially no
prospects from 67 to the mid-70s there
were again prospects I wrote about it a
lot at the time it would have been
possible and it was actually some
support for this in Israeli military
intelligence and some parts of the
Palestinian movement for moving towards
some kind of Federation which could lead
to closer integration and so on well
nobody was interested so it died by
night by the mid seventies as that
option was gone because Palestinian
national rights had entered the
international agenda before that in the
international agenda Palestinians were
refugees you know so nothing about the
Palestinian national right
once they entered the international
agenda and the policy of of most of the
world outside the u.s. became to move
towards a two-state settlement then
there was a new option the first
proposal for a two-state settlement
incidentally was in January 1976 formal
proposal when the major three major Arab
states Syria Egypt and Jordan so-called
confrontation States brought a
resolution to the Security Council that
calling for establishment of two states
on the internationally recognized border
with in the wording was taken from UN
242 there were guarantees for the right
of every state Israel and new
Palestinian state to exist in peace and
security with secure and recognized
borders that's that's basically the
international consensus now the u.s.
vetoed it again in 1980 won't run
through the rest of the record but since
that time the US with the quiet support
of its allies like Britain has been
undermining it well you know if it was
realized and I don't think it's beyond
realization then there could be further
moves and every time in the past when
tensions have been somewhat reduced you
know cycle of violence has been reduced
you very quickly see interactions across
the borders I mean anyone's ever been in
the former Palestine those you just
can't draw a border through it I mean
anywhere you draw is totally crazy so
what happens is people start commercial
interactions cultural exchanges and so
on now that could lead to closer
integration and maybe to something
federacion and then maybe on
incidentally I don't think that that
should be the final goal that we should
be thinking about actually just tell you
a personal anecdote and my first visit
to Lebanon which was inadvertent it was
in 1953 my wife and I were students and
we were backpacking up in northern
Israel and by accident we happen to walk
into Lebanon there's no meaningful
border you know like every other border
in the world is just something
arbitrarily imposed by Imperial violence
no reason that worship it Jeep came by
and guy yelled at us we're in the wrong
country we should come back so we came
back but you know I would think that if
if you can reach some kind of by
national settlement the next stage ought
to be eroding the Imperial borders not
just there a lot of places I think that
would be very healthy and frankly I
think realistically that's the only
framework in which I think there's
likely to be some meaningful approach to
the huge Palestinian refugee problem
could be and so that's a possibility I
mean if there are other options I'd like
to hear them I've just never heard
anything else except I'd like this well
okay a lot of things we'd like but how
you get there number five please
one get you some water I have some
hello professor Chomsky we queued
outside to hear your lecture today and
I'm so glad we managed to come in I was
born in Mexico City and my best friends
in my building and in my colonial
borough were from the Jewish religion
when my mother was growing up she went
to a nun school but her best friends in
her borough in el circulo were serially
beneath when I grew up the best friends
I had were the sons and daughters of
those who had flown from Franco and when
I became an adult my best friends were
the sons and daughters of Chileans who
had run away from my ending and they're
from I mean from Pino Chatham and then
and the ones who had refuge themselves
from the IND camp sorry
and I'm talking very senior people in
Mexico so you spoke of Latin America
with two fronts the one with hope and
the one which is trying to maybe make
business with the uranium Iran could you
tell a Latin American what to expect of
her homeland and whether there is a seed
of Hope there with all these tolerance
like the Londoners who are gathered here
tonight Mexico's very much as you
describe this it's been a center for
refugee flow remember them you know
we're all everyone
there was everything about the horrors
of Eastern Europe you know anyone can
reel off the European dissidents who
were badly treated and so on I'd like
say Vaslav Havel he was put in prison
for a while not nice but just as an
experiment how many of you can even
though the names of the leading Latin
American intellectuals Jesuit priests
who had their brains blown out in 1989
by a US run State terrorist force which
already killed thousands of people and
had just returned from renewed training
at the John F Kennedy School of Special
Warfare just the last you know the
latter day and not even end but of a
major war against the church that the
United States was conducting after
vatican ii which is much in the news now
because vatican ii introduced a heresy
the heresy was to go back to the bach
gospels and in other words to what the
church was before the romans took it as
a you know the Church of the Empire and
the Vatican two calls were returned to
the Gospels you know radical pacifist
message preferential option for the poor
I was taken seriously in Latin America
as I'm sure you know priests and nuns of
laypeople went out into the villages of
organized based communities had people
read the Gospels think about how to take
control of their own lives I mean that's
an in totally intolerable heresy the
Vatican played its role in crushing it
but the u.s. just went to war and it's
not a secret
the famous School of the Americas which
trains Latin American killers one of
their talking points you know
advertising points is that the US Army
helped the feet Liberation Theology the
Liberation Theology was the effort to
bring the Gospels back to the church and
it was a very bloody campaign of course
most of the people killed were you know
working people the usual victims but
there was a long strain of religious
martyrs the like as I mentioned and
plenty of others but nobody here knows
them I mean you know maybe some of you
maybe you know them but a very few
people could even mention their names
and the crimes of Latin America through
the safe from 1962 up to now are far
worse than what was going on in Eastern
Europe during the same years but we only
know the others because somebody else
was committing the crime so we're we're
supposed to know about them and deploy
them and so on and so forth not the ones
we're killing well is there a way to
overcome this yeah there isn't I think
it's going on in Latin America the
development that I mentioned in the last
10 or 15 years I think is of really
historic importance and overcoming this
legacy and it's not just the last 60
years after all this is the first time
and half a millennium since they could
kiss the doors that the Latin America
has begun to free itself from Imperial
control and that the changes are
dramatic what I'd mentioned about the
globalizing tortures one case but many
others I mean a long way to go but it's
it's pretty hopeful one of the most
hopeful issues things in the world
that's for the Iranian might I don't
think that amounts to very much it's
gonna have to take two more questions
only I'm afraid because we're running
out of time can we take number three I
know I want to ask a question about the
effectiveness of the boycott divestment
and sanctions movement with relation to
Israel I'm part of an organization
called football Beyond Borders and we're
campaigning to get the upcoming UEFA
under-21 football tournament moved away
from Israel or if that fails to mobilize
a massive boycott at the tournament do
you think these kinds of boycotts are
effective and can they have the same
global impact as the sport boycotts
against apartheid South Africa
I think these are useful tactics but we
should recognize that there's a pretty
striking difference between the current
what's called by the participants the
BDS movement and the resort to these
tactics in the case of South Africa
there was no BDS movement in the case of
South Africa rather there was often
quite careful use of these tactics when
they were appropriate and it was
selective and thoughtful the sports
boycott was important it was against
racial exclusion in the sports teams and
a lot of it was carefully designed for
you know everything wasn't perfect but
the reason it was successful was that
there were several conditions that were
understood by the participants one of
them is that first you have to have a
long educational program so that people
understand what you're doing
BDS type tactics have began seriously
around pretty much around maybe the late
70s though that was after decades of
educational work organization by then
apartheid was incorrectly it was
condemned advice but everyone even
corporations in fact that Congress was
beginning to pass sanctions in fact
Reagan who was a credible racist had to
he had to evade congressional sanctions
he tried to veto them but there passed
over his veto and then he had to evade
them to keep supporting South Africa for
interesting reasons that was part of his
war on terror
remember that - the war on terror we got
in 1981 not 2001 and was the focus of
u.s. foreign policy and the ANC African
National Congress was designated as
quoting one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world that was
1988
right near the end of apartheid Nelson
Mandela himself just got off the
terrorist list a couple of years ago he
can now come to the United States
without special dispensation so you had
to defend white South Africans from
terrorism that sounds familiar today but
he had lost the public on that I mean
the public that turned against it they
were ready for stronger actions those
that were nowhere near that in the case
of Israel today not even close
secondly the use of these tactics in the
best cases and a lot of they were good I
paid attention to two crucial questions
that what's their impact on the society
that we're sanctioning like do they
produce a cost for the society okay
that's important and secondly what's
there how do they appeal to the audience
that we're trying to reach the audience
we're trying to reach as people hear
these efforts are as in the case of
South Africa or an fr part of the
educational program of getting people to
recognize we got to do something to
bring these crimes to an end so you have
to ask yourself well are the tactics
well adapted to that or do they have the
opposite effect I mean are they so
remote from the understanding of the
people you're trying to reach that they
agitate them and they become more
supportive of the crimes activist
movements and nationalist movements have
always understood this so for example I
can remember long discussions with the
Vietnamese back in 1960s about what were
the right tactics to use and they were
strongly opposed to a lot of the tactics
that were used by young people who were
deeply committed to ending the war like
the Weathermen
March down the street right break back
windows and so on though they thought
that was just totally crazy because they
understood that it harms them it just
builds up support for the war what they
wanted is telling Maruyama before one of
them mains I remember when they
suggested as a tactic this is a period
of real militancy in the United States
they suggested and they said what they
really liked was when a group of women
in the United States went to the graves
of American soldiers and stood silently
they thought that was a great tactic
well you know that didn't much appeal to
kids who for good reasons were pretty
upset by the war and wanted to do
something more militant but if you care
about the victims that's kind of
question yes and it was done pretty well
I think you know not perfectly as a
South African movement and those are the
considerations that have to be thought
through but there was never a BDS
movement with principles you know that
you had to adhere to and so on and never
and that was why as I think so they're
good tactics they can be used
effectively but you have to think about
it you have to think about all the
aspects not had any share whoever's got
the microphone
okay I have recently become acquainted
with the global Commons movement that
promotes trusty ship and stewardship
instead of ownership of land currently
we live in a system that protects the
ownership of land do you think that land
ownership in its current form which
hemorrhages the lands produce and
resources profits into the pockets of
the land owner plays a part in our
current wars and what you described is
almost by definition something we should
obviously be opposed to but you know
it's it's not really a large part of the
current wars I mean a lot of this
incidentally is being carried out by
countries like Saudi Arabia and others
who are buying up big pieces of Africa
and they're not the only ones to try to
convert convert it to agricultural
production which they need they're doing
a lot of purchase of land but that's not
contributed it's not right but uh
contributing to Wars the Western
countries are not really drinking like
when they invade Iraq or Afghanistan or
not trying to buy up the land and they
have all kind of strategic and economic
reasons but not to buy the land it's
it's a bad thing in our own countries
too and so should be dealt with but I
think you know without misrepresenting
the kind of context at which it takes
place I'm going to just end with a
housekeeping note if you're interested
in buying some signed copies of
Professor Chomsky's book please come out
this way if you're fed up with us and
want to leave as fast as possible go
through the back and finally I want to
thank you all for your support and thank
you for passing
you
