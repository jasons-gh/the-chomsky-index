we're all as the elected president
Morales was this was last September's on
ancient history the Morales responded by
saying thanking them for their support
and saying that this is the first time
in 500 years that Latin America has
taken its fate into its own hand without
the intervention and control of foreign
powers recently last couple centuries
the United States well that's really
important in fact the mark of its
importance is that wasn't reported in
the United States it's far too important
to be allowed to reach the public so I
mean it was mentioned that there was a
meeting but not what happened there okay
that's a real democratic election of a
kind that we can't even dream of that
and it's not that unusual there are
other cases but there in the South what
we call the South you know the nons that
there may really be a famous what is
called a clash of civilizations but not
of exactly the kind we think of in any
event for the West this is undoubtedly a
historical magical event it's understood
what happened by the people who run
campaigns here the quadrennial
extravaganzas they're called elections
here are run by the public relations
industry the advertising industry is a
huge industry which is dedicated to
controlling beliefs and attitudes and
opinions its main task is to undermine
markets now if you take an economics
course you learn that markets are based
on informed consumers making rational
choices right if you look at a
television ad you learn that what
markets consists of is uninformed
consumers making irrational choices so
when you look at an ad for a car
lifestyle drug or something you don't
expect to find information like G in a
market system GM would have a five
second ad which is a here
characteristics of our car and a system
dedicated to undermining markets what
you have is you know football player
sexy actress the car driving into the
heavens or something about it the point
is to create a category of uninformed
consumers making irrational choices to
sell your products make profit ok now
the same institutions run elections now
they have the same goal to ensure that
uninformed it's not consumers in this
case on our forum the uninformed
electorate makes irrational choices and
they do it the same way with glitz you
don't get to know what the candidates
stand for issues are marginalized and
suppressed I mean the McCain campaign
was at least honest enough to say it
outright I said this election isn't
going to be about issues it's not
personalities and qualities and so on
the Obama campaign was basically the
same so it was marketing brand Obama I
was about hope and change and things
like that a kind of a blank slate where
you can write your hopes and dreams but
issues are kept way to the side now if
you're really energetic you can look up
the webpage you find position papers on
this and that but that's not friend of
Senator not what the elections are about
and for the most part the electorate is
uninformed we haven't seen polls yet
about this election but the last
election 2004 bushwah I think so maybe
ten percent of Bush voters even though
his positions were he was a nice guy you
know kind of guy you'd like to meet in a
bar have a drink with
you know running in 120 degrees sun with
and that's everything he likes to shoot
listen I didn't suffer example majority
of Bush voters assumed that he was in
favor of the Kyoto Protocol the reasons
obvious populations in favor of it
obviously the right thing he's a nice
guy he must be in favor and in the case
of Obama it's pretty much the same
people think he stands for what I want
why on what basis you can't accuse him
of having mislead anyone because he
hadn't said it he's kept to hope and
change well you know if you're if you're
an executive in the advertising industry
you have to sell a candidate in 2008 and
you read the polls which of course they
do and you know what's happening in the
country you know that eighty percent of
the country thinks the country's going
in the wrong direction and the same
roughly the same eighty percent think
that the country is run by a few big
interests looking out for themselves not
for the population by about three two
one people want the campaign's to pay
attention to issues not personalities
for those polls you forget because
that's no good you also know that on a
host of major issues domestic
international the two political
organizations two factions of the
business party our way to the right of
the population so you good reason to
keep away from issues kind of like
selling toothpaste no you don't want
people to know what it does do you so
issues are to the side its qualities of
body language I remember to torture
myself I sometimes turn on NPR while I'm
driving somewhere and after the one of
the debates Clinton Obama Clinton
Clinton Obama debate i happen to be
turning it on and they had the political
analyst of the the New York Times was
being interviewed and they were talking
about the debate I listened for about
ten minutes the discussion was about the
first moment of the debate when
apparently the two candidates who walked
in and Obama held Clinton's chair while
she sat down and the question is what
was his body language like was it
condescending you know like little woman
get out of here or was it deferential
like Blackpool a talking to white lady
and that was essentially discussion
that's and much of the discussion about
the campaign is like that anything
except what matters and is a good reason
kind of reasons I mentioned and the guys
who run the campaign are well aware of
it the advertising industry gives an
award every year for the best marketing
campaign of the year and guess who won
it in 2008 Obama he beat out Apple this
was the best marketing campaign of the
year and it's in the business press they
quoted the top executives who are just
ecstatic they said we've been marketing
candidates like commodities ever since
Reagan and this is the best we've ever
done it's going to change the corporate
culture or CEOs are going to pick up the
style and do it the same way and so on
so yeah it was a great marketing
campaign and now the army of supporters
are supposed to be sitting there waiting
for their instructions from the leader
and who will tell them what you supposed
to do next kind of like the opposite of
democracy but that can't be % from say
Bolivia radically different but that's
very hard to pretreat just can't enter
the intellectual culture here it's too
inconsistent with the view that we're
supposed to have of ourselves and the
way our society works unfortunately it's
it's accurate
and I say the population knows that's
why eighty percent think that the the
government is run by a few big interest
looking out for themselves not for the
people now how do you it there are
there's good political science work on
the predicting policies on the basis of
many factors and the factor that is the
best predictors financing I just
extremely good work on this done by a
very good political economist at UMass
Thomas Ferguson calls it the investment
theory of politics he's studied in
detail elections for you know hundred
years and viewing elections as occasions
on which groups of investors coalesce to
invest to control the state and then you
try to predict from the groups of
investors who funded the campaigns what
the policies are going to look like and
it's a remarkably good predictor
considering the complex system like this
well applying it applying that to this
campaign we want to know who's funding
it well the propaganda is that just a
lot of small contributions over the
internet and so on and so forth which is
not totally false but it's pretty
misleading the final data aren't in with
the Washington Post tried to estimated
an estimated that about twenty five
percent of the contributions were from
contributors of under two hundred
dollars small contributors the mass of
contributions appear to be from the
financial industries they much prefer to
Obama to McCain so they funded him way
beyond McCain and that showed in the
vote he was also at major sport from law
firms that doesn't mean civil rights
lawyers it maidens lobbyists and a
couple of other concentrations of
