well they're two kinds of questions
there's a narrow question of whether the
grand jury decision was correct to be
honest I don't think we can say we just
didn't see the evidence that was
presented to them so I don't think it's
fair to say that the jury decision was
wrong
personally I think it probably was but I
don't see I don't have the evidence
there's a broader question why are
blacks being murdered by the police and
it's not just this case I'm in this case
after case that the police are heavily
militarized the attacks on African
American males are way beyond any level
of criminal behavior and so on this
extends to the so-called drug war blacks
are specifically targeted by the drug
war from police action up through
sentencing through the post
incarceration release they are
specifically targeted now take a look at
the history the first slaves came to the
United States in 1619 okay it's 500
years during this 500 year period there
have been maybe three decades when
African Americans had some kind of a
fair shot at joining the mainstream
society that's literally true I can run
through the details if you like the
current system doesn't have legal
discrimination but it has a whole array
of social political other measures which
maintain a system very much like Jim
Crow like the system that existed after
the you know after the Civil War and
right up to up to the Second World War
and so that's the broader situation and
that's
that's across the board quite apart from
the question of what the grand jury
decided in this case I think that's the
background against which we have to
think about think of it
