and as of yesterday at least hadn't even
reported in the united states maybe
there was a study that came out in one
of the major medical journals which was
reported by Patrick Coburn fine reporter
in London and the London independent and
one or two other places abroad and it's
a it is in fact being reported broadly
abroad what they found is that in
fallujah town in Iraq which was
viciously attacked by American forces in
november two thousand four with all kind
of horrible war crimes they found the
doctors who investigated there found
levels of cancer you know leukemia you
know and so on there beyond what they
found in Hiroshima that's pretty
significant century unmentioned in the
US but it's the kind of thing you're
taught not to think about it and not to
say and not to ask what it means and
there's not a lot like that
