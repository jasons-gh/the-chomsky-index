what about the labor movement the United
States is an unusually violent labor
history by comparative standards so
workers are being murdered here into the
1930s there's something done heard of in
Europe or Australia in fact right-wing
British newspapers like the London Times
in the 1920s were just reporting back
and just appalled at the treatment of
American workers you just don't do that
you know and in fact the American labor
movement which was very vibrant and
lively was practically dead by the 1920s
was killed off by the Wilson read scares
so was almost it was almost dead there's
a great book on labor history by David
Montgomery one of the great labor
historians died recently it's called
something like the fall of American
labor and he's talking about the 1920s a
very lively labor movement it was
destroyed by 1920s it was almost nothing
there
it came back the 1930s it came back CIO
organizing started I'm old enough to
remember this my unemployed
working-class family was part of it that
was the cutting edge of the New Deal
legislation and it got very far I'm by
the time it got to sit-down strikes and
enterprises it really put the you know
real fear in the hearts of the business
classes a sit-down strike is just one
step before taking over the factory and
saying goodbye we don't need you who'll
run it ourselves so at that point you
start getting the New Deal legislation
which was very significant shouldn't be
but designed to prevent the labor
movement from going any farther
important I'm not denigrating and I'm
glad it happened but it it was intended
to contain as well as support working
people had a very powerful labor
movement and by the late 1930s the and
certainly if you read the businessperson
those years you get the same paranoia
in the world's coming to an end but they
did start to organize the business world
other devices for controlling labor what
we're called scientific methods of
strikebreaking
they were kind of worked out and began
to be applied in the 1930s it's kind of
interesting to look at them everything
was on hold during the Second World War
of course but immediately after the
Second World War started instantly the
taft-hartley acts at 1947 huge
propaganda campaigns by the business
world to indoctrinate workers forced
sessions and factories efforts to take
over schools sports leagues and nothing
was left out that's interesting
literature and this if you want to read
it it's just an amazing propaganda
campaign make people hate government but
nevertheless what a big government for
us you know and hate taxes the whole
business and it's had a big effect it
took off again it escalated in the 1970s
and we're living in the middle of it
today it's not the first time in
American history it's happened before
1920s were case in point and it can come
back so an answer to your question if in
the 1920s it would have well predicted
will never have a labor movement turns
out to be radically incorrect and it
could be incorrect now depends what
people do
