there is a very powerful you know a
straw dinerral e powerful part of the
entire sort of capitalist ideology is
making you worry only about yourself
lose any connection to other people
destroy solidarity just leave solidarity
in the hands of the investing class the
rest of you just worry about yourself
this goes way back you read the
working-class press in 1850 in around
the places like where I live you know
which was in round New England which was
the centre of the early Industrial
Revolution whose very lively
working-class pressed run by mechanics
and what they call Factory girls young
women off the farms and so on a very
interesting reading but one of the
things that they were denouncing was
exactly this tendency the what they
called the new spirit of the age gained
wealth for getting all but self you know
which they regarded as degrading and
demeaning and destroying you know their
human values and so on correctly
in fact the labor movement throughout
its whole history has been fighting
against this work together you know
because we're all in it together and we
want to help each other that's a very
different ethic as it's a traditional
ethic it took modern capitalism's even
questioning but and I think that what
questions is a very antique human well
that shows up in connection with the
schools it comes down to the question do
I care whether the kids down the street
get an education well I think we should
you know I think we should care that
but notice that means that means public
education in fact I think that's the
major motive for public education like
public health you know it's like a
public health system do we do I care
that the kids down the street have
sewage okay
well the same question you know why not
just me I should have sewage and they
should have like you know the backyard
well you know that's a question of what
kind of a world you want to live in do
you want to live in a world where people
care for each other and care about each
other you know I think we can tighten at
least I think we ought to live for that
kind of a world but to then that some
form of community education whatever you
call it is part of that it means that
children ought to have the best
opportunities they can have and the best
chance for developing their own powers
that they can get it whether they're my
kids there's nobody else's kids and the
whole move towards vouchers and
privatization and so on is in effort as
as far as I can see like trying to
privatize health care which is well who
cares if they're healthy down there as
long as I'm rich enough to buy health
care for myself there's a very dangerous
tendency to I support
I think it's socialized but it's like
let's see the best look how many you can
say about Medicare
I mean what kind of a show in Egypt of
it yeah sure so a a community system or
a public system but that's what a
democratic a democratic society and a
free society of cooperating people or to
allow options if if you're only given
the choice of everybody's kids go to a
factory call the school or else I make
choices for them well that's not a very
good set of choices but I think we ought
to be working for a public education
system that you know that there really
does provide the opportunities and
options and freedom and so on up to some
limit I mean you know I can't hug the
limit has to be determined by a
community exactly one of my kids I ended
up sending to a private school to the
online favorite discuss
yeah one of my daughters actually ended
up going to a friend's school which is
about as close to that as you can get in
the Boston area but that was for you
know I wasn't happy about it but for
various reasons given the options within
the public school system we just felt we
had to do it so I'm not saying that
these are easy personal choices given
bad options they're not and the same
Stroeve health you know like I mean I
know that like if you might one of my
kids let's say really needed expensive
health care and you couldn't get it
through the public system I'd find a way
to pay for it myself
though I don't think there ought to beat
that ought to happen well it's because
we're given a set of bad choices
so within the set of bad choices I think
thing do is try to make them better not
eliminate the good things because in
some aspects we do think not working I
mean in a way it's like you know
anything you point to it's gonna be like
that every institution that exists is
distorted by concentration of power and
many other things fine so you try to
overcome those distorting effects but
you don't throw away whatever is useful
about institution you say something
about the labor movement on the labor
movement I think has been over Oh over
the years has been a major force and
democratization and improving people's
lives and so on and so forth on the
other hand is crooked as hell you know
all involved with gangsters and so on
and so forth
well okay you know see instead of saying
okay let's throw out the labor movement
what you say is let's get rid of that
aspect of it make it more responsive to
workers there's been a lot of yeah okay
let's yeah and I wait a madness but I
think you know yeah I think it's better
to keep to the mic sorry I didn't mean
to cut off the previous speaker I I have
a question there's been a lot of
discussion lately about the fact that
corporate profits have been rising well
at the same time layoffs of of employees
have been going up as well and
recently the Secretary of Labor in the
US and the Minister of Industry in
Canada have both made well fairly tepid
comment comments about the the conduct
of corporations laying off workers when
their profits are are skyrocketing and I
just want to hear your comments on that
well first lay off is the least of it I
mean for about 20 years now
wages wages in the istick and I only
know the detailed figures for the United
States and Europe I don't know them for
Canada but in the United States at least
let me talk about that I don't think
it's much different here around the
early seventies wages started to stack
real real incomes started to stagnate
and by around 1980 it started to decline
so if you take the median wage you know
half below half but it's been declining
fairly steadily since around 1980 that
continued right through the Clinton
recovery the Clinton years the recovery
was in fact the growth was faster than
during the Reagan years but it was
unprecedented in that way just kept
going down so I think something like the
preferred number 95 percent or so of the
family some very high number lost family
income from 89 1989 when recessions but
through 1993 which is after the recovery
and it's the last year for which we have
figures and it's probably still going
down for what they call unskilled
workers which means like 70 to 75% of
the workforce
they've lost about 20 percent or so of
income since about 1980 that's the core
of this you know angry white male
phenomena and so on what Buchanan's
appealing to for college graduates wages
started going down around 1987 after the
full effect of the Reagan social changes
hit and they're still going down
so there's so laughs is one aspect of it
but the other aspect is just a general
collapse a general attack on working
people across a very broad spectrum and
at the same time corporate corporate
profits are just you know breaking all
records if you read fortune and
Businessweek and so on they can't even
find the adjectives anymore to describe
how stupendous and dazzling and so on it
is last year if your fortune has every
Fortune magazine you know the big
business magazine every like May has an
issue devoted to the fortune 500 the top
500 corporations and last the one last
May was really pretty pretty impressive
I mean they couldn't get over how
fantastic it was fourth straight year of
double-digit profit growth you know 54%
profit growth last year
expected to continue after four years of
it so the country is just flooded with
capital you know it's not lean and mean
or anything like that
absolutely flooded with capital more and
more narrowly concentrated well for most
of the population is either stagnation
or decline well layoffs is one aspect of
that that happens to be hitting the
newspapers now but it's pretty small
aspect of the whole picture well that's
you know these are the results of very
definite social policy facts starting in
the early 70s pretty powerful new
weapons were placed into the hands of
private tyrannies what we call private
business which is just big totalitarian
institutions basically unaccountable
ones and they got a lot of new weapons
to beat people over the head with and by
what the main one being the huge
explosion of financial markets which was
just an extraordinary scale and that's
had an enormous effect I mean and I'm
gonna give you some of the numbers if
you like they're really mind-boggling
the effects were already understood by
the late seventies pretty well
understood that this was gonna drive
down growth rates concentrate will lead
to a kind of low wage low growth high
profit equilibrium but that's the only
part of it the another aspect of it is
that there is now tremendous pressure
from invest from financial markets you
know big money managers which happen to
have huge amounts of capital in their
hands and can move it around very fast
one effect of contemporary
telecommunications is you can take say
the whole New York banking system and
put it in Tokyo every search every every
day you know so you can use the
financial markets over there and make a
little more money and then use them over
here and make a little more money I mean
that's why you have it takes a MIT you
know science engineering school their
corporate recruiters to come around
every no May June to try to pick up the
smart guys in the science and
engineering the phd's last year 25% of
them are from Wall Street corporate
recruiters they were going after math
and physics PhDs
these guys don't know anything about
Wall Street but they're smart guys who
know how to work out complicated scams
that will enable you to get a tiny bit
more profit by you know some intricate
device in speculative markets that's
having a huge effect on the
International economy and the domestic
economy for example it's forcing it's
forcing the corporation's to move
towards a a manager a guy who's doing
the actual you know the guys in a
management position in a corporation the
state of the CEO or the guys in the
Board of Directors it's forcing them to
look for a very short-term profit
because if they don't go for a very
short-term profit there's gonna be a
rapid exit of capital to somewhere else
which is getting short-term profit and
that's having it probably no I don't
think worked it out yet but
there's a general assessment that this
is having a very harmful effect on the
economy altogether just as the rapid
transfer of its the enormous growth of
capital that's used for speculation
against currencies is also having a
tremendous effect it moves towards it
attacks any any any country even a big
country like the United States that
tried to introduce stimulative measures
capital would flow out of it really fast
because this capital does not want
growth what they want to stable
currencies and growth can threaten
stable currencies do they want low
growth stable currencies you know
inflation tremendous profits and wages
going down and at home you're getting
pressures against the you know private
enterprise never does much long term
planning but whatever there is there's
pressure against it because you want to
make sure that you have high profits the
next quarter or else you want to lose
the capital that couldn't move around
very fast now so these things are having
big effects and they started around the
early seventies and have been expanding
ever since and there are others you know
global what they call globalization you
know the human there's been a
considerable escalation of
transnationals and so on and so forth
and in different ways than in the past
they're doing different things than they
used to do they've always been around
but all of these are putting very
powerful weapons into the hands of
private power and they're using it to
try to unravel the social contract that
has been established after lots of
struggle the attack on labor
incidentally is part of it
so in the United States as you know
unionization has gone way down but it
isn't a lot a large part of that is I
don't like the term conspiracy and I
don't use it much but this is real
conspiracies there was a state corporate
conspiracy in the 80s very blatant state
corporate conspiracy to destroy unions
now corporations have always wanted to
destroy unions but they were but state
power in the 80s essentially author
stood and pretty openly the only place
where I've seen really good reviews of
this is in the business press which are
very frank about it
Business Week for example it very good
stories about it how the government
basically hold the private sector from
the early 80s they're simply not going
to enforce the laws so do what you like
you know and in fact the number of
illegal firings of organizers shot up
and it went up by like a factor six or
something
the number of the corporations were told
that OSHA the safety and health certain
office of safety and health there's
something or other you know the
government office that looks after
safety and health standards would simply
not enforce standards and in fact the
number of days the number of working
days lost to injury went up by about
fifty percent very quickly and that's
across the board illegal firings the use
of it has been technically legal in the
United States since the late thirties to
use permanent replacement workers United
States may be one of the few industrial
countries where this is even on the
books but it's after the Wagner Act was
packed and passed to 1935 which sort of
which for the first time gave workers
the right to organize that they had an
interest about every other industrial
country Supreme Court very quickly
undercut it within a few years and
technically allowed the right to hire
permanent replacement workers which is
much worse than scabs noticed but but
the balance of forces was such that the
major corporations could never do it
never thought of doing it well by the
late eighties they started thinking of
doing it and the first big manufacturing
corporation big manufacturing
corporation to do it was caterpillar
that was part of a major union busting
strategy and right at the center of the
heartland of working-class America at
the caterer Illinois big working-class
town three major unions you know biggest
unions and there was a big corporate
attack
three transnationals two one British one
Japanese and one caterpillar US base and
they just want to destroy the unions
very openly they use the huge profits
they use their excess capacity overseas
like caterpillar explained its business
strategy at least in the business press
they said that they're going to force
they're going to force workers to
capitulate because they've used their
enormous profits to build excess
capacity overseas like in Brazil and so
on which allows them to fill their
international markets even if they don't
produce you plus permanent replacement
workers here and you know a lot it's
huge growth and temporary workers you
know you know no benefits all that kind
of stuff
well these weapon this got I mean
actually the United States was actually
censured by the International Labor
Organization which is extremely rare
I mean they never tapped the wrists of
their rich funders but it got to the
point that the US was actually censured
by the ILO for using permanent
replacement workers which by up in the
caterpillar case which violate all
international labor standards and I
think US was urged to sort of accept
international labor standards which it
doesn't all right this was outright
conspiracy I mean the state federal
government simply authorized the use of
illegal methods some of them flatly
illegal methods to attack and destroy
and undermine unions well they couldn't
gotten away with that earlier
incidentally here's another case where
the left simply abandon the terrain to
cater workers were going around the pic
of course they weren't covered in the
press you know obviously you don't
expect the corporate media to cover this
stuff but the cater workers were really
fight they all lost instantly they got
smashed and they all it was a total
disaster all three and a big part of the
reason for that was that the Putten
people who ought to be the left just
didn't give a damn like in Boston when
daily workers came to try to organize
some support we had a meeting for them
which oughta have been this many people
it's in the
where this many people show up for
anything there were 75 people it's the
first time I've talked at it I talk a
lot at those meetings on every
imaginable topic this is the first time
in about 20 years everything the place
almost feel why well just a bunch of you
know
white males who cares about them working
people from Decatur Illinois who are
trying to preserve and restore and
ultimately rebuild the American labor
movement okay those are the kind of guys
are going to be out in the malicious
pretty soon or listening to Pat Buchanan
and I think we can partly blame
ourselves for them not in significantly
but the point is there were powerful
weapons and they're being used all over
the world I'm the United States and
Britain they're first they were used to
destroy the weaker working classes like
in Latin America Latin America you know
in Latin America pretty organized and
powerful working classes but they're
much weaker societies so they were
smashed by structural adjustment and so
on there by now really devastated
throughout the continent in the
industrial world it's a tougher nut to
crack and it started with the United
States and England the United States and
anyone our worst in this respect but the
Thatcher Reagan period a big attack on
working people also on families on
children you know it's across the board
and Europe and Japan are not are still
kind of holding on Canada's sort in
between I mean somewhere between the
United States and and the the
anglo-american model and the European
Japanese model but in a more integrated
global economy it's going to be awful
hard for anybody to hold out unless
there is substantial popular resistance
because most of it I mean what's
actually happening is most of the world
is being turned into a kind of third
world you can see there's pretty
dramatic in places like the United
States and England less so and
continental Europe but unless there's
substantial resistance to this that's
pretty much what's going to happen so
layoffs is a piece of it but it's a much
bigger hit picture and I don't think
that the kind of book that's coming out
of Washington even relates to this issue
I mean asking corporations to be nicer
you know that's like a sugar you know in
fact there was background like in the
Kennedy years around that period there
was a lot of talk about how corporations
had changed I remember one colleague of
mine was in fact the head of the
Institute for Advanced Studies and then
was in the Kennedy administration at MIT
there's an economist wrote a paper
called the Soulsville corporation that
is the corporations that becomes soulful
you know they used to be kind of
money-grubbing and so on but now they're
it's just ridiculous I mean if any
corporation here Milton Friedman and
those guys are absolutely right if a
corporation tried to be anything but you
know really monsters they would it would
be basically illegal they would not be
fulfilling their responsibilities to
their shareholders and furthermore they
would be eliminated they'd be cut out of
the market because somebody else
wouldn't be soulful and would be making
more money
this is institutional you know has
nothing there with anybody being nice
these are institutional facts and as
long as I mean it's like trying to ask
you know the some totalitarian state to
be more nice to its people well you know
it doesn't make sense what you do with
the totalitarian state is eliminated but
you don't ask it to be nicer to people
and these are totalitarian systems these
a corporation is a totalitarian system
and by now they're very big ones you
know they're they're huge command
economies which are internally modeled
they're just the you know they have
pretty much the structure of it's a
tellurian state they unify the judicial
legislative and executive functions in a
tough unaccountable control system the
only accountability is to investors
which means other
you know banks and you know big
investment firms and so on all right and
public accountability is limited to the
regulatory system which of course
they're trying to destroy so it's
essentially a takeover of power by Big
totalitarian institutions which
incidentally their rates come their
roots are not very - about the same as
the other contemporary forms of
totalitarianism Bolshevism and the size
ISM they all come out of late nineteenth
century
you know vaguely Hegelian ideas about
organic entities having rights above
individuals and so on and so forth
there's actually a pretty good scholarly
work on on this on the origin of 20th
century liberal corporations got their
current power mostly the early part of
the century you know they're not like
sort of graven in stone the rights of
immortal persons with things like free
speech and you know all that kind of
stuff that's early twentieth century and
it was not granted by legislation either
it was done mostly by courts and lawyers
and so on and it's a form of
totalitarianism and you don't ask it to
be more soulful anymore now just on to
be more soulful it's these are
institutional structures they behave the
way they do you have to the Eliminator
and so these were truisms in the
working-class movement not very long ago
by now they sound really weird but
that's the sign of the the of the
victory of powerful propaganda systems
corporate propaganda system is simply
driven out of people's heads what used
to be everybody's understanding in fact
you go back to the early century ago in
the AFL you know which is not
particularly radical these are the
things people are talking about the
national meetings you know let's get rid
of all these things and working people
working people ought to own the mills
and they and run them there they build
them they work in them the other Runner
that was one of the big issues in
Homestead
strike back in 1892 you know well you
know if it's been beaten out of people's
heads that's our our problem we were to
get it back in people says it's not very
strange sort of natural and automatic
just like Opposition in any other form
of totalitarianism and playing games
about me they should be nicer to people
that doesn't mean anything yeah sure if
you can sort of impose by force if you
can use federal to say OSHA if he can
impose health and safety standards on
them fine that's better than not having
those standards but there should be no
illusions that's like forcing a
totalitarian state because of some
countervailing force to act nicer okay
maybe you can do it but that's not the
answer okay yeah I consider myself to be
a Machiavellian excuse me your use of
the word totalitarian is a poo term and
I'm not afraid that's my descriptive
term Martin kitchen who wrote a book on
fascism is calls it a Bou term who
Martin kitchen up at SFU he wrote a book
on fascism totalitarianism is a boo term
what you got to do is unpack them usage
of the word totalitarianism Machiavelli
if you look at Machiavellianism as
Machiavellianism from above and from
below but Koonin has been called a
machiavellianism from below I think word
we need more envious workers we don't
need sentimentality from Noam Chomsky
this is neither too sentimental about
the workers all the little bleeding
workers we need Envy from below and
greed from above we're not gonna get
anything but greed from above you
admitted that but you want
sentimentality from below I don't want
sentimentality I want struggle freedom
justice what's wrong
and when I incidentally when what I used
the word chocolate Aryan I met it I - I
didn't say much about it but when I was
talking about centralizing the
legislative executive and judicial
functions in a top center I was actually
quoting I didn't say so because it
wasn't time but I was quoting from a
pretty mainstream political annoyed
political economist back when I was at
around ninth in the early 1940s Robert
Grady who wrote a book on businesses
system of power in which he described
quite well the way in which totalitarian
institutions like corporations were
developing in the industrial world with
many counterparts to the fascist systems
there's more recent work when I
mentioned scholarship I had something in
mind - there's a legal historian at
Harvard very good one Martin Horowitz
who has two big fat books on the
transformation of American law and if
you look at the second volume he goes
which is the more you know goes through
say 1860 to 1920 or so he talks about
the origin of modern corporate
corporations in corporate law and
exactly these terms this is these are
descriptive terms they are not Luthor
okay why can't we have something like
max Turner's alliance of egoist from
below well you can have it if you want
but that's not the world are you want
sentimentality an organism of the week
what an organic what you call howdy this
Impala Terran is the mother left wing I
think we've exhausted a stuff you want
sentimentalism of the left wing Organa
sysm of the left wing excuse me that's
what it sounds like yeah this left me at
this point I'm told sir thank you
I'm not long ago in this province uh
some some changes were made in the
legislature to legislation to make
stutter penalties for things like
distribution of hate literature in
response to an increased perception of
groups like the arya nation and that and
the heritage front and well it's it's
definitely important to preserve free
speech freedom of speech it is also
clear that the increased activity of
such groups also needs to be dressed as
well and I'm wondering what thoughts you
might have about what means could be
done so apart from trying to make
stricter penalties for distribution of
hate literature well I'm against it I
don't think the state should have the
power to decide what people think and
say I don't want the state have that
power and I think it's bad to have
people running around with hate
literature but the way to do it is not
to give power to some more dangerous
entity like the state the what you have
to do is meet them on you know get to
the people that they're reaching right
they are reaching people who are
susceptible to this literature why well
for reasons the kind I mentioned let's
take the the people who have been
subjected to the social policies that we
all know in which we just alluded to
yeah they're going to be frightened
angry they're gonna search for somebody
to blame it on they're gonna be easy
targets for hate literature just as they
were under the Nazis well the way to
deal with that was not to outlaw mine
comp that wouldn't change the thing it
was to deal with the sources in the
Society for what Hitler was appealing to
and the same is true here incidentally
if you're worried about talk that harms
people picking out hate literature is a
very odd choice yes that harms people
but free-market ideology harms them way
more if you take
if you want know people who are really
suffering you know let's who's really
suffering from the kind of IMF
fundamentalism which is mostly phony but
it's true that it's a dominant ideology
at least among elites well you know go
to you know Africa or Latin America or
poor slums in the United States and
you'll find people suffering mostly
women incidentally and suffering
miserably like mortality rates for women
and infants have gone way up okay hate
literature hasn't done that if you're
worried about harming people they're
much more obvious candidates and the
answer to this is not to have the state
powerful enough to stop people be
talking about this stuff that's not the
answer
I don't think I can say thank you any
better than all of you have to know
thanks very much on behalf of the PC
Federation of Labor and the Vancouver
and District Labor Council and my thanks
to all of you for being so patient
