I just know it's a has an unbreakable
grip but I can't tell you what it is
it's just life is empty without it
I have to say the people who really
impressed me when I have a chance to
meet them are people whose names
nobody'll ever hear so for example in
southern coal let me give you a personal
looks very personal example a couple of
months ago I learned that extremely poor
peasants in southern Colombia whose
lives are being destroyed in part by
us-run chemical warfare called
fumigation which destroys their
agricultural lands and communities and I
purchased by the terror of the Colombian
state and the by now terror the
guerrillas that they're caught in the
middle of really miserable people they
just planted a forest in memory of my
wife who died a couple of months ago
that's one of the most moving things
I've ever experienced I've actually met
some of them I did go down and couldn't
do mine I couldn't do anything for them
I just listened to horrible testimonies
but these are people with real and
they're all over the world you know with
real human feelings commitment concerned
suffering beyond what we can imagine but
willing to do something for someone else
they've never met and I you find things
like that all over the place here to
some of the most moving experiences I've
had are just in black churches in the
South during the civil rights movement
we're you know people were getting
beaten killed really struggling for the
most elementary right just asking for
the resolute the Congressional
amendments during the civil war smv
implemented not particularly radical but
quite about
