I was just wondering how much of an
effect do you think behaviorism has had
on the continued question of the
existence of language he continued
question about whether or not language
exists oh that overwhelming in bed
the behaviorism can't die it doesn't
matter how often it's refuted and how
fully it's refuted it comes right back
to life it's kind of like genetic
somehow actually I was taught this in
Toronto I was in Toronto a couple days
ago I was talking to a very outstanding
neuroscience noir linguist and works and
they spent a lot of the work in these
topics and she was telling me not not as
a joke about what happens in her
introductory courses
she teaches language acquisition in her
introductory language acquisition
courses the first day she asked skins to
say you have language required
she's about a hundred percent say
reinforcement Association I mean it's
you know it's been refuted so
overwhelmingly
that you don't know what to say about it
but you're absolutely right it keeps
coming back and it's at the core of
these computational cognitive science
approaches they don't call it
behaviorism anymore but it's sort of the
same idea actually behaviorism in a
serious sense collapsed in the early 60s
just for internal reasons I mean the you
know it we're interesting things that
happened it essentially wiped it out so
for example one are you a psychology oh
you noticed well if those of your
psychologists ought to know that a lot
of assessments forgotten you know
because people forget everything it
didn't have it isn't on the internet but
then it's a back around early 60s there
was a very interesting paper in Psych
review the main psychological journal by
Keller and Nancy Breeland there
Skinner's two main students you know the
most loyal Orthodox students they
assumed like everybody that the game
all over there's no point studying
anything anymore everything's answered
so they went off in the animal training
and in fact they're the ones who trained
all the famous animals like you know
flipper the dolphin all the things that
my kids watch don't know what you want
but and they discovered something they
discovered that when they were training
an animal they got the expected results
up to a certain point and then the
results started to deteriorate the so
for example if they were one case they
were training a pig to pick up a coin
and put it in a mail slot
and you know get a whatever pigs like
reinforced by some food and according to
the story the pig is supposed to improve
its behavior you know don't do any other
things just go more and more right to
the coin put it right in don't waste any
time you get reinforced and that worked
up to a point but then after that point
it turned out that the pig started
rooting at the coin and delaying the
reinforcement and would continue to do
it up to the point where it starved well
what was happening is what they called
instinctual drift pigs root you know
that's what they are and they were
interpreting this whole coin business
some crazy thing that the experimenter
made up that's just some plenty kind of
routing and then they then over time
went back to their routing well then
they started looking at all the
experiments in the lab it turned out the
experiments are always terminated when
this begins to happen so you get a
smooth learning curve and then things
start to go haywire so you stop the
experiment and say the Skinner
experiments with pigeons pecking well it
turns out there's two kinds of pecking
pigeons peck for corn and they also peck
for water and they look kind of alike
but there are different kinds of pecking
and the things that the pigeons were
able to be trained on actually were
adaptations of
one or the other of these kinds of
packing you tried to get the business do
something else to get nowhere but if you
kind of modify their instinctive
behavior slightly you can sort of fool
yourself into thinking you're getting
results but before too long the animal
takes over and it's doing what it was
doing so it kind of wiped out the whole
field later work in the mid-sixties
already began to discover that I mean I
remember this happening I was involved
in it but remember once gave a talk at
University of Illinois or somewhere
strict behaviorist department and you
know I like this 50 years ago so
different but same idea saying that you
can't get anywhere with conditioning and
reinforcement for human behavior so one
of the guy got up a very good
behavioural animal psychology and said
how do you know it works for animals so
I said I know you guys say it works for
animals so I suppose you're right and
the name is Bill Brewer and he got
interested and he started redoing the
animal experiments and he started
publishing some papers and it turned out
that the animals are getting reinforced
only when they're aware of what's
happening if you set up the experiment
you can do some sophisticated
experiments that distinguish cases where
the animal doesn't know what's going on
and then it doesn't get any
reinforcement or it's worse than do
anything and other cases where the
animal sort of sees what's going on it
gets reinforced so his conclusions and
others too was this is just information
transmission you know it's a
reinforcement experiments are an odd way
of providing the animal with information
when you can tell them heck when you I
tell you hit them so you do it this
other way and there's more work that did
that but by the yeah and more recent
times it's not even evident that
conditioning exists and there is work
again Randy jostle and others have
argued that it's all an artifact it's
just the various ways of estimating
valuable values of variables and the
whole thing kind of collapses but it
doesn't matter you're exactly right no
matter how much it's refuted it
right back the next day
