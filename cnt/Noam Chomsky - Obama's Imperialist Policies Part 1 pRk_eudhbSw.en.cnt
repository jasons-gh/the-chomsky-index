thank you for coming I'm Karen mal peet
and I wrote and directed the play
prophecy and that's not why I said that
just so you know who I was because it's
really my profound pleasure to introduce
professor Noam Chomsky author teacher
linguist preeminent intellectual and
moral voice of our time Noam Chomsky
knows more about the causes and effects
of American imperialism than any other
person alive and certainly far more than
anyone in the government so right now
when we need someone capable of cutting
through the captain speaking truth to
power we are graced with his fierce and
rigorous and gentle voice and I
particularly want to thank known for his
generosity in supporting theater three
collaborative a little tiny theater
trying to put on a play about the
effects of war that no established
theater in this country dared to produce
when I wrote down the story of how we
realized that we would have to do the
play ourselves he answered why am I not
surprised and he agreed to help it's
always been my dream of the theater
become again a vital part of the
intellectual life of its time and it's a
very great honor for the theater as a
whole to welcome Noam Chomsky to the
stage tonight
this this is work yeah okay well I'm
glad that we moved to a different
auditorium frankly I thought I could
shake off a little bit the emotions and
the memories that were brought up by the
performance a little bit not too much
one thing that couldn't help coming to
my mind as I was watching it that I
don't want to spend time on personal
things but I've had about 75 years of
consciousness of the outside world and I
don't think there's been a moment well
at least in the background and often
obsessively in the foreground it was the
thought that you've got to do something
to stop this horrific war too many of
them to mention and they're going to go
on and they're going to go on we can see
them develop right in front of our eyes
unless we do something about it I'll say
a couple of words about that and then
turn to you see what's on your minds I
just have to move come back from Lebanon
a couple of days
it's I was there for years exactly four
years ago with my wife we traveled
through southern Lebanon at lots of
people we were graciously welcomed homes
we gave me I gave talks I thought little
saw the country was a moment of real
hope it's had a terrible history but
that was a moment of great hopefulness
and aspiration for a better future a
couple of weeks after we left the place
was leveled that was the us-israeli war
said they operate at an the us-israeli
wore which essentially leveled the
southern part of the country this time
of course I went back to try to see the
places where we had men where the places
where we had been welcomed people we had
met some of them now murdered places
like Nantucket and southern in southern
South Beirut which was literally living
that's the famous stuff yet doctrine
that Israeli general proposed for Gaza a
couple years later it a lot of it's been
rebuilt amazingly rebuilt there's still
a spirit of courage and determination
with my senses of more grimness than
there was before because of an
expectation that it's going
again and it might I spoke to knowledge
quake I don't wanna mention any names
but very knowledgeable journalists
who've been in the region for decades
and are convinced that there's a there's
a Israel because the law of war coming
maybe soon and in that in this kit will
presumably be partying Israeli attack on
Iran if it happens if it does this time
it will be an error all out air war
which will probably destroy all of
Lebanon and Hezbollah seems to believe
and those who know about it seemed to
take them seriously they could that they
have now the capacity to devastate a
good part of Israel so maybe they'll
succeed in this during each other or
something like it and it could be in it
and it could be part of a much worse for
the involving Iran or even beyond how in
it is we don't really know so for
example Iran has announced as you may
have seen that they would send ships to
Gaza to join the efforts to break the
blockade if that happens you know it's
finished might turn into a nuclear war
which could spread without limits the we
we have a president named Barack Obama
if you take a look at his website I
don't know if it's still there the
website that he had he put up in his
primary campaign explaining his policies
and goal
and so on there's an action word 11 and
as mentioned once it's full of a few civ
love for Israel of course but the word
Lebanon is mentioned once namely he took
pride in the fact that as a senator one
of the few things that he did was to
co-sponsor a resolution in june two
thousand six a resolution which insisted
that nothing be done to prevent israel
from achieving its maximal goals in its
invasion of lebanon and that Iran and
Syria should be punished for helping
defend Lebanon from its attackers the I
gave of course talks in Lebanon one of
them was on May twenty-fifth the May
twenty-fifth I didn't know this is
happens to be a Lebanon Liberation Day
it's the one national holiday 11 schools
are closed businesses closed what's it
about well it's about the fact that in
the year 2000 the guerrillas his fellow
primarily had finally succeeded in
driving Israel out of southern Lebanon
where it had been holding territory for
22 years in violation of security
council orders with plenty of atrocities
and massacres
to include a number of invasions
including all of the Israeli figures who
are regarded as heroic doves Shimon
Peres it's a Caribbean and others but
they finally left and withdrew in the
year 2000 so this happened to be the
10th anniversary of the national holiday
Liberation Day if you read the press
coverage in Israel today it's a full
articles by military figures other
officials the frames Nana Moshe aren't
describing how they made a mistake by
withdrawing from Lebanon because now as
well what is has not been on focus
bolinao Iran is able to renew its
aggression against Israel in southern
Lebanon in other words what they were
doing in southern load and driving
guerrilla war against Israel is
aggression against Israel by Iran and
that's accepted in the united states you
won't know about the flotilla you know
that Israeli helicopters flew over the
boats but commandos down from where'd
the helicopters come from well from your
pockets if you're paying if your
taxpayers Israel doesn't manufacture
helicopters we give them the helicopters
with the purpose of carrying out war
crimes and that's not a joke and just to
give one example in the first month of
the in September 2000 just about the
time that israel withdrew from lebanon
finally in September 2000 the the Second
Intifada broke out the first month of it
was
tember was right after Arielle Sarang
had gone on that famous visit to the
region of the Temple Mount very
provocative and then the next day hey
who'd Barack send a big military force
which killed a lot of you then it broke
out in that first month September there
were 70 Palestinians killed and four
israeli soldiers the usual ratio if you
go back to the press reports you'll find
that the Israel Israel was using
helicopters meaning American helicopters
to attack the civilian targets like
apartment complexes killing dozens of
people it was reported what was not
reported however and to this day is
barely known is that just as those
reports were coming out about us
helicopters being used to attack
civilian complexes Bill Clinton made
sent made a deal to send the biggest
consignment of helicopters to Israel
ever or at least a decade Blackhawk
helicopters and spare parts for Apache
doctors the attack helicopters I cannot
write at the time that the news reports
were coming out about using them to
attack civilian complexes wasn't a
secret you could read in the Israeli
press you could read it in the military
journalist Jane's Defence weekly reading
the European press Amnesty International
how to report about it condemning it not
a word in the US press actually one word
one small newspaper in Virginia had a
reference to it it wasn't that it wasn't
known as all over the wire services of
editors were in fact approached as and
what if I don't run well you know that's
the kind of contribution that we make to
these atrocities and will continue to
Obama's one of the more extreme
disrespect as the example I just
mentioned well if that comes that's one
major war that may come pretty soon
maybe is likely to come it's not the
only one the one that's more likely in
fact is imminent any day now is an
attack on Qandahar in Afghanistan second
largest city in Afghanistan it's been
announced it's not secret that the next
major attack in Afghanistan is going to
be on Qandahar well the US Army has
published taken holes and published them
so you can read them in the American
press of opinion in Kandahar that's
about ninety-five percent opposed to a
military action 19 21 by the tribal
elders have met apart from cold same
percentage
we don't want the military action
against their Afghan brothers referring
to the taller one okay that's the next
one that's coming you can guess what
that's going to look like the last
attack were widely reported Harold
Asbury Vickery was an attack on Marge
Omar Joseph town small town but Helmand
province for most of the insurgency is
in the question areas marjo was finally
conquered after a couple of days of
pretty bitter fighting as you may have
seen a few days after that the commander
I think lieutenant general or something
forgot his name had an interview in the
press which he said we've got to revise
our notion of enemy he said we were
thinking we were going to drive the
enemy out of Marja but now we understand
that the people of marjo support the
enemy so we can't we got to recalibrate
and think some other way of talking
about who the enemy is this is very
reminiscent of earlier the
counterinsurgency wars in fact he could
have read the same in profiting 80s and
you could have read the same in the
United States in the 1960s where it was
written so for example in most of in
1965 the leading US government scholar
that that was quite the wrote a book
about the Viet Cong viet cong is a
derogatory term invented by us
propaganda for the National Liberation
Front the southern
resistance and he described how
difficult the u.s. goals are going to be
in South Vietnam he said the problem we
face is that the Viet Cong are Matt are
the only Maskull it achill force in
South Vietnam and to try to confront
them say it by political means would be
like a minnow confronting a whale our
clients being the minnow of them being
the whale so therefore the only thing we
can do is to reconstruct the war so that
it's not the kind they want a political
war but it's the kind we're good at a
military war so we prefer our
comparative advantage which is violence
and we have to do that because there's
no other way to for a minnow to deal of
the whale and in fact that's the main
principle of the famous coin as its now
pull counterinsurgency doctrine which is
you know the wonderful new a theory that
we're supposed to be dedicated to and
yeah if you're fighting wars in other
people's countries you constantly faced
with that some it's not the United
States that invented it there the
Russians or the British credibility the
same thing the French the Germans in
fact as far back as you go the Romans
the Greeks well that's the prospect
we're looking for Pat and forever years
I have left I don't expect them to be
different from the past 75 of
consciousness unless some
very significant happen to you at least
a willingness to face the reality of
these of these actions stop their turn
to you so if you would like to ask a
question or say something raise your
hand and you'll get a microphone do you
think that Barack Obama is erected I'm
elected for a second term to see him go
more to the right move even one of the
right yes hard to know it takes a george
bush bush's second term was considerably
more centrist than his first term first
term was abrasive aggressive reason I
mean he basically literally he and Colin
Powell and the rest to pull Europeans
literally you either do what we say or
you're irrelevant the we don't care
about you we make history was one of
their famous words we don't care you you
guys the reporters you can report
history who we make it and they went
ahead and made like in Iraq for example
that term dropped us prestige to its
lowest point in history us became one of
the most hated countries in the world
and feared countries in the world and it
led to quite considerable internal
criticism right within the establishment
the second Bush term move was more
moderate more
toward the center they kicked out some
of the most outlandish figures of
rumsfeld Wolfowitz a couple others
couldn't get rid of Dick Cheney because
he basically was the administration the
other thing a lot of the others went and
it was more of a familiar kind of what
we call centrist administration and
Obama's pretty much following the
policies of the second Bush
administration what he would do in the
next term if he has another term I don't
know how to predict depends on what the
world situation you just can't tell I
mean takes a candidate though there's a
lot of propaganda is what it amounts to
about how if Kennedy had been had not
been assassinated well the kind of
wonderful things would happen he was
planning this that nila he was going to
get us out of yet nom he was going to
make peace in the world and so on are
the evidence for that is Europe I mean
I'm Vietnam for example there's a
massive evidence I would it shows as he
was sort of it toward a hawkish into the
administration when he was willing to
tolerate McNamara's proposals for slow
withdrawal from Vietnam but always with
a qualification after victory never
departed from that so yeah after victory
and in fact the people in his
administration like McNamara were the
most committed to withdrawal we know
what they did when the situation change
after there was a kind of period of
optimism about victory in 1963 but 1964
was clear that that was a fantasy so
then war then we get to build spike and
the policies that went along with it and
I to the slightest reason to doubt that
Kennedy would have done this
thing and you know the political leaders
operated within a pretty narrow
framework which is set by external
factors power systems of various kind
must of domestic concentration of
economic power and they there's a
difference between them they're not
identical but I don't think that these
differences are very predictable so for
example in many ways Richard Nixon was
the last liberal president that's
literally true to his policies yeah I'd
like to ask you what you see whether the
financial crisis has had any effect on
the level of aggressiveness of the Obama
administration it's going to have to
have some effect look at the famous
Deborah now you know the current
propaganda is we have to be obsessed
with the deficit okay that's coming from
people like peter peterson it's to
another server you know just dying to
get rid of Social Security another
benefits day so we have to concentrate
on the deficit actually it's pretty dumb
idea you should have a deficit during a
recession they should have a bigger
deficit to stimulate growth and so on
but put that aside what's the deficit
take a look at it about half the deficit
is military spending which is going on
under Obama in fact it's the most
military spending of any president's
first term not relative to GDP but
absolutely well that's roughly half the
deficit so the famous not deal with the
deficit demands
of that and of course that would mean
cutting back on adventurism oversees the
united states is spending approximately
as much on the military as the rest of
the world combined and it's
technologically farmer that and going
into areas that other countries came a
dream about in fact are trying to
prevent like state who you know were
using space for military purposes and
there's all kind of other grotesque
ideas on the drawing were like take
drones which are the exciting new
technology there is now plans for
developing drones with nanotechnology
which allows a lot theoretically a lot
more flexibility and having them range
from you know massive drones which in
carry out vast destruction to drones for
targeted assassinations which has just
been condemned by Phil Alston's when
deleting specialist on international
human rights a down to drones which can
get into your living room and kill
particular tiny drones that will be able
to penetrate small living spaces and
kill people suspected of this that or
the other thing well you know all of
this is extremely expensive and that's
plus the eight hundred or so military
bases around the world and the Obama
administration is very much committed to
those I'm they practically overthrew the
government of japan just recently it's
big country because the prime minister
of japan had been elected on a camp
promise to a Tiana to close down the
military base in Okinawa the people of
Okinawa have been struggling to get that
base out of there for decades and the
Japanese government finally agreed to
try to do it but the Obama
administration put its foot down with a
major power play how to Yama had to
resign you know that's an indication of
how power works and what the plans are
so yeah if they're if there's going to
be any effort to deal with the growing
deficit serious effort that's what it
will have to concentrate on now it's not
going to Obama has a commission as you
know that is supposed to deal with the
deficit but there's every likelihood
that that Commission if you just took
the way it's constituted is going to go
after benefits like Social Security
which isn't the economic problem at all
there's hated by a lease they've been
trying to get rid of it for years
although it's pretty good shape fiscally
so they're going to go after that
they're gonna have to go after Medicare
benefits and so on but nobody's talking
about doing anything about the military
which keeps expanding but yeah that's
going to be a constraint at some point
you know you can't get one like that for
her actually the other half of the
deficit is mostly medical expenses do
they completely dis fun
tional us medical system which has not
been improved in its most dysfunctional
aspect by Obama's health care reform I
both to reformat a few good things in it
but it didn't touch the main part which
is the incredible expense of the system
it's about twice the per capita expense
of other of comparable countries and
outcomes are down toward the bottom so
for example a maternal atmosphere
national just put out a report on
maternal deaths deaths during childbirth
the United States is worse than Greece
you know I mean it's despite twice as
high for capita expenses of anybody one
of the these studies global studies it
comparing many countries among them Cuba
in the United States Cuba has
approximately the same health outcomes
as the United States that five percent
of the expense per capita well none of
this is touched in Obama's health care
reform and we have this is the only
country in the world where as far as I
know where the government is barred by
law from negotiating drug prices they
can do it the Veterans Administration so
their prices are sort of reasonable but
they pick Medicare can't do it so of
course drug prices are you know two or
three times as high as anywhere else
Obama insisted on that he made a promise
to the drug companies that that wouldn't
be touched over the objection of
eighty-five percent of the population
according to polls at the time that's
not touched the private private eyes
didn't
virtually unregulated insurance basis
for the system is extremely expensive
and that's not touched in fact as you
know obama killed even the public option
over the objection of probably
two-thirds of the population so these
things are just you know that's holy
territory financial institutions are far
too powerful to in dominating the
government for there to be any real
progress on this unless we move towards
a functioning democracy but but with the
point you make is correct there's there
is a conflict coming up between
financial crisis which is our state's
not going away unemployment is going to
be very high for a while it's not just
the financial crisis it's a general
economic crisis unemployment is
extremely high no indication that it's
going to reduce in fact you know the
economists are now recalculating what's
