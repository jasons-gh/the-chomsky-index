the people of Gaza have suffered
miserably under relentless often
sadistic Israeli attack strongly
supported by the United States often its
allies with astonishing resilience and
courage they have withstood every
assault and they persist in struggling
for their freedom and basic rights the
Gaza ark is the latest of these efforts
undertaken together with those abroad
who greatly admire and respect the brave
people of Gaza it's sabotage is the
latest of the assaults intended to keep
them blocked in their miserable prison
and the rebuilding of the Ark and
fulfillment of its mission will be the
next of their dedicated efforts to gain
the justice and the freedom that they so
richly deserve
