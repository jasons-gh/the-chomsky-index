number ten number one Karl Marx Lenin

Chomsky Hegel Cicero
under the liberal administration of the
1960s the laws of academic intellectuals
designed and implemented the Vietnam War
and the other similar the smaller
actions this particular community is a
very relevant one to consider at a place
like MIT because of course you're all
free to enter enter this community in
fact you're invited and encouraged in
the community of technical and elegancy
and weapons designers and
counterinsurgency experts and pragmatic
planners of an American Empire is one
that you have a great deal of inducement
to become associated with right in
manufacturing consent that it's the
primary function of the mass media in
the United States to mobilize public
support for the special interests that
dominate the government and the private
sector what are those interests well if
you want to understand the way any
society works ours or any other the
first place to look is who makes who is
in a position to make the decisions that
determine the way the society functions
societies differ but in ours the major
decisions over what happens in the
society decisions over investment and
production and distribution and so on
are in the hands of a relatively
concentrated network of major
corporations and conglomerates and
investment firms and so on they are also
the ones who staff the major executive
positions in the government and they're
the ones who own the media and they're
the ones who have to be in a position to
make the decisions
they have an overwhelmingly dominant
role in the way life happens what's done
in the society within the economic
system by law principle they dominated
the control of our resources and the
need to satisfy their interests imposes
very sharp constraints on the political
system and the ideological system New
York Times is certainly the most
important newspaper in the United States
and one could argue the most important
newspaper in the world
the New York Times plays an enormous
role in shaping the perception of the
current world on the part of the
politically active educated classes also
the New York Times has a special role
and I believe its editors probably feel
that they bear a heavy burden in the
sense that the New York Times creates
history I was a very conscious decision
and a very uncomfortable decision
because I knew what the consequences
would be I was in a very favorable
position I had the kind of work I like
we had a lively exciting department the
field was doing well personal life was
fine I was living in a nice place
children growing up everything looked
perfect and I knew I was giving it up
and at that time remember was not just
giving talks I began involved right away
in resistance and expected to spend
years in jail okay we're close to it
thank my wife went back to graduate
school in part because we assume she's
going to support the children these were
the expectations
and I recognized that if I returned to
these interests which were the dominant
interests of my own youth life would
become very uncomfortable did I know
that the United States you don't get to
go psychiatric prison they don't send a
death squad after you and so on but
there are there are definite penalties
for breaking rules so there's a real
decision and it simply seemed at that
point that it was just hopelessly mrl
not for Chomsky I'm a on the faculty at
MIT and I've been getting more heavily
involved in anti-war activities for the
last few years
something beginning with writing
articles and making speeches and
speaking of Congressman and that sort of
things gradually getting involved more
and more directly and resistant
activities of various sorts I've come to
be feeling myself that the most
effective form of political action that
is open to a responsible and concerning
citizen at the moment is action that
really involves direct resistance
refusal to take part in what I think are
were crimes who raise the domestic cost
of American aggression overseas through
non participation and support for those
who are refusing to take parts in the
theater draft resistance throughout the
country
I think that we can see quite clearly
some very very serious defects and flaws
in our society our level of culture our
institutions which are going to have to
be corrected by operating outside of the
framework that is commonly accepted I
think we're going to have to find new
ways in political action and carry
inside
Hey
the way things change is because lots of
people are working all the time and you
know they're working in their
communities in their workplace or
wherever they happen to be and they're
building up the basis for popular
movements which are going to make
changes that's the way everything has
ever happened in history you know
whether it was in slavery or whether it
was the Democratic revolutions or
anything you want you name it that's the
way it worked you get a very false
picture of this from the history books
in the history books there's a couple of
leaders
you know George Washington or Martin
Luther King whatever and I don't want to
say that those people are unimportant
Martin Luther King was certainly
important but he was not disabled rights
movement Martin Luther King can appear
in the history books cause lots of
people whose names you will never know
and whose names are all forgotten than
who may have been killed and so on we're
working down in the South I wonder if
you can envision a time when people like
myself again in naive people of this
world can again take pride in the United
States and is that even a healthy to
wish now because it may be this hunger
for pride in our country that makes us
more easily manipulated by the powers
that you talk about I think you first of
all have to ask what you mean by your
country now if you mean by the country
the government I don't think you can be
proud of it and I don't think he could
ever be proud of it or it couldn't be
proud of any good it's not our guy
and you shouldn't be States or violent
institutions the the government of any
country including ours represents some
sort of domestic power structure and
it's usually violent when states are
violent to the extent that they're
powerful that's roughly accurate you
look at American history it's nothing to
write home of them you know why are we
here
we're here because say some 10 million
Native Americans were wiped out that's
not very pretty until the 1960s it was
still cowboys and Indians in the 1970s
for the first time really it became
possible even for scholarship to try to
deal with the facts as they were for
example to deal with the fact that the
Native American population was far
higher than had been claimed millions
higher maybe as many as 10 million
higher than had been claimed and that
they had an advanced civilization and
that there was something that can the
genocide that took place now we went
through 200 years of our history without
facing that thing one of the effects of
the 1960's as it's possible to at least
begin to come to them to think about the
facts well that's an advantage and I'm
really glad to be back I have sort of a
simple question for professor Chomsky it
seems to me that you left out in your
analysis the element of violence
psychological physical against Israel
against Jews and it seems to me also
that the history that professor dish was
described a lot of that is dictated by
what what happened the terrorism the
wars against Jews especially considering
the immediate history right before the
establishment of the State of Israel the
Holocaust and everything that has
happened since oh I'd like you to
address the effect of the psychological
effect and the physical effect of war
and terrorism on Israel
