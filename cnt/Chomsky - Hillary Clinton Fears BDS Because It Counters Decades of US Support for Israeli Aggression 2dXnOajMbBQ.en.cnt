no I want to turn back to the democratic
debate that was held here in Brooklyn
Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton
sparred over the issue of Israel and
Palestine this exchange begins with a
question from the moderator Wolf Blitzer
Secretary Clinton you agree with senator
Sanders that Israel over reacts to
Palestinian attacks and that in order
for there to be peace between Israel and
the Palestinians Israel must quote end
it's disproportionate responses I can
tell you right now because I have been
there with Israeli officials going back
more than 25 years that they do not seek
this kind of attacks they do not invite
rockets raining down on their towns and
villages so I don't know how you run a
country when you are under constant
threat terrorist attack rockets coming
at you you have a right to defend
yourself and let me say this if yasser
arafat had agreed with my husband at
Camp David in the late 1990s to the
offer that prime minister Barak put on
the table we would have had a
Palestinian children 15 years
anybody would suggest that Israel
invites or welcomes missiles flying into
their country that is not the issue and
you evaded the answer he evaded the
question the question is not does Israel
have a right to the respond not does
Israel have a right to go after
terrorists and destroy terrorism that's
not the debate was their response
disproportionate I believe that it was
you about answer that there comes a time
when if we pursue justice and peace we
are going to have to say that Netanyahu
is not right all of the time that's
Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on
the issue of Israel and Palestine Noam
Chomsky responds
well it's interesting and helpful that
Sanders said that by world standards
it's way off to the extreme I don't know
what dimension to call it the
nationalist right the talk the question
of Israel's disproportionate response is
a little bit like the question of
expansion of the settlements the only
one you're allowed to discuss here these
are not the questions the question is
why is there a response at all why are
there any settlements the settlements
are totally illegal that's been
determined by the heart highest
authorities Security Council
International Court of Justice Red Cross
administers the Geneva Conventions
there's simply no question about their
legality at one point the u.s. also
agreed that they were illegal now they
just say it's an obstacle to peace so
and the same is true of the
disproportionate response so let's take
at these alleged missiles for so there
aren't any missiles but the so-called
rocket attacks that are coming why are
they coming you look at the record of
going through it in detail and print if
you want to look at it in the book that
you just mentioned
in fact consistently what has happened
is this a ceasefire agreement is reached
between Hamas and Israel the terms are
always about the same and the siege no
more military action beginning of
commercial relations and so on
Israel complete Hamas lives up to the
terms Israel totally disregards them it
maintains the siege of brutal harsh
siege continues with military actions
finally some is escalation in Israeli
attacks leads to a Hamas response at
that point we get another episode of
what Israel politely calls mowing the
lawn each one worse than the last then
we get a question here is Israel's
response disproportionate it's I mean if
it weren't so grotesque it would be
comical the question is why is Israel
maintaining a harsh brutal vicious siege
which is destroying Gaza consistently
violating the ceasefire agreements that
it reaches and then when there's some
response to its escalating crimes
carries out a monstrous attack while its
protector debates whether the response
is disproportionate the the real problem
is right here as long as the United
States continues to support all of this
it's going to continue and incidentally
the u.s. support for Israeli actions is
not only is not only supporting
violations of international law it is
explicitly violating US law take a look
at US law so-called lay law it flatly
bars military dispatch of military
equipment to any military group that is
involved in consistent human rights
violations it simply no doubt that the
Israeli army is involved in extremely
serious human rights violations
consistently
that's why organizations like Amnesty
International and I if I recall
correctly Human Rights Watch have called
for a ban on sending weapons Israel in
accord with US law incidentally so yes
if the United States lived up the US law
if it stopped providing the decisive
support for the settlement activities it
claims it's opposed to for other
repression and violence then there
wouldn't be any need for any response
certainly not a disproportionate
response as to Clinton's famous offer
last Camp David mrs. Clinton may
remember that Clinton himself recognized
that it was inadequate a couple months
later in December he after Camp David he
issued what he called his parameters for
a settlement both sides accepted them
both sides had reservations Israel had
extremely severe reservations they were
to negotiate these in Taba in January
2001 negotiations took place they were
called off by Israel at a point where
the negotiators at least said they were
coming pretty close to an agreement an
agreement which was much less extreme on
the pro-israel side than the Clinton
proposals well a prime minister Barak
himself has said informally that maybe
doctors incorrectly that the Israeli
negotiators at table I had no authority
negotiate anything so it was kind of a
show no I wanted to go back to the
candidates on this issue particularly
what Hillary Clinton had to say to AIPAC
earlier this year when she criticized
the BDS movement the boycott divestment
sanctions movement as I wrote last year
in a letter to the heads of major
American Jewish organizations we have to
be United
fighting back against BDS many of its
proponents have demonized Israeli
scientists and intellectuals even
students to all the college students who
may have encountered this on campus I
hope you stay strong keep speaking out
don't let any one silence you bully you
or try to shut down debate especially in
places of learning by colleges and
universities
anti-semitism has no place in any
civilized society not in America
not in Europe not anywhere professor
Noam Chomsky can you respond to
presidential candidate Hillary Clinton
well some of what she said is quite
accurate um strongly I'm very happy so
that she has agreed that one should not
shut down debate on this issue in campus
she's about 40 years too late over the
past decades I've had plenty of
experience the few other people who talk
about this issue have similar experience
of trying to give talks on the topic on
university campuses with police
protection with meetings broken up
violently with airport style security at
entrances even at my own University
until not long ago not only did there
have to be a police presence but the
police insisted on walking me back to my
car just because of the threat of
violence so that's been going on for
decades and it's very nice that miss
Clinton has finally decided yes maybe it
would be nice to have free and open
debate on campus as there is now for the
first time and it's a good thing that
there is that there is now a possibility
of free and open debate on campuses you
can find if you search a kitten mama
marginal cases of excesses reminds me of
back around 1970 when people like
Seymour Martin Lipset were desperately
searching through local black newspapers
to see if they could find an
anti-semitic comments somewhere so they
could then condemn the black movements
as anti-semitic you know you can
understand the game
but the fact of the matter is now there
is for the first time free open
extensive discussion and debate on
campus not perfect by any means on you
can find things on to all sides but
radically different from before
as to the tactics of boycott and
divestment they make perfect sense when
the Presbyterian Church imposes a
boycott and divestment on anything
connected to the Israeli occupied
territories including US multinationals
that's critical which are involved in
the territories that's a very positive
step forward sir canonical supportive of
international law supportive of genuine
moral principles a very significant act
nonviolent act to oppose the brutality
violence and repression we could I think
go much farther as I said we should be
calling for implementation of US law
along joining Amnesty International and
others to call for an end to US military
aid to Israel but boycotting sanctions
make perfectly good sense when these
tactics are properly applied as they
often are you can understand why Hillary
Clinton is frightened of them they might
undermine the policy of her husband than
his predecessors and Obama as well to
support Israeli violence and aggression
to protect Israeli nuclear weapons from
scrutiny so we can't have a nuclear
weapons free zone in the region to veto
Security Council resolutions which
literally support official US policy as
Obama did in February 20 2011 yeah and
the non violent actions to undermine
this legitimate actions of course fright
Hillary Clinton enormous Lee and then
your tirades like this but one part was
correct namely it's good idea to protect
the right of free discussion and debate
on campus it's a shame that that never
occurred to her for the past 40 years
when it was impossible to have the baton
discussion without violence of police
protection and so on no I want to break
and then ask you who you are supporting
in this presidential race Noam Chomsky
