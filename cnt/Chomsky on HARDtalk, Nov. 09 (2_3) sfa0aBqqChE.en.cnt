maybe if that's the case and the public
you say is behind many of the positions
you hold maybe the reason that the
public isn't necessarily giving full
voice to support for you is that they
find it difficult to live with some of
the things you say about the United
States and your critics say that you
consistently exaggerate the crimes
committed as you call them crimes
committed by the United States and you
airbrush away the failings of America's
enemies and the facts are the opposite I
underestimate US and British crimes and
I overestimate the crimes of enemy well
let's take an example let me go back to
one statement you said the reason the
American people don't vote for my
position they don't have that option
even if they knew what it was that's not
one of the options the system is
designed so that you have two choices
within business run systems and the
choices are a little different and
sometimes it makes some sense to pick
one rather than the other and both
choices happen to be off the main
spectrum of American opinion on many
crucial issues so there's no choice but
language is important and when you and
this is back in 69 when your main focus
was activism against the Vietnam War
you wrote what is needed in the u.s. is
a kind of denazification that's a very
common quote from the right wing
do you know the context well look at the
context it was in 1967 the Chicago
Museum of Science very well-known
institution had an exhibit which was a
diorama of a Vietnamese village in which
children could stand on the outside and
shoot guns into the Vietnamese village
okay a group of mothers protested and
the New York Times had an editorial
denouncing the mothers because they were
taking they were taking away the
from the kiddies who were having a great
time shooting guns into a Vietnamese
village that's the context but I'm
commenting on that I said you have to
ask whether what the United States needs
is descent or detoxification and I would
say the same thing today in that same
context in that same context we're
usually where you pick it up from you
know the right wing blogs and so on or
even the liberal blogs all the context
is eliminated but if you put the context
back in I think the sentences are pearl
is that still a mindset in power in the
United States which in your view is a
king - requiring as a response
quote/unquote D knots if Acacia with
that context yes I'd repeat it has the
country changed enormous ly it's changed
through activism which which has
tremendously changed the country it's
become a much more civilized country the
same here through large-scale activism
since roots noticed way back that the
major routes were the activism of the
60s mostly young people which changed
the country but but it's the king with
foreign policy then would you say there
is a morality maybe to America's
presence and and fight in Afghanistan
which was not there in Afghan because
now Obama calls it quote unquote a war
of necessity and he says to Americans we
are fighting this more precisely because
your security in the United States is at
stake al Qaeda bin Laden the Taliban who
protected them these are people who want
to destroy our way of life and we have
to combat them and he's not doing it in
fact he's radicalizing the population
with but we could we could ask a factual
question does this contribute to defense
of the United States but that's not the
moral question I mean you know the Nazis
could have said that it contributes to
the security of but there are many to
consider before 11:00 happened
know that it happened because the
Taliban sheltered militant jihadi will
actually led by bin Laden who planned it
from Afghanistan that is a fact and it's
I mean it's my belief - and it's the
belief of the FBI - but it's only a
belief as they pointed out eight the
head of the FBI eight months after the
invasion of Afghanistan it was queried
by the press Washington Post and said
well we believe that the plot was
hatched in Afghanistan and implemented
in the United Arab Emirates and in
Germany but we can't prove it that's
after the most intensive investigation
in history secondly Afghanistan was not
invaded and attacked to overthrow the
Taliban that was a came a couple of
weeks later it was it was attacked
because George Bush demanded that the
Taliban handover Osama bin Laden and
associates to the United States
the Taliban vacillated they indicated
they might consider it if there was
evidence provided but the United States
perfused to provide F so you wouldn't
accept that what happened and continues
to happen in Afghanistan with the
American and NATO presence is in any
sense just a just war a just conflict I
think it's a very weak argument
basically not but in fact if you want to
know the truth I think it's one of the
most immoral acts in modern history
while they're the most immoral and let
me explain why that if you look back at
October 2001 the the United States
invaded Afghanistan because the Taliban
refused to hand over suspects without
evidence okay not actually they had a
right to do that you're supposed to
provide evidence if you want extradition
at the time the estimates were there
were about five million Afghans on the
verge of starvation and the estimates
were that if the United States bomb that
might go to two and a half million more
in fact the a date inches agencies which
were forced to leave when the bombing
was announced bitterly condemned the
bombing and take a look across the board
almost all of them bitterly condemned
the bombing and many leading
anti-taliban Afghans including us favors
very harshly condemned the bombing I
mean you said millions might die within
weeks that's I was reading from the New
York Times report of the enormous it
didn't happen but to say that happen is
irrelevant we look it did when
Khrushchev put missiles in Cuba it
didn't lead to a nuclear war and I
suppose some party hack would say well
you know I was fine to put missiles in
Cuba it wasn't it was a criminally
insane if the worst didn't happen that
doesn't change the conditions of the
choices the point I'm trying to get to
perhaps the best port in this simple
sense by going to another internet
question from a viewer of hard to Rafael
st. amour and in Canada says quite
simply mr. Chomsky do you think the
Obama administration should leave
Afghanistan right now it can't be
answered in that form because it doesn't
matter what I think
what matters is what the Afghans think
invading armies have no rights they have
responsibilities the responsibilities
responsibility is to pay attention to
the to pay attention to the opinions of
those you're attacking now if you look
at the debate over Afghanistan
strikingly one voice is missing what are
the Afghans think well you know it's not
that easy to determine but it's not
totally impossible either for example
there happens to be an Afghan peace
movement which is pretty significant
their voice is totally missing
