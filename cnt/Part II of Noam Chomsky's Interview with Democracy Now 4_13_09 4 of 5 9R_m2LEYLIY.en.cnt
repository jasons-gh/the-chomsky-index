king of wool were a stimulus profession
here on democracy and a stimulus
progression here on democracy now
democracynow.org the war and peace
report I'm Amy Goodman is return now to
the last part of my conversation with
leading American intellectual and
anti-imperialist critic Noam Chomsky the
whole issue of populous rage Noam
Chomsky actually do you think that this
rage is going to boil over as the
unemployment figures rise it's very hard
to predict those things I mean it has a
potentially positive side like it could
be like the activism of the 1930s or the
1960s which ended up making it a more
civilized society in many ways or it
could be like an unfortunate president
that quickly comes to mind of written
about it you take a look at Germany in
the 1920s a Germany was the absolute
peak of Western civilization in the arts
and the sciences this regard as a model
of democracy and so on I mean 10 years
later is that depths of barbarism that
was a quick transition descent into
barbarism at sometimes school in the
literature scholarly literature now if
you listen to early Nazi propaganda you
know end of the by my republic and so on
and you listen to talk radio in the
united states which I often do it's
interesting there's a resemblance and in
both cases you have a lot of demagogues
appealing to people with real grievances
grievances aren't invented I mean for
the American population the last 30
years of the some of the worst economic
history that's a rich country but real
wages have stagnated or declined working
hours of shot up benefits have gone down
people are in real trouble and now in
very real trouble after the bubbles
burst and they're angry and they want to
know what happened to me you know I'm a
hard-working white god-fearing America
you know how come this is happening to
me that's pretty much the Nazi of field
the grievances were real and one of the
possibilities is what Rush Limbaugh
tells you well it's happening to you
because of those bad guys out there okay
the Nazi case it was the Jews and the
Bolsheviks here it's the rich Democrats
who run Wall Street and run the media
give everything away to illegal
immigrants and so on and so forth it
sort of peaked during the sarah palin
period that's kind of interesting it's
been pointed out that of all the
candidates sarah palin's the only one
who used the phrase working class she
was talking to working people and yeah
they're the ones are suffering so there
are models that are not very attractive
and she very much is being talked about
as as a leader really of well she's kind
of a model you know the talk radio mom
went crazy over and one shouldn't demean
it you know they describe themselves
it's really worth listening to we're fly
by country you know they don't care
about us those rich Democrats on the
East Coast and the west coast were all
you know interested in gay rights giving
things away to illegal immigrants and so
on they don't care about us the
hard-working you know god-fearing people
so we gotta somehow rise up and take
over and elect Sarah Palin or Rush
Limbaugh or someone like that as I say
the precedents are not attractive now if
not even before the next presidential
isn't an X congressional election the
economy has not begun to recover this
kind of populous rage could boil over
and could have very dangerous
consequences this country has a long
history of being kind of written by fear
it's very frightened countries goes back
to colonial times we're very lucky that
we have never had an honest demagogue I
mean the demagogues we've had are so
corrupt that they never got anywhere you
know Nixon McCarthy you know
jimmy swaggart and others so they were
kind of destroyed with her own
corruption but suppose we had an honest
demagogue you know Hitler type who was
not corrupt it was probably it could be
a could be unpleasant there's a
background of concern and fear
tremendous fear and searching for some
answer which are not getting from the
establishment who's responsible for my
plight you know and that can be
exploited and unless there's active
effective organizing and education it's
dangerous your assessment of President
Obama so far frankly I never had any
expectations I heard about it over a
year ago I thought then and I think it's
been confirmed that he's essentially a
centrist Democrat he's moving back I
mean the Bush administration was kind of
off the spectrum especially the first
term so he's moving things back toward
the center with a kind of a public
posture which was recognized by the
advertising industry that's why they
gave him the award for best marketing
campaign which but as far as policy is
concerned unless he's under a lot of
pressure from you know activist sectors
he's not going to go beyond what he's
presented himself as in actual policy
statements or her cabinet choices and so
on centrist Democrat gonna basically
continued wishes policies maybe in a
more modulated way do you see
Afghanistan becoming a never expanded
war in the next decade or so do you them
now we're talking about doubling the
u.s. trips that's the way Obama and the
Pentagon see it in fact they say so this
is going to be a long war it's going to
be extended the u.s. is going to take
over the military side and it's going to
expand it it's going to expand into
Pakistan it's a and I mean we'll talk
about development but the focus will be
on military Obama right now is trying to
get NATO to cooperate but recognizing
that they're not going to send military
forces the populations are opposed
Canada
falling out yeah countess Willie on the
other is maybe how long this made a
termination date but we'll at least ask
them to come in and sort of help out on
the civilian side that's their job
that's the famous line of i guess it was
robert kagan you know their Venus we
were Mars so we'll move in like Mars and
take care of the military side you know
we're good at killing people and they
can come in and sort of put on the
band-aids and make it look like
something good is happening it's not the
right direction the unmanned drones
bombing Pakistan yeah Turan Thrones but
and that has effect so a lot of the
worst fighting recently has been in
modular province right on the border in
Pakistan side and militants in the area
have reported to the press that part of
the reason is that an American drone
attack hit madrasa school and killed
about 80 people well you know they're
uncivilized barbarians they sort of them
like that also they reacted and now one
of the milks is that ok we're going to
bomb the White House which is considered
totally outrageous but you know if we
kill as we like there's going to be
reaction where do you see American
Empire in 10 20 30 years prediction in
human affairs is a very Loeb has a very
little success too many complications of
the United States I think will come out
of the economic crisis very likely as
the dominant superpower there's a lot of
talk about China and India and it's real
they're changing but there's not the
same league I mean both China and India
have enormous internal problems that the
West doesn't face you get it kind of a
picture of this by looking at the human
development index of the United Nations
the last time I looked India was about a
hundred and twenty-fifth there's
something and I think China was about
80th and China would be worse I think if
it wasn't such a closed society in ND
sort of get better data so you can see
what's happening China's kind of clothes
you don't see what's going on in the
peasant area
which are in turmoil you know they have
environmental problems if huge hundreds
of millions of people are kind of like
the edge of starvation we don't have you
know we have problems but not those
problems and even the industrial growth
which is there you know for part of the
population there's been improvement but
it takes a India where we know more in
the areas where I high-tech industries
developed that's pretty impressive I've
visited some of the labs and Hyderabad
you know it's good or better than MIT
but right nearby the rate of peasant
suicides is going up or sharply in fact
and it's the same source that's the
neoliberal policies which privilege a
certain sector of the population and a
certain and let the rest
