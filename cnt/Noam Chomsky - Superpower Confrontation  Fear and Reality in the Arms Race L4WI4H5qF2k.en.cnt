to be very great and it seems really to
to have deep roots in in the American
psyche what do you think the basis for
this is well from my perspective I think
it's have been a kind of conditioned
reflex it's been building up in this
country ever since the Bolshevik
Revolution in Russia in 1917 1918 there
may be some legit of reasons why people
object to communism but I think that the
broad kind of fear that we have in my
view is the physics as a conditioned
reflex that sort of covers up what our
own country has been up to during that
period it seems to me it's pretty
obvious that the rationale of the
American government for pushing through
more and more money to buy weapons you
know the influence on Congress is the
quote fear military fear of the Soviet
Union
actually there are two as far as I can
see there are two forces in the world
that are attempting to carry out the in
my view quite ludicrous attempt to
identify the Soviet Union with communism
one is the Soviet leadership itself
which is trying to exploit the the
positive image of the of the egalitarian
communist tradition for their own
benefit and the other is the United
States the American propaganda system
which is which also would like to
undermine that egalitarian vision by
associating it with Russian
totalitarianism but I don't think that
we should and you're right I mean this
leads to a situation in which the values
of the egalitarian socialist tradition
the libertarian egalitarian socialist
tradition are associated in the American
mind with the brutal and repressive
Soviet state which in my view has
nothing whatsoever to do with communism
or anything that no connection with it
and these things I think very much
should be dissociated so I wouldn't
think that I don't for example I think
the American people a very good reason
where everyone has good reason to fear
the Russian state which is a violent and
repressed
brutal autocracy no I don't know that we
should spend our time trying to argue
about the definition I would agree with
Noam in a pure sense but I think in
practical political terms they're still
as seen as a threat of Soviet Communism
in terms of American military informed
yeah you're right but I think we have to
separate out the various strands in that
threat it's perfectly true that the
United States or at least you know the
American leadership in the American
ideological system have been very
strongly opposed to what they call
socialism but of course they're opposed
to many other things too for example
they're they've often been opposed to
fascism you know we went the war with
fascist States there they were opposed
to national capitalism in Europe I mean
they were a pope that the United States
has been opposed to democracy for
example we were opposed to democracy to
a nudie overt style regime in Guatemala
and in fact there's a general principle
of which the opposition to so-called
socialism is just one special case
namely the United States is opposed
natura Lee to any attempt on the part of
any society to use its resources for its
own purposes instead of to integrate
itself into what we call an open world
system which means a system that's open
to American economic penetration and
political control if any society
deviates from that whether it's
capitalist fascist communist you know
democratic or whatever the United States
will be opposed to it it's very handy to
use the quote Soviet threat or the
phrase communist threat to cover up the
efforts to protect American hegemony
everywhere in the world we got our we've
got some two thousand bases all around
the world the Russians have nothing like
that if you came down from Mars it would
be our country would be seen as the
expanding power but the American mindset
is just the opposite of that we see the
Soviet Union there the threat out there
and we are just minding our own business
we've brought up now a number of times
the question of
life in the Soviet Union repressive
Society various words have been used to
describe it is this a given in other
words are we all in agreement that the
Soviet Union is a very repressive
Society descent is totally stifled its
authoritarian totalitarian absolutely no
freedoms you know in that society is
that an act I don't think it's it's it's
a very difficult kind of question if
you're an ordinary worker and you know
then then things may not be quite so bad
but if you try to go beyond that and you
run into a bureaucracy you'll run into
all kinds of constraints on what you can
do if you're prepared just to be an
ordinary John Doe not cause too many
problems you may be alright
what because one of the things the
Russians do do which which is important
to them is to say there are a different
set of Rights in their country whether
it's question of medical rights whether
the treatment is better bad it has to be
judged differently but at least they
espouse that and they say
full-employment yeah now of course there
are some people who are unemployed if
you're a dissident you can be unemployed
and then there's no unemployment
compensation because by definition
there's no unemployment so what do you
need unemployment compensation for so
for you that can be bad so in those
areas the russians indeed are kind of
there's like a social contract which
says we'll take care of your elemental
economic needs now we don't do that too
well in this country and and you know
one of the biggest strains that russians
keep throwing up to me is how can such a
rich country like the united states
tolerate unemployment and that's a heart
that's not an easy question to answer if
there's an answer at all but when you go
beyond that I mean the Russian system is
a very strict one and you're not allowed
much deviation and if you if you want to
step out of line you're going to find
that that's you're subject to all kinds
of pressure and possibly jailing it's
not to say that things are free in this
country but but in the Soviet Union
there's much much greater fear if you go
to visit somebody's home and they don't
have authorization before and you walk
in you don't talk because they're feared
that somebody will hear you speaking
English or Russian with an accent it's a
very frightening kind of thing so I mean
that that that is a problem that exists
every one of these criticisms have some
validity
from my perspective the nuclear arms
race is just going to make matters worse
I mean I think there's there's
historical reason for the Soviet Union
to be fearful of the West there was as I
said earlier there was the
counter-revolution in the beginning
there was a whole period and we had the
atom bomb they didn't have it and they
felt they were being intimidated you
know whole series of incidents where
there is this fear of the West and I
would say that there could perhaps be a
solidarity movement as in Poland in the
Soviet Union in 15 years if we had
genuine coexistence in d'etat because I
imagine Soviet workers like Polish
workers you know it sort of fed up with
the top-down stuff so I I don't know
that we need to argue in basically that
things are most Americans would not like
to live in the Soviet Union they Lamy
you're a black teenager in Detroit out
of work you know it might look pretty
good to be in a place where there's no
unemployment and you can go to school
without joining the army and so forth
but be that as it may I would say that
that that what the problem we've run
into is the Soviet Union has been on the
defensive that the repression the
possibility of intervention along its
frontier all of that is aggravated by
the American initiatives in built in
keeping the arms race going because it
seemed to me the initiative of the arms
race has come from the West from the
beginning and continues to come from the
West and mr. Reagan criticizes the
Soviet Union for all perhaps the good
reasons but his policies in my view are
almost calculated to reinforce and
aggravate and make the situation worse
well I think Russ has made has
distinguished things properly that ought
to be distinguished on the one hand
there's the question of what kind of
society the Soviet Union is and I think
we would I doubt if either of us would
disagree in any serious way with what
Marshall just said you know it's a
highly repressive society which has a
kind of social contract that puts a
floor under certain kinds of suffering
okay that's the kind of society it is
separate question is what kind of a
threat it poses those are separate
tirely separate questions I mean you
could have the most brutal murderous
Society internally which just wouldn't
happen to be a threat out outside you
have the freest it's in fact it through
history there has been no correlation
between that I can detect between the
internal freedom of the society and its
violence and aggression abroad for
example England
was the freest country in the world in
the 19th century and in India acted like
the Nazis did you know the United States
is the in my view the most open
politically speaking for getting social
issues and so on it's the most open and
freest society in the world and it also
has the most brutal record of violence
and aggression in the world these things
are just uncorrelated now if you look at
the Soviet Union
it seems to me yes it is a repressive
and you know dissent is suppressed and
it's my view to dungeon kind of a
dungeon with a certain degree of social
services not and it is also a threat
it's a threat to it to the government
it's a threat to its own population it's
a threat to in fact anyone within its
reach but its reach doesn't happen to be
very long I mean it's reaches far
shorter than we claim it to be so for
the population of the Soviet Union for
Eastern Europe for Afghanistan the
Soviet Union is a real threat and I
don't see how anybody can question that
on the other hand the United States has
created the image of a Soviet threat
just for the same reason that they
create an image of an American threat as
a way for us to justify intervention and
aggression in our own domains and in
fact if you look over the history of the
Cold War I think this is transparent
take any incident of the Cold War you
know from the American intervention in
Greece in 1947 up to today in the garage
WA and you will find that every single
time a Soviet threat has been created
and usually fabricated to justify
American intervention and incidentally
they play precisely the same game we
started off though talking about the
internal system in the Soviet Union the
degree to which it's a repressive
Society because that's certainly the
perception of most Americans but in what
sense if any does that is that related
to its behavior these are the other
nations as well as its own people
because for example I think many people
believe you can't trust the Russians
they never they never abide by treaties
they never keep their promises they're
really not a nation like other nations
they're not part of the community of
nations they're there especially in this
the the Russians don't keep their
promises
they are a nation like other nations in
fact the fact that is anyone who
believes the promises of any
nation-state is out of their minds or
just doesn't know anything about history
and that includes us and every other one
thinks so I mean you know states follow
their promises if it's in their interest
to do so and the the point is to try to
create a system of shared interest which
will bring about a certain degree of
observance to international agreements
now if we look at it that way then it
seems to me the Russian record is
certainly no worse than error it's in
fact it's pretty good in terms of arms
control because I think the Soviet
garment seized it's in its interest to
observe those treaties and the salt one
trade even salt - so mr. Reagan's anyway
the other day maybe they weren't keeping
some of the salt two provisions even
though it's not been formally ratified I
think both sides you know for pragmatic
prudent reasons have been living up to
it
I think norm is absolutely right in fact
mr. Reagan right now is violating our
solemn agreements to both the
Organization of American States and the
UN with this business in Nicaragua which
is just typical of how big power states
operate I would say that that the Soviet
position is to argue a point from the
very beginning has been a defensive one
essentially that they from the very
beginning felt under duress from the
West that they insisted after World War
two of occupying all those countries
around their European perimeter and
they've been very tough there as they've
been pointed out in sexual Avakian
Hungary Afghanistan is on their frontier
and that along that line there's no
doubt there must have be criticised if
we criticize the internal repression but
both of those things I think it confused
in the American mind with this idea of a
Soviet military throughout the United
States because most the arguments go
back to Afghanistan for example or
Poland and I think you could admit all
of the negative things and still argue
that their whole position militarily has
been one of reacting and responding to
the West even today their leaders say we
will never first use a nuclear weapon
and mr. Reagan says no mr. Reagan brings
up the whole Star Wars concept now of
outer space they have been pressing
against that so I mean we should need to
discuss this issue as to whether or not
it isn't true that the threat and the
initiative in the arms race has come
from the
United States rather than Soviet Union
but that I don't think that's the only
issue involved I mean I but I don't so
the Russians indeed do tend to be
defensive about their perimeter although
Afghanistan is again another issue but
but I don't think it's fair to say
they've only been concerned just about
their perimeter I mean the the best
illustration of my mind was Khrushchev's
attempt to put the missiles in Cuba that
I think Americans look upon as as going
outside but that's not to say that we
haven't been done the same thing to them
it's a question of how do the Americans
perceive it in other words the Russians
are not an oculist there's another
problem involved and that is that that
as as concerned as I am about our
military-industrial complex
I'm equally or even more concerned about
the Soviet military industrial complex
because I think it's more powerful let
me just make introduce a qualification I
don't agree with you about the Cuban
Missile Crisis I think that was a
perfect example of a defensive move and
maybe could go into that but let's well
that's defensive because in fact what
the Russians were trying to do is to
counter an overwhelming advantage and
missiles that that they knew that we
knew it was after Penn cascades maybe we
should put that aside but aside from
that I think your point is not only
right but it's exactly what we ought to
be talking about if you look at the
history of the arms race there's just no
doubt that the United States had the
initiative but I don't but the reason
for that I think it's very simple we're
a more powerful or more technologically
advanced country so of course we're
going to always have the more advanced
military technology now the important
point that you made Marshall I think
that I'd like to that I certainly agree
with you thought you were going to be
isolated that you're not I think that
the the main thrust the main pressure
for militarization and the arms race in
the Soviet Union comes from the internal
dynamics of the society and I think once
we dissociate our discussion from what
in my view are kind of irrelevant
considerations like you know whether
nations abide by their States abide by
their treaties and so on though of
course they don't and we ask ourselves
what are the concrete situate what is
the concrete situation today I think
what we see is that the United States is
deeply committed to a massive program of
domestic militarization for the same
kinds of reasons that drove it in 1961
on the drove it in 1950 and that have
nothing to do with any perceived
international threat we ought to
understand that if we want to know I
mean I think it's very clear I think the
administration came is the programs that
the Reagan administration is following
were in fact proposed in late 1978 but
they couldn't be pushed through Congress
at that time Reagan extended them and
accelerated them and they're absolutely
classical in the American system when
there is a domestic repression in the
United States when there's a domestic
recession in the United States the
standard reaction is to is to turn to
the any in fact let me make it more
general any modern industrial society it
Reckitt has recognized since the 1940s
that the way to deal with internal
economic problems is through state
intervention I mean the institutional
structures of American society happened
to be such that there is no coordinated
state planning we don't have the system
that they have in Japan where there's a
government ministry which deals with you
know with highly centralized foci of
Industry and brings them together and
makes a long-term economic plan we don't
we don't have the institutional
structure for that we have a different
institutional structure our
institutional structure as its developed
since the Second World War is that the
technique by which the government
stimulates production is by creating a
state guaranteed market another
perception I think that the great many
Americans have is that the goal of
Soviet foreign and military policy is
really world domination and that's
really what it's all about and it's a
fear that Americans have that this is
indeed the the goal of Soviet policy is
this true I think that one of the things
one of the misperceptions that Americans
have is that they were Soviet Union is
just kind of like a vacuum cleaner
running over one country after another
but they do the same kinds of things and
big powers do that we've done but that
doesn't mean again that that you can sit
back and say well whatever they do is
vacuous look I mean the fact of the
matter is that the Russians in their
international behavior behavior very
much like any other power including us I
mean every Power greater small tries to
extend the influence of it's the extent
of its degree to coerce and control and
penetrate markets and so on and so forth
get resources we happen to be the world
most
powerful force in the early post-war
period we were overwhelmingly the
world's most powerful force and
therefore the United States did in fact
we can easily document this both in the
documentary record and a historical
record the United States did in fact set
forth on a policy of global domination
and it succeeded to a surprising extent
since that period the and the Russians
did so also in their much smaller sphere
now since that period this bipolar
system has in fact eroded I mean other
powers have developed Europe Japan
element to the third world and in fact
the degree of the two super powers to
coerce and control us in our huge
domains and them and there are smaller
domains that has declined one may
readily agree the Soviet system is
totalitarian but that there's a lot of
illusions among the ordinary Americans
that if we go somewhere in the world
we're out to promote democracy this is
the Reagan line I would say that from
what I've observed in living in Asia and
in observing what's going on and Latin
America this is simply not true this is
another one of those rhetorical
statements that helps to build up
support for US policy that should be
challenged that that the wall street
journal had a report an article urging
us corporation to invest in East Asia
and you know what the rationale was is a
beautiful euphemism that Korea Thailand
Philippines they have firm political
management this rationale of the
American mission in the world is being
benevolent and democratic I think that
has to be also taken issue with well we
could point out that every again it's
quite general every society perceives
itself or tries to make its public
perceive itself as benevolent
I mean the British were carrying the
white man's burden and the French had a
civilizing mission and the Russians are
doing their international is duty when
they entered when they invade
Afghanistan and the United States is
preserving democracy and all of this and
we are as much interested in democracy
as the Russians are interested in
socialism in fact we you know over and
over again have overthrown democratic
regimes if they didn't do the kind of
thing we wanted them to do I mean there
has study after study has revealed the
obvious namely that American support and
aid correlates with essentially with the
improvement of the investment
if a country is willing to open itself
to air penetration and control our
access to resources allow our
corporations to repatriate profits and
so on we will support them doesn't
matter what kind of regime they have
given what we've said about you know the
goals of Soviet foreign military policy
how how do you how do you respond to the
situation in Central America in terms of
Soviet either influence or Soviet active
involvement
you know this discussion reminds me of
you know the standard joke about have
you stopped beating your wife I mean
there's a presupposition here which is
so grotesquely false but even to answer
your question is impossible I mean it's
as if there was a discussion going on in
the Soviet Union where they asked what's
the extent of American intervention in
Eastern Europe well okay maybe they have
discussions about that and if we looked
at them we would laugh I mean okay maybe
there's some intervention in Eastern
Europe but that's not the problem in
Eastern Europe I mean the problem in
Eastern Europe is Russian domination now
take a look at Latin America
I mean Latin America has been subjected
to American supported us supported
terrorism and violence to a degree that
is I mean unspeakable you know I mean in
in 1964 get about history in in 1961 the
Kennedy administration made one of the
most important decisions in modern
history which almost nobody in the
United States knows about namely they
changed the mission of the Latin
American military from hemispheric
defense presumably against the Martians
to Internal Security meaning war against
their own populations and that decision
led to a spread of a plague of bloodshed
and repression and torture and violence
over Latin America that has no no
precedent in the whole bloody history of
the continent as country after country
was turned over to national security
states with a kind of a Nazi model and I
mean that quite literally under with
constant American intervention and
support now we look at that history and
then we ask what is the extent of
Russian intervention in Latin
one of the things that it's true that
we've done all these other things which
really deserve to be criticized at the
same time we've done some other things
which you know you simply overlook with
which indeed are are worthwhile we have
tried some economic aid and then
sometimes the present yes for example in
Afghanistan not the fact that they have
on the side done some decent things to
try to win people over of course they do
sure okay but I mean the point is that
there was there was a view of Russian
interference from Latin America and in
South America it saw against in some
cases the legitimate regimes which
weren't always wrong I mean you know
that these countries have problems they
have economic problems and indeed any
kind of society in the third world
generally has problems almost by
definition this is that they're not
strong democracies they've got economic
growth problems and they lend themselves
to critic criticism and pressure on
either side and let me just raise one
other one other thing that you know as
Americans we really do give our country
a hard time deservedly so for the most
part I wish that were true what the
problem in the United States is that we
failed to criticize American policy the
amount of real critic to critical
analysis of American policy is minuscule
in the United States and what there is
can never reach a mass audience one of
the the the perceptions that is being
suggested at the present time is that
that one way to demonstrate that the
Soviets do have as a goal in their
foreign military policy world domination
is the size of the military that it's
not just a defensive type military it's
also offensive and in fact we're told
that the Soviets are really militarily
superior to the United States at the
present time so what about the the
Soviet military first of all is it true
would you say that the Soviet military
capacity is superior to that of the
United States and the president asked
the Joint Chiefs were asked at every
session of Congress constantly they
asked them well would you trade the
American military system for the Russian
military system and the answer is a
horse left we should tell the truth
about the Russians we should understand
how repressive they are we should
understand how brutal
and how aggressive they would be if they
could get away with it which they can't
in most places but if you look at the
Russian military system the fact is that
it's it's it's character is wildly
exaggerated American propaganda and in
fact all of this has been exposed it's
been exposed over and over again and has
any exposure has no effect so for
example take the way in which take the
way I mean for one thing take take the
way in which the the United States
determines the the character of the
Soviet military system this is this is
such a you know this is so farcical that
people know about it just laughs I mean
what we do is the CIA calculates what's
called the dollar equivalent of the
Russian military expenditures that means
we ask how much would it cost us to
produce the Russian military system and
the answer is some huge number the
reason that some huge number is that
they are so hopelessly inefficient I
mean that's a labor-intensive system
backward labor-intensive system and for
us to create a backward labor-intensive
system would be extremely expensive I
mean for example if you ask the question
what would it cuts the dollar equivalent
of the Russian agricultural system
suppose somebody asked that what would
it cost us to duplicate the Russian
agricultural system well the answer is
it would bankrupt us you know if we had
that if we had to pay you know 100
million peasants to farm and efficiently
it would just be bankrupt but we don't
excuse me we don't conclude from that
that the Russians are more better are
ahead of us in agriculture not the fact
that suppose you were to ask what is the
ruble equivalent of the American
military so we do just but you know what
the answer is the answer is that it's
infinite yes yeah because the Russian
simply cannot duplicate our military
system if they could spend every cent
every ruble they have in Russia and they
can't duplicate our military system
there's just too advanced for them well
at the very least then there's this
adversarial relationship do either
superpower want to change this or is
each of them benefiting from this
present situation so much so that
they're willing to escalate things even
further I don't think either side
benefits in any long-run
but I don't see any any any indication
that either side is going to do
something take any unilateral action
that may very well be that I that the
Russians could use the resources that
are going to the military sector they
could certainly use them to if they
could be converted which I don't think
will be easy so I don't see any answer
your question I don't see any action at
our level I don't see any action at
their level and I think it comes the
motion that I do see is coming from kind
of citizen activity and I would only
hope that there would be something
comfortable in the Soviet Union about
that I'm not very optimistic either we
can't create we cannot create
initiatives in the Soviet Union so it's
pointless to discuss it we can ask what
can we do here now what we do here if we
want to be logical about it has to be
directed at two ends at cutting down the
American commitment to the arms race and
cutting down the Russian commitment to
the arms race and fortunately the very
same actions that contribute to both of
those ends not just consider for a
minute the dynamics of this system we
know that every time the Russians do
something aggressive it supports the
Hawks on our side and every time they
back off somewhere it hurts the Hawks on
our side and the system is mutual it's
symmetrical so the fact of the matter is
that the best way in which we can
contribute to the reduction of
aggression and militarism in the Soviet
Union is by constraining era militarism
and aggression which their hawks use
just as ours do as a way of mobilizing
their own population in fact my view is
that's why the Cold War persists in fact
it is highly functional for the more
brutal and militaristic elements in both
societies it would also be helpful we've
pointed out a number of Marshall pointed
out most strongly and I agree with them
that one of the problems in the
contemporary world is there is no
content corresponding discussion inside
the United States so it's inside the
Soviet Union sorry yeah and that's
correct and I think we ought to also
recognize that what is a fact that there
is very little discussion in the United
States the spectrum of discussion in the
United States is extraordinarily narrow
I mean it's not narrow because the
government comes and throws you in a
concentration camp it's narrow for other
reasons but for example well the things
that I just said a few minutes ago
which Marshall doesn't agree with fine
that's his right method disagree but the
point is the things I have said I have
cannot literally cannot be expressed to
any large audience in the United States
there if there is no way for those views
to be expressed to anything more than a
marginal audience in the United States
so nobody stops me from getting up let's
say at a college meeting called by a
couple of students and saying these
things but everything stops me or anyone
else who believes these things from
approaching any large audience now what
that means is that in effect almost the
entire discussion in the United States
and this is literally 100 close to
hundred percent is within a very narrow
framework of assumptions and people who
think that those assumptions are wrong
like me simply have no access to any
large audience Marshall keeps ringing up
well I wish they had a movement
comparable to ours well given their
history given the fact they've never had
any experience of popular democracy as
we have it our voluntary organization I
think this is almost irrelevant that's
not going to happen the same way but on
the other hand from my experience there
which he agrees with there's no denying
the Soviet people across the board are
feel furled another war and I think
there's a lot of criticism of the
bureaucracy there are letters to the
editor criticizing the bureaucracy so if
there was coexistence and there's
pressure from the bottom for a more open
society wouldn't it seem reasonable that
the government as long as it doesn't
feel threatened would make some
concessions to these pressures to me
that is a common sense perspective and I
just wish that we had enough strength in
our own system you know to move in that
direction and away from this idea of
name-calling and and military threats
and it's a risk either way I just remind
us again it's a risk either way because
each day that the present situation
continues there is a risk of war to
accidents so let's take our risks on the
basis of our own parody in our belief in
human beings as having this capacity to
act reasonably in our own interest
