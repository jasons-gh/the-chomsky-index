how has the United States supported
radical Islam as I mentioned just as
Britain did before it I won't comment on
the British rule but if you want to
learn about it there's quite a good book
on it by a a very good British
diplomatic historian Mark Curtis who
discusses in detail going back to the
documentary record how the United
Britannia
its period of dominance the US has done
it always the major center of radical
Islam extremist radical Islam is Saudi
Arabia unquestionably they're the source
of the wild ization of the region which
Patrick Coburn points out as one of the
most major developments of the modern
era who's the main supporter of Saudi
Arabia
you are now that's where your tax
dollars go and for a long time right now
tens of billions of dollars of arms
being sent under Obama but it goes way
back in fact the the strong US relation
with Israel developed out of this the
United States and Israel had close
relations but not unusual through the
1950s and early 60s that changed in 1967
what happened in 1967 Israel performed
the huge service through the United
States and it's Saudi Arabian Ally Saudi
Arabia has been and remains the center
of extremist radical fundamentalist
Islam with offshoots and the jihadi
movements and so on including Isis at
the time the center of secular
nationalism was Nasser's Egypt and there
was a conflict between the two of them
in fact they were at war they were at
war in the Yemen at the time Israel
administered a very serious blow to
secular nationalism it
devastated the Egyptian army in Syria
and it saved Saudi Arabia and offered a
great boon to the United States and in
fact if you check back it's at that time
that the unusual in fact unique
relationship between Israel and the
United States developed and in fact it
continues after that I could give more
examples if they thought if there was
time but that has been a consistent
pattern there are a few exceptions here
and there so sometimes the United States
has supported secular Islamic states of
the most extreme an interesting example
the Saddam Hussein who was greatly loved
by the Reagan administration and by the
bush one administration could give you
the details of the day they were so
supportive of Saddam Hussein that he was
even given a gift that otherwise only
Israel has been granted no other country
he was permitted to attack a US naval
vessel killing a couple of dozen
American sailors and to get away with it
with just a tap on the wrist Israel had
done the same thing in 1967 Saddam
Hussein did it in 1987 and the as the
friendship for Saddam Hussein was so
enormous that he was granted that right
and that was a secular state in fact
George Bush number one they even invited
Iraqi nuclear engineers to the United
States for advanced training in nuclear
weapons production that's pretty pretty
supportive relationship so there are
cases where the United States has
supported secular Islam but typically
it's radical Islam that has been the
beneficiary of US support like Britain
before
