your conversion to realizing that Paul
Pott was a mass murderer and you you
finally seen the light on that have you
mr. Chomsky know I've seen exactly the
light that I saw at the beginning
there's been a vast amount of lying on
this topic including an article which
happens to be right before me in today's
Daily camera which I wrote which you
wrote well let me describe to you the
 then crying then let me okay
there's no time here you know it takes a
phrase to produce a lie in ten minutes
to decode it so I'll just take one the
one you've just mentioned let's take the
Pol Pot atrocities okay you say here
somewhere that everybody knows that Pol
Pot killed two million people or some
phrase to that extent I felt like that
okay let's look at that two million
people and what I wrote about it killed
no one according to you right look here
this book by you you're saying yes
especially no one after the Cataclysm
and you can look and check exactly what
I'm saying so there's a war orchestrated
his campaign yes may I finish on the two
million okay
the figure of two million people killed
was produced in February 1977 this is
all described in detail in the book by
jacques letoure a French journalist who
was reviewing a book by a French priest
named Francois Paul show which had just
come out in French it was fine about a
year or two later was translated into
English you can read it if you don't
read French it was called Cambodia Year
Zero that was the only book at that
point by anyone who had any direct or
sort of plausible knowledge of what was
going on in Cambodia so it was an
important book the appeared in France in
January 1977 I was immediately reviewed
in the New York Review of Books
translating an article a review that
just appeared in France a point I guess
I'll get to the point review and all I
told you it takes ten minutes to decode
a lie and I'm now decoding it okay this
in this review
jacques letoure stated that according to
poncho Pol Pot had killed in fact most
they didn't talk about Pol Pot because
nobody knew him then he said the Khmer
Rouge have bursted that was his word of
killing two million people that's where
the figure of two million comes from
that you've heard over and over again
since well I was interested I hadn't
seen figures like that so and the book
was not available in the United
incidentally locker tours review was
immediately picked up by the press
quoted all over the place oh isn't this
fantastic on horrifying they've killed
two million people instantly in July
1975 two years earlier the New York
Times had already accused them of
genocide but now we had support from
call show the French priests high source
says they killed two main people well I
had no opinion on it one way or another
so I did the obvious thing I wrote to
some friends in France and asked them to
mail me the book because no copy of it
existed in the United States it was
being quoted all over the place
everybody's coating it but it didn't
exist so I got a copy the French book
and here's what I discovered here's the
source of your two million figures I
discovered that according to polls show
the United States was responsible for
the death of 800,000 Cambodians in the
bombing in the war in the first half of
the decade and then he says according to
the American Embassy the Pol Pot regime
is responsible for 1.2 million deaths
from all causes including killing
starvation overwork etc alright lucky to
read that he added up the two figures
the alleged claim of the American
Embassy and whole show his claim about
the American war a data map comes to two
million attributed all to Pol Pot that
was the two million figure well I did
the next obvious thing I wrote a
personal letter through Lac Courte tour
in which I said look I don't know what's
going on in Cambodia but you miss quoted
Pancho I gave a series of missed quotes
it turns out that every reference of his
to the book may I continue we have some
Cambodia
older I walk in just a second you asked
me that you asked me to talk about your
particular lie I will now talk about it
okay if you wanted me to talk about
other lies I'll talk about them this if
if you'll bear with me if you'll bear
with me on this it's a very illuminating
story about the way a system of
indoctrination works and about the way
connoisseurs work let's continue
continue let's continue
you don't want me you don't want it's
plain that you don't want to hear this
and I understand why but let me continue
anyway the so that I won't take the time
to go through the other lies I just
mentioned that one okay I mentioned to
Lac Courte or that his falsification of
Pancho's book was now being widely
quoted and I thought that was improper I
thought he ought to report what Pancho
actually said he then wrote an article
which appeared in the United States in
which he thanked me for calling to his
attention a number of errors in fact it
turned out everything that he referred
to was totally false but let's forget
that and he corrected a few of them not
all but a few in the case of the number
of people killed here's what he said he
said maybe the number killed was
thousands or hundreds of thousands but
he said did it really matter in other
words did it really matter whether the
actual number was in the thousands or in
the millions no I said it doesn't matter
it's about the same and everyone thought
that was just wonderful and very heroic
and after that everyone continued to
quote the two million figure even after
he had said well maybe it's in the
thousands and of course I'm is quoted
but just imagine that somebody had where
say that about an American atrocity you
know I mean like in in El Salvador the
United States responsible for 50,000
deaths in the last five years
suppose somebody came along and said
well it's 15 minutes it's it's 50
million deaths or five billion deaths
factor of a thousand first time we wrote
the United States responsible for five
billion deaths you know or 50 million
deaths and El Salvador and then suppose
when we said well look you know you just
bet you missed quote
and so on and he says well after all
what's a factor of a thousand you know I
mean we would think that that's
ludicrous of course a factor of a
thousand matters it matters whether it's
now a thousands of killed as an atrocity
but millions killed in particular a
boast of millions killed that's a very
different atrocity factor of it you know
these things didn't matter well you know
factor of a hundred a factor of a
thousand all of those things matter now
I wrote an article and after like after
like Hooters said he didn't think it
mattered I not I in fact but a colleague
of mine named Edward Herrmann economist
at the University of Pennsylvania he and
I wrote an article in the nation in
which we gave the first actual review of
Paul shows book Paul shows book is the
standard source on this and we wrote the
first review of it I discount like
Hooters review because everything in it
was totally false the book had not yet
appeared in English but we wrote a
review of the book in the nation it's
June twenty-fifth nineteen seventy seven
you can look it up and in it we praised
Hong Joos book as serious and worth
reading with its report of the grisly
atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge
and their barbarity and we said we have
no idea what the actual numbers are how
could we know but on the basis of his
book they're probably serious and we ran
through the range of we know it we also
said we disagreed with Likert or about
the question of a factor of a thousand
we thought it mattered whether the
number killed was in the thousands or
the millions incidentally in the same
review we also pointed out that Pancho
had very significantly exaggerated the
atrocities due to the American bombing
you'll notice that nobody's minded that
we have never been criticized for
pointing out that Paul show exaggerated
the number of killings due to the United
States excuse me excuse me no he's not
I'll go on with the rest yeah that was
the first book that existed and it's the
major source okay and that's all we
wrote at that time okay that's the basis
of your then in the book
your excuse me the book that you're
talking about the book that you're
talking about appeared in was written in
1978 and it appeared in 1979 after the
fall of the Pol Pot regime written in
1978 it used more evidence up through
early 1978 now at that in that book we
started off by saying that the Khmer
Rouge are responsible for what we call
gruesome atrocities and we we went on to
describe them and we tend but our book
was not about Cambodia it was about the
American propaganda system this is one
chapter in a 2-volume work on the
American propaganda system in which we
compared the way the other guy's
atrocities are treated with the way our
atrocities are treated and the point
that we made with two volumes of
documentation is that when it's the
other guys atrocities we the press
vastly exaggerated s-- them and
fabricates and so on and what's our
atrocities they suppress them and remain
quiet about them and so on
one of dozens of cases discussed this
Cambodia and we pointed out this example
but we also pointed out something else
we pointed out that the only people who
knew anything about Cambodia was
American intelligence okay I mean they
actually had evidence about Cambodia
they were monitoring it closely and in
fact by then I had contacted State
Department intelligence to find out what
they were saying and it's given in their
what they were saying first of all they
said that this claim of pawn shows about
1.2 million was an invention they had
never produced any such thing and then
they said and in fact this was said in
public and we quoted in the book in mid
in the 1977 which is about the latest
evidence they said that the number of
people killed by put they said that no
doubt that their atrocities they said
it's in the tens or hundreds of
thousands not from mass genocide but
from brutal overwork and harsh
conditions so American intelligence
estimate was tens or hundreds of
thousands and we cited that as well we
came out with no conclusion of our own
about the numbers
in fact we ended up by saying well maybe
the two million figure will turn out to
be right even if it was totally
fabricated but tentatively we assumed
that American intelligence was probably
right
okay now let's turn to the last point
now there's a lot of evidence say after
the fall of the Pol Pot regime a lot of
evidence came out okay I've now finished
with everything I wrote about the topic
which was perfectly accurate no one has
ever found one minor error or even there
have been lies like what you just heard
but no errors now let's turn to another
question now let's turn to another
question what the actual numbers are
well here you can turn to subsequent
scholarship it's certainly not known in
detail but there is subsequent
scholarship in fact there are two major
sources at the moment one of them is a
book on the Pol Pot period by the only
authentic Cambodia scholar who has
written on the topic Michael Vickery
he's actually American in fact he was
actually in the Foreign Service
he's a specialist on Cambodia speaks
Khmer his wife's family was all
massacred by pot he worked in the
refugee camps and so on and he has a
book called Cambodia 1975 to 1979 in
which he gives a detailed demographic
study you know region by region putting
together whatever evidence he could and
so on and so forth the book was very
highly praised in England by Indochina
scholars and so on and so forth it's
never been reviewed in the United States
that was published here his conclusion
is that except in marginal journals in
fact the professor here reviewed it in
the monthly review I will tell you
because this is important that's right
that's why let me do you want to do do
you do you do you want to know the
answer to this question or don't you
you don't okay well all right let me
just ask for a show of hands how many
people want me to give you this answer
okay then
the final remark what is what is visit
what is his
do you want to hear what the scholarly
record shows yes okay what the what
his estimate his estimate excuse me
his estimate is that the total number
who died above what would be expected if
you had had regular population growth is
about 700,000 there's another study by
the one government that carried out an
official inquiry into this the
government of Finland
of course again never mentioned in the
United States they come out with
somewhat lower estimates the State
Department Journal problems of communism
came out with a still lower estimate the
leading there are people incidentally
who are apologists for Pol Pot the
government scholar Douglas Pike who now
heads the Indochina Resource Center
according to him Pol Pot was I'm quoting
the charismatic leader of a peasant
revolution under whom the population
didn't suffer anywhere near as much as
they said however I haven't said any of
these things I've just reported the
facts now why does that bother people so
much because what Herman and I did was
art was we took the position that it is
not proper to lie either in suppressing
the crimes of your own state or
exaggerating the crimes of an official
enemy and of course the connoisseurs who
insist on the right to lie are outraged
by this do you want to go on for the
next lie this one having been discussed
