you
I've never been entirely happy with that
slogan of my many Quaker friends with
whom I shared plenty of experiences
about speaking truth to power we should
be speaking truth about power but not to
power rather to the people who are gonna
get rid of it and that's a slightly
different slant on the thing I think
maybe it doesn't ring as well but it
seems to me more accurate well as you
all know we're the meeting our meeting
happens to coincide with the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations the
other end of the country and it is
almost inevitable I guess but even
appropriate that we should take this
time to think seriously about contours
of World Order as they were then what
the prospects are for them now and what
the factors are that have determined
them and will continue to determine them
well 50 years ago there were two
conflicting visions of the new world
order of the day you're only hearing one
of them in the commentary on the United
Nations and it's in fact only one of
them that gets publicly articulated but
there was another one they're both
highly relevant today I think the one
that one hears all the time is the
vision of the United Nations and all the
wondrous things we hope for and are
dedicated to the United Nations may now
be facing its demise because of its
alleged failure and bringing about these
marvelous things to which we're
committed the second vision is what
sometimes called realism in
international relations theory which is
critical of what they call the
utopianism of that accompanied the
forming of the United Nations and that
still resounds and the rhetoric and the
realist vision was also articulated 50
years ago in fact with great clarity
perhaps most clearly by one of the most
respected statesmen of the 20th century
in fact speaking for the victors in
World War 3 Winston Churchill one of the
World War two sorry that's the next one
speaking for one of the in one of the
big three one of the victors
he explained at the time fifty years ago
that in his words the government of the
world must be entrusted to the satisfied
nations who wish nothing more for
themselves than what they had our power
placed us above the rest we are like
Richmond dwelling in peace within our
habitation rather ample habitations and
we must keep the hungry Nations under
control or they'll be danger well that's
the realist vision earlier in the
century in fact at the peak of British
power right before World War one
Churchill articulated this vision with
greater clarity in internal discussions
of the British Cabinet which have only
recently been Declassified released here
he said we are not a young people with
an innocent record and a scanty
inheritance we have engrossed to
ourselves and altogether
disproportionate share of the wealth and
traffic of the world we have got all we
want in territory but our claim to be
left in the unmolested enjoyment of vast
and splendid possessions mainly acquired
by violence largely maintained by force
often seems less reasonable to others
than to us so we have to teach them
regular lessons and reasonableness and
in fact in this internal secret meeting
he was calling for an increase in the
military budget so that the lessons can
be taught better a sanitized version of
that did reach the public with all the
offending phrases removed but that's the
actual version and a very good one I
ought to add that the more humane among
the conquerors didn't always find the
measure so reasonable for example Adam
Smith who bitterly 200 years ago
bitterly condemned what he called the
Savage and justice of the Europeans who
as he saw very clearly were brutally
creating the first world third-world
divide that's now so dramatic and was
much less so at the time in fact
virtually undetectable at the time
created as he pointed out by the savage
injustice of the Europeans well Smith
Adam Smith was a figure of the
Enlightenment pre-capitalist and in fact
anti-capitalist in fundamental ways and
he was also smart enough to detect the
fundamental illusions of the realist
position one of them was that contrary
to Winston Churchill the rich men are
never satisfied rather as Adam Smith's
pointed out they will always follow what
he called the vile maxim of the Masters
of mankind all for ourselves and nothing
for anyone else
second the we who are enjoying their
vast and splendid possessions acquired
by violence were not the people of
England or France or the United States
and so on except for accidental
exceptions rather as Smith put it the
principal architects of state policy
design it to ensure that their own
interests are most peculiarly attended
to however Grievous the impact on others
including the people of their own
country which is quite a valid
observation the principal architects II
went on to say were the merchants and
manufacturers that's changed now it's
the huge transnationals and financial
institutions but the picture is valid he
was no fool so to correct the realist
illusion story the realist vision with
Adam Smith's insights it comes out like
this the rich men of the rich societies
will pursue their vile Maxim seeking to
expand their vast and splendid
possessions which they have gained by
violence and maintained by force
resorting to savage injustice when
necessary and the
don't play that game will fall by the
wayside the lot of the vast majority of
the population is just to serve and to
suffer that's the realest vision
incidentally these observations of Smith
Adam Smith's and Churchill's can be
generalized to domestic forms of
property and so-called property rights
and possibly even to a proposition
that's being debated not too far from
here but I leave that to you well that's
one vision of world order the other was
the vision of the United Nations or at
least the rhetoric that accompanied its
founding and I won't review that because
we're engulfed in it all the time and a
flood of such pronouncements presented
with great self adulation as heir
permanent and noble commitments since
you know all this by heart I won't waste
time on it we can ask
realistically however whether the people
who produced the rhetoric have ever
believed a word of what they were saying
or whether either consciously or maybe
not too far below the surface they
actually adopted the realist vision that
was advocated by Winston Churchill and
corrected and condemned by Adam Smith
that's a fair question and I think
historical practice provides a rather
clear it's not particularly flattering
answer to it well there are of course
plenty of people who are deeply
committed to the vision of the rhetoric
and who hoped and often sought to make
it a lot more than that I suspect that
that includes the vast majority of the
population of the world which is why
reality always has to be masked in such
so much secrecy and deceit it's after
all easier to tell the truth why
construct the illusions also this
includes some fairly prominent
individuals but power has always resided
elsewhere
those were the visions of World Order
then we know which one succeeded and I
don't think it's fundamentally different
now going back to the United Nations in
the United States
attitudes toward the UN
the ones articulated that we can read
the ones that articulated by the
educated classes folks like us they have
oscillated all over the place throughout
these last 50 years from great praise to
utter contempt I'll return to that at
the end suggesting a kind of a realist
principle that gives I think a simple
explanation for the variations but first
limit let's take a look at the major
arguments that are now current as to why
the United Nations has failed in its
mission and why they maybe get rid of it
and what all this tells us about the
realities of world order there are two
basic failures of the United Nations
that appear in all the discussions one
is that during the Cold War it was
paralyzed and then there was this moment
of hope after the Cold War ended but the
illusions were shattered by the rise of
ethnic conflicts and the failure of the
United Nations to deal with them that's
the basic story so to give a couple of
representative quotes from the moment of
hopefulness around 1990 and the I'm
quoting from leading columnist sand
editorial writers in the Washington Post
in the New York Times but this is
perfectly typical it was a flood of this
stuff I've got a lot of it in print if
you're interested it's virtually
Exceptionalist
so here's typical examples and during
the long cold war years the Soviet veto
and the hostility of third world nations
made the United Nations an object of
contempt of scorn to many Americans who
were rightly appalled by the sight of
grim-faced Soviet ambassadors casting
Veta vetoes and storming out of Security
Council meetings and shrill anti-western
rhetoric from the third world but with
the end of the Cold War this is from
1990 with the end of the Cold War in
1989 in 1989 Soviet policy changed and
that brought about a wondrous sea change
in the United Nations which can finally
work the way it was designed to that's
completely typical of a flood of
rhetoric from that period then came the
disillusionment the era of ethnic
conflicts replaced the Cold War the
United Nations again failed to deal with
them so
maybe the time has come to bid at
farewell that more or less encapsulate
the story well let's have a closer look
at these two eras of modern history and
what they actually tell us which i think
is a little different with regard to the
Cold War there's again a standard
version I won't waste much time on it
because it's too familiar the it was
articulated for example by President
Kennedy the communist world he said from
Havana to Moscow to Payton Peking as it
was in those days through you know
Saigon and so on the communist world he
said is a monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy planning to take over all the
rest his right-hand man Robert McNamara
elaborated he said that Soviet
aggression has no historical parallel
its goal is total obliteration without
any hint of moral restraint anywhere and
in the entire literature of Marxism and
communism so therefore our stance is
defensive we are defending civilized
values from the monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy which aims at total
obliteration
there's a lot of stuff like that I won't
go on there's also a kind of a more
sober version of this which you find in
the better scholarship so for example
and let me turn to that takes a John
Lewis Gaddis who's deleting maybe the
most respected of contemporary
diplomatic historians and a major Cold
War historian as well who pretty much
accepts what's called the Orthodox
version of the Cold War's on nowadays
sometimes called post revisionist for
those of you who know this stuff I
rather realistically he traces the Cold
War to 1917 agreeing with George Kennan
and many others and I think that's right
and he explains that the of course there
was an immediate invasion of Russia
right after the wall street group the
coup or revolution or takeover whatever
you call it
he there was an immediate invasion and
he explains that as defensive the west
carried out a defensive invade
incidentally on the side that invasion
was taken pretty seriously
so Britain for example used poison gas
which at that time was the ultimate
atrocity this is right after World War
one poison gas was usually reserved to
what were called recalcitrant Arabs and
uncivilized tribesmen among whom it
would spread a lively terror I'm again
quoting Winston Churchill from secret
documents also worth reading but in this
case it was possible to use the ultimate
weapon even against white people not
just Kurds and Afghans who Churchill was
talking about so I was taken very
seriously the defensive invasion but
let's go back to why it was a defensive
invasion well Gaddis explains the reason
is it was a present it was a preemptive
strike it was taken in order to prevent
potential Soviet actions so therefore it
was defensive as he puts it
it was undertaken in response to a
potentially far-reaching intervention by
the new Soviet government in the
internal affairs not just of the West
but of virtually every country in the
world namely the revolutions challenge
to the very survival of the capitalist
system so that's serious business now
what was that challenge well obviously
it wasn't a challenge by military
conquest nobody claims that that was
true in the time that someone claimed
that it was true you know years later
instantly gatos like other serious
historians and the internal record also
discounted for the later period but for
this period it's not even under debate
so that wasn't the challenge rather the
challenge was a demonstration effect of
an alternative social alternative
development model which it was feared
might have great appeal to not only in
the traditional service areas it's now
called the third world but even at home
among working people and the poor and
the industrial societies themselves that
incidentally was a prospect that very
greatly concerned Lloyd George in
England Woodrow Wilson here and others
and incidentally that remains if you
look at
documentary record the dominant theme
until the record runs dry which is now
in the 1960s so you go all the way
through up to this a interchanges
between Kennedy and Prime Minister
Macmillan in the early 60s it was always
fear of the demonstration effect of
successful development it was the
perceived success of the so-called
communist model and with communism but
it was the so-called success of that
model that was considered the threat
which is entirely understandable when
you compare what was going on there to
what was going on in comparable western
domains and maybe educated Americans
can't see that but people around the
world can see it very well because they
are non benefit from our education which
prevents us from seeing what's obvious
and was indeed obvious to planners now
of course Stalin in particular carried
out horrifying crimes maybe some of the
worst of history but these awesome
crimes are totally irrelevant to the
story and that's again pretty clear from
the documentary record so it takes a
Truman Truman liked Stalin he admired it
he said he was honest he said what goes
on in Russia is none of his business
there would be a disaster if anything
happened this all in private it would be
a disaster if anything happened that
Stalin this is around 1945 and he said
in fact he could get along fine with
Stalin as long as the United States got
its way 85% of the time that was the
issue
Churchill was the same after he's late
as after Yalta that means February 1945
Churchill and internal cabinet meetings
when Britain was defending Stalin as you
know honest man we can trust great man
so on and so forth the crimes were
completely irrelevant they knew about
him of course but that's not significant
and and that fits into a very
traditional pattern it Saddam Hussein
you know he owes some heart though you
go through the list the crimes are
irrelevant that in close up to the limit
so it includes that admirable Italian
gentleman as President Roosevelt called
the man who brought fascism to Italy who
was greatly admired it includes even
Hitler
in internal records up until the late
30s when he started to get out of line
its disobedience that's the crime not
the crimes no if anything is clear in
history that is it's the record on that
is completely overwhelming and it's also
true of Stalin the couple of years
before the Kennedy
McMillon discussions early 60s on the
demonstration effect President
Eisenhower and Secretary of State Dulles
in again an internal secret discussion
since Declassified they highlighted the
central issue they were lamenting what
they called visual quotes the ability of
the Communists to appeal directly to the
masses and to gain control of mass
movements something we have no capacity
to duplicate and the reason is that the
poor people are the ones they appeal to
and they have always wanted to plunder
the rich now as Eisenhower and Dulles
understood their position on who should
plunder whom was going to be a pretty
hard sell so it was kind of like an
unfair competition and the you know in
the general arena and sorry that's an
old worry goes back to the founding of
American constitutional system if you
read the debates over the in the in 1787
over the constitutional in the
Constitutional Convention most
strikingly and most interesting is James
Madison who was the main framer I'm it
was his ideas that got incorporated and
he warns very strongly against the
danger of allowing a democratic system
to develop he discusses what would
happen if they allowed it to develop in
England which was then the model of
democracy he said you know the majority
of the population will undermine the
rights of landed proprietors and
obviously we can't allow that the our
system has to be designed he said and
was designed so that in his words that
so the government will fulfill its
primary responsibility and the prime
responsibility of government is to
protect the minority of the opulent
against the majority because
these people out here are always trying
to plunder the minority the opulent and
that has to be prevented and the
constitutional system was designed to
prevent it and that theme runs right
through all of all of our history in the
actual history
now I'm only sampling from a very rich
record which suggests a rather different
perspective on the Cold War that
different perspective in fact I think is
reinforced pretty powerfully when you
look further and it tells us a lot about
the future as well one place where you
can look further is in the very rich
record of Declassified planning
documents
which stress quite forcefully that the
major threat to US interests is what is
called sometimes radical nationalism or
economic nationalism that calls for
improvement in the low living standards
of the masses and development for
domestic needs on the principle that the
first beneficiaries of a country's
resources should be the people of that
country not foreign investors
that's a conception that must be
destroyed in all its forms and that's a
constant theme these are all quotes
constant theme right through the
internal planning record at the highest
level exactly as it was for the British
before us and I presume for other
countries too but I haven't examined the
records of France and other countries
the same conclusion is strongly
supported by a look at the public record
and that's obviously too great to sample
but it's it's substantial and quite
intriguing so just take one pretty
dramatic case so that not a few years
ago you recall in 1986 the World Court
condemned the United States for its what
they called its unlawful use of force in
other words international terrorism or
aggression against Nicaragua and for
it's illegal economic warfare against
Nicaragua that was 1986 in the World
Court us of course refused to accept the
judgment Congress immediately responded
democrat-controlled Congress responded
to the World Court judgement by
increasing by a huge amount hundred
million dollars the US aid to the
national terrorists who were carrying
out the unlawful use of forces American
agent and what the what was used to
rammed through the you know the real
thing that was most efficiently rammed
through and enabled the Reagan
administration around this through was
the appeal to what was called the
Sandinistas Revolution without borders
they had actually announced the
revolution without borders they were
going to conquer the world these guys in
the garage and they denounced it and
since they denounced that we had to
defend ourselves with another one of
these preemptive strikes so therefore
you know too bad about the World Court
or anything else we'll go on with
international terrorism at a massive
scale now the revolution without and
that was all over the press that
journals you know went on and on big
propaganda theme right for a long time
and it was a kind of an interesting it
wasn't totally false it was interesting
and true in an interesting way when you
look at it there was a basis for it the
basis for it was indeed a speech by
Thomas Murphy under Nesta who in which
he said that every country has to carry
out its own revolution and we can't do
anything about other people but we would
like to create a society that'll be a
model that others will want to follow
and that's in that sense he said our
revolution transcends borders that was
the actual text it was known like the
fact as soon as the Reagan of the
propaganda system started using this as
a threat of conquest it was exposed and
prominently like right in the Washington
Post but it didn't matter it was true
anyway and in a sense it had it
expressed the deeper truth the deeper
truth is that the threat was the same
the demonstration of threat and that's
the same as military conquest so
therefore we have to defend ourselves by
violence against the threat that an
alternative might be proposed that
people might choose to follow well
there's plenty of that in the public
record take a look at the post Cold War
period that also gives me some good
insight into what the Cold War was about
in fact that's a good idea generally a
good rule of thumb is to take a look at
what happens after a war is over and see
who's cheering and who's complaining
when you do that you often get a
surprising insight into what the war was
actually about try it out on the second
war and you get some interesting
conclusions but let's take the cold
world so after the cold war says a post
1989 whose rejoicing and who is unhappy
that tells you something always does so
whose rejoicing well let's look at the
East Eastern Europe whose rejoicing in
Eastern Europe that's very clear the old
communist party leadership they're
better off than their rich beyond their
wildest dreams a very powerful the only
difference is that now they're the
agents of Western power in other words
they are now playing the typical role of
third world elites very rich very
powerful favored by the West who loves
them in fact there's even a name for
them they're called the capitalist
nomenclature other than the main
clitoris the old Stalinist commissar is
now you know working for the bosses in
the West and very rich and very powerful
favored opening up a franchise in Moscow
those are the guys you want to run it
you know tough know the ropes and so on
and so forth so they're delighted
they're the winners of the Cold War the
old Stalinist bureaucracy and command
they won the Cold War and their riches
what about the there's others who are
rejoicing too for example CEOs of
Western corporations Western corporate
world is rejoicing as well and they're
rejoicing for quite good reasons which
are explained in the openly and frankly
in the International Business press like
the Financial Times which is the most
important International Business Journal
in London which had an article about two
years ago with the interesting headline
green shoots and communism ruins meaning
whole thing is a wreck but there's some
green shoots there's some good things
what are the green shoots well the green
shoots they said are that with the
reforms that have been instituted in
Eastern Europe the reforms they say have
led to in poverty and poverty and very
high unemployment which means that now
Western investors can get well trained
well educated healthy workers
at a fraction of the cost of the
pampered Western workers who are going
to have to abandon their luxurious
lifestyles as Business Week at so this
is really great
well you've got a new weapon against our
own population now we can not only
invest in you know Indonesia and Mexico
but we can get these guys in Poland to
for 10% the wages of the pampered
Western workers and of course since none
of these people believe in the free
market except for anyone else when Damon
were Bence or Audi or GM or somebody
invests there they insist on very high
tariff protection and all sorts of you
know infrastructure support and so on
exactly incidentally is when Damon
Benton invests in Alabama which they
treat as a third world country properly
and where they get the same amenities
but now they got all of Eastern Europe
opening up to them so they're among the
winners of the Cold War - so there's two
categories of winners of the Cold War
well let's go on what about the people
of Eastern Europe they're not so happy
about it in fact the Financial Times
again just Ranna been running regular
polls the polls now in Eastern Europe
are well run you know Gallup polls and
all that stuff and they're interesting
the the latest poll
it's the they've been asking people to
tell what the best period in Russian
history is is Russia around 1992 50%
said the best period was pre perestroika
you know before the whole thing fell
apart last hog April that was last one
that went up to 67 percent said that was
the best period meanwhile optimism about
the future is declining that's Russia
rather general people are of course
delighted and properly by the collapse
of the tyranny but they're not so
delighted about what's been about the
result of the so-called reforms reforms
supposed to be a good thing that's why
the word is used and the reforms have
been have had a devastating effect
most of the region so for example in
Russia alone they've led to about an
extra half a million deaths a year
according to UNESCO to a you know UNESCO
report which incidentally supports them
and says it's necessary but in any event
the reforms have been very harmful to
the general population who are
complaining bitterly about it so they're
not among the victors they're among the
losers of the Cold War what about in the
West
well those pampered Western workers who
are being have another weapon against
them to force them to give up their
luxurious lifestyles they're not so
overjoyed about it either and indeed at
some level at least they are well aware
of this new weapon in the hands of the
Masters to drive down wages and benefits
and increase working hours and maintain
the huge increase in corporate profits
that's gone on since the end of the Cold
War and indeed to contribute to this
spectacular redistribution of wealth
that's taken place in the United States
in the last 15 years now escalating so
they're not among the victors well again
if now take a look and ask who the
winners were and who the losers were and
you get a certain picture of what it was
about a useful technique after any
conflict
well this alternative and I think more
realistic perspective makes a good deal
of sense and broader historical terms as
well and carries us forward so the
east-west conflict in fact had many of
the features of the so-called
north-south conflict that's the
euphemism for Europe's conquest of the
world in the last 500 years the
north-south conflict the basic property
of it is the one I just indicated the
service areas that it's now called the
third world or the south they can carry
out what's called complementary
development but not competitive
development they have to be subordinated
to the needs of the rich men who run the
rich societies and if they try to move
towards independent economic nationalism
has to be crushed because they are
servants and like Churchill and other
realists it the own as I say runs
throughout the whole record furthermore
if they seem to be succeeding in
dependent development then it's even
worse than they become what are called
rotten apples who might spoil the barrel
or a virus that might infect others and
they really have to be stopped because
of the demonstration effect so for
example Henry Kissinger when time the
end a regime in Chile warned that the
success of them of social democratic
Chile would be a virus that might infect
people all the way to Italy he didn't
think that Chile was gonna conquer Italy
but it was sending the wrong message to
Italian voters namely here's an
alternative you might want to pursue and
we can't allow that so it's got to be
crushed that's basically the north-south
conflict and a good deal of the
east-west conflict fits right into that
framework it becomes even more clear
when you think about the history Eastern
and Western Europe have been separating
for about over 500 years around the 15th
century they started the split actually
in a fault line right down in Germany
with the West beginning to develop and
the East becoming its service area and
that division deepened right up to the
20th century
so Russia was a deeply impoverished
third world country getting poorer
relative to the West right up to 1917
and that same was true of most of
Eastern Europe after that it was a
standard it was the traditional third
world providing resources and markets
and investment opportunities and there
was a very wealthy class of course but
that's true of every third world country
the of course even at this period when
Russia was a deeply impoverished third
world country it was different from
others so under the Tsar it had a big
military force it was a very different
in scale wasn't grenade it no it had a
big military force and that was aware so
it was an unusual third world country
and that persists right through the Cold
War - meaning that this aspect of the
north-south conflict had a took on a
life of its own because of questions of
scale but aside from that it has many of
the familiar features if you look over
the historical range and everything fits
pretty much into place I think when you
look
that way as does the aftermath that is
what has happened since 1990 as the
region mostly returns to its earlier
origins the parts there were sectors
that were parts of the industrial west
like the Czech Republic or Western
Poland and they're returning to that
most of it was third-world and it's
returning to that very dramatically
which explains
I think certainly explains who's happy
and who's unhappy but I think also adds
to the account of what in fact was going
on well this picture is reinforced when
you look at the continuity of policy
sense which is pretty dressing changed
end of the Cold War nothing changed take
say the Pentagon budget we had to have a
huge Pentagon budget to defend ourselves
from the monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy okay monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy it's gone Pentagon budget is
the same barely declined now going up
it's actually higher already than it was
in in real terms and under Nixon and
it's going up so obviously something
wrong there or take say Cuba which was
which we had to defend ourselves against
by international terrorism and illegal
embargo and so on ever since 1960
because it was a tentacle of the you
know this monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy bent on total obliteration
which was going to strangle us so we had
to defend ourselves against by the
biggest terrorist campaign in history in
fact unless you count Nicaragua the plus
the economic warfare ok 1989 berlin wall
falls it's not-- whatever you think
about it it's no longer a tentacle of
the you know it's no longer part of the
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy so
what's the effect the effect is we
increase the attack on cuba the economic
warfare is tightened but now it's for
another reason turns out it wasn't
because of the fear of cuba all this
time it turns out it was because of our
profound concern for human rights and
democracy and the propaganda if you look
back you'll notice that the doctrinal
system didn't miss a beat nobody noticed
or pretended at least not to notice this
rather sudden change that took place and
in fact the concern about human rights
and democracy is
about as plausible as the fear that Cuba
was going to invade us and destroy us
whatever you think of Castro take any of
you you like the harshest condemnation
you like he looks positively saintly in
comparison to the guys that we support
throughout the region that again is not
controversial the real problem about
Cuba which explains the continuity all
the way through was illustrated pretty
well and what happened in the UN
yesterday can read it in the front page
of this morning's paper Makassar o
issued what the New York Times calls his
controversial call for social justice
which is just as controversial they say
as his critique of American imperialism
and worse he got more applause from the
delegates and Clinton did so that's a
problem
the problem is but you're not supposed
to notice it if you've got a benefits of
a proper education like us you sort of
read those words but I don't see what
that means the problem in fact is that
the is the standards of Health and
Social Services and education and in
fact even high tech that have been
achieved there which other people in the
world who aren't as well educated as we
are conceit and that's the problem
there's plenty to criticize about Cuba
for people who are seriously concerned
with human rights and democracy now
excluding everybody was talking about it
but people who are serious about yeah
planning to criticize but as far as the
doctrinal institutions are concerned and
certainly the planning system
it's the successes that are the problem
the threat
it's what Oxfam once called the threat
of a good example when they were named
of a pamphlet that in which they were
discussing the u.s. attack against
Nicaragua and that's accurate
well anyway policy has persisted in fact
even got her shirt under ludicrous
pretext with the end of the Cold War
which tells you whatever it was about it
wasn't what they were saying just as in
the Pentagon budget or take the what
immediately followed the Cold War what
immediately followed the cold of the
Berlin Wall fell and
in November 1989 absolute end of the
Cold War a couple of weeks later the
u.s. invaded Panama absolutely typical
footnote to history you know in fact
about the only difference from a million
other examples like that is that the
pretext were different in fact the
pretext were like the ones that Woodrow
Wilson use right before the Cold War
when he invaded Haiti and the Dominican
Republic and there was no monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy then he was
defending us from the Huns if you
remember this time George Bush when he
invaded was defending us against
Hispanic narco traffickers but other
than that it was the same as before same
actions you know footnote to history you
know changes let's turn finally to the
United Nations what happened that the
United Nations happen to be in session
at the time as a winter session so fall
winter 1989 at for winter 1989 the UN
was in session and there were indeed
Security Council vetoes in fact three
one of them voted 14 to one was on
Israel's practices and the occupied
territories vetoed by the United States
to further Security Council resolutions
were condemned the US attack on Panama
vetoed by the United States those the
only Security Council resolutions veto
the General Assembly had very a few - in
fact highly lopsided votes you know in
fact two votes against everyone else US
and Israel alone voting against a
resolution which condemned u.s.
international terrorism against
Nicaragua the other same two against
with a resurrection oral assembly
resolution condemning the US illegal
economic warfare against Nicaragua now
why didn't it come up in Security
Council well the reason is the Security
Council had been disabled a couple of
years earlier when it passed a
resolution calling on all states to obey
international law not referring to the
United States but everybody understood
what it meant and that was
by the United States so that got rid of
the Security Council actually this is a
rather this incidentally continues
another vote this time around in which
the US and Israel again were alone was
against the US economic warfare against
Cuba two against as usual and this
pattern is very traditional
its standard the you recall the 50th
anniversary line about how the UN was
paralyzed by the Russian obstruction and
vetoes and the grim-faced Soviet
ambassadors well here there's just data
that you can look at since it's not easy
to find you got to search for it but
it's there since the 1960's the US is
far in the lead and Security Council
vetoes in second places the United
Kingdom a very distant third is France
and forth for the grim-faced Soviet
ambassadors in the General Assembly the
story is about the same votes like 153 2
1 or 152 2 and so on are not at all rare
and that covers a whole range of issues
obeying international law aggression
human rights terrorism and so on and
it's always the u.s. against those are
the isolated votes and a US vote against
in the General Assembly amounts to a
veto of course now all of this is almost
totally suppressed in the Free Press
I've reviewed it if you're interested
it's almost never reported it's not an
it's not even in the even in the
mainstream scholars literature you don't
follow but it's there and worse the
press and journalism and a good deal of
scholarship not only suppresses the
actual facts but repeats endless lies
about it of the kind that I just
reiterated well that's something though
to concern people who have any you know
who are worried about the nature of
their country and the fate of their
country tells us something about the
culture that we're living in and
something worthwhile but instead of
going on with that let me go on to the
that's the Cold War you can think about
it let's take a look at the ethnic
conflicts
you know this that disillusioned us
after the end of the Cold War they're
real they're our new ethnic conflicts
namely in the area we're the imperial
system collapsed so we're the Soviet
Union collapsed there are ethnic
conflicts that were held under control
by the tyrannical system same in the
Balkans but that's hardly a new phase of
world history that calls for deep
thought from you know serious
intellectuals in facts actually standard
its standard and expected with the
decline of any tyrannical system always
takes a post-colonial Africa when the
when the imperial power has left lots of
ethnic conflicts or takes a India and
Palestine after the British withdrew
horrible ethnic conflicts the last most
recent imperial system to collapse prior
to the Soviet Union is the Portuguese
Empire that collapsed in 1975 and it led
to very serious conflicts ethnic
conflicts actually three primarily
Angola Mozambique and Timor they're
rarely discussed in the same context but
they belong in the same context these
are three ethnic conflicts that took off
right at the time of the collapse of the
Portuguese Empire 1975 and they were
serious
I'm sure and I won't talk about
Mozambique and Angola but let me just
quote the conclusion by one of the
leading Western historians of Africa the
British historian basil Davidson he says
that those responsible for the Contra
subversions
against Angola and Mozambique will be
cursed by history for enormous and
terrible crimes which will Longway
heavily on the whole of southern Africa
he is referring to you and me
incidentally if it's not obvious and
he's quite right in fact to kind in fact
the UN Commission on Africa estimated
that more than one and a half million
people were killed and there were over
sixty billion dollars in damages in the
Reagan years alone by way of South
Africa with us support that's under the
rubric of what was called constructive
engagement in Angola it's continuing
with horrible consequences
well let me turn to Timur which is even
more dramatic in a way it's not a small
matter incidentally it's the worst
slaughter a relative to population the
only reasonable measures since the
Holocaust and it's very clear and
unambiguous ethnic conflict the worst
case in post-war history in fact and
also outright aggression on top of it
now it's true that the UN failed to stop
it this was a real failure of the UN so
therefore we have to dismantle the UN
until we take a look at what happened
what happened is that the u.s. role in
implementing the invasion and the
slaughter was decisive both at the
military level and that the diplomatic
level at the military level the US had
been providing about 90 percent of the
arms and immediately after the invasion
Henry Kissinger who now produces noble
words about the United Nations the
meeting he immediately secretly enhanced
the flow of arms to the aggressors at
Jimmy Carter then stepped in a couple of
years later the Indonesian army was
actually running out of arms in this war
and and as the slaughters peaked in 1978
they became real genocide 'el Carter in
increased the flow of arms to to
implement them what about at the
diplomatic level well our ambassador was
daniel patrick moynihan and he's
explained it in his memoirs so i don't
have to make it up he says he writes in
his memoirs that he that the State
Department wanted things that the United
States wanted things to turn out as they
did and he was given the task of
rendering the United Nations utterly
ineffective in anything it might do to
impede the Indonesian aggression and he
said he carried this out with great
success and then he goes on in the next
sentence to say well apparently within
the next couple of weeks about 10% of
the population was slaughtered and then
we go off to the next topic
so yeah the United Nations fail and in
fact it continued to fail for similar
reasons end result of all of this
Moynihan has lauded all over the place
as the most courageous and leading
exponent of international law and morale
a lone voice of of Honor at the United
Nations Carter's you know soul of our
foreign policy is human rights Kissinger
gives speeches at the UN and so on again
tells us something about the
intellectual culture in which we live
what about coverage of all of this
that's interesting to pre 1975 believe
it or not Timor got a lot of coverage in
the press
the reason was concern about the
collapse of the Portuguese Empire what
it was gonna mean as the invasion took
place with you a decisive US military
and diplomatic assistance decisive as it
took place coverage began to drop by
1978 when the slaughter peaked coverage
reached zero both in the United States
and Canada another leading investor in
Indonesia later on there were some
changes in an interesting way so by the
80s there is coverage and has an
interesting touch good thing that's
there sometimes even accurate but has an
interesting tone to it it's indicated by
say headlines the editorial in New York
Times called the shaming of Indonesia or
articles in The Washington Post by say
James Fallows and others saying well we
just interpret our mistake we didn't do
enough to stop the atrocities actually
we did more than enough we implemented
them and it's not the shaming of
Indonesia it's the shaming of the United
States and the chaining of the New York
Times and so on but that insight is
inexpressible it's no problem that are
not doing enough
we didn't as I've indicated and barely
indicated did plenty actually the in
fact made the decisive contribution but
that's inexpressible that's not part of
the possible culture now there have been
changes important ones one change is
that popular opposition finally
developed enough so that US Congress did
impose constraints on sending arms to
Indonesia which forced the Clinton
administration to undertake all sorts of
chicanery to evade the restrictions as
it did but that's important there were
also been significant changes in
Indonesia it's a lot harder to criticize
things and Indonesia than it is here
very much harder but student
organizations and
dependent intellectuals and human rights
activists and labor leaders and so on
have been openly and vocally condemning
the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in
the last couple of years and also
condemning the west condemning us for
refusing to join with them in doing so
and it's easy for us and for refusing to
join in their own struggles for internal
democracy and human rights and labor
rights in Indonesia and for them to do
it I stress again is a lot harder than
for us to do it that's heroic nothing
for us to say that well the end of the
Portuguese Empire had consequences that
are far worse than the end of the Soviet
empire the end of the French Empire
still worse led to Algeria and China
with about 4 million people killed there
was a cold war element but pretty far at
the margins
I suppose we look elsewhere say at the
Middle East
well that's take say Lebanon mmm you
know the absolute symbol of ethnic
conflict yesterday and you know I'm
still today in fact Lebanon hit the
front pages recently all of its horrible
ethnic conflicts right after the
Oklahoma City bombings remember the
headlines were Oklahoma City looks like
Beirut you know horrible I mean here's
this horrible stuff coming back to haunt
us right here real atrocity it's true
that Oklahoma City did look like Beirut
in fact very much like it
of course Beirut has been looking like
Beirut for some time in particular it
looked like Beirut exactly ten years
before the Oklahoma City bombing when
when the biggest car bomb in history
went off the worst terrorist act in the
region in that peak year of terrorism
which was virtually identical with the
Oklahoma City bombing a bomb went off in
a month right outside a mosque a huge
carve on time to kill the maximum number
of people when they were leaving killing
mostly women and children you know
babies slaughtered in their beds and
that sort of thing
huge casualties you remember that after
the Oklahoma City bombing there's a lot
of talk about our
hunt the criminals to the end of the
earth and bomb the Middle East if it's
there and so on well in the case of the
of the Beirut bombing just exactly 10
years earlier all of that would be
really easy that is assuming that the US
Air Force has the capacity to bomb
Washington and California and Texas and
places like that cross the bombing was
organized by US intelligence by the CIA
and carried out with the assistance of
British intelligence so maybe there's a
couple of bombs left for London -
yesterday at the United Nations
Clinton's big announcement was that
calling on everybody to aid us in the
struggle against international terrorism
and to find the criminals wherever they
are and so on and so forth some other
interesting things there which I'll talk
about if you like there's no time
yeah that's pretty easy we can certainly
do it no big problem we know exactly
where they are there's incidentally no
controversy about this you know but
oddly somehow it was missed you know and
all the talk about Oklahoma City looking
like Beirut nobody was able to point out
that there is after all a comparison and
if you want to look for international
terrorists we know where to look for him
it's not that the press didn't know
about it it was brought to their
attention I know myself because I did it
lots of times and some people tried to
write about it and couldn't the same was
true in Britain incidentally so anyhow
yeah Lebanon has a horrible place and
there are some entry interesting reasons
why the Middle East is also supposed to
be a grand success in overcoming ethnic
conflict namely the Oslo agreements I
would like to talk about that but
there's no time right now again I'll
come back if you like it's again very
revealing what actually happened what
actually happened is the victory the
huge u.s. power play in which the United
States for about 20 years has stood
alone against the rest of the world
alone in blocking a diplomatic
settlement and has now rammed through
its own rejectionist position the u.s.
blocked the United Nations veto Security
Council resolutions every voting every
year there were votes like you know 150
to two at the General Assembly to block
any diplomatic settlement because the
u.s. insisted on two
one no rights for the Palestinians and
the rest of the world wouldn't agree to
this and the u.s. it's insisted on no
withdrawal except as they decide and the
world wouldn't agree with this it's only
after 1990 when the u.s. after the that
the world capitulated in fact with a big
effect of the Gulf War as the world
capitulated and said ok you run it
yourself and then we had a genuine peace
process namely one run a peace process
run unilaterally by the United States
with nobody interfering and ramming
through the rejectionist position of the
United States which it had held against
the rest of the world all of this is
documented beyond any question the facts
are not in doubt and it's undetectable
you got to go way deep in the memory
hole even in scholarship to dig out the
facts again a great success of
propaganda and an explanation of why the
headlines read day of all at the White
House week or two ago yeah it was a day
of all but not exactly for what they
were talking about well let me finally
return to attitudes toward the United
Nations there's a lot of self-righteous
commentary about its failings of some
given some indication of why and where I
think it's failed in my opinion the what
has happened is exactly what was
predictable
namely the unrealistic air of the
responsibility for the failure Falls not
surprisingly on the world's most
powerful state which has been in fact
rendering the United Nations uh Turley
ineffective in anything it did exactly
as our ambassador and leading exponent
of international law was kind enough to
tell us that he did in the case of the
worst slaughter since the Holocaust and
that's dramatically been true since the
early nineteen sixties what happened
then was that the United Nations fell
under what's called here the tyranny of
the majority which is also sometimes
known as democracy and it just stopped
following orders as soon as it stopped
following orders down the tube
we then render it utterly ineffective
and anything it's going to do the
commentary on all of this is quite
amazing I sampled a bit of it a lot of
it's in print it's a pretty remarkable
story well what about the principle that
explains us attitudes toward the UN the
ones that are articulated in our culture
the intellectual culture I think if you
check you'll find that the explanation
is extremely simple insofar as the
United Nations followed the orders of
Churchill's rich men and the rich
societies which means primarily the
United States exactly to that extent it
was praised insofar as it didn't follow
those orders it was condemned that's
pretty simple principle and it accounts
with remarkable precision for all the
variations and attitudes again go
through more of it if you like and
there's a lot in print but I think
that's the way it is well that I'm
afraid these are some of the issues that
lie behind the fashion some of the
reality is behind the illusions and if
they continue to be kept in the shadows
that is if Churchillian realism
continues to prevail in the coming World
Order we can praise ourselves and our
colleagues and our friends and our
institutions for the achievement thanks
you've been watching a from the archives
lecture by MIT professor of linguistics
know'm Chomsky the contours of World
Order 50 years of the United Nations in
a moment we'll return to the question
and answer session from this program no
I'm Chomsky is world renowned for his
revolutionary work in the fields of
linguistics and philosophy from the
early days of dissent against the US
invasion of Vietnam Noam Chomsky became
widely known for his analysis and
criticism of the United States foreign
policy he has published hundreds of
articles and dozens of books at the time
of this lecture October 1995 he had most
recently published year 501 the conquest
continues and World Order's old and new
his most recent books include
hegemony and survival America's quest
for global dominance and failed States
the abuse of power and the assault on
democracy for more information about
Noam Chomsky and his work please visit
the norm Tomsky website at WWF key info
and now we return to the question and
answer session from our program the
contours of world order 50 years of the
United Nations
thank you I can have one more minute
there's something I really feel bad
about the president yesterday made an
eloquent appeal to people to help him
out and since I've been talking about
following orders I'd like to perform my
duties as a citizen and respond to the
President's request you can read it in
the front pages of today's papers and
it's actually it's not quite what I was
talking about but closely relevant apart
from the appeal for everyone to search
out the international terrorists and
pursue them to the corners of the earth
and so on which is easy as I mentioned
easy ways to start on that there were
other there was another thing equally
dramatic he called the national
emergency because of an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national
security of the United States and he
called on everyone all nations and
everyone to join with us to in the task
that he announced which is the following
to identify any nation person or company
business engaged in money laundering or
playing a significant role in drug
trafficking centered in Colombia and all
such nations and companies and
businesses will be banned for operations
in the United States and please help him
out so here's some help in identifying
them there was a major study done by the
OECD a couple of years ago that's the
organization of the rich countries they
tried to trace money laundering not so
easy because it's illegal but they tried
to trace it and their conclusion
is that over half of it goes through US
banks Columbia gets about seven percent
of it according to them now it's not not
a secret it was published in the major
national daily in Mexico however
Excelsior I don't think was ever
recorded here
that's the organ is a you know utterly
reputable organization of the big rich
countries and it tells you one good
place to start in trying to close down
anybody who's involved in money
laundering over 50 percent sounds like a
good place to start second during the
are there any companies involved in in
playing a significant role in drug
trafficking well yeah during the Reagan
administration years the CIA and
congressional investigators did an
analysis of the chemical flows to
central to Latin America from American
chemical companies and discovered that
they were far in excess of any possible
industrial needs and that the in fact
the chemicals that were flowing down
there are exactly the ones that are
being used for manufacturing cocaine and
Colombian so there's another way to shut
down businesses that are doing business
because here though they have a
significant role in the drug racket
namely start with the big American
chemical corporations which again in
aught to be pretty easy
what about nations that are involved in
in playing a significant role in drug
trafficking in Colombia well you know a
good place to start is to look at those
who are funding the traffickers now it's
well known you can read it in every
Human Rights Watch report and Amnesty
International report and Church study
and so on it's pretty well known who
they are mostly the military the
military and the security forces are up
to the next in league with the drug
traffickers and the paramilitary and the
landowners who have given Colombia the
worst human rights record in the
hemisphere again documented a whole flow
of documents on this from all the
international human rights groups and
church groups and they're getting funded
namely by us in fact they get more than
half about half of US military aid the
Latin America
to them there's nothing to it the drug
war but except insofar as we're funding
people are involved in it it has a lot
to do with killing peasants and things
like that but that's half of US military
aid actually it's increasing under
Clinton so it's pretty easy to identify
the nation's and major corporations and
banks and financial institutions that
are engaged in money laundering and drug
trafficking and Colombia and well we'll
have a test presumably all of this will
be headlines and the Free Press tomorrow
so I'm just giving it a fourth taste but
in any event there's an easy way for all
of us to help out and the president's
appeal if we want okay your turn
thank you his trip professor Chomsky and
thanks to the groups who sponsored your
trip here as well my question regards
nuclear weapons policy in the United
States in the post Cold War era
my understanding is that pretty much a
year ago there was a Nuclear Posture
review conducted by the administration
and the decision was to continue a
policy of nuclear deterrence as a result
of that review the specific question I
have is regarding the nuclear weapons
establishment subsidizing the high tech
corporate sector in the continuation of
the development of very sophisticated
replacement components for nuclear
weapons systems in the years to come
specifically the Intel Corporation which
is now moving to the neighboring County
north of us has an R&D facility which is
involved with a contract with Department
of Energy to develop a new
supercomputing system which will be able
to do simulation and modeling of very
precise physics of nuclear detonations
so that in conjunction with the proposed
National Ignition facility in California
seems to continue the policy of
sophisticated weapons development yet
what is right what impacts does this
have for future directions for the
non-proliferation treaty for the
Comprehensive Test Ban and for an
eventual nuclear weapons convention
banning nuclear weapons in the post Cold
War era could you address that yeah I
think the answers are pretty obviously I
mean there is a shift in nuclear weapons
policy there's a shift towards I mean
you know a lot of stuff they don't tell
us but from the public record there's a
shift towards you know sort of lower
more sophisticated and precise and lower
yield targeted weapons and there's even
a public posture about this
was announced in the first right after
the fall of the Berlin every year that
Congress the White House gives Congress
a statement about why the Pentagon has
to be bigger than it ever was in history
and it's used for all through the Cold
War was the same statement you know the
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy via
defend ourselves and so on and the
bottom line you know more weapons more
nuclear weapons and so on well the
interesting one to look at was March
1990 the Russians are gone you know
no Russian bear if you look at the
posture statement it was the the bottom
line was the same as before you know
bigger Pentagon you know maintain the
military industrial base and so on and
so forth but the argument was different
no Russians in fact they even said that
our main intervention is before they go
for our main intervention forces have to
continue to be targeted to the Middle
East where the threat to our interests
has not could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door you know contrary to the
lives of previous years but there was a
threat namely what they call the
technological sophistication of third
world powers that's the threat all of a
sudden so we have to maintain the same
system because of the technological
sophistication of third world powers
which at least is getting closer to the
truth all of this is a system of world
control and if the Russians aren't there
let's be more honest so the clouds are
kind of lifting and I think the weapons
policy is shifting in that direction
there's another comment that's worth
making about weapons policy and here
just let me suggest an inquiry to you
there's a good point you use the word
deterrence and that's the word that's
used but there's a fair question one
should ask where the weapons designed
for defending us well you know you can
sort of check that you can look at the
threats that the United States faced and
there have been some and ask how what
response there was to them so as they go
back to around 1950 I mean the US had
the was the most secure country in
history of the world you know control
the whole hemisphere controlled both
oceans the opposite sides of both oceans
you know a huge military effort I mean
it's just there's no level of security
remotely like it but there was a
potential threat potential at that time
the potential threat to the United
States was intercontinental missiles
with high-yield meaning hydrogen bomb
warheads so simple now the records are
out take a look and see how much
attention was given to relieving that
threat answer it never even came up
meaning the one threat that there really
was was of absolutely no concern to
anyone now you know could of the
negotiations have been carried out that
would have prevented that threat well
you don't know you know until they were
tried and they weren't going to be tried
because basically nobody cared and if
you check the story you'll find that
that runs through to the end like take
say the Reagan years the biggest
military threat to the United States in
the Reagan years with sea launch cruise
missiles the United States has long
coastlines you know submarines can come
right up to the coastline cruise
missiles are very precise they can carry
nuclear weapons so that's a real threat
to the United States no threat to Russia
they don't have to coastline but it's a
big threat to us so ask yourself how the
ring and administration strategists
handled sea launch cruise missiles they
wanted them extended they wanted to
block any negotiations that might stop
and in fact that story runs quite
consistently all the way through which
again suggests that something else is
going on and I think we see what else is
going on even more clearly now and we
look at the shift of weapons policy
about the non-proliferation treaty I
mean obviously as long as the major
powers mean mainly us but you know
Britain and France just aren't going to
hold on to nuclear weapons and as long
as they're set our kind of client states
do like Israel with our support
incidentally sure it's gone
non-proliferation treaties going to work
just insofar as you can beat people over
the head in some of this one thing you
might keep an eye on is a proposal
coming to the World Court the World
Health Organization that two years ago I
guess voted to ask the world court for
an advisory opinion on the legality of
the keeping nuclear weapons the Western
powers were passionately opposed to this
they've tried in every way to prevent
the World Court from hearing this they
went as far the United States went as
far as threatening Indonesia with
sanctions what not for you know
leading his team weren't killing off
most much but that's okay but because
Indonesia was planning to propose to the
world Corte an opinion given a pass a
resolution on from the non-aligned
countries and yeah they'd like to hear
the world's Court opinion on this that
was gonna call for sanctions well you
know it's still coming up I think it's
still being discussed it's very hard to
learn anything about it you know because
it's never reported but it's in process
now and that could be of some interest
it's of course an opinion of the World
Court and the rich and powerful and
paying attention to it if they don't
feel like it's the Nicaragua case should
but nevertheless it's another step
towards trying to which can be used to
try to get people to understand what all
this stuff is about but you know other
than that I think things are going in a
very dangerous direction for a comment
asking for a response you you referred
to the preemptive strikes used by the
United States one in the early 60s was
used at a place called the Bay of Pigs
in Cuba and one of the gentlemen who
helped repel that preemptive strike as
you indicated has now grabbed a much
bigger share of the world stage then
President Clinton felt like sharing at
the United Nations this weekend and I
wanted to point out that a couple of
months ago in Cuba there was a
demonstration about half a million
people to support the Cuban Revolution
one of those little facts that also
doesn't climb into the daily newspapers
in the United States very often in 1989
there were all kinds of predictions that
Fidel Castro would be going the way of
Chao hsq and others in Eastern Europe
all of that has turned out really to be
not true and the Cuban people have asked
for help from people in the United
States and elsewhere in trying to fight
against this criminal embargo that if
I'm not mistaken perhaps you can correct
me is the longest embargo of its type
carried out by any country in the world
against any other country so under if
you could say a word or two about that
and I would just like to tell everyone
that if you're interested in doing
anything to fight that embargo there is
literature and information at one of the
tables outside thank you yeah yeah it's
by far the longest also in economic
warfare embargoes which are completely
illegal the United States is way
the third-world South you know the
non-aligned countries actually table the
resolution at the United Nations about
three years ago calling on the General
Assembly to ban the practice of economic
embargoes which are and of course it you
know big powers would never even let it
get to a discussion it's been condemned
by the world court in the case of
Nicaragua in the case of Cuba it's you
know it's I mean you take a look at the
last vote at the UN not only the United
in previous votes about the embargo the
US had gotten more than one that's
automatic one vote it had also gotten
Albania one year and it got remaining in
one year but this year Albania and
Romania dropped off so it was just the
US and Israel which means the u.s. is
one vote alone furthermore very
interesting was the discussion about it
even US allies loyal US allies usually
pretty craven US allies like Britain
were bitterly condemning the embargo and
it has nothing to do with your attitude
toward Castro a totally separate issue
and the u.s. is in fact tightening it
making it worse interestingly the u.s.
business community is now split on the
issue on the same principle as Vietnam
I mean torturing people makes some sense
but making profits makes more sense and
if the two things come into conflict
then there's two values that have to be
considered and you know one might
prevail over the other as to I mean the
practice ought to be considered
intolerable I mean like nobody puts in
bar goes on the United States you know
it's a practice that can be carried out
by the powerful against people they want
to hurt and that's exactly why the vast
majority of the world's population
through the non line countries have
wanted to ban it and it's exactly why
we're the leading you know well in the
lead and it's completely illegal you
know under get rules
under international law and so on it
goes on as long as we let it talking you
talked about daringness speak truth
about power and obviously what you're
saying wakes up a lot of people and I'm
just wondering what protects you from
being one of the many people that just
vanishes very simple white privileged
you know I'm part of the wealthy classes
it's a this is there's no such thing as
a capitalist country in the world it
couldn't survive for a second but this
one is sort of more toward the
capitalist end of the spectrum and most
and the more you are toward that end of
the spectrum the more everything becomes
a commodity of which you get about as
much of as you can buy well here freedom
is a commodity if you're rich enough and
the right color or and everything else
you can buy a lot of it and I I'm rich
enough and privileged enough so I have a
lot of it you know in fact the people
who would protect Sam felt like I was a
black organizer in the ghetto maybe I
get killed no it's happened but the
people who really have power in this
country would not want the state to be
powerful enough to go after people like
me because if so they would go after
people like them you know so civil
rights are indeed protected under the
condition that freedom is a commodity
that you can purchase like shoes and
there is a lot of it this is a very free
society and there are a lot of people
like us who are pretty privileged and we
have an awful lot of freedom to do
things if we don't do them it's you know
it's our fault because there's you know
there's no cause I mean if there's any
cost it's pretty slight you know not
like most places in the world it's not
like protesting and Indonesia for
example or in Central America you're not
gonna get your blame brains blown out
like Jesuits and El Salvador and that
just gives us more responsibility
I want to draw some references to your
earlier statements about nerve gas and
international terrorism with the use of
chemicals that are being put in our food
and our clothing and our cleaning
products you could smell it when you
walked in here today when the rugs were
rolled out and tobacco and our medicines
ad infinitum and we're seeing it in the
statistics most recently told us about
the the high numbers of children in New
York with the astronomical levels of
respiratory problems these manufacturers
it is an international terrorism and
they're killing themselves as well as
everybody I kind of see it doesn't
matter whether we have education or
money in the future I think we're all
going to be too sick to go to work and
produce much and the numbers of chemical
sensitivities cases are are at least
being recognized today but are being
recognized in big numbers I wish I'd
like you to comment on that you know
it's a serious problem but I think we
should be clear about it's mostly a
problem of poverty people like us may
suffer somewhat but not a lot the people
who are really going to get it in the
neck are the ones who are who are here
and of course in the third world so it
just takes a tobacco tobacco is a is a
very dangerous drug in terms of the
number of people killed it's like I
think latest figures I saw us about a
hundred times as high in the United
States as all hard drugs combined that's
compared to marijuana I'm sure is not
good for you but I don't think there's a
single known overdose from death from
overdose and marijuana after I don't
know 60 70 million users plenty of the
deaths of the vacuum the so it's very
and furthermore of tobacco is
different from other drugs and that it
harms other people like if I smoke at
harms you you know and the costs are
very high but they're not much here you
know they're going down here especially
if by now smoking is mostly a class
issue here so if you if you look at the
you just look at the statistics on
smoking it's not totally but by and
large they sort of as you go towards you
know as wealth goes up smoking goes down
very considerably it's become sort of a
class issue on the other hand there are
other parts of the world where smoking
is going way up with aggressive US
intervention at the very same time that
George Bush announced the drug war same
month in fact the US Trade Commission
was conducting hearings on sanctions
against Thailand and South Korea which
passed because they were not permitting
aggressive advertising of us lethal
narcotics namely tobacco aimed mostly at
women and children so here's you know
all can die hysterical talk about
Noriega and the drug war on the one hand
on the other hand we're using state
power to force women and children there
to smoke more and more so that they can
more and work and be killed
and certainly the press wouldn't cover
this either though it was brought the it
was hard to avoid the Surgeon General of
the United States ever coop properly
conservative was outraged about it and
tried to get some attention and nobody
could do it he said it was like the
opium wars nobody would report well the
the scale of that is substantial
there's an well-known epidemiologist in
Oxford University who really trekked
recently tried to do an estimate on what
the cost was going to be to China of the
aggressive marketing of tobacco they are
mostly to young people and you know his
estimate for what it's worth was that of
people now under 20 I think I think that
was the number I think he said about 50
million we're going to die from the
effects of tobacco that's a I mean
fairly substantial killing even by 20th
century standards and it's
and it is very much kind of you know
it's not uniform but it's highly
correlated with privilege and
opportunities and I think the same is
true if you look across the board yeah
you're right and these things are going
to harm everybody but not not equally
forgive me if I ask the question that
should probably be a lecture in itself
but um I think a lot of people probably
came here expecting to hear some kind of
solution or looking for solutions and I
was wondering if you could address this
kind of a 3-part thing like personal
solutions that you've participated in
like I believe I read in an introduction
to one of your books that he
participated in the early Zionists
movement which was an anarchist sort of
socialist movement and also in the 60s
as well and also if you could address
what most people here are giving
intellectuals who want to affect change
in society in the way and intellectual
can sort of break with their class
privilege and third a lot of people
leaning towards the anarchist bent of
solutions have a very hard problem
dealing with the organization like more
less organization is seen as like a more
bigger solution and to me I can't see us
being like too organized but it's more
the type of organization that's a
question that's a question and I was
hoping you could address maybe some of
the solutions participated in they are
not hierarchical okay just first of all
to clarify this
it's true that I was pre active as a
teenager and the Zionist movement in
fact remained so for a long time but it
was anything but an anarchist movement
you know it was a you know it was a
nationalist movement which had it this
is in the early before the state was
established and had various wings and
there was a kind of a lure
in socialist wing and that's the part I
was interested in but by 1948 that was
essentially dead in fact that part of
the Zionist movement was opposed to a
Jewish state it was part of the Zionist
Moot mainstream at the time because the
idea of a Jewish state is a fairly
recent one was even opposed by the
leadership until about 1942 but but
that's a different story and I want to
go into that whole thing as far as
things that can be done there's tons of
them I mean takes a steam work which I
just mentioned you know if for about 15
its though it's you know it's the worst
slaughter since the Holocaust relative
to the population and for a long time
you just could not talk about it the
number of people involved there's a kind
of got a dozen people maybe mostly young
who were involved in it I can name them
if you like the and you just couldn't
break through you know zero well the
last couple of years have changed I mean
it got to the point where there's a
considerable protest and it you know
it's mutually supportive like protests
here relates to protests in Australia
and they're mutually stimulative and it
meant to England then even Indonesia now
the Indonesian protests don't get
reported here but they do get recorded
in Australia and if we could do it we
could report it here and that's
important and that made a big change you
know it made such significant
significant change that by now there is
actually a possibility that Indonesia
might withdraw and allow
self-determination when the u.s. changes
policy the world listens you know
because this is a big thug you know and
everybody knows it except educated
people here and if you if it changes
policy on something everybody listens
including Indonesia so there is
something that and you know that was
done by a very small number of people
who had a tremendous effect for you know
if you count the number of hours that
were put in and the number of lives that
were saved that's extraordinary
or take say the Indochina war I mean
it's true that it ended up killing about
four million people but the u.s. did not
use nuclear weapons you know didn't it
it didn't
totally destroy all the countries of the
region just mostly well that's because a
lot of people struggled against it or it
takes a central America the biggest
popular movement of I think post Second
World War
that's never talked about in the press
but it certainly was the air was the
Central America solidarity movement way
beyond anything that existed in the 60s
and very sprit Nonnie spread but pretty
deeply rooted in mainstream American
society whereas the movement of the 60s
was kind of marginal it was enormous I
mean you know churches most it was much
stronger in the Midwest and Southwest
than it was in places like say Boston
campuses and it was very effective I
mean the Reagan administration tried to
duplicate Kennedy Kennedy just attacked
South Vietnam 1961 just sent the US Air
Force started bombing it's not part of
our official history but it happened the
Reagan administration tried to duplicate
that in 1981 and in fact announced it
with a white paper very similar to
Kennedy's who they were who was their
model and there was such popular
reaction had to back off and resort to
international terrorism instead of
direct aggression well you know
international terrorism is harmful but
direct aggression is a lot more harmful
so that's a big innocent you know it's
not pretty what happened but it could
have been a lot worse and you can go
across the board I mean the more we can
do the more we change things I don't
think there's any secrets I'm not
spending any time on it because things
have these if you recognize our
responsibilities which are great and our
options which are enormous instantly you
can think of all kinds of things that
can be done whether it's Columbia or
Timor you know Africa or wherever you
like just think about it for two minutes
and you'll think of things that can be
done now as for anarchists and
organization you know anarchism covers a
lot of things but I don't and I've
always been much interested in it and
engaged in it and committed to it but I
don't think there's any conflict between
anarchism
organization at least the parts of the
anarchist movement that I've been
interested in we're looking for a highly
organized Society but organized from
below organization doesn't mean
hierarchy and authority that's something
else but if people get together to run
things and they federated with others
and they make voluntary associations
maybe across the planet that could be an
extremely high level of organization and
it's on anarchist principles so there's
no I don't see any conflict between
anarchism and organization in fact that
Megantic ism is going for a highly
organized Society but uh popularly and
democratically organized one-bite people
who are interested in discussing these
issues I'm got some fliers for a
magazine that I'm putting together on
these issues yeah if you're interested
too
with the I noticed McNamara command with
the new book on Vietnam and I was
wondering if you were comment on what
the u.s. relations of it nah Miz at this
current moment as well as what is the
current political economic and situation
inside of the country
well I won't I've written about
McNamara's book if you're interested so
I won't comment any further it was it
was quite interesting what was
interesting about it was that there
isn't a it was the the discussion about
it was what was most interesting the
question was did he go too far in
apologizing or you know was it right
that he did it and the people in the
peace movement said you know let's honor
him for apologizing and other cities
know went too far
fact of the matter is there is not a
word of apology in the book except to
Americans he apologizes to Americans for
what he did to American society there is
not a word of apology for the four
million corpses that he left there in
three destroyed countries that is beyond
discussion and it's amazing to me that
activists in the peace movement and
religious leaders and so on were
praising this as an apology to everybody
except the victims the fact that that
could happen you know tells you
something quite astonishing about the
culture again and there's more to say
about the book but I won't go into it
as to the US and Vietnam well you know
long story but what happened in my
opinion I mean back around 1970 I
thought the US had basically won the war
the big threat nobody was ever worried
about Vietnam conquering Indonesia
you know Hawaii and all that stuff that
was for you know the frighten the public
what they were worried about was the
usual thing the demonstration effect of
successful independent development and I
was part of a broader concern about
China and so on and that's pretty clear
in the internal documentary record I
thought a sort of obvious by 1970 but
with the release of the Pentagon Papers
it became quite well documented over 20
years ago and in fact by about 1970 it
was clear that was never
any demonstration effect in fact the
countries would be lucky to survive this
is a huge assault by a superpower and be
lucky if they could survive at all but
they certainly weren't going to be a
model buddy in fact one effect which I
thought was again I read about it in
1970 it was pretty obvious then was that
whatever either the place would be
totally wiped out or else what would
survive would be the harshest and
toughest elements because they're the
only ones who can survive that kind of
an assault well it's pretty much what
happened they didn't predict the Khmer
Rouge but it's generally what happened
so I thought the US had basically won a
victory in terms of its actual war aims
well I still think so actually the
business press more or less agreed like
the Far Eastern Economic Review a couple
of years later said look you know I want
you guys call off you've won already you
know they're never gonna bother us we've
put up dictatorships all in the
neighborhood so no virus is going to
infect anybody and crush this one's no
virus and go on to something more
productive ok then comes 1975 at the
u.s. escalated the war but in a
different way turned it into
strangulation the idea after 1975 was to
make the victory to deepen the victory
make sure that they don't even that they
don't have a chance of recovering so put
a heavy economic embargo on block the
international lending institutions from
giving them a cent make them really
suffer and starve exactly what we're
doing in a garage right now Nicaragua
was going down like that you know it's
now the second poorest country in the
hemisphere right after Haiti we got a
stranglehold on it we are not going to
let it develop we are now insisting that
they return basically the Somoza
properties and so on Hillary Clinton was
just there praising the Chamorro
government for for reuniting the
Nicaraguan family and rejuvenating the
economy since democracy came in 1990 a
couple of days before she was there the
ultra-right paper of the business
community let
buna which is you know I'm super
neoliberal and everything else published
a story on a UNICEF report on Nicaragua
which has yet to make it here and never
will which was headlines something like
you know Nicaragua mortgaging its future
by the district by the fact that the
child malnutrition is the starvation is
out of sight and everything's collapsing
and so on and so forth yeah that's the
revitalization revitalization of the
Nicaraguan economy we got a stranglehold
on and we they got to suffer same with
Cuba and there's reasons for that too I
mean just imagine yourself in the
position of say the Mafia Don who runs a
certain neighborhood so you're running a
certain neighborhood suppose somebody
doesn't pay protection money do you just
go in and get the money
no you send goons in to you know break
its legs and beat them to a pulp and
make a model so that others understand
that you follow orders okay now in
people in the world understand this but
if you're well educated like us you
don't see it no so it kind of looks odd
that every time anybody gets out of line
and we've won we go on a torture yeah it
makes complete sense you know in fact we
wouldn't have the slightest problem
understanding it in the case of say you
know the Mafia Don in the neighborhood
and that's us you know we're the Mafia
Don for the world
so sure makes a lot of sense and the
fact the u.s. kept the stranglehold on
the excuses kept changing so at first we
had this the missing an action story was
concocted a total fraud
I mean nobody ever cared about missing
an action before you know there's still
people who haven't been found from the
war of 1812 we don't have any problem
digging up the bodies there were bodies
all Flanders field which nobody's cared
about nobody bothers with them saying
for every war but this was a good way to
get people upset
you know behind the idea of strangling
Vietnam then fortunately something else
came along Vietnam invaded Cambodia and
put an end to the Pol Pot regime's
atrocities and they and that since the
u.s. was in fact supporting fall cut
that they were bitterly attacked this is
the one humanitarian intervention that I
know of in modern history and it's not
that they were trying to be humanitarian
that was just a consequence of it was to
put it into a major massacre so they
came under huge attack you know the
prussians of Asia we got to strangle
them and so on that went across the
propaganda system without a whisper and
we started openly supporting Pol Pot the
Democratic Kampuchea coalition and now
we had to embargo Vietnam because the
prussians of Asia were had put an end to
the Pol Pot regime
okay then they withdrew from Cambodia
without a missing a beat we shifted back
to missing in action now we got a
strangle and because of missing in
action and this continued until a couple
of years ago and it then stopped for a
very simple reason most of the world
listens when the United States gives
orders but it was starting this leak I
mean Japan was starting to invest and
Europe was starting to invest and so on
an American business just didn't like
the idea that they were being cut out of
lucrative markets so we had exactly the
conflict which is now showing up in Cuba
makes perfect sense to torture people
teaches people a good lesson and so on
but at some point they need to make
profits is more important so Vietnam is
now allowed back into the civilized
world at a on our terms after and that
will sooner or later happened with
Nicaragua - if anything's left of the
place Nicaragua may be uninhabitable in
10 or 20 years it's possible but that's
the way you treat people who get out of
line and I think that's exactly what's
going on in a cubic case right now I'm a
Nicaraguan case incidentally much the
same as true of Iraq which is another
story but
that investment options the
transnationals have like Eurodollar
investments are doing to the speculation
economy it was hoping that you could
protect the perhaps articulate more of
the impact on the real economy when
though that money is essentially
stripped mine from it and you know
playing in the larger global casino well
instead of I mean late but instead of my
trying to say anything let me just quote
an absolutely impeccable source Paul
Volcker who was the head of the Federal
Reserve under Reagan's on very you know
its perspective we'll just headed a
commission which was looking into the
decline of the growth rate since the
1970s there's been a general decline in
the growth rate around the industrial
world since the 1970s and they concluded
that about 50% of the decline could be
attributed just to the shift of capital
to speculation against currencies and
there's pretty it's pretty well
understood why I mean it's a weapon
against growth anytime any country
starts to undertake policies that might
stimulate the economy capital flows from
it so it's a weapon against growth and
their estimate for what it's worth is
about 50 percent of the decline and the
growth rate is attributable to it I
don't have an independent judgment yeah
thanks for coming again and especially
all these people here this is quite the
turnout it you don't get to see that
Olympia very much so it's an honor to
everyone here and show up I wanted to
say three things one had to do with
international law and indigenous issues
in corporate colonialism and how that
rates and the Western Hemisphere
especially but I know its global second
thing is about the international court
of public opinion and the third would be
on the what to do question and I think
that fits nicely into what was said
earlier a little bit is that I'm one of
things I've heard you say I've been
listening for years is that inform
yourselves inform each other identify
allies and get out there and work on it
in
one of the things I'd ask - when we get
to that part but on indigenous issues in
corporate colonialism hoping you could
speak to that a little bit I know that
it's a little bit lacking in some of
your public talks I know that you do get
into it and I know that the book
function in the one years relates to
that to a degree but if you could speak
to that especially as regards regionally
on we've been looking at a situation in
British Columbia whereby that Empire is
on its beyond the treaty frontier
there's no treaties and most of what is
now BC and the Native Nations and
people's there have been in a very
strong resistance there was a 30-day
siege it was blacked out of the u.s.
it's very recent and also the BC Treaty
Commission which in terms of
international law I think is really a an
interesting concept that you know if
we're gonna believe in NAFTA and GATT
and the rule of law and constitutions
and Parliament's you know how is Canada
getting away with this and it's with its
reputation and in terms of the
international court of public opinion I
think a lot of the people here will
pretty much always you know agree with a
lot of what you have to say on detailing
history for us and bringing us up to
speed but at the same time I find more
intriguing as your talk on mind control
and and and what we can do about it and
how people are really being manipulated
or not and what we can do about that so
in terms of the international court of
public opinion and why did we all see
the person at Tiananmen Square standing
in front of the tanks you know we all
got that yet
is there any hopes in that regard so
maybe you could tie that into the what
to do those those couple of things well
let's me begin with the end you know
what to do there can't be any answer
about what to do that's like saying look
people are suffering all over what
should we do you know well there's no
answer at that level ask what should you
do about X you know let's pick a problem
then we can ask what do we do about that
problem and then we'll ask for what are
our capacities you know what's the
problem how can we deal with it and so
on and so forth that's how you answer
what can we do questions you can talk
about a bigger vision like the person
who asked the question over there about
anarchism and organization yeah you can
think about long
term aims that you're trying to get to
and that makes sense too but just what
can we do no I mean suppose people say
what should we do about slavery well get
rid of it you know now how do we get rid
of it okay now it becomes a problem and
you get serious and you try to do
something about it but general
discussions about what can we do they
don't mean anything you know we've got
an enormous option we're very free most
of us are very privileged you know we're
very there's a high degree of
responsibility here for what happens in
the world so the kind of things we can
do if we choose to do them we want to
talk about it
then if we decide more fun to talk about
it well then nothing will change as to
manipulation and what you can do about
manipulation yeah stop letting yourself
fall for it
I mean again there's no big secret you
know you have to learn which isn't all
that hard to take a skeptical critical
eye to the kind of stuff that you see
and you know think about it and look at
it from other points of view and so on I
mean it's like asking you know if I'm
teaching a science class and somebody
says how do I figure out the truth I
don't know what can you say I mean you
try to use your mind that's whatever
mind for you know you try to be critical
I mean maybe an experiment comes out
this way it doesn't look like right you
look at it another way and so on and so
forth there's no techniques you know
there's no techniques for finding out
the truth about things except having a
critical intelligence and using it and
if you're looking for secrets you're
gonna be my very disappointed there
aren't any at least nobody's ever found
them about indigenous issues I can't say
anything about British Columbia just
know what the facts are but
international law is extremely weak on
these issues on the other hand there's
plenty of cases of national law like the
u.s. Ferguson I don't know the Canadian
situation but the United States for fact
since the 18th century has had binding
treaties with one or another indigenous
group which it has violated in the most
extraordinary fashion over and over
again because power is one thing in
binding treaties or another thing and
how can you implement the binding
treaties well again by
the public insisting on the public and
the powerful part of the society that's
us also I wouldn't you know I mean right
now the question of what the legality is
of the treaties that were made in the
chair with the Cherokees for Southeast
United States as kind of academic but
there are real issues about what people
should have right now and those should
be addressed independently of any formal
question of treaties or international
law and what happening no I guess I'll
hit you with this big concept one here
basically I'd like you to describe the
conflict between autarky which is
regional self-determination and the New
World Order and specifically I guess go
back to Africa here and in a for East
Timor in a country that's now known as
Burkina Faso which means literally
standing tall it's named that by its
revolutionary leader who took money away
from the center of power in his country
and gave it to the farmers gave them
more money to grow food basically become
more self-sufficient and he was
suppressed by the French colonialists
and deposed very shortly thereafter by
his vice president I'd like you to
what's that I think he's saying you
better wrap it up yeah well I'd like to
just talk about that and also about what
your vision of libertarian socialism and
that's that's specific it's more than I
could manage in the one minute but on
the questions of regional
self-determination and integration in
the world economy I'm afraid that there
are no simple answers at a general
abstract level you have to look at the
cases so the problems of some country
you know in Africa say and Haiti are
just different you know and they have to
be looked at on their own terms
which is not easy you know and there's
no formula it
by and large it's going to come down to
the same thing any country is going to
be able to follow a path of more or less
independent self development to the
extent that the rich and powerful allow
them to get away with it now that
happens to be mostly us which means we
have a big influence on this like Latin
America could in 1945 at the foundation
of the United Nations it could have
followed what it was calling the
philosophy of the new nationalism that
was sweeping the region meaning
development for domestic needs on the
principle that the prime beneficiaries
of a country's resources should be the
people of that country and so on u.s.
didn't let him now American citizens
were just not involved in that they
didn't know what was going on in fact I
suspect 99.9% of them still don't know I
was going on 50 years ago and don't
associate the extraordinary inequality
of Latin America which is the highest in
the world and the huge capital flight
and everything else with the fact that
we had some very definite decisions
there and it played a big role there for
50 years but the same thing is true now
and we got to learn about those things
and what we're doing and what we how we
can change and how it affects us and how
it affects other people but there's no
formula you know it's a matter of
looking at hard cases and coming up with
analyses and understanding and then
trying to do something about it
and I just don't know how to answer the
food there's no answers at this level of
generality twenty years ago there was an
energy crisis what has happened it was
no energy crisis well in in terms of
where are all right in terms of where
fossil fuels are heading into the future
there is an energy crisis look and how
come is being totally ignored is nothing
lowly it's not being totally ignored
there's a ton of people interested in it
and concerned about it and exactly what
should be done about fossil fuels is
another is a hard question so for
example take say the question of nuclear
energy here I disagree with a lot of my
friends I should say I don't think
that's a moral question I think it's a
tactical question technical question
basically I mean whether nuclear energy
is more or less harmful than fossil
fuels or it's a no energy those are
technical questions that it is not a
moral issue and you got to be serious
about it
the same is true fusion whether fusion
is an option and what its consequences
might be is not a moral issue it's a
technical issue now a technical issue
has human consequences significant human
consequences so it's in that sense a
moral issue like any technical issue is
has huge consequences but you can't take
a stand on it on moral grounds you know
I don't like it or something you have to
take a stand on it by asking well what
are the consequence of the various
choices that are open to us and there
are choices like one choice is to say
give up use of energy but then you have
to ask what happens like you know it
does that mean genocide of five million
people or does it mean something else
well those are questions which
unfortunately have to take seriously you
know and the same is true of all of
these questions they are not easy and it
doesn't make any sense to have slogans
about them you got to think of through
