and as of yesterday at least hadn't even
been reported in the United States then
there was a study that came out in one
of the major medical journals which was
reported by Patrick Coburn fine reporter
in London and the London independent and
one or two other places abroad and if it
is in fact being reported broadly abroad
what they found is that in Fallujah
town in Iraq which was viciously
attacked by American forces in November
2004 with all kind of horrible war
crimes they found the doctors who
investigated there found levels of
cancer you know leukemia you know and so
on there beyond what they found in
Hiroshima that's pretty significant
century unmentioned in the US but it's
the kind of thing you're taught not to
think about and not to say and not to
ask what it means and there's not a lot
like that
