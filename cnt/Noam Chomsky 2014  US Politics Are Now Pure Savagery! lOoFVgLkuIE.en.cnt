no I'm chomsky would be talking to him
in a moment but first a little about him
I'm Chomsky and they on the faculty at
MIT and I've been getting more more
heavily involved in anti-war activities
for the last few years linguist
socialist anarchist and one of the most
active and famous American intellectuals
of the left sometimes described as the
father of modern linguistics Chomsky
gained public attention in 1967 for his
vocal opposition to US intervention in
Vietnam I was arrested on multiple
occasions for his anti-war activism I
think that we can see quite clearly some
very very serious defects and flaws in
our society our level of culture our
institutions whilst praised for being
prepared to expose what he sees as the
high crimes and misdemeanors of America
he is criticized by others for being
naive and knee-jerk in his opposition to
u.s. foreign policy in a week where
President Obama will announce reforms to
the reach and scope of the NSA's
surveillance program it is as yet
unclear whether mr. Obama will truly
champion civil liberties rather than
cement government surveillance in the
name of national security Noam Chomsky's
view is clear he believes the
whistleblower Edward Snowden should be
honored not vilified for exposing a
government treating its citizens as the
primary enemy and ahead of possible
peace talks next week to discuss Syria
was professor Chomsky right all along to
condemn military intervention or are the
deaths of over a hundred thousand people
and the displacement of millions too
high a price to pay for
non-interventionism Noam Chomsky joins
us now from Boston Massachusetts I
should tell you the slight problem on
the audio to Boston but professor
Chomsky let me put it to you that you
opposed the attack on Serbia you opposed
the invasion of Iraq you opposed the
invasion of Afghanistan and you opposed
military intervention in Syria now
America is out of Iraq it's coming out
of Afghanistan it
isn't gone into Syria you must suddenly
find yourself on the side of the of the
White House well it's not the first time
that such a situation has arisen so for
example you could have added a couple of
more cases I was strongly opposed to the
Russian invasion of Afghanistan and when
they finally decided to pull out in the
mid-80s 86 I thought that was a good
decision so I was on the side of the
Kremlin when the South South Africa yeah
sure I think that they criminals should
put an end to their criminal activity
criminals but at the same time the price
of doing nothing is very high a hundred
and ten thousand people dead maybe more
in Syria and millions displaced and we
have stood idly by if there were some
possibility of acting in a way which
intervening in a way which might
alleviate these crimes then one could
justify it but no such way has been
proposed of the only proposals are
intervention of a kind that would be
very likely to exacerbate the crimes and
violence as is typically the case with
foreign intervention should President
Assad remain where he is or are is the
West right in attempting to negotiate
his exit I of course do not think that
Assad and many other leaders around the
world should stay where they are but if
you turn to negotiations that you need
the negotiations that are coming up and
ask do they offer some hope of
alleviating these monstrous crimes of
the answer is probably not the United
States has established preconditions
which almost guarantee
he failure the preconditions that the
u.s. insists on Secretary of State Kerry
reiterated them yesterday are that the
that the Geneva negotiations must lead
to a transitional government which
excludes the Syrian government which
excludes Assad it's very hard to see how
the government can possibly agree to
negotiations in those terms and
incidentally the the United States
refuses to allow Iran to be among the
dozens of countries that a torrent of
the negotiations because it refuses to
accept the American preconditions would
would do you now see that there is a
complete change of American policy on
Iran or does this refusal to allow them
full participation in the peace talks
mean that their attitude Tehran is very
limited and limited to the nuclear issue
no it means that the United States
insists on its right to control and
dominate nah I the region but as much of
the world as possible that's what you
expect for from a a superpower with few
constraints and either internal or
external it's not pretty but that's what
happens and in systems of unconstrained
power but the physical evidence is that
America is retreating is retrenching is
coming home and whilst it may still be
playing the kind of game you suggest in
the Geneva peace talks America is
becoming more isolationist is that
something brings you pleasure it's not
becoming more isolationists the extreme
adventurism of the past decade which has
been very harm extremely harmful to the
region fact it's my the main causes of
the
term the turmoil and the conflicts that
are now tearing it to shreds also been
extremely costly and harmful to the
United States the United States is
retreating from that extreme adventurism
and turning to other forms of a terror
and violence so the President Obama is
at the moment running the largest
terrorist campaign in the world by far
the drum campaign the even the US
authorities recognize that almost no one
accepts the legality of this these
murder operations and they are that's
hardly an example of isolationism nor is
the the establishment of a horse's this
is official very briefly it's more than
50 years since your activism against the
vietnam war the world has changed have
you changed have I changed yes sure in
the early stage in the early stages of
my own opposition to the Vietnam War in
the very early 1960s I miss described it
I learned later that I should have
changed that I described it as a civil
war in which the United States was
legitimately intervening as a
documentary in other evidence has
accumulated it's quite obvious that that
was wrong it was a simple war of
aggression unprovoked aggression
beginning with John F Kennedy to at a
level that at that time we didn't know
but now we do know that what perhaps the
major crime of the post-war era put out
of Thomas Camry room Noam Chomsky I'm
afraid we're out of time but thank you
very very much indeed for talking to us
from Boston if you missed any of that
catch up on four plus one in a moment
