hello and welcome to newsclick today we
are very fortunate to have with us a
legendary norm Chomsky Noam welcome to
newsclick does it be with you thanks but
if only virtually about 60 years ago 70
years ago a mrs. R wrote a line which I
wanted to read out to you she said a
civilization that cannot solve the
problems that it's created is a decadent
civilization I find this to be a very
opposite line Noam how would you
characterize the civilization
particularly in the Western countries in
our time 15 years ago I wrote a book
called failed States which was primarily
about the United States but it
generalizes to other Western societies
though they have especially in the past
40 plenty of problems before but for the
past 40 years most of the West has been
engaged in a project which is great for
the people who designed that they're
living in heaven but as a disaster for
almost everyone else
it's called neoliberalism again and the
seventies really took off with Reagan
and Thatcher mathy the design was pretty
clear in the beginning we now see the
results they worked out pretty much as
anticipated the wealth has concentrated
to an extraordinary level the general
population has stagnated declined they
take the United States by now 0.1% not
one person 0.1% of the population has 20
percent of the wealth about half the
population has negative net worth that's
the
liabilities greater than assets roughly
70% or so are living from paycheck to
paycheck anything goes wrong tough luck
the benefits have significantly declined
concentration of wealth of course
immediately translates into even greater
control over the political system it's
always great it's intensified that shows
up in the legislation which is designed
to destroy unions to destroy labor
rights to create a global system which
turns out to be harmful for the
perpetrators No a very fragile global
system designed to squeeze every cent of
profit out of possible with mobility of
capital of course no mobility of Labor
free and highly protectionist a lot of
talk about free market but that's
garbage
highly protection system designed to
ensure investor rights so take drug
drugs for example since that's of
everyone's mind there is a drug RAM
disappear which seems to be of some use
in overcoming symptoms it's owned by a
corporation Gilead huge drug company but
the drug was produced in part on as
always by government research
development and subsidies but they want
a patent on it and according to the
neoliberal rules in the World Trade
Organization
they have monopoly rights for decades so
they can charge you know twenty thousand
dollars a dose if they wanted to
now there happens to be a law in the
United States vital law which requires
not permit requires the government to
ensure that
drug is produced with government support
would be available to the public at
reasonable price but we live with
criminal governments they don't pay any
attention to the law none
another Reagan made that very clear or
there were no swallows it so nobody pays
attention to this law so they can charge
what they want well now there's so much
public pressure but maybe they'll back
off a little but that's the way the
system is designed not its head but
these effects on the general public it's
led I've left out a lot it's created a
what's called a precariat huge number of
people with very precarious positions no
unions no support as Thatcher pointed
out there's no society Reagan and
Thatcher were right on target the first
things they did was moved to destroy
unions
the only protection that people have
against predatory capitalism
so let's destroy them Reagan didn't even
enforce not even even purposely didn't
enforce the labor laws that require some
observance of labor rights it hires the
scabs illegal everywhere in the world
the breakup strikes corporations
immunity picked up the pole or did you
see some people are left on their own
kind of atamans
one consequence is a lot of anger a lot
of resentment hatred of institutions
it's felt arranged for demagogues to
come along and say somebody else is full
you know immigrants like by Reagan's and
welfare mothers use extraordinary racist
you know blaming the plight of things on
rich black women driving their
limousines to welfare offices to steal
your trick but that kind of strength
Trump is a masterpiece does it all the
time that's what the big fuss is about
the building the wall and so much so and
it's happening in many countries easy
terrain for demagogues
the world were facing the world of
extreme savage capitalism had 40 years
to wreck things Europe intensified by
the structure of the European Union
which transfers all decisions major
decisions to an unelected troika and
Brussels with the big banks looking over
their shoulders you can predict what
that's gonna be so yeah that's it
the world isn't but I haven't even
mentioned the worst part I mean let's
take India in 50 years India is going to
be uninhabitable under present if the
present conditions persist very likely
not for certain but under the current
course the best scientific analyses
suggest that India will simply be on all
of South Asia will be uninhabitable just
because of worsening the planet who does
this benefit the rich and powerful
fossil fuel companies big banks
manufacturing polluters what are we
doing about it
well most countries are doing at least
something the country that's doing most
is the United States it is racing to the
abyss as quickly as possible
Trump's main program is to destroy the
prospects for organized human life
literally this is the most criminal
president human who has ever lived on
earth
I mean Hitler was a monster one killed
all the Jews kill the Roma and 30
million slobs when you get rid of it
hidden ones that destroy organized human
life on earth Trump does he knows
exactly what he's doing it just doesn't
matter and the people behind him
CEO of JPMorgan Chase and pouring money
into fossil fuels that they understand
perfectly will it just doesn't matter
the logic under which they operate says
maximize your own gain tomorrow nothing
else matters
in fact if you read the neoliberal of
gurus people they worship Milton
Friedman says it's strength as the only
role of a corporation is to maximize
profit for shareholders and of course
management they destroy the world's not
their business and civilization would
collapse if you don't live up to this
now this is neoliberal doctrine back to
the 1920s it's not new but this stuff
goes back to in fact the concept
neoliberalism goes back to the twenties
in Austrian literally fund Mises the
great guru Friedrich Hayek they loved
the authority they talk about you know
not liking the state total lie they love
the state they love strike power
fun Mises in the 20s could Carroll
barely controllers euphoria when the
nailhead incipient fascist regime in
Austria smashed up the labor movement
destroyed social democracy by violence
so that was wonderful it was eliminating
interferences with selled economic but
he praised fascism and saving
civilization when the Pinochet
dictatorship came in
rushed to endorse it not to take part in
it was a perfect experiment for their
neoliberal ideals it could be no
objections of the torture chambers took
care of that money poured in you know
from international investors from the
World Bank from the United States they
were smart enough to overcome their
doctrines to leave in place the highly
efficient the nationalized copper
company Cadell code which was the basis
for most of the state revenues and
forgot their doctrines with that perfect
experiment and what happened five years
they totally crashed in the economy
state to take over more than a dozen
oriented did that affect anything fact
Hayek said that when he visited Chile
under Pinochet he said I couldn't find a
single person who didn't say that
there's more freedom under Pinochet than
there was before which is probably true
considering the people he saw that's
neoliberalism they're perfectly happy to
emerge from the present crisis with a
system very much like the one they
instituted in their benefit but much
farther more brutal more
therawtarian.com ideals back a century
so we should not be surprised at that
and of course they're working on it
relentlessly well they're telling
everybody else you know stay home
they're working very hard to ensure that
the outcome will look very much like
this it's a brutal form of class war
unfolding before our eyes but as you say
this known which is I think something
that you know given my understanding of
what was going on
anticipate this in fact as you said your
book was called a fan
but as we are talking the streets of the
United States I've got one fire people
have decided that they're just not going
to take it after the murder of George
Floyd and even liberals seems to be
losing patience I read George Packer he
wrote an article with the title we are
living in a failed state it's quite
astounding to see a liberal write about
the failed state and of course it's
heartbreaking to see the murder of
another african-american but then to see
people come on the street I mean this
reaction must I mean you know give us at
least some sense of hope well actually
the what's happening does give a sense
of hope first of all the murder of
George Floyd is not an unusual event
I mean events like this used to happen
pretty frequently not nobody paid any
attention to them what's encouraging
hard to say this in the midst of these
horrors but what's encouraging is there
is a reaction that shows that there has
been a kind of improvement in the level
of civilization in the country things
that passed under the radar before at
least a lot of people noticed though
they didn't protest before the different
testing known but let me say a word of
criticism about it like I understand it
sympathize really good thing but notice
to focus on the few policemen one of
them is a murderer three others stood by
and did nothing and there's a lot of
demonstrations of those three who stood
by but it's useful them every once in a
while to look into the mirror
can you think of anyone else who's stood
by for actually all of our lifestyle
last long before while all these things
are happening and didn't do anything
people like me for example and the rest
of us but what have we done to alleviate
the circumstances that lead to this oh
yes we can certainly claim the policeman
for standing by but there's a deeper
problem deeply ingrained in white
society even people who were activists
and posters we pretty much stood by of
this the protest today are very
reminiscent of others so in 1992 after
the brother Rodney King burger but
police in Los Angeles and after the
policeman who killed him were released
on you know without from the court
without any punishment there was huge
protests the week for the protests I
think about 60 people were killed
federal troops were brought in the
effect as usual was to shift public
attention to rioters we have that more
for the border war force that's the
typical response to protests that seek
employment we're living except now
there's more protests and I should say
this raises a question that activists
should ask themselves it should always
ask themselves you have to distinguish
between tactics that make you feel good
the tactics that actually do good the
ones that make you feel good or easy
like if I can break a window and until
that anger am makes me feel good is it
doing good to give the president Trump
and the right-wing they love it so it
may be hard to restrain yourself and
times of
bitterness and or crisis if you ask
yourself what am I trying to achieve to
the answer of what to do is why Twitter
over time consistently nonviolent
protests which are hard to courage our
strength
these have shifted opinion in support of
the cause were event who I am in
projects consistently have been a gift
to the harsher and more brutal elements
in the society and you have to think
about that if you're serious about the
cause ah hard funnies and easy to
sympathize with special flex that's a
boot on their neck for four hundred
years
no can't criticize any reaction but on
the part of others this is really
thinking about these things
that's a very powerful thought because I
think the question of strategy and the
question of tactics should be taken of
course very seriously I wanted to ask
you about something I think doesn't get
talked about much you try continental we
are playing with the concept of Corona
shock and we are suggesting that while
the more capitalist states have been
having a harder time with this pandemic
it's quite extraordinary that socialist
countries seem to be bearing up much
better one of the first books I read of
yours was the new man during the you
know new mandarins book which was about
Vietnam it affected me a great deal
known because your writings on Vietnam
was so important for those of us coming
up and understanding American power
Vietnam and Prime Minister Nguyen have
had a completely different attitude to
the global pandemic and in fact despite
sharing of for 1,400 kilometer border
with China they have had no casualties
now one day
do you have anything to say about this
country that was so brutally bombed by
the United States you know for a
considerable part of its 20th century
history has been able not only to have
no casualties but donated four hundred
and forty thousand you know pieces of
protective clothing to the United States
how is one to understand this a country
so brutalized is being so generous in
the middle of a global pandemic well it
is pretty striking to see the reactions
of the Vietnam figures which I can't
verify but scientists seem to take them
seriously it seemed to indicate that the
number of fatalities really very low may
be zero
in fact if you look over when the
pandemic struck the United States was
similarly unprepared and there were many
reasons for this but the main reason it
is is that it is the most business run
of any society when society is business
run it's going to be geared for profit
for the rich that's a tautology so
hospitals were run on the business model
kind of like an assembly plant you don't
have spare resources you don't have an
extra bit that would be a waste of money
doesn't work very well even in normal
times but in when there's a catastrophe
you know even anything mildly wrong with
catastrophe under Obama it was science
or added he did George shall be the
first W Bush Bush HW had established a
science advisory board when Obama came
to office he within the first days of
his administration he activated it then
he asked them to work out proposals for
an impending pandemic everyone knew
coming so what should we do within a
couple of weeks they gave me detailed
plan and it was implemented Sooners
Trump came into office first days
dismantled the whole thing no profit
this is extreme negative religion
instead of mild neoliberalism
extreme savagery instead of mild
savagery from the first day in office
from defunded the Center for Disease
Control every year eliminated programs
of American scientists working in China
with Chinese scientists to try to
identify potential coronaviruses hoard
dangerous work Chinese scientists some
of them were killed doing it but all of
this dismantled so that's the extreme
end us totally unprepared
after the within days China amazingly
fast Chinese scientists had identified
the virus in a sequence the genome given
into the world everybody knew us nothing
intelligence new health officials new
than one do anything that's the worst
Europe was sort of in the middle some
reacted some didn't we don't pay
attention to these Asians but in the
China area almost everybody reacted
Vietnam was remarkable but New Zealand
Australia reacted how it contained the
South Korea was one of the most
remarkable that a very severe outbreak
immediately contained in very almost
total testing no lockdowns they didn't
need it because they used tests and
trace techniques and it was pretty much
under control Taiwan the same Hong Kong
same
Singapore pretty much Singapore even had
hospitals that had been established and
kept vacant in case there would be a
been Deming the West much worse
the United States at the bottom of the
barrel and I think it pretty much
correlates with to what extent is a
government business run to what extent
does the government care about its
population these are inversely
correlated not always you have
dictatorships don't care about the
population but among the countries we're
talking about these are inversely
correlated pretty much and you sort of
see it so yeah in fact one of the most
amazing cases which is another gap
you're not let talk about here this Cuba
there's something called the European
Union Union there's a rich country
Germany they were able to more or less
contain it extra capacity next rehearsal
for diagnostic capacity and so on pretty
low death for a very rich country
there's another country not very far to
the south which had a huge pandemic in
the north Italy northern Italy
do you see German doctors in northern
Italy I mean if so it's been kept a
secret you do see doctors from Cuba the
one internationalist country in the
world which once again is sending
thousands of doctors to places most
affected working in the most difficult
conditions just the way they did after
the huge earthquake in Haiti and
Pakistan this is a country that's I
don't have to tell you it's been under
the US boot for 60 years the u.s. is
trying to crush it terrorist wars
economic warfare so stringent that if a
swedish company wants to send medical
equipment they can't because there might
be some they might via the anger the
knife he had done so they can't do it
and it's cuba first of all it has it
pretty much under control itself and is
now sending help other countries I mean
the
irony of this is beyond the words that's
another thing that you don't see
headlined in the press exactly in fact
when it is discussed occasionally it is
Cuban is attacked for forced labor for
enforcing doctors the ghosts of the
state can probably well it is based on
like a lot of folder propaganda it is
based on a sliver of truth the part of
the funding that goes to the doctors
goes back to the government to use for
health services for training and
improving the health services No Cuba's
totalitarian state slave labor you've
got to increase the punishment is this
manufacturing concern well it's a pretty
good example of it I think but here's
the European Union on the one hand and
getting international aid for the one
international statement in the world the
one that's under the most attack by the
Mafia done that's the world we're living
in you don't talk about it well Chomsky
it was a pleasure to have your news
click and especially to end at time with
you with you speaking so passionately
about Cuba thanks a lot good to talk to
you
