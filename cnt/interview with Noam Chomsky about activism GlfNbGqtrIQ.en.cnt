hello hi is this Noam Chomsky yeah
freaking hi I have some general
questions i'm at it's at its best what
can activism be what can what what can
activate be best fit something that a
Chiefs results that it's trying to
attain that's activism you've got a goal
you want to do something about it you
pick various techniques and approaches
you refine them find the ones that seem
to be working improve them I get
somewhere I wanted to ask about four
different things that activism can do
and just I'm at maybe you could just
comment on them the first one is just
solidarity mm-hmm well let's take the
Occupy movement one of their
achievements in fact I think one of the
most important ones has just been to
create communities of solidarity mutual
support Democratic participation that's
a very important achievement in fact
particular in a society like ours which
is kind of almost designed to isolate
people and separate them for one another
which is a great technique of control of
course so forming communities based on
solidarity sure that's very important
that I guess not now that's the reason
why the labor movement from its origins
has been concerned with solidarity
that's one of its main slogans we're
going to work together we ought to work
together because we ought to be helping
and one another but that's the only way
in which we're going to confront
concentrated power okay and another one
is find finding out what you think in
what your values are well that I think
relates to solidarity
you find out what you think and what
your values are by participation and
interchange and maybe there are some
people who can sit alone in a room and
think through these questions and find
answers but very few even even in the
sciences like take the floor we're on
having to be talking in a science-based
university MIT they go around look at
the offices people working together
talking with each other or trying to
sharpen up what they think getting
reactions it's what you find would you
believe yourself but most people think
they already know what they think in
what their values are well then they
haven't thought very hard about it
because we learned i'm at some general
level yes I mean like I know how opposed
to say aggression and massacre but when
you really try to get down to a more
refined understanding of these questions
interaction with others feedback
criticism and so on answering objections
all of that is part of discovering
things about yourself okay and another
one is just information for example
where do you get your information from
is it mostly from networks of people no
well to some extent that all right it's
the main sources every bunch of
newspapers every day read it tied
journals read people's papers talk to
others about what they're doing talked
about what I'm doing and getting
reactions Oh endless numbers of books
there's no magic about it it's just a to
work hard and what do you think in terms
of activism what do you think about
information networks I'll let me very
helpful groups of people people with
shared interests and concerns can enter
the supplement one another's no
information but also understanding
actually we all do this I'm involved in
any number of informal exchanges which
do this all the time sometimes close
friends sometimes people I barely know
do you know any examples of people who
are extremely knowledgeable not because
they not not because they're fanatics
but because they belong to such a
network yeah sure I mean that's one of
the one of the functions of labor
movements during their their peak the
labor labor union hall or labor meetings
were places where people could learn
interchange discover help each other out
workers education was always a central
part of the active workers movement and
it's the same and other things other
than whatever you know whatever kind of
network you're involved with and the
last one is an action which which
tactics do you think are the most
effective and I don't think there's any
general answers that depends what you're
trying to achieve some things made the
effective if you're organizing to try to
get this city to put a traffic light on
a intersection where your kids are
crossing the street to school then some
kinds of attack tix are right there
different kinds of tactics are
appropriate if you're trying to set of a
setup a cooperative Enterprise either
production commerce whatever owned by
and run by the workforce in the
community a very important thing to do
and different tactics are required
they're still different ones are
required if you're trying to initiative
press for certain kinds of legislation
there's no single answer I fact tactic
have to be kind of discovered there is
choosing tactics is a tricky operation
you have to take into account lots of
things that are uncertain like what's
the reaction of other people want to be
like saying um you're trying to reach
out to what about mass protests I mean
that's a pretty that's a pretty standard
action that's that's pretty important
isn't it sometimes you know I've taken
part many of them sometimes it's a very
important thing to do like a you know
demonstration in Washington I guess
idiot a war or Martin Luther to take one
that failed unfortunately Martin Luther
King's final dream just when he was
assassinated he was planning to lead a
march of the poor to Washington it did
take place right after he was
assassinated beginning at the motel
where he was killed going through the
south through the places where the civil
rights struggle had been waged if I they
ended up in Washington set up a kind of
intensity resurrection City they were
totally scorned by Congress the police
were called in and drove out of the city
and for good measure came in in the
middle of the night and smashed up
resurrection city the Democratic
Congress incidentally well that's one
demonstration that didn't work should
have worked with more participation and
engagement it could have would have made
a big difference and what are all the
different kinds of things that can
happen at a demonstration besides
scaring politicians well demonstrations
one of their main functions actually is
creating solidarity those are ways in
which people work together to achieve a
common goal that strengthens the bonds
and even is informative it gives them
ways to go on
frightening politicians is also a matter
of showing look here's what the
population are substantial part of it
believes you better pays an attention to
us okay and I just have another question
if you were talking to the American
public you wanted to tell them why they
should become active what would you say
I would simply have them take a careful
honest look at the world around them and
if they do they will see very serious
problems all over the place ranging I'm
taking simply in the United States ring
i'm in a problem of say fifty million
people without any health care which is
just a scandal in the richest society in
history at another extreme they would
see that our dedication to maximizing
the use of fossil fuel which we do is
going to drive the society off the cliff
just like lemmings going to disaster and
maybe pretty soon and all sorts of other
things in between well okay that's
reasons for activism if you care about
making a decent world in which your
children and grandchildren can live you
ought to be you gotta do something about
these things and what are the sacrifices
you have to make when you become active
sacrifices our range from giving up time
taking things away from other things
you'd like to do all the way up to
facing harsh repression maybe jail
sentences who knows why you went to jail
what was that like as an experience for
you that's one of them most unpleasant
experiences i can imagine i was never in
jail for a long time but it's the very
idea that you're you have no choices
your fate is completely in someone else
and that person can capriciously decide
anything they want about you so strange
feeling the first time you undergo it
even and the simple to fit you know it
wasn't I wasn't put in a
maximum-security prison this is Sylvie
dias but what was it like can you tell
me a little bit more about the
experience that's what they prefer that
one is boring as hell but for another
the overwhelming experience least for me
is the sense that you have no choices no
control essentially you're under someone
else's arbitrary rule and how long were
you actually in jail for hmm well it was
until quite a few times but never more
than a day or two okay well thanks so
much professor Chomsky I really
appreciate it okay good talk to you yep
