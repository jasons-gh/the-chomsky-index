what I focus on frankly is based on a
very elementary moral principle I
realize it's almost universally rejected
but I'd still like to reiterate it our
prime concern should be our own
responsibilities
we should our prime concern for anybody
should be the predictable consequences
of your own actions I mean it's very
self it's very convenient and you know
be self-righteous and to talk about
somebody else's crimes so you know if
you were a Russian commissar in the
1970s they'll be very convenient to
concentrate on US crimes but the
important thing to do in Russia was not
that I don't care whether soccer I've
said anything about US crimes what you
care is what they're saying about their
own society and something they can do
about and the same elementary moral
principle applies to us the focus of our
attention should be on what we can do
what we are doing what are the options
for us to try to terminate major crimes
in which we're involved and there are
plenty of them and to mitigate harm and
atrocities elsewhere and there's a lot
that we can do you say that what the
media do is to ignore certain kinds of
atrocities that are committed by us and
our friends and to play off enormously
atrocities that are committed by them
and and our enemies and U+ but there's a
test of integrity and moral honesty
which is to have a kind of equality of
treatment of corpses quality principles
I mean that every dead person should be
in principle equals that with every
other dead well I'm glad that's not what
you say because that's not what you do
what I say is that we should be
responsible for our own actions
primarily because your method is not
only to ignore a court the corpse is
created by them but also to ignore the
corpses that are created by neither side
but which are irrelevant to your
ideological but let me give you an
example that that one of you are one of
your own causes that you take very
seriously is the cause of the power
Stinney ins and anna palestinian corpse
where is weighs very heavily on your
conscience
and yet a kurdish corpse does not
involved in kurdish support groups for
years a that's actually true it's a
plateful so let me just ask the kurdish
ask the people who are involved in I
mean you know they come to me I sign
their petitions and so on and so forth
and if you look at the stuff that the
things we've written let's take a look I
mean I'm not Amnesty International I
can't do everything I'm single you know
third-person but if you read say take
take a look say at the book that Edward
Herman and I wrote on this topic in it
we discuss three kinds of atrocities
what we called benign blood baths which
nobody cares about constructive blood
baths which are the ones we like and the
Farias blood baths which are the ones
that the bad guys do the principle that
I think we ought to follow is not the
one that you stated you know it's it's a
very simple ethical point you're
responsible for the predictable
consequences of your actions
you're not responsible for the
predictable consequences of somebody
else's actions the most important thing
for me and for you is to think about the
consequences of your actions what can
you affect these are the things to keep
in mind these are not just academic
exercises we're not analyzing the media
on Mars or in the 18th century or
something like that we're dealing with
real human beings who are suffering and
dying and being tortured and starving
because of policies that we are involved
in we as citizens of democratic
societies are directly involved in and
are responsible for and what the media
are doing is ensuring that we do not act
on our responsibilities and that the
interests of power are served not the
needs of the suffering people and not
even the needs of the American people
who would be horrified if they realize
the blood that's dripping from their
hands because of the way they're
allowing themselves to be deluded and
manipulated by the system
what about the third world well despite
everything and it's pretty ugly and
awful these struggles are not over
the struggle for freedom and
independence never is completely over
their courage in fact is really
remarkable amazing I've personally had
the privilege and it is a privilege of
witnessing it a few times in villages in
Southeast Asia and Central America and
recently in the occupied West Bank and
it is astonishing the sea and it's
always amazing place to me it's amazing
I can't understand it it's also very
moving and very inspiring in fact it's
kind of all I inspiring now they rely
very crucially on a very slim margin for
survival that's provided by dissidents
and turbulence within the Imperial
societies and how large that margin is
is for us to determine
