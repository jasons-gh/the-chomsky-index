you
you know by comparative standards it was
a period of relatively decent policies
relatively and it was mainly still a
reflection of the of the activism of the
30s and 40s by then already there was a
major attack on labor going on which has
severely undermined that unfortunately
the labor union leadership contributed
to this many respects but the labor has
always been at the forefront of
progressive social change
this was the residue with the New Deal
not a new deal reflected labor up to a
large extent labor militancy which did
bring in you know pretty progressive
policies and I mean not perfect I think
a lot be a lot better than that and
plenty of the policies in the 1950s were
pretty destructive and awful but a lot
of a lot of the kind of regression and
it's furious is a reflection of the
destruction of virtual destruction of
the labor organizations look this has
been a business run society to an
unusual extent by comparative standards
for a long time and there's a very class
conscious business class which is always
fighting a better class war and right
away after the Second World War they
organized a massive campaigns to drive
back the progressive legislation of the
1930s and have been slowly succeeding
well a lot of things have changed first
there it's it's a very atomized Society
if there may be if you count the number
of activists in Boston this fairly large
number but they're separated from one
another other things going on in
downtown Boston which are quite
interesting which I never heard of until
I happened to go down there was invited
to give a talk and the atomization of
the society has affected activism so
people are working on specific usually
specific issue oriented matters and not
collaborating and cooperating with
others one thing the labor movement did
was bring people together and that's not
so easy especially when there's
tremendous pressures to separate and
then isolate people that's what the
whole consumer is May Day is about which
has huge pressures and money beyond it
trying to drive people to individual
consumption and not cooperation that's
me say mass transportation which I
mentioned before is it's a case in point
it's a market that does not permit mass
transportation as an option and markets
by their nature restrict choices they
restrict choices to individual self
gratification like if I want to go home
tonight a market offers me a choice
between a Ford and Toyota but it doesn't
offer me a choice between a car and
subway that requires Democrat that
requires collective action Collective
popular Democratic action which is
markets are inherently opposed to so
that we don't have really a market
society but to the extent that there is
it has the effect of undermining
constructive activism
plenty of other problems too certainly
those
but Labor's been a big factor that's you
know it's a huge organized massive of
working people remove the labor movement
or virtually been destroyed in the 1920s
it was almost gone but in the 30s it
revitalized the formation the CIO
sit-down strikes industrial organizing a
militant labor movement that had a huge
effect working people there's nothing
else like it the plenty of activism but
it doesn't have that base so that's one
big part but by no means all like us let
me say take the women's movement just
probably changed the society more than
anything else you can think of in the
last couple of generations it was
obviously not labor based in fact it was
Labour's dubious attitude
