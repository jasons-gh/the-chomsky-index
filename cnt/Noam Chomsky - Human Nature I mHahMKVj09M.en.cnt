what do you think behaviorally speaking
humans primarily are that is do you
think we have a sort of Hobbesian human
nature or a plastic human nature or
something else because this seems to
when you hear either conservatives or
liberals or people on the far right or
far left discuss what kind of policies
and what kind of economics and what we
should have you know how we should deal
with the rest of the world it usually
always what often comes back Lisa to
justify their opinions always comes back
to well this is what humans are and this
is therefore more natural for us to do a
you know have a capitalist society or B
have a social society what do you think
is the basic human nature that or do you
think that we have a basic human nature
I believe that we are part of the
natural world okay hmm therefore we have
a nature it's our genetic endowment
determines substantially what our nature
is in fact if you look at the growth of
any organism us bees you know eat
whatever they like there are actually
three factors that enter into its growth
and development one is its genetic
Constitution another is environmental
effects and the third is just the way
laws of nature work which isn't
turns out as a major effect and the
inquiry into biological organisms takes
all of those into account or should as
for our human nature the genetic
endowment that we essentially share very
little is known about it I mean it's
just a really hard question and as I
mentioned in our earlier discussion a
lot of the ways of studying it are
excluded simply because we don't allow
invasive experimentation mmm the and it
you know it's hard enough to learn about
insect nature where we allow ourselves
anything well they're much simpler
organisms so what do we know about human
nature well most of our knowledge comes
from history experience literary
exploration and so on that's what our
knowledge comes from what does it tell
us it tells us that of course humans are
partially plastic like how speak Swahili
for example so we're partially plastic
on the other hand there's there has to
be an enormous uniformity at a level
right below the surface and what we see
on the surface is a wide range of
possibilities I mean we see people who
are acting in a beastly fashion we see
others who are kind of sacrificing their
lives to save dolphins one of the the
sciences and I'm not sure it would be
categorized the hard science or soft
science or it's an emerging science
evolutionary psychology people like Leo
Wilson and Steven Pinker have come
around and and said they understand what
human nature is and it's based on this
new science are you saying then that
they are either still just guessing or
do they have some some scientific
backing that from what you have if
you've read any of their work yes
another word and I know a lot of them it
what's now called evolutionary
psychology was in fact initiated about a
century ago over century ago by Peter
Kropotkin the an erisa thinker and
naturalist wrote a book called the
mutual aid to factor in evolution
mmm-hmm and in it he investigated he was
basically trying to counter social
Darwinist he was Darwin Darwinist
himself and he argued by looking at a
lot of naturalistic phenomena other
animals human history and so on he
argued that if you look at it you
discover that mutual aid had a provided
a selectional advantage and therefore
organisms were had evolved through
selection including humans to be deeply
committed to one or another form of
mutual aid well you know that's not what
elite opinion wants to hear mmm they
want to hear some other story so
therefore core potkins
form of evolutionary psychology
essentially disappeared
I've been revived to some extent the
actual modern the modern state of
evolutionary psychology as I mean it's
not that there's no science there at all
there's some you know like say kin
selection is real reciprocal altruism is
real a couple other things real but very
little as an
it's Finn you know this is not physics
and that's not molecular biology it's
not chemistry it's largely gas is not
it's a worthwhile topic to pursue it's
mind I'd like to pursue in fact that's
where my own professional work is in
particular areas but we should be
scientists particularly should be very
cautious about inducing the and diluting
the public to think that they know more
than they do mmm science has held an
enormous respect for good reasons and
therefore scientists have a
responsibility to make very clear here's
what we know and here's what we don't
know and what we know in these areas
happens to be extremely thin not because
they're not good scientists but because
the questions are too hard
