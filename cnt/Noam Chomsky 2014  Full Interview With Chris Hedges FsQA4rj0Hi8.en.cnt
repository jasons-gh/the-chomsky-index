let's begin with a classic paradigm
which is throughout the Industrial
Revolution which has been cited by
theorists from Marx to Kropotkin to
prove down to yourself that you build a
consciousness among workers within the
manufacturing class and eventually you
lead to a kind of autonomous position
where workers can control their own
production we now live in a system a
globalized system where most of the
working class in industrial countries
like the United States our service
workers we have reverted to a dick and
Sounion system where those who actually
produced live in conditions that begin
to replicate almost slave labor and I
think as you have written in places like
southern China in fact our slave what's
the new paradigm for resistance you know
how do we learn from the old and
confront the new well I think the I
think we can draw many very good lessons
from the early period of the Industrial
Revolution of course earlier in England
but let's take care of the United States
the Industrial Revolution took off right
around here eastern Massachusetts mid
19th century this was a period when
independent farmers were being driven
into the industrial system men and women
incidentally women from the farms of
gold factory girls and they bitterly
resented it they had it was a period of
a very free press the most in the in the
history of the country there was a wide
variety of journals ethnic labor others
and when you read them they're pretty
fascinating the people driven into the
industrial system regarded it is an
attack on their personal
ND on their rights as human beings they
were free human beings who were being
forced into what they called wage
slavery which they regard it is not very
different from chattel slavery in fact
this was such a popular view that was
actually a slogan of the Republican
Party that the only difference between
working for a wage and being a slave is
that working for wages supposedly
temporary the pretty soon you'll be free
other than that they're not different
and they bitterly resented the fact that
the the industrial system was even
taking away their rich cultural life and
the cultural life was rich there by now
studies of the British working class and
American working class and they were
part of high culture of the day actually
I remember this is later the 1930s with
my own family industrial sort of
unemployed working class and they said
this was being taken away from us we're
being forced to be something like slaves
they argued that if you if you're a say
a journeyman a craftsman and you sell
your product you're selling your what
you produced if your wage if your wage
earner you're selling yourself which is
deeply offensive they condemned what
they called the new spirit of the age
gain wealth for getting old but self
sounds familiar and it was extremely
radical it was combined with a the most
radical democratic movement in American
history the populists the early populist
movement radical farmers began in Texas
spreaded to the Midwest enormous
movement of farmers who wanted to free
themselves from the domination by the
northeastern bankers and capitalists
cousin
the markets you know sort of forced them
to a silver what they produced on credit
and squeeze them with credit and so on
they went on to develop their own banks
there on cooperatives they started to
link up with the Knights of Labor major
labor movement which held that as they
put it those those who work in the mills
ought on them that should be a Democrat
free democratic society these were very
powerful movement by the 1890s you know
workers were taking over towns and
running them in eastern Pennsylvania and
western Pennsylvania homestead was a
famous gate well they were crushed by
force it took some time that's where the
final blow was Woodrow Wilson's Red
Scare right after the First World War
which virtually crushed the labor
movement at the same time in the early
19th century the the business world
recognized both in England in the United
States that sufficient freedom had been
won so they could no longer control
people just by violence they had turned
to new means of control the obvious ones
were control of opinions and attitudes
that's the origins of the massive public
relations industry which is explicitly
dedicated to controlling minds and
attitudes the first government of partly
was government the first government
Commission was the British Ministry of
Information this is long before or will
he didn't have to invent it so the
Ministry of Information had as its goal
to control the minds of the people of
the world but particularly the minds of
American intellectuals for a good reason
they knew that if they can delude
American intellectuals into supporting
British policy they could it be very
effective in imposing that on the
population of the United States the
British of course we're desperate to get
the emerg
into the war with a pacifist population
that Woodrow Wilson won the 1966 teen
election with a slogan peace without
victory and they had to drive a pacifist
population into a population that
bitterly hated all things German wanted
to tear the Germans apart at Boston
Symphony Orchestra couldn't play
Beethoven and I succeeded the Wilson set
up at a counterpart to the Ministry of
Information called the Committee on
Public Information again you can guess
what it was and they at least felt that
probably correctly that they had
succeeded in carrying out this massive
change of opinion on the part of the
population and driving the passive the
pacifist population into you know
warmongering fanatics and the people on
the Commission learned a lesson that one
of them was it urbanized who went on to
found the main guru of the public
relations industry another one was woven
Lippmann who was the leading progressive
intellectual of the 20th century and
they both had to do the same pleasant
and said so the lessons were that we can
we have it with Lippmann called a new
art and democracy manufacturing consent
that's where it Herman and I took the
phrase from for burn eyes it was
engineering of consent the conception
was that the intelligent minority who of
course is us have to make sure that we
can run the affairs of public affairs
affairs of state to the economy and so
on we're the only ones capable of doing
it of course and we have to be I'm
quoting free from the roar and the
trampling of the bewildered heard the
ignorant and metals and outsiders the
general public they have to have a role
their role is to be spectators not
participants
every couple of years they are permitted
to choose among one of the responsible
men us and that consider the John Dewey
circle that took the same view that
Dewey changed his mind couple years
later to his credit but at that time a
dewy and his circle were writing that
speak in the First World War that this
is the first war in history that was not
organized and manipulated by the
military and the political figures and
so on but rather it was carefully
planned by rational calculation of the
intelligent men in the community namely
us and we thought it through carefully
and decided that this is the reasonable
thing to do for all kind of benevolent
reasons they were proud of themselves if
there were people who disagree like
Randolph born disagreed he was kicked
out he couldn't write in the duty I
journals he wasn't killed but it was
just excluded and if you take a look
around the world it was pretty much the
same in the the intellectuals on all
sides were passionately dedicated to the
national cause also its Germans British
everywhere there were a few with fringe
of dissenters like Bertrand Russell who
was a jail the coral liebe liebe
clapping Rosa Luxemburg in jail Randolph
porn marginalized Eugene Debs in jail
for daring to question the magnificence
of the war in fact Wilson hated him with
such passion that when he fund declared
an amnesty devs was left out had to wait
for Warren Harding to release him and he
was the leading labor figure in the
country was in candidate for president
Socialist Party and so on but the lesson
that came out is you we believe you you
can and of course ought to control the
public and if we can't do it by
course we'll do it by manufacturing
consent by engineering of consent after
that comes the huge public relations
industry massive industry dedicated to
this incidentally it's also dedicated to
undermining markets the fact that's
rarely noticed but is quite obvious it
business hates markets they don't want
and you can see it very clearly the
markets if you take an economics course
or based on rational informed consumers
making rational choices they turn on the
television set and look at the first ad
you see it's trying to create uninformed
consumers making irrational choices
that's the whole point of the huge
advertising industry but also to try to
control and manipulate thought and it
takes various forms in different
institutions media knew it one way the
academic institutions do it another way
and the educational system is a crucial
part of it is not a new observation
there's actually an interesting essay by
Orwell's which is not very well known
because it wasn't published it's the
introduction to animal form in the
introduction he addresses himself to the
people of England and he says you
shouldn't feel too self-righteous
reading this satire of the totalitarian
enemy because in free England ideas can
be suppressed without the use of force
and he doesn't say much about at the
exact has two sentences when he says the
press one reason is the press is owned
by wealthy men who have every reason not
the one certain ideas to be expressed
but the second reason more important one
in my view is a good education said if
you've gone to all the good schools you
know Oxford Cambridge and so on you have
instilled into you the understanding
that there are certain things it
wouldn't do to say and I don't think he
went far enough wouldn't do to think
and that's very broad among the educated
classes that's why overwhelmingly they
tend to support state power and state
violence maybe with some qualifications
like say Obama is regarded as a critic
of the invasion of Iraq why because he
thought it was a strategic blunder that
puts him on the same moral level as some
nazi general who thought that the second
front was a strategic blunder knock off
England first that's called criticism
but and sometimes it's kind of
outlandish for example it was just a
review in the New York Times Book Review
of Glenn Greenwoods new book by Michael
Kinsley and which bitterly condemned
them is mostly character assassination
didn't say anything substantive but
tensley did say that it's ridiculous to
think that there's any repression and
the media in the United States because
we can write quite freely and criticize
anything and he can but then you have to
look at what he says and that's quite
interesting Michael Kent in the 1980s
when they major the mask local news
story was the u.s. massive us atrocities
in Central America they were horrendous
and wasn't presented that way but that's
what was happening kinsley was the voice
of the left on television and there were
interesting incidents at one point the
u.s. Southern Command which ran over saw
see it was the overseer of these actions
gave instructions to the terrorist force
that they were running in Nicaragua
called the Contras and they were a
terrorist force they gave them orders to
they said not to duke it out with the
Sandinistas meaning avoid the sand
earnest of the Nicaraguan army and
attack undefended at the targets like
agricultural cooperatives and health
clinics and so on and they could do it
because they were the first
Gorillaz in history to have high-level
communications equipment you know
computers and so on the u.s. CLA just
rent controlled the air totally so they
could ascend instructions to the
terrorist forces telling them how to
avoid the Nicaraguan army detachment
sand attack undefended civilian targets
well this was mentioned you know wasn't
publicized but was mentioned and
America's watch which there became part
of Human Rights Watch was made some
protests michael kinsley responded he
condemned America's watch for their
emotionalism he said we have to
recognize that we have to accept the a
pragmatic criterion we have to ask for
something like this he said we have to
compare the amount of blood and misery
poured in with the success of the
outcome in producing democracy will will
call democracy and if it meets the
pragmatic criterion then terrorist
attacks against civilian targets are
perfectly legitimate which is not a
surprising view in his case he was the
editor of the New Republic the New
Republic supposedly liberal Journal was
arguing that we should support Latin
American fascists because there are more
important things than human rights and
also all the door where they were
murdering tens and thousands of people
that's the Liberals and yeah they can
get in the media no problem and it's at
the end appraised for regarded with
praise all of this is part of the
massive system of it's not that anybody
said that top and plans at all it's just
exactly as or well said it's instilled
into you it's part of a deep
indoctrination system which leads to a
certain way of looking at the world and
looking at authority which says yes we
have to be subordinate to authority we
have to believe we're very
pendant and free and proud of it as long
as we keep within the limits we are try
to go beyond those limits you're out but
that that system of course is constant
but what's changed is that we don't
produce anything anymore so what we
define is our working class is a service
sector class working in places like
walmart and the effective forms of
resistance the sit-down strikes you know
the the going back even further in the
middle of the 19th century with the
women and lowell i think that was a
while the Wobblies were behind those
textile strikes what are the mechanisms
now and i know you have written as many
anarchists have done about the
importance of the working class
controlling the means of production
taking control and you have a great
quote about how you know Lenin in the
Bolsheviks are right right wing deviants
I think was that which is of course
exactly right because it was centralized
control destroying the Soviets given the
fact that production has moved to places
like Bangladesh or southern China what
is going to be the paradigm now and
given as you point out the powerful
forces of propaganda and you touched
upon now the security and surveillance
state we are the most monitored watched
photographed eavesdropped population
human history and you cannot even use
the word Liberty when you eviscerate
privacy that's what totalitarian is what
is the road we take now given the
paradigm that we have which is somewhat
different from you know what this
country was certainly in the first half
of the 20th century I think it's pretty
much the same frankly the idea still
should be that of the Knights of Labor
those who work in the mills should on
them and there's plenty of manufacturing
going on
tree and probably there will be more as
for unpleasant reasons that one thing
that's happening right now which is
quite interesting is that energy prices
are going down in the United States
because of the massive exploitation of
fossil fuels which is going to destroy
our grandchildren but under the
capitalist morality the calculus is that
profits tomorrow outweigh the existence
of your grandchildren that's
institutionally based so yes we're
getting lower energy prices and if you
look at the business press they're very
enthusiastic about the fact that we can
undercut manufacturing in Europe because
we'll have lower energy prices and
therefore manufacturing will come back
here and we could even undermine
European efforts at developing
sustainable energy because we'll be so
much we'll have this advantage at
written as saying the same thing that
Britain lives just in England recently
as I left the airport I read The Daily
Telegraph you know I mean newspaper big
headline England is going to begin frac
fracking all over the country even
fracking under people's homes without
their permission and that'll make that
will allow us to destroy the environment
even more quickly and we'll have it will
bring manufacturing back here the same
is true with Asia manufacturing is
moving back to an extent to Mexico and
even here as wages increase in China
partly because of labor struggles it's
those massive labor struggles in China
huge all over the place and since we're
integrated with them we can wouldn't be
supportive of them but manufacturing is
coming back here at both manufacturing
and the service industries can move
towards having
those who do the work take over the
management and ownership and control in
fact it's happening in the old rust belt
you know Indiana Ohio and so on there's
a significant not huge but significant
growth of worker owned enterprises
they're not huge but their substantial
around Cleveland other places the
background is interesting in 1977 the US
Steel the multinational decided to close
down their mills in Youngstown Ohio the
Youngstown is a steel town built by the
steel workers and the main one of the
main steel producing areas well the
Union tried to buy the plants from us
deal they objected in my view mostly on
class lines they might have even
profited from it but the idea of worker
owned industries don't have much appeal
to the corporate leaders which means
bankers and so on it went to the courts
finally the Union lost in the courts but
with enough profit of support they could
have won well the working class just and
the community did not give up they
couldn't get the steel mills but they
began to develop small worker owned
enterprises they've now spread
throughout the region their substantial
and it can happen more and more and the
same can happen in Walmart I'm there's a
massive effort right now significant
ones to organize the service workers and
what they call associates and in the
service industries and these industries
remember depend very heavily on a
taxpayer largesse in all kinds of ways I
mean for example as they say Walmart's
the import goods produced in China which
are brought here on containerships which
were designed to develop
by the US Navy and point after point
where he look you find that the way the
system the system that we now have is
one which is radically anti-capitalist
radically so I mean I mentioned one
thing the powerful effort to try to
undermine markets for consumers but
there's something much more striking I'm
in the in a capitalist system the basic
principle is that say if you invest in
something and say it's a risky
investment so you put money into it for
a long time maybe decades and finally
after a long time something comes out
that's marketable for a profit supposed
to go back to you that's not the way it
works here that takes a computer's
internet lasers micro electronics
containers and GPS in fact the whole IT
revolution there was taxpayer investment
in that for decades literally decades
doing all the hard creative risky work
doesn't the taxpayer get any of the
profit because that's not the way our
system works radically anti-capitalist
as it's radically anti-democratic posed
the markets in favor of concentrating
wealth and power but that doesn't have
to be accepted by the population these
are all they're all kinds of forms of
resistance to this can be developed if
people become aware of it well you could
argue that in the election of 2008 Obama
wasn't accepted by the population what
we see repeatedly is that once elected
officials achieve power through of
course corporate financing the consent
of the governed is a kind of cruel joke
it doesn't poll after poll I mean I sued
Obama over the national defense
authorization act in which you were a
co-plaintiff and the polling was
ninety-seven percent against this
section of the NDAA and yet the courts
which have become wholly owned
subsidiaries of the corporate state the
elected
officials the executive branch and the
press which ignored largely ignored it
the only organ that responsibly covered
the case was ironically the new york
times we don't have it doesn't matter
what we want it doesn't I mean we and I
think you know that that's the question
how do we affect change when we have
reached a point where we can no longer
appeal to the traditional liberal
institutions that as karl popper said
once made incremental or piecemeal
reform possible to adjust the system of
course to save capitalism but now it
can't even adjust the system you know we
see when cutting well welfare I mean
it's perfectly true true that the
population is mostly disenfranchised in
fact that's a leading theme even of
academic political science you take a
look at the mainstream political science
so for example a recent paper that was
just published out of Princeton by
Martin Gilliland and Benjamin page 2
with a leading analysts of these topics
what they point out as they went through
a couple of thousand policy decisions
and found what has long been known that
there was almost no that the public
public attitudes had almost no effect
the public organizations that are
certain nonprofit organizations that are
publicly based no affect the outcomes
were determined by a concentrated
private power there's a long record of
that going way back that Thomas Ferguson
political scientist near here is shown
very convincingly that something as
simple as campaign spending is a very
good predictor of policy that goes back
into the late 19th century that's right
through the new view you know right up
till the present and that's only one
element of it and you take a look at the
literature about seventy percent of the
population what they believe has no
effect on policy at all you get a little
more influence as you go up when you get
to the top which is probably looked at
the one percent they basically write the
legislation and you see this all over
I'm going to take these huge traded with
so-called trade agreements that are
being negotiated trans-pacific and
transatlantic norma's agreement kind of
NAFTA style agreements their secret
almost there not secret from the
hundreds of corporate lawyers and
lobbyists who are writing them they know
about it which means that their bosses
know about it and the Obama
administration and the Press says look
this has to be secret otherwise we can't
defend our interests yeah our interests
means the interests of the corporate
lawyers and lobbyists were writing the
legislation take it a few pieces have
been leaked and you see that's exactly
what it is same with the others but
doesn't mean you have to accept it and
there have been changes so today say it
takes a the nude in the 1920s the labor
movement had been practically destroyed
there's a famous book one of the leading
labor historian David Montgomery has a
major book called something like the
fall of the house of labor he's talking
about the 1920s it was done there had
been a very militant labor movement very
effective farmers movement as well
crushed in 1920s or was nothing left
well the 1930s have changed and it
changed because of popular activism but
it also changed because of the breakdown
of capitalism there was a circumstance
that led to the opportunity to do
something but we're living with that
constantly I'm in take the last 30 years
for the Lord majority of the population
it's been stagnation or worse that's a
permanent it's not exactly the deep
depression but it's a kind of a
permanent semi depression for most of
the population that's a plinth is plenty
of and kindling out there which can be
lighted and what happened in the 30s is
primarily CIO organizing the militant
actions like sit-down strikes sit-down
strikes very frightened
it's a step before taking over the
institution saying we don't need the
bosses and that there was a cooperative
administration Brazil administration
sort of some interaction and significant
legislation was passed not not radical
but significant can't underestimate it
and that if it happened again in the 60s
can happen again today so i don't i
don't think that one should abandon hope
in chipping away at the more oppressive
aspects of the society within the
electoral system but it's only going to
happen if there's massive popular
organization which doesn't have to stop
at that it can also be building the
institutions of the future within the
present society would you say that the
you spoke about propaganda earlier and
the Creole commission and the rise of
the public relations industry that the
capacity to disseminate propaganda is
something that now you virtually can't
escape it I mean it's there in some
electronic form even in a handheld
device does that make that propaganda
more effective well that's kind of an
interesting question I've like a lot of
people have written a lot about the
media and intellectual propaganda but
there's another question which isn't
studied much how effective is it and
that's kind of when you brought up the
polls it's a striking illustration the
propaganda is you can see from the poll
results that the propaganda has only
limited effectiveness I mean it can
drive a population into terror and fear
and war hysteria like before the Iraq
invasion or 1970 and so on but over time
the public attitudes remain quite
different in fact studies even of what's
called the right-wing you know people
who say
get the government off my back that kind
of sector they turn out to be kind of
Social Democratic they want more
spending on health more spending on
education more spending on say women
with dependent children but not welfare
no spending on welfare because reagan
who is an extreme racist succeeded in
demonizing the notion welfare so in
people's minds welfare means a rich
black woman driving in her limousine to
the welfare office to steal your money
well nobody wants that but they want
what welfare does foreign aid is an
interesting case there's an enormous
propaganda against profit and foreign
aid so because we're giving away
everything to the undeserving people out
there they take a look at public
attitudes a a lot of opposition to
public foreign aid very high on the
other hand when you ask people how much
do we give in foreign aid way beyond
what we give when you ask what we should
give in foreign aid far above what we
give and this runs across the board
takes a taxes have been studies of
attitude starts taxes for 40 years
overwhelmingly the population says taxes
are much too low for the rich and the
corporate sector we got to raise it what
happens well the opposite
well it's just exactly zor well said
it's instilled into you it's part of a
deep indoctrination system which leads
to a certain way of looking at the world
and looking at authority which is yes we
have to be subordinate to Authority we
have to believe we're very independent
and free and proud of it as long as we
keep within the limits we are try to go
beyond those limits doral well what was
fascinating about I mean the point this
to buttresses point when you took the
major issues of the Occupy movement they
were a majoritarian movement what would
you look back on the Occupy movement
what do you think its failings were its
importance were well I think it's a
little misleading to call it a movement
occupy was a tactic fact a brilliant
tactic and if I'd been asked in you know
a couple months earlier whether they
should take over the public places
understood it's crazy but it worked
extremely well and it lit a spark which
went all over the place hundreds of
hundreds of places in the country they
were occupy events it was all over the
world I mean I gave talks in Sydney
Australia to the Occupy movement there
but it was a tactic very effective
tactic changed public discourse not
policy it brought issues to the
forefront I think my own feeling is it's
most important contribution was just to
break through the atomization of the
society it's a very atomized society
there's all sorts of effort to efforts
to separate people from one another to
so that if the ideal social unit is you
know you and your TV you know Hannah
Aaron raises atomization as one of the
key components of totality exactly and
the Occupy actions broke that down for a
large part of the population people
could recognize that we can get together
do things for ourselves that we can have
a common kitchen we can have a place for
public discourse that we can form our
Diaz and do something now if those
attitude that that's an important attack
on the core of the means by which the
public is controlled so you're not just
an individual trying to maximize your
consumption but there are other concerns
in life and you can do something about
them if those attitudes can be and
associations and bonds can be sustained
move into the directions that will be
important but going back to occupy it's
a tactic tactics I have a kind of a
half-life you can't keep doing them and
certainly you can't keep occupying
public places very long so and it was
very successful but it was not in itself
a movement the question is what happens
to the people who were involved in it do
they go on and develop do they move into
communities pick up community issues do
they organize the thing out of us takes
a this businesses a worker-owned
industry right here in Massachusetts not
far from here there was something
similar one of the multinationals
decided to close down a fairly
profitable small plant which was
producing the aerospace equipment
high-skilled workers and so on but it
wasn't profitable enough so everyone
close it down the Union wanted to buy a
company refused usual class reasons I
think if the Occupy efforts had been
available at the time they could have
provided the public support for it this
happened when Obama virtually
nationalized the auto industry there
were choices the ones one choice was
what he took of course was to rescue it
return it to essentially the same
owners in different phases but the same
class basis and send them back to doing
what they had been doing in the past
producing automobiles there were other
choices and if the octa something like
the Occupy movement had been around than
sufficient could have driven the
government into other choices like for
example turning the auto plants over the
working class and having produced with
the country needs and we we don't need
more cars that we need mass public
transportation I'm with the United
States is an absolute scandal in this
regard I just came back from Europe so
you can see it dramatically you get out
of European train you where you want to
go in no time the train from Boston to
New York maybe I don't know 20 minutes
faster than when I took it 60 years ago
that's you go along the Connecticut
Turnpike and the trucks are going faster
than the train recently at Japan offered
the United States a low-interest loan to
build high-speed rail from Washington to
New York was turned down of course but
what they were offering was to build the
kind of train that I took in Japan 50
years ago and this is a scant scandal
all over the country well you know a
reconstituted auto industry could have
turned in that direction under worker
and community control I don't think
these things are out of sight and
incidentally they even have so-called
conservative support because they're you
know they are within like it there that
within a broader capitalist kind of
what's called capitalist frameworks not
really capitalist and and those are
directions that should be pressed right
now for example the the steelworkers
union is trying to establish some kind
of relations with Mondragon the huge
worker-owned conglomerate in the Basque
Country in Spain that which is very
successful in fact
and very includes industry manufacturing
banks hospitals living quarters is very
broad if that it's not impossible that
that can be brought here and it's it's
potentially radical it's creating the
basis for quite a different society and
I think with things like say occupy the
timing wasn't quite right that if they
if the timing had been a little better
and this goes on all the time so it's
always possible it could have provided a
kind of an impetus to move significant
parts of the socio-economic system in a
different direction and once those
things begin to take off and people can
see the advantages of them can become
quite significant there are kind of
islands like that around the country so
take Chattanooga Tennessee happens to
have a publicly organized internet
system it's by far the best in the
country rapid internet access for broad
parts of the population I suspect the
roots of it probably go back to the TVA
and do deal initiatives well that kind
of you know if that can spread
throughout the country why nots very
efficient very cheap works very well it
could undermine the telecommunications
industry and its oligopoly which would
be very good thing there are lots of
possibility I want to ask just two last
questions first the fact that we have
become a militarized society something
the ante all of the predictions of the
anti-imperialist league at the end of
the 19th century including Carnegie and
Jane Addams hard to think of them both
in the same room but you go back and
read what they wrote and they were right
what how a militarized society has
deformed us economically Seymour Melman
wrote about this quite well and
politically and that is a hurdle that as
we attempt to
we form or we can figure our society we
have to cope with and I wondered if you
could address this military monstrosity
that you have written about quite a bit
well for one thing the public doesn't
like it what's called isolationism or
one or another bad word is you know
pacifism what is just the public
recognition that there's something
deeply wrong with their dedication to
the military force all over the world
now of course on at the same time the
public is frightened into believing that
we have to defend ourselves and it's not
entirely false a part of the military
system is generating forces which will
be harmful to us say Obama's a terrorist
campaign drunk campaign the biggest
terrorist campaign in history it's
generating potential terrorists faster
than its killing suspect you can see it
very striking what's happening right now
in iraq and hunted the truth of the
matter is it is very evident she could
go back to the nuremberg judgment I was
not the only anything you don't know but
in Nuremberg aggression was defined as
the supreme international crime
differing from other war crimes in that
it includes it encompasses all of the
evil that follows well us british
invasion of iraq is a textbook case of
aggression by the standards of nuremberg
it all behind and it it one of the
things that did one of the crimes was to
ignite a Sunni Shiite conflict which
hadn't been going on I mean there's you
know various kinds of tensions but
Iraqis didn't believe that could ever be
a conflict that we're intermarried they
lived in the same places and so on but
the invasion set it off took off on its
own by now it's inflaming the whole
region
now we're at the point where Sunni a
jihadi forces are actually marching on
Baghdad and the Iraqi army is collapsing
regirock II arm is just giving away
there are right there obviously is a lot
of collaboration going on and all of
this is a u.s. crime aus crime if we
believe in the validity of the judgment
against the Nazis and it's kind of
interesting the record Robert Jackson
the chief prosecutor US Justice did at
the tribunal addressed the tribunal and
he pointed out as he put it that we are
giving these defendants a poisoned
chalice and if we ever sip from it we
have to be treated the same way or else
the whole thing is a farce and we should
recognize this is justice but it's not
accidental that our security and
surveillance apparatus is militarized
and and and you're right of course that
there is no broad popular support for
this expanding military adventurism and
yet it's the question is if there is a
serious effort to curtail their power
and their budgets they have mechanisms
and we even heard Nancy Pelosi echo this
in terms of how they play dirty I mean
they have him from they are monitoring
on all of the elected officials as well
on the monitoring but despite everything
it's still a pretty free society and the
recognition by US and British business
back a hundred years ago that they can
no longer control the population by
violence is correct and controlled by of
attitude and opinion is pretty fragile
as is surveillance it's very different
than sending in the stormtroopers no
that's so there's a lot of latitude for
people of relative privilege at least to
do all sorts of things and it's
different if you're a black kid in the
ghetto yeah then you're subjected this
violent but for a large part of the
population there's plenty of
opportunities which have not been
available in the pilot but the majority
or those people are essentially passive
virtually and but they don't have to
they don't have to be what hannah errant
when she writes about the omnipotent
policing that were directed against the
stateless including herself in France
said the problem with building
omnipotent policing which we have done
in our marginal neighborhoods and
targeted people of color or can have
their doors kicked in and stopped at
random and thrown in jail for decades
for crimes they didn't commit is that
when you have a societal upheaval you
already have both illegal and a physical
mechanism by which that omnipotent
policing can be quickly inflicted on the
rest I don't think that's true here I
think the time has passed when that can
be done for increasing parts of the
population those who have almost any
degree of privilege the state may want
to do it but then on the power to do it
they can carry out extensive
surveillance monitoring they can be
violent in against parts of the
population that can't defend themselves
undocumented immigrants that black kids
in the ghetto and so on but even that's
that it can be undercut for example a
lot of the one of the major scandals in
the United States and Reagan is the huge
incarceration program which is a weapon
against it it's a race war but it's
based on drugs and there is finally
cutting away at the source of this and
the criminalization and the radical
distortion of the way criminalization of
the drum uses worked that can have an
effect I mean I think look there's no
doubt that the population is passive
there are lots of ways of keeping them
passive there's lots of ways of
marginalizing and atomizing them but
that's different from storm
troopers is quite different and it can
be overcome has been overcome in the
past and I think there are lots of
potential developing which can be used
to break down this system I think it's a
very fragile system including the
military let's just close with climate
change you like I read climate change
reports which well unfortunately that
made doom us all and not in the
long-distance future that just
overwhelms everything as the first time
in human history when we nore we have
the capacity to destroy the conditions
for decent survival and it's already
happening I'm gonna just take a look at
species destruction a species
destruction now is estimated to be at
about the level of 65 million years ago
when an asteroid hit the earth and ended
the the period of the dinosaurs wiped
out huge numbers of species same level
today and we're the asteroid and if and
you take a look at what's happening in
the world any better looking at this
from outer space that be astonished I
mean there are sectors of the global
population that are trying to impede the
catastrophe there are other sectors that
are trying to accelerate it and you take
a look at who they are those who are
trying to impede it are the ones we call
backward indigenous populations the
First Nations in Canada you know
aboriginals in Australia the tribal
people in India all over the world are
trying to impede it who's accelerating
in the most privileged advanced so
called advanced educated populations in
the world the US and canada right in the
lead and we know why they're all so
here's an interesting case of
manufacturers consent and does it work
you took a look at international polls
on global
forming Americans are who are the most
propaganda has done this of there's huge
propaganda efforts to make it believe
it's not happening there are little
below the norm but to the some effect of
the propaganda its stratified if you
take a look at Republicans their way
below the norm but what's happening in
the Republican Party all won't all
across the spectrum is very striking so
for example about two-thirds of
Republicans believe that there were
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that
and the sorts of other things you know
so so it's it's trad ified but there but
there's some impact of the propaganda
but not overwhelming most of the
population still regards it as a serious
problem that is actually an interesting
article about this in the columbia
journalism review with just a few at
current issue you know the lead critical
review of journalism they attribute this
to what they call the doctrine of
fairness in the media doctrine of
fairness says that if you have an
opinion piece by 95 ninety-seven percent
of the scientists you have to pair it
with an opinion piece by the energy the
corporation's does that be fair balanced
there isn't any such doctrine like if
you have a an opinion piece denouncing
putin as the new Hitler for the nexium
did Crimea you don't have to balance it
with an opinion piece saying that a
hundred years ago the united states took
over southeastern cuba at the point of a
gun and is still holding it though it
has absolutely no justification other
than to try to undermine cuban
development whereas in contrast whatever
you think of food there's reason
have to have that when you have to have
fair and balanced when it affects the
concerns of private power period but try
to get an article in the columbia
journalism review point that out
although it's transparent so all these
things are there but they can be
overcome and they'd better be and let
this isn't unless there's a sharp
reversal in policy unless we hear in the
advance of advanced societies can gain
the consciousness of the indigenous
people of the world we're in deep
trouble our grandchildren are going to
suffer from it and I think you would
agree that's not going to come from the
power elite certainly it's up to us
absolutely and it's urgent it is thank
you very much
