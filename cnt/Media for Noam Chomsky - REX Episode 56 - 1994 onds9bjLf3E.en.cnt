there are also people who lived through
a childhood of immense international
propaganda
now some rock way the iris comedy get
real for me to disregard the camera
thank you sure lots of idiot hi and
thank you for tuning in I'm Jane I'll be
your bartender my name is big I'll dear
editor and Noam Chomsky Noam Chomsky the
yeah it was in town here to speak with
us and while I was here he's also going
to speak to be speaking of the audio on
Torian but he came to see us teach at
MIT work of language plus Vidya positive
psychology large part of my flashes
through it to what's called politics
yeah well I think we should I think we
should introduce the show out here okay
um just because I thought that that what
what happened in the studio was kinda
lame okay so so hello and welcome to J
and B on the rocks i'm jay and on the
bartender of this program yeah and my
name's be i actually edit things and
that's why i'm able to just oh snap my
fingers set and you'll see something
else any any number of bodily noises can
be used to segue to something for
example um well noam chomsky for example
uses the sup this cough of his
had this really thinking three months
really interested in a theory that you
have called the propaganda model and
those wonder if you could explain what
that is yeah I wouldn't actually dignify
it with the native theory that's more
like a truism I can tell if everything
in the social sciences there's what are
sometimes called the agenda-setting
media the ones who set framework but
others are here too and they're the ones
with the big resources if they got beats
and songs and then there's the general
comedians some local newspapers
television and so on through much of
what they do is sort of diversion they
keep people out of trouble no so pay
attention to something that the matter
the agenda-setting media are aimed
especially generals like the computer
console Russian Cozens dawn had sorry
decision-making sectors you know
educated sectors but sometimes for
political class plus so the
agenda-setting meeting kind of set the
framework and that's kind of adheres to
it so the local newspaper whatever it is
doesn't have reporters all over the
world news bureaus and so on and without
looking at it I can he couldn't copy to
predict that it's going to pick up its
decisions as to what's the story of the
day from the web came across on the AP
wire so anyway the there's the
mainstream media there's that Chomsky
talked about the general media and the
agenda-setting media okay the
agenda-setting media kind of up here
right and they set the agenda the
general media is kind of underneath and
they just follow the agenda and then
under that there's the alternative media
kind of is doing their own thing but no
one is really paying too much attention
and then under that is J and B on the
rocks this TV show that you're watching
now not only is no one paying any
attention but even we don't know what
we're talking about
difference between this program in the
New York good but if we remind me by my
hair you know they're kind of relatively
insignificant compared right exec turn
their influence they are huge
corporations parts of even bigger ones
very profitable with they like other
corporations they have a product in the
market the market is other businesses
Bingley advertising exec MTG going the
product is audiences and in their case
fairly privileged audiences I like to
show you something I think Jane has
sitting over there this is an ad from
broadcast TV which is a it's a magazine
which is selling TV shows two different
stations trying to get them to make it
up and it was really one of the moment
that this is a particular show called
time to generate which is targeted to
Generation X that's why the X is so big
and I see in the next generation and I
would call your attention especially to
where is it the other the 18 to 34
demographic that advertisers advertisers
are I yeah that seems strange when I
when I let that I mean how can uh that's
exactly right I mean how can you buy a
demographic will you by people I mean
what the media cell is audiences that's
their product an advertiser's right
that's exactly the correct description
okay but if that almost makes it sound
like they're not there and paying they
only they're paying the producer for the
product so like if you're whoever
whatever under what personnel militates
a television somebody's producing it
they've got a product mean the the
product that they're in fact color that
they're actually making a signal but
what they're selling to the advertiser
is notice it too there's knowing the
Watchers yeah for another showing the
audience to the advertisers who are
buying the audience and effect than
paying the guy who produced its own
advertising fees so they're from
knowledge is quite accurate yeah that
seems like a very simple common sense of
thing but I think that most most people
don't see them as add the shop clean
well I mean what Technic sake tell me I
mean the guys who CBS doesn't make any
money when you turn the tumor an ATM and
what they get ready for them is if
somebody's giving any advertising
revenue so the propaganda model simply
suggest it's the purpose of the name is
that the media product should reflect
its institutional nature that is in
should reflect expect it to reflect the
interests and concerns of the business
community for everything businesses so
government which is closely linked to
the corporate interests than the other
powers interview it's not about a deep
profound philosophical conversation it's
just about fun it's about relationships
so what about this Noam Chomsky guy um
he's a character hey Jenny Beasley hey
why don't you transition for us into
this next scene okay relationships what
relationships for example our
relationship to you the camera operator
Chris merit in fact if you turn the
camera around Chris you'll be able to
see yourself see yourself you want to in
the letter there you go well sorry I'm
right here I'm the camera guy right now
yeah having a great time yeah and
they're really the necessary illusions
are everywhere just look around you and
wonder what could have been if it wasn't
this way right now necessary illusions
this is something that tough Noam
Chomsky talks about a lot I'm not sure
if you mentioned it really in our
interview but I think maybe I did
accidentally so what I wasn't there are
certain necessary illusions that
government or the ruling class and must
maintain in the minds of the people in
order to continue fucking them up the
ass as they did yeah like the illusion
that the American government has any
reason to be the only government for
example and you know there's been an
increasing federalization of of our
government there's less local control
these days than there than there has
been in the past and as a result people
are are under the control of a distant
ruling class in Washington DC that has
very little to do with them it's
important for people not to think about
that well I've talked about welfare show
you a big problem deficit too much money
good you know love it is diffusion
hundred children and so low there's
another home welfare systems over your
top spec look at the that's the the
fiscal measures which essentially give
you tack box or tax deductions were
various expenditures so it's a home
mortgage bubble to get tax deductions or
business expenses you think
except work sure charitable expenditures
the whole dancer stuff which are our
fiscal measures reduce your taxes well
that's the exact equivalent of welfare
payments exact equivalent but it's no
difference if you know if you take a
hundred dollars if a guy doesn't pay
under dollars in taxes that's exactly
the same as making me pay everything
Union one hundred dollars come home and
safe but so there's a huge welfare state
sometimes called the hidden oil fair
state goes over willingly to the welcome
you always have to think about is the
mother with dependent children you're
not supposed to think about the
executive who's jerking you off in the
other things a lot of fashion all that's
the same kind of thing except for the
welfare state for the rich is much more
expensive it takes AAA the help thing
the other thing is you oh you know
there's one very striking property of
the all plans are being considered to
striking Gregory's Clinton Cooper
unveils what is and this is being
discussed reserves that the vespa firing
in the hands of huge insurance companies
and the other is that the the other
factor which nobody talks about visit
their radically regressive so if you
haven't said tax based system like
Canada it as progressive as the taxes to
this you know the richer you are more
you pay all of these systems are
regressive know you're the sheriff or
the general motors and you and the
secretary and the janitor all the effect
pays any milk for health care in fact
it's even worse than that with that
sucker this is it everybody paid a lot
of taxes oh well you know as a tax
system of a down
but this time it is Memphis try for the
word about it yeah well saves our story
don't want people to think about the
things that matter to them and their
couple of ways of doing that what is the
common morality play is about figure
skating or to watch the Super Bowl or
something other just divert them it's
one way the other way is to shake the
discussion and presentation of issues of
people so see there has been a very
significant indoctrination campaign
since the pit on walks up to 60 number
the 60s were a period of sort of freaked
out of control they scared me well this
is a periodic thing in American history
it was letting move know everything
there has been public permit there has
been a major to drive people back into
their whole Rhino the 60s begin to
permit developed again and then came the
inevitable effort to repress and it's
diff my success so there's much more I
think probably the activist murders in
Grove 626 pieces there was an article
that I read somewhere recently interview
with you where you argued that the Gulf
War was in a sense of success for the
peace movement why did you say well its
first time in history that i know of
that there were huge demonstrations
against the war before the war broke out
and comparative did known in the case of
the Gulf War it was before the bottom
that's never happy
we kind of wanted to shift gears and
talk a little bit about the drug war
which is in essence a war of the
government against its own people why is
this more being what agent I think it
was one of the techniques of social
control it was the drug war that Bush
launched in 1989 it was not the first
several that if you look at them they're
always I think they're always time with
relation to issues of social control so
take the nineteen eighty million won
because of some new crisis and try to
sell on the contrary among in fact
hardcore music and declining and part of
the reason why they could launch the
drug war and expect favorable results
was that if the tendencies continued
that it will say two years later well
you would figure see what great things
we do there was no new crisis and that
he 89 but there was there was another
crisis mainly the suddenly name is
collapsing now the major technique of
social control for a long time since the
First World War and then your Congress
it coming well thing I'm getting very
hard to say Bush's speech when elting
the drug war always offended and at the
time of his speech titanium studies
showed that drugs were concerned or
drugs way down you know if you looked at
the
look at the range of issues is quite low
in about two or three weeks did it zoom
to learn power level rostami measures
undertaken to the drug where had nothing
to do with reducing drugs trying to
produce drugs which would go after is
first of all tobacco and second of all
alcohol which is the biggest killers by
a long shot takes a marijuana and no
crack well if marijuana was there is the
main target of the drug war you know
repression and it's but it's I'm sure
it's not good for you but it's not
terribly wrong I don't think there's a
single overdose the left rent tens of
millions of users then why is black owe
me go and there are a lot of healing
that are much more horrible anybody's
guess is that tobacco is a basically
industrial crop evening money on a
friend whereas know why we're in a
backyard that he's going to make anybody
on the other hand we need will you knock
out the less harmful drugs like
marijuana beach track people through
more harmful ones to the industrial
product you know the opt you really want
to stop drug the over charcoal drug
industry those maybe the target is
crippled banks which are doing money
longer and then just you know the
chemical corporations from Inuits
chemical corporations that bas plan
ownership shipping through Latin America
chemicals weigh in excess of any
industrial gutes then exactly the
chemical to go in the drug pradesh mmm
wow ok you heard many delta force
operations taking over the executive
suite to portsmouth and you've read a
psychedelic experience yourself very
square ok that must be one of the few
people is never pop ok so we've come out
here to cedar cedar bluff outside of
bloomington because it's such a
beautiful day and you know we're we're
built we were all taking the day off
we've decided to say fuck it to our jobs
and drink some beer on cedar bluff
because you know it's important to have
daily acts of rebellion in your life I
think chomsky kind of implied that and
and so do we every day well actually
today's Saturday and I don't work on
Saturdays and Joe doesn't have a job I
don't have a job actually I'm unemployed
so but I'm repellent what a rebel
unemployment what rebels we all are yeah
yeah Cedar Bluff one of nature's many
wonders here in Indiana you see it there
behind me what this Bluff is this are we
in the bluff no no we're headed towards
the bluff we're in the bluff area now
how did they decide to call it Cedar
Bluff Oh probably from the cedar trees
really I don't see any so who was gonna
governor use the fellow came the Sun is
back cool Wow must be sprinkle enough
yeah you can see it's very bright well
that was true i can open your eyes it's
almost intoxicating yeah this look at
this Wonderland back dark is less you
look with the light sir we look
backwards
wow yeah yeah so that's kind of our
roles really in this in this program
here yours and B and me and all these
other people that were hanging out with
they're just so long it's kind of God
people along through this otherwise
incomprehensible mess oh it's very
comfortable oh that yeah but not if
you've been drinking Terry the boot
against the man carry the boots against
the man carry the boot against the man
Carrie Carrie the boot Terry the boot
carry the Terry look at this way cool I
think oh yeah man fuck the revolutionary
songs look at this instant gratification
J&B on the rocks J&B it the bluffs cedar
bluff in fact here in outside of
Bloomington it's on the southwest side
of bloomington it's a really cool place
to come and it's a lovely day here in
southern Indiana so what about this Noam
Chomsky guy um he's a character in the
film manufacturing consent you say this
is a quote an attack on the fundamental
structure of state capitalism is an
order why do you believe this and how in
such an attack why do I believe I think
it's a familiar with state capitalism
it's an authoritarian system with
absolutist institutions that are immune
to public control and I think that's
wrong I think that every institution
should be under public democratic
control and that includes the centroid
expectation to society
furthermore if these corporations of
fascist see resistant basically I mean
you can give up the structure of power
within it strictly top though if you're
outside you can get yourself to it or
not no star but I forget anything
nothing to say I got to get not part of
it you can do nothing though it's cure
absolutism that's where idea traditional
classical liberals were opposed
corporation enjoyed stock companies are
denounced by Adam Smith and Thomas
Jefferson who liberalism idea beginnings
of the modern corporate system was
appalled by it because these are just
absolutely system power they were given
their power by courts that we were voted
for so there was a change in the legal
structure in the 19th century which
vested more and more power and far any
other supremacy in these systems of
absolute power either you give in and
it's located you know those guys will
run my life from home our life will
decline which is what's happened or what
glopping we're doing is you join some
fanatic cult neo-nazis are the most
religious or something it's kind of in
irrational but understandable asking for
you try to move towards really radical
change of assistance of a freshman
there's no magic formula other you have
you have to begin with the self
education which usually means working
with others as you know no individual
city loans
where figure out what's going on you
know the resources of the time your
nails so it requires organization
education political action if you can
get the right scale listen Evelyn if
your presence directors that's been done
successfully in some areas minutes they
further there's been an attacker and
lots of structures of accommodation Oh
Charlie from the feminist group or the
gay and lesbian movement or the civil
rights movement multiple cultural
movements or primitive our mental
movements which are essentially
protecting the rights of future
generations right but they never got to
the core which is the system of control
over production
distribution you know investment is a
capital is that true I take it to the
core these other tendencies are just go
continues do you have a favorite mixed
drink big stream I like liver would
straighten okay from the profound to the
stupid so in better breath oh my god
it's the tree man with this big scary
eyes mm-hmm what Jenny Beasley will save
me she has come to save me from the tree
man and well I just feel very happy
about that it's just so soft and reading
look at that and I can't remember if I
heard it when I was young or if it's
true that the women used to use this is
maxi pads and I was thinking it sure
would be soft but what about the bug
dogs use it to but I've got a bigger
stick
as I sit here in my little nature's
hippie cushion or what have you hey
what's that in your hand you've got a
lens for you oh thanks it's my favorite
yeah Oh put it over to the lens and
we'll see what it does okay oh look at
you you know I could give chomsky sat in
this thing his audience were up in the
bluff maybe he'd have more success but
you'd have to be reclining well we were
thinking it'd be nice if Bloomington was
able to free itself from some of the
bullshit you know that that exists in
our society in other words if
Bloomington were able to become
independent from all the things that
we've been talking about and for that
reason we wanted to found something I
don't know exactly what it would be
maybe we call it the Bloomington
independence network which would just be
a oh I don't know some kind of loose
touchstone a place for people to make
contact with one another as they as they
work to establish the necessary
organizations that would allow us to
achieve independence as a community and
break free from the rigid capitalist
bullshit yeah as jay says the rigid
capitalist bullshit the yeah yeah you
know the stuff that we consume the stuff
that we need is produced largely in
places that are far far away from
Bloomington well why not have it happen
here just a thought if you're interested
in something like that write to us at
the address that you're seeing on your
screen and if you are doing something
anything really that has some kind of
bearing if you're working in some way to
make Bloomington independent then we'll
gladly give you some kind of media
coverage so that other people can know
what's going on perhaps become involved
or who knows what let's we just like to
try to explore the potential that exists
here in access television or whatever it
is actually that you're watching
you
you
so noam chomsky who the fuck is that you
may be wondering well he's this guy he's
written a bunch of books one of them was
called necessary illusions another one
was called what manufacturing consent
there was a movie actually there was in
the rider festival which comes through
bloomington sometimes called
manufacturing consent Noam Chomsky and
the media and it was about him and
actually we found something interesting
out about that movie and Noam Chomsky
Noam Chomsky is in fact never seen that
movie and we asked him about that and I
didn't review for me but gives pressure
I mean you're a comedian talks over the
world I mean looks at it I'm doing to
not react other people forms it's the
same usual fraud
I know they try to become aware that's
in here just kidding they take somebody
else's
it's your plan
you
you
