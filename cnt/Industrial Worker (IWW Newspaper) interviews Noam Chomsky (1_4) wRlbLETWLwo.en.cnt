oh he says epidermal divider gone I
would like to start you basically
talking about the economic crisis and
how we as workers can I recently writer
he's quite simple Boston review and in a
piece you stated that the financial
crisis will presumably be patched up
somehow leaving the institutions that
created the promotion place um while
thinking about this I came to understand
that working people in the u.s. and
North America and Europe basically are
not are not really being helped by the
Bell so so much I'm they're being helped
stimulus with the stimulus and the
bailout are two different things and not
enough by the systemics is much too
small should be much larger that's why
they're you know can be an unemployed
but the you know the policies are not
made to reduce unemployment they're made
to help banks and all know that there
has been a recent upsurge of i would say
of milton industrial action on in
workplaces program throughout your
apostle north america
fuel in North America as you know
republic with his adores factory model
that was the first half your occupation
of the reasons 1930s maybe no not quite
with the Youngstown steel that was an
occupation in 1979 I think and actually
that's I think I mentioned that in the
article it's a model that really should
be pursued now they went on from to try
to have the workforce in the community
take over the fact that he abandoned
factories the US Steel was dismantling
and they that effort was led pretty much
legal effort that followed was led by
stalking lend radical labor lawyer and I
went up the courts and they were they
didn't win in the courts but they could
have won and if they could have won it
would have been with enough support
which they didn't have that it could
have meant a lot in fact same thing to
be done right now republic windows the
corporation saw what was coming and sold
it off which is pretty normal but it
ought to be done right now on the in the
auto industry for example there's no
reason why other than weakness and lack
of kind of conception of how to proceed
there's no other reason why the
workforce and the communities and say
detroit and flint and so on can't take
over these installations that General
Motors is dismantling selling off and
convert them take some assistance but
nothing like what the the bailout of the
bank's convert them to say producing a
high-speed rail instead what's happening
I may have mentioned that in the Arctic
recall is that the Obama administration
is using federal stimulus money to try
to get Spain and France to produce high
speed rail for the United States which
badly needs it but not the installations
that are being dismantled presumably
those policies are more profitable for
the banks and other financial
institutions but that's a perfect
opportunity for the workforce and the
communities to simply proceed to do what
they were trying to do in Youngstown and
a little bit in Republic and that is
take over the factories put them under
worker self-management produce what the
country needs badly needs like
high-speed rail for example or green
technology but i feel that philosophy
what they're doing or they're sort of
aiming for these these parochial games
without thinking warner long term in
terms of how they can work move towards
work yourself matters yeah that's what
the idea that we should be doing
providing that spark you're right it's
reactive but the same was true the
sit-down strikes in the 30s i mean the
reason the sit-down strikes struct such
fear in the hearts of management was
that they know that a sit-down strike is
just one step short of taking over the
factory and running it and that's the
end
