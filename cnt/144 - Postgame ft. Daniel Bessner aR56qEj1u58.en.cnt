[Music]
over to the postgame I'm Michael Brooks
reminds of course by the great crew that
make it all possible each and every one
of you welcome new patrons in a little
bit
Daniel best nur is gonna be joining us
for one of his postgame segments where
we're going to be talking about pop
culture Hollywood video games and police
and Pentagon propaganda pulled a great
great clip that the great great Ana
Kasparian used and commented on in her
commentary this past Saturday for the
Jacobin show weekends with Ana and
Michael which you haven't yet make sure
you subscribe to it we're doing out
there you go
and I'm really excited about Shama
sawant tour a read big wise and john
nichols last for guests so but first we
have about another good chunk of this
noam chomsky interview so we're gonna
play that and then we'll come back and
finish out the rest of the postgame here
is the ongoing interview with Noam
Chomsky
you know could I just could we I want it
I just really want to ask you about the
election professor Chomsky but could you
take a couple of extra minutes and I
just cuz I think what you're saying is
extremely important and sometimes in the
popular conversation things
unfortunately get a bit I don't know
what the what the right way to frame it
is but if if we have an understanding
that America is you know is deeply
corrupt has profound institutional
problems that the structure of
capitalism produces all of these these
outcomes in contrast would say a kind of
mainstream Democratic Party MSNBC
narrative that sort of says a you know
Trump created all of the problems Under
the Sun and everything else now this is
something that particularly younger
people and definitely people in this
audience are going to be very familiar
with this critique in this understanding
and it's a correct one but I also fear
and I really appreciate that you just
highlighted that and I'm wondering if
you could just take a few extra minutes
to explain that even as that is true
structurally that what Donald Trump is
doing institutionally actually is unique
and does matter on its own terms quite
apart from the sort of evasions of the
Democratic Party and the kind of
mainstream liberal establishment well
Trump is actually this sounds strong but
it's proved he is the worst criminal in
human history undeniably there has never
been a figure in political history who
was dedicated with passion to destroying
the prospects for organized human life
women births in the near future that is
not an exaggeration people are focused
now on the protest moment endemic there
go bad no the pandemic is serious enough
we will emerge from that terrible cost
the cost is greatly amplified by the
gangster in the White House and still
tenders of those
Americans will be very making this the
worst place in the world in this box be
but we will emerge we're not going to
emerge from another crime with trumpets
committee the heating of the globe
global meeting global bursting which was
coming we're not going to emerge from
that both each said it's a very serious
business the ice sheets melt things are
not going to recover but leads to
exponential increase global warming had
already glaciers are melting could flood
the world recent studies indicate that
on the present course in about 50 years
much of the Hobbit or part of the world
will be on live in South Asian watch the
Middle East
watching the united states sea level
we're approaching the point of 125,000
years ago see those 25 years later than
thing right now it's worse than that
recent star anybody on the top Siam the
climate scientists concluded that the
scripts oceanographic needs to just
which monitors particles in the universe
that could Co to Florida season yeah the
mainland
I just can't know the studies showing
live of course and he's steady increase
and escalating increase and they
estimated they were coming along
honestly close to a point three three
million years ago when sea levels were
50 80 feet higher than they are today
all around the world countries are
trying to do something about some pretty
much would be something there's one
country which is led by a president who
wants to escalate the crisis
to erase the litany of this to
maximizing use of fossil fuels including
the most dangerous of them and the
dismantle of regulatory apparatus that
limits your in fact there is no crime
like this in human history okay
nothing this is a unique individual
that's not know what he's doing of
course it does so when it comes time to
when his golf course and fireman he's
threatened by rising sea levels
he whoever manages things warm those
enough to petition the government of
Ireland to build a seawall because of
rising sea vote yes he doesn't care you
can pour more profit into the pockets of
his rich constituents and tomorrow than
him as well who cares of the world
disappearing a couple of generations
making those elections in the first
minute sir I should say that as far as
the government is concerned you seen
something pretty interesting
the parliamentary democracy has been
around for 350 years started named one
1689
and so-called Glorious Revolution when
sovereignty was transferred from the
loyalty to the four of them
beginnings of parliamentary democracy
the United States naturally it's not
electric democracy's not just based on
laws and constitutions in fact the
British constitution is maybe a dozen
words it's based on trust and good faith
the assumption that people will act like
human means so take Richard Nixon great
rotten be going but when the time came
he had to leave office he left office
quietly
nobody's expected that he's drunk he
doesn't act like a human being so
somewhere else
call it what suddenly the psychiatrist
say
his but it's plain what's there and what
he has done is crush the the executive
offices correctly destroyed if it only
make appointments that can be confirmed
by the Senate
why bother no just make a point I don't
like somebody alone now
one Republican Museum of cuffs dares to
raise a small question about his
nobility came down like a ton of bricks
I'm gonna destroy you or develop myself
destroy me it's not fascism it's what I
said before tin pot dictator of some
small Neil :
with f.cuz of a couple of years that's
[Music]
we're concerned about vaccines okay it
was a sign chief scientist in charge of
vaccine production needed to raise some
questions what one of trumps quack
medicine helped it's the executive
branch's nullified Congress the Senate
happens to be in the hands of soulmate
if his Mitch McConnell in many ways the
real evil genius of this administration
dedicated to destroying democracy long
before Trump when Obama was elected to
join McConnell said open publicly
my main goal is to ensure they though I
can achieve nothing okay
that same I want to destroy
parliamentary democracy which is based
as I said one good faith and trust in
Turkey but it's me the Senate is no
so-called world's greatest deliberative
body to reduce two things passing the
legislation will enrich the very rich
empower the corporate sector and massive
Judicial Appointments to stack the
judiciary with young ultra-right mostly
incompetent justices who can ensure for
a generation that no matter what the
public wants they'll be able to block it
this is and it's kind of like the
Republican effort to suppress the keep
people from voting all the rest I mean
it's a deeply deep hatred of democracy
and fear of democracy that's not unusual
among the elites they don't like
democracy for obvious reasons but this
is something special as I say 350 years
of parliamentary experience they're
really being put to the test that's on
top of the pandemic top of the the
global warming crisis crisis of nuclear
weapons which is equally severe Trump is
dismantling the entire arms control
regime greatly increasing the threat of
destruction to us virtually inviting
adversaries to develop weapons that
could destroy us can't stop I mean but
of course you know with great euphoria
in military industry they love it
getting huge contracts what's wrong I
mean it's a unique position but when but
you said as you say it's not just trunk
its trunk taking the worst aspects of
the capitalist and particularly a
neoliberal version of capitalism and an
amplifying them but you can see it in
let's just take the pandemic
why is there a pandemic in 2003 after
the SARS epidemic which was a corona
virus it was well understood by
scientists and they were saying
another coronavirus much more serious
than this is very likely I hear the
steps we have to take to prepare for
somebody has to take the steps well
there is a pharmaceutical industry
extraordinarily wealthy huge huge loves
can't do it capitalism you don't spend
money on something that might be
important ten years from now from
stopping a future catastrophe it's not
profitable we'll do what we can sell
tomorrow so that's the capitalist crisis
they are out what about government they
have the resources they have great labs
but then comes something like called
Ronald Reagan at the beginning of the
neoliberal assault on the population
government is the problem not the
solution meaning we have to take
decisions away from government which has
a serious flaw it's influenced by people
now we have to put them in the hands of
unaccountable private institutions which
have no influence from the public then
everything will be great
in the United States that sometimes
called libertarianism interesting
concept but just get it out of any
public influence just for the rich and
powerful that's the beginning of the
neoliberal salt and the in fact at the
same time they both know just the girls
the advisers knew what they were doing
first step destroy unions first step for
both because they're the bases main
bases for public response so we can get
rid of them you've enhanced the
destruction of democracy and the
transfer of power to the very few money
don't have to go through the details and
is what happens news but private and the
big pharma was out capitalism governors
Alan neoliberalism nevertheless the
government could do something
the first Bush H double knot established
a presidential scientific advisory
council for Obama called it into office
quickly the first day of his
administration asked them to prepare a
pandemic the morning reaction system a
couple weeks later that came back with
the system was put in place January 2017
the retro comes into office first days
of his administration dismantle the
whole system to respond to that belly
started defunding the Center for Disease
Control every health related aspect of
government year after year eliminated
programs of American scientists in China
working with side Chinese scientists to
identify potential coronavirus throats
throw it out so when it finally hit
United States was uniquely unprepared
thanks to the record and then it got
worse used to react to it other
countries responded some of them very
well for it quickly almost got thrown
largely under control not the United
States didn't care for months US
intelligence couldn't get to the White
House to say this is a serious crisis
and finally according to reports he
noticed that the stock market was
declining I'm like that so I have to do
something what he's done since it's just
chaos the United States but again a
large part of the problem is pre Trump
so why aren't the horse and hospitals
ready well they run on a business model
that's neoliberalism you have to be just
on time delivery you don't want to lose
the scent so we don't have an extra
hospital bed we have to make sure the
owners of the private only CEOs the
private hospitals get to millions of
dollars a year in compensation
have an extra bed which would cut into
that so everything's paired of the bone
the nursing homes which are privately
owned are reduced to minimal functioning
because we can make more money that way
if we're a private equity corporation
that arms them now we can contribute to
Trump's campaign so you can have a photo
op with us telling us I'm wonderful you
are for destroying the nursing homes
killing all the elderly people now
that's what we're living with so yes it
goes deep into issues well before Trump
but he's a unique phenomenon again the
worst criminal in human history some of
his minor crimes are to destroy American
democracy and to create a Penta amplify
epidemic just killing tens of thousands
of people because of him but those are
minor crimes by his standards you should
recognize we're living in a unique
moment of human history very striking
everything's coming together I'm afraid
I professor Chomsky I think you you
answered the question about voting as we
say strategically in this election I
think you outlined the reasons they're
extremely clearly and I remember
President Trump saying when you cut the
pandemic office he said I don't like to
waste money anyways professor Chomsky
thank you very very much for doing this
and we wish you all the best and stay
stay safe thank you thank you
folks hey folks proud of that one yeah
yeah and I will say I mean you know
maybe whatever I think the superlative
he use I I actually think it's I think
one of the most interesting things
rhetorically about Chomsky's that he's
in a way so you know very much in like
the not appealing to like rhetoric or
emotion tradition but then he will
actually you know quite consciously and
absolutely honestly choose to say like
yeah if Donald Trump was the greatest
criminal in human history and I'll
explain you precisely why I will say but
I don't want to get lost in the
particularity of that one-frame I agree
with him overall about his analysis of
Trump and I think the ability to
synthesize those two positions
essentially of there's a context for
Trump Trump is not in a vacuum obviously
most of the responses to Trump reflect
the broader problem probably actually
more institutionally idealistic than we
are but some of that is just
generational I think but at the end of
the day his ability to synthesize
systems with the unique threat of Trump
I think is unparalleled and absolutely
correct and I'm really happy that he
articulated it on this show so and and
he seems you know he seemed to be
enjoying himself yeah I hope so I hope
he was and I should say next week I'm
actually really excited we're having
William shocky from Africa is a country
which is a great leftist website a
serious analysis and he's talking
actually about policing persisting after
the liberation so there's so many
parallels between apartheid South Africa
and the United States and you know it
remains decades into liberation and
antsy governance enormous levels of
police violence and brutality even
including how they've been enforcing
the lockdown in South Africa so we're
gonna talk about race and class and
police you not ignore the class and
capitalist dimension at all in South
Africa is in some respects the
horrifying example this and then Ronin
Burtenshaw is returning and we're doing
a review of the last ten years what do
we learn from Bernie Corbin a demos
cereza and the strategy for what's next
and then Bill Fletcher jr. will return
for the final show of the month and then
in the first show of July Stavros from
come town
stop e stop
Daniel bessner are you there yes sir
okay Daniel bessner is joining us mr.
framing this content we was either gonna
be like book reading with best nur mat
has coined bullshitting with best there
and she's like BSN with Esther yes yeah
yes who's best them better and I and
best nur of us have had some great BS
sessions so Daniel this is gonna be is
sort of like yeah informal history BS
and with best nur we're gonna talk about
a little bit of a lesson of the
relationship between Hollywood the
Pentagon and the militarization of
policing and I actually really want to
start by playing this clip I really
strongly recommend everybody watch the
full segment that Ana Kasparian that is
just excellent on our Jacobin show
weekends with Ana and Michael which of
course everybody should subscribe to and
watch in general but this commentary she
did this last week on militarism and
policing was just brilliant and she also
dug up this ad that as soon as I saw I
knew I had to play for best marine even
regardless of whether we were doing a
segment or not this is just mana of
content here for best there and and the
relationship I mean in this video game
add between
you know police militarization racism
valorizing the police and just sort of
general American violence so let's let's
play this clip and then we'll get to the
bigger history to lesson here it was
glorified really in all sorts of
propaganda including in video games so
there's one video game known as police
quest and I just want to show you what
the commercials look like me the men and
women who risk their lives daily in the
most violent city in the nation LA's
SWAT specialist organization and that's
what we do most the time we use all of
our tactics and all of our training to
resolve a situation without hurting
anyone but sometimes there's no way
around that and when that happens it's
just a suspect that decides the way it's
going
danger daring adventures police quest
five LAPD SWAT and by the way I'm Jacobi
so at any rate yes and and again I'll
just encourage again I mean that's just
a fantastic commentary that Anna did
there and you know she fit that in well
as well as some very great and revealing
footage of Daryl gates who was involved
in the creation of Swat as the head of
LAPD but a better reaction to that and
then just take us out here because the
relationship between the video game
industry the movie industry television
and I mean we know very specifically
with regards to the Pentagon the
intelligence agencies there's literally
liaison offices like that's that's very
strongly established even bragged about
some respect but we include also you
know policing as well we could really I
think in a kind of loose way say the
entire entertainment and the American
national security state apparatus
foreign and domestic yes so I think this
is something that's been going on for a
long time of course you know very
famously there have been cop radio
programs in the 20s and 30s the cop
shows in the 40s and the 50s and
everything like that so this is not a
new relationship between the domestic
apparatus of violence and pop culture um
but I do think that that in the last
twenty or thirty years it's become
pretty clear that in a in a world of
different genre forms on television that
that the police procedure on the police
show has clearly taken off and it's
funny that Ana showed that old ad that
must have been from the late late 90s of
police caught ladies actually are you
sure because I'm pretty sure police
quest for was like 93 okay 993 sounds
about right
yeah so I remember the game one of the
first games I played was police quest
for and whose
aldair Olaf gates presents police quest
for which is actually in the wake of the
LA riots I believe which Gates was
forced to resign soon thereafter I
believe relatively soon and so he had a
real big influence on sort of how people
understood policing in the United States
because of his influence in pop culture
and so what does this mean so of course
as everyone knows listening for this
after the end of the Cold War the United
States emerged as this great superpower
and it is searching for a logic right
and one of the logics for world
governance that it needs to affirm is
that it's not a broken society right and
so there's this enormous tough-on-crime
rhetoric that emerges in the late 1980s
in the early 1990s with the collapse of
the Soviet Union and the rise of the
Cold War and I think have you seen that
documentary on la 92 it's a National
Geographic documentary yeah so it starts
with george w bush's invasion of kuwait
I mean invasion using the Gulf War one
to prevent to propel Saddam Hussein's
invasion from Kuwait and then it just
opposes that with the Rodney King
beating right so there's this this
important moment in American history
where decision makers are rear tick you
lating what they want their citizens
relationship to violence to be in the
project of this larger global program to
persuade people that the United States
is a just society particularly to people
of color which is why for example and
then I'll stop talking through the
biggest exports of the 1990s in terms of
American pop culture Michael Jordan and
Michael Jackson right so there's this
turn to American multiculturalism that
is this post Cold War project related to
the increasing militarization of
American police and the subjugation of
domestic dissent so it's always the
relay know and so and how does this
relate then to like it's just that like
basically even I think actually Thaddeus
Russell made this point to me that he
was saying like you know even relative
to the 80s which we think of as like
this
revanche of this you know revanche it is
reactionary time and it was mean Ronald
Reagan literally announces his candidacy
talking about states rights in
Philadelphia Mississippi as you know as
no Chomsky pointed out where you know
the only national profile it had was
literally because that's where Chaney
Schwerner Goodman were murdered going
and doing civil rights work but even
then and you can check this out you know
just that going through kind of you know
basic pop culture rabbit hole like yeah
it wasn't like there was a lot of pop
products where you know like the whole
Police Department was rotten or you know
the entire Pentagon was bad but even
then as at that point out there was a
lot more willingness it seemed like for
like okay yes but there is like this
group of generals that's really evil or
you know or even just in the 70s I mean
that this is actually one of the great
movies ever made I mean you know Serpico
was made into a movie and that is true
that like his whistleblowing revealed
something I can I think literally half
of the NYPD if not more being involved
in everything from violence brutality to
like systemic corruption we don't really
see that at all I mean I'm thinking even
like in 2007 iron man sort of critiques
private military contractors while
disaggregating that from the Pentagon
entirely as if like the Pentagon is just
this noble you know I mean maybe not
that observant thing because these evil
arms contractors are hustling it but
still you know that's completely out of
the equation in terms of the systemic
police or Pentagon critique
last thing I'll say real quick I was
watching the other day I watched a
little bit of charniak 21 Jump Street
remake with a with a god I'm completely
spacing their name's Jonah Hill and
Channing Tatum exactly and I mean their
their stuff in the first 20 minutes of
like you know they're at a park and
they're bored with their profile so
they're like
you know they're like threatening to
kill people there you know the fact that
they don't read someone's Miranda rights
like you know it's it's it's actually
ruins their case but it's just plain as
a joke this is also like when he's you
know anyway anyways you're watching this
and you're actually like if you you know
particularly in this moment but really
at any moment you're aware of like the
murders obviously that we're talking
about this you know petrifying that was
just sort of played for a laugh I mean
it's it's not satire it's not like you
know poking fun at the institution it's
just like it's funny yeah so I think
that's a really interesting point and
and in some sense the American
ideological tapestry is incredibly
complex right so this country has
traditions of both anti state force anti
state authority and Pro State Force and
pro state authority and you could point
to you know radical traditions going
back to Thomas Paine to Hamilton and
different different approaches to the
issue of essentially organized state
violence in relation to its citizenry so
these ebb and flow over time and of
course is sure many people already
listening know in material on the ground
basically modern police forces are
relics of the post-civil war era in the
south the police the freedmen and in the
north to police essentially labor
militancy so that sort of material
reality interacts at various moments
with this the ideological strands I'm
talking about so then the real question
that I think we need to ask ourselves is
what changed in the 90s in the 2000s in
the 2010s that got rid of that implicit
critique in in in Serpico that's that's
the one that I was thinking of but I
think in a lot of movies like take for
example the Godfather one of the bad
guys is McCluskey right the Irish a cop
in some tears there's a recognition that
state authority can be can be corrupt
that is not as relevant today so I think
so funny in the book in The Godfather
book that the cop that defends Michael
Corleone from McCluskey when McCluskey's
being an absolute just out-of-control
asshole at the at the hospital when he's
trying to pull security off of off of
the dawn in the
book McCluskey's like second-in-command
is defending Michael Corleone and what's
great is that it's it's not because like
he's a good cop it's because he's like a
Corleone II cop so it's just like
competing payrolls yeah the book is kind
of considered a trash classic but it's a
classic it's fun to read does its stands
on the movie in a big way but so so um
so then the so what we could trace then
or we could at least I didn't defy a
shift from let's say 60 seventies
anti-authoritarianism to a B's 90s 2000s
and after Pro authoritarianism so I
think and I think this would actually
bring us back to the Chomsky in
conversation when he was talking about
like what is unique about Trump blah
blah blah um I think it ultimately has
to do with the the the rise to power and
authority of the baby boom generation
and the transformation of that
generations politics over time and I
just mean that in a pure not
generational warfare sense but in a pure
material sense the baby boomers were
such an enormous generation that they
literally took over massive cultural
industries in the 60s and the 70s and
basically remained dominant in those
industries from back then until today so
I would say my inclination would be to
examine that shift over time and I would
say two things one the collapse of any
totalitarian challenger made Americans
less reticent about state power because
in the crucial aspect of cold war-era
propaganda and Nazi anti-nazi propaganda
of course was that they had groups like
the Gestapo or the KGB and the Stasi in
East Germany and so I think that sort of
getting rid of that threats also
inspired a more authoritarian politics
here um and then also I think a general
valorisation of violence and a belief
that the United States could control
destiny can good control history which
express was expressed internationally
with sort of the post-war
nation-building projects and rules
respect um was reflected domestically
with things like welfare reform and
prison reform and things like that which
were essentially social scientific
interventions into the social scientific
interventions into the the the world and
so
I think there's a lot to link these
things that we have to locate the change
at the level of sort of reactors
themselves last week on the majority
report I interviewed Alexandria and
Neeson who has a good piece of Columbia
Journalism Review where she talks about
just that the the oh the relationship
between you know police and the press
and how and and also obviously how
that's you know racialized and the
authority dynamics and how you know as
an example like when laQuan McDonald was
murdered in Chicago in 2015 I want to I
mean that basically you know the police
put out just a completely false
narrative that he was attacking that he
had a lot you know he was he was doing
no such thing he was actually retreating
when that that officer whose name I'm
forgetting who thankfully you know is it
was actually in that case my god
actually charged but of course only
charged after a lawyer basically
unsealed the videotape and the city
which have been covering up this murder
was were forced to reveal the truth and
you know she connected it to this very
potent history of the relationship
between the press and uncritically
accepting police narratives and and so
you know there's obviously there's many
directions to take this and I think it's
another conversation for us to be
interesting parallels between you know
cut the Pentagon cut the police
you know the parallels there Bernie
Sanders has actually put forward a great
piece of legislation of just a 10
percent Pentagon cut that would
immediately get redirected you know
another great example of just very solid
real reform you know not the end goal
but also something that you know no one
else really gonna put on the table but
specifically in the context of this
conversation what would you say even
just like legislatively or I don't know
in terms of exposing for the like in the
broader public conversation like what
can be done about these relationships
between policing the Pentagon and and
culture industries yeah I mean I think a
lot of it could actually come the
problem is it would have to be mostly
for executive action
given the president's unique role as
commander-in-chief of the military if a
synthetic presidents and anti-militarist
president was elected that person would
be able to do things like direct the
military not to consult with various
movie companies or video game companies
Congress could theoretically do things
like make it illegal there's someone who
worked in the Pentagon or worked in some
defense related industry or security
related industry to consult for a number
of years after they were but their jobs
aren't even to make it totally illegal
that's possible I don't think would
happen
um and so basically I do think it would
have to be executive action and there
would have to be essentially the
executive directing the military what to
do
as commit as commander-in-chief and I
think that would probably be a good
thing I think a major issue would be the
fact that she the rise of the mercenary
industry complicates everything because
nominally private contractors consume to
do what they want and I've had to guess
it's probably mostly at this point
people who are private contractors /
consultants doing a lot of that
Consulting so you'd have to really
consider how to classify private
contractors and other groups like that
who kind of stand in a grey zone of law
and you know purposefully for capitalist
interests that's essentially absolutely
well Daniel Bester actually Daniel that
wraps that segment but can you do one or
two more seconds with us do you you got
a little more time alright because I
want to do particularly I want to do a
clip number two this this piece from
Tony Blair the former British prime
minister of course who people don't know
this but Daniel Buster and I are deeply
admire Tony Blair we're just trying to
live - Tony Blair life but no this guy
is actually again you know me he's it to
me he is a fascinating figure and
obviously a grotesque figure and
sinister and so on but I mean actually
maybe you can weave in why he is he is a
fascinating thing I mean he is actually
the
kind of ongoing living reality of the
90s in so many ways but this clip on him
basically saying trying to push forward
and this is something that that you know
even in his own government there was
national ID that that he was pushing
forward aggressively when he was Prime
Minister the UK I believe actually has
more surveillance cameras per capita
than any other place on the planet they
got started in the 90s I believe very
early right and it accelerated I think
you know or maybe even just start in
late 90s under new labor but the next
day I mean one of the things that's so
disturbing about corona is that were on
one hand respect in the United States
were you know sitting in the reality
that we have an administration that's
going to let you know tens of thousands
of people die you know you know a
complete decimation of public health
infrastructure and everything else then
there's this conversation though that's
also gonna be about basically like the
next wave of biopolitics and I wanted to
play this clip of tony blair talking
about digital IDs and corona and then
get your thoughts on it
cuz i think this can this you know this
really can't be situated in a kind of a
cheela bimbe a gob in conversation and
more prosaically there's huge money to
be made here this is tony blair talking
about digital ID i hate the digital ID
today that is much more easily protected
so you can deal with a lot of the
privacy and surveillance issues that
worry people but it's a it's a natural
evolution of the way that we're going to
use technology and anything to transact
daily light and this coded crisis gives
an additional reason for doing that
because look I could be wrong about this
but when I can look at for example how
you restart some businesses how you
restart international travel I think
people's disease status for example have
they been tested what is the result of
that test and have they had the disease
do they have the disease I think unless
you're able to record some of this
in a way that people can use it's going
to be difficult to go back to anything
like a near normal in things like like
like transport so if you're going to
start international travel again how do
you do that unless people can be easily
texted and have some record of that case
Danny thoughts thing so I was going to
say when you're talking about Blair that
I always consider him and Clinton to
really be a duo and that Clinton
represents sort of the meritocratic
charming side of neoliberalism and and
Blair is really like the technocrat and
so um
that little soliloquy was so interesting
he gets like turned on when he starts
talking about his like eyes like I'm
talking about like managing people and
tracking people and he's just the
apotheosis apotheosis the apex of a
certain form of liberal technocracy that
took off in the early 20th century and
with the dreams of Frederick Winslow
Taylor to essentially directly manage
the minutia of everyone's lives and I
think Blair it what excites him is the
fact that that the Ultimates he's the
ultimate twentieth-century manager and
that he truly believes in things like
technology and social science to
discreetly track human behavior and it
was just that that whole discussion just
evinced that to a tee that he's so happy
that the individual you will be able to
finally track and monitor everyone it's
it's funny that you you mentioned a
she'll Bev a and everyone because this
really brings us back to Foucault right
and the sort of Foucault daeun
Foucauldian dream or Foucault argues
that one of the defining features of
modernity is the idea that everyone
could at once be totally trapped and not
know if they're being tracked and
therefore be totally tracked and this is
exactly the realization of that dream
through technology so I think it's very
interesting to examine that there's a
real element of modern liberalism a
really important one yeah and in an
enormous I mean this
is the next area to like of primitive
accumulation basically of a basic
accumulation you can you know there's
there's the artificial scarcity of
basically creating markets just fake
markets through technology like a
technology could be unlocked could be
open source but instead will do the most
regimented IP programs on it and turn it
into something that you can essentially
rent you know the kind of like the
feudal Silicon Valley model and then
there is the last remnants in the
ecological crisis basically
bioprospecting places like the Amazon
for pharma and things like that and then
there is the interior in the the feel
like internal bio of the body and I and
I want people to actually especially
also though because if you don't have
this either innate deep concern about
civil liberties from both public and
private institutions which you should or
you don't have the kind of intellectual
infrastructure it sounds totally common
sensible like of course we need to track
and see like we're in the middle of
pandemic right and because I I know that
that's also gonna come across in that as
well
so do you know the phrase knowledge is
power
that that doesn't actually mean people
misuse it they say means like education
means like you'll get powerful in
society but it actually referred to the
idea that literally tech sodomizing and
designating something that is knowledge
of something gives one power over it and
so I think it's important to think of to
think of this as part of that process by
literally identifying something as a
problem for example about having a
particularly in you on your essentially
disciplining it and I think that's
exactly right and what's a disciplinary
nature of this is I think and I think
you're right primitive accumulation
related to sort of Marxist processes of
capital accumulation by essentially
identifying things to be bought and sold
right because things can't be bought or
sold or work on the market unless
they're identified so I think this is
where you can see how Foucault daeun and
marketing insights put together very
nicely in that they have a little
academic about it they very much
complement each other and under
standing how the present society governs
in itself and it works and everything
and then I'll stop but it works in
everything for example like ankle
monitors right you have to buy the ankle
monitor when which people violate which
then gives more capital to the state
with then impoverishes a certain class
in the cycle so I just think this is a
general tendency that's important to
take Congress itself III think that yeah
like we are really in a very important
political moment to when it comes to
privacy and those individual rights and
it's so frustrating because the way that
it's played out specifically in the
United States we're like wearing a mask
has become such like a cultural
signifier right people believe in
science versus like the loony
right-wingers but you know I think like
amberleigh's Ross essay and damage
magazine a couple weeks ago on wearing
the mask and you know sort of resisting
the idea but saying like yes I wear the
mask because I understand the role that
it plays but resisting this other kind
of like liberal like embrace right of
like accepting all of these restrictions
and tattling on your neighbors like
there's a very frightening aspect to all
of this and it's like we should
understand this as like a sacrifice that
we're doing collectively and not like an
embrace or like some kind of symbol of
of basically being people who are
prepared to accept and obey whatever is
given to them by the state and by
authorities and you see like the worst
aspect of this would be this kind of
Tony Blair fantasy if basically being
able to track everybody across the world
I mean he's talking of course it's not
much of a fantasy no I mean but he's
talking about to like like a super
national level kinda yeah
as well oh this would be privately done
yeah I have known I would be shocked if
Tony Blair doesn't you know sit on a
board or isn't involved you know I mean
you know he's got expensive post prime
ministerial portfolio of this stuff yeah
and I think I think you know just like
kind of like philosophical political
level the struggle that we've seen with
the movement for black lives in these
protests over the past couple weeks is
something that's very important that
people are actually saying we understand
that going out into public does come
with the risk
potentially like spreading the virus but
we're actually making a political choice
right now that's standing up for these
rights supersedes that and I think
that's actually is like something that's
been very encouraging on a political
level that people are willing to make
those distinctions because there was a
real moment when this first started that
I was feeling a lot of pessimism of like
you know this creating a scenario that
is perfect for like hyper hyper like
technocratic neoliberalism to take
control everyone's staying in your place
you're consuming primarily virtually the
public is completely dissipated and you
get maybe food delivered a couple times
a week a while like this massive
underclass is like exposing themselves
to the virus like in the shadows there
is a real development of a very
frightening a future that still is
ongoing but yeah I mean that's still and
I love what you're saying David and I
just want to add another quick point to
this for you guys the riff off of
because I think this is so this is
another one of these conversations where
it's like I there really is I don't know
what terminology want to use but I do
think if you if you if you have the
worldview that we have you know whatever
anti essentialist Marxist oriented
whatever it really reveals just the
lunacy of so many of these debates like
the mask right like the right wing thing
is you know it's it's a conspiracy
theory dad you know don't tell me what
to do fuck or it's just pure horrific
narcissism and then on the other hand
you know the the liberal answer is like
not well of course we're gonna do this
right now but as you say we're gonna
deeply question and resist the overall
tendency we're not gonna just say like
oh well sure Tony Blair wants us to have
a you know digital ID now you know and
then you know and I think a Benjamin
Studebaker had a really smart piece
about this too though too that like even
the mask thing like again and it's
annoying how much we have to say it but
you know like in Amber's piece it was a
great piece and she said where the mass
but you know the fact that government
isn't providing the masks let alone
hospital beds and everything else is the
structure
a problem here and that like culture war
skirmish is not where the ultimate
action is the ultimate action is in the
lack of health infrastructure and and I
and I think like even and and the last
point really quick like there were
people that you know all of a sudden
like medical and and other authorities
came out and said well actually all of a
sudden it like it's totally fine to
break quarantine because this is a
serious issue and like the truth of the
matter is is actually more deep and more
challenging what you're saying is what
you're saying Chris calm which is like
of course it's not safe that we know
protesting and of course by the pandemic
logic you shouldn't be breaking the
lockdown but in fact police murder and
terrorism of black and brown and poor
and working communities is superseding
that and people have made that
Democratic choice and that is infinitely
more important and correct it is the
right choice in my opinion and not
something that can actually be work
reverse engineered to be justified in a
technocratic way because it isn't
technocratic it's a democratic uprising
even in the context of the objective
reality and risk yeah it's it's a
political choice right and and and
oftentimes different value fields come
in conflict politics technocracy health
even and it's it has to one has to make
a choice and what really frustrated me I
don't know if you saw this guys but
there was a lot of discussion in
right-wing media it's like how could all
these public health officials support
the protests and not support you know
people going to look ransacking Walmart
for consumption purposes right and it
just highlighted to me that the total
poverty of American political discourse
everyone's talking about categories
right the category of leaving and
massing as n taking no cognizance of the
different political values and I think
that's important because I think it
relates to that nonsense over James
Bennett is that what we're seeing now is
a transformation and how people
understand the news where the idea that
there was a view from nowhere
is coming under increasing question I
think largely because the post-world War
two consensus in terms of politics geo
of politics economics is itself coming
under question we're seeing big
transformation and how people understand
the basic profession of providing
information to what we call the public
and that's also a really interesting
question that I think relates to a lot
of these larger processes that I you
David and Michael just identified it's
great um can you do one more sure run
all right let's do I wanna do and
actually wait is Matt saying he can't be
on screen when it's the four of us is
that what the deal yeah the logos
covering the bottom right all right all
right we'll do this we'll do one more on
them we need our Matt back but I wanted
to talk about this I'd wanted to get
Daniel on this as well let's do this
incredible story from Mexico that
Bloomberg's reporting that amlo has
indicated that he's willing to help
Venezuela with fuel subsidies I'll quote
briefly here Mexican president Andres
Manuel Lopez Obrador yeah I just scroll
down a bit thank you said Monday he's
willing to sell gasoline to Venezuela as
a humanitarian gesture despite US
sanctions against the South American
country if they requested it and it was
humanity and humanitarian necessity we
would do it Lopez Obrador said replied
to a question adding that Venezuela
hasn't asked Mexico for aid at the
moment no one is the right to oppress
others Venezuela is facing crippling
gasoline shortages after years of mass
management of production refining
infrastructure that is a very
interesting way of leading off that
explanation that's not to say that the
Venezuelan government has not made
mistakes but the most crippling made
outside of Iran arguably the most
crippling sanctions regime in the world
from the world's pre-eminent superpower
and endless seemingly almost
week-by-week attempts at coos and other
violent and DIF may have something to
deal with it I just want you guys as
thoughts I'll start with you Danny and
and and just also you know in the
context of
I see it very clearly in you know in the
centrist media all of a sudden there's
these ludicrous comparisons between
bowls and ro and Homme Lowe again it's
not you know whatever both I'm low is is
like any other political leader not
perfect but I think especially I mean we
don't even know you know we could just
talk about the coup and Bolivia anytime
you start getting into this maximalist
moralistic discourse about a leader in
South America who's doing something for
poor people doing something for working
people and now continually showing that
he's willing to subvert u.s. aggression
I think we've got to be very careful of
the propaganda you're gonna see against
them yeah I it's it's nice to hear of
course as even listening probably know
there's centuries long tradition going
back to the founding of the independent
republics in the early 19th century of
turns Latin American solidarity right
and so this is again a trend that rises
and falls over the course of the 19th
and 20th centuries reaching a height in
the rise of the non-aligned movement in
the in the 50s and the 60s and the rise
of the new international economic order
and the new world information order but
and of course the pink tide there were
discussions about trans Latin American
solidarity so I think it's what it seems
like is Amla if I had to guess is and is
in giving his own personal history sort
of reaching back into that really nice
internationalists transnational Latin
American tradition where essentially the
countries of the continent have and at
Central and South America have and the
Caribbean to have come together to
attempt a former power bloc against
essentially the United States
that's succeeded and failed to to a
greater or lesser degree at various
moments but it wouldn't be the worst
thing in the world of amla was serious
behind this and and and made the
important statement particularly within
the Western Hemisphere itself that one
could defy the United States and begin
trading with Venezuela I think as with
most sanctions its ordinary Venezuelans
just like the ordinary Iranians are the
ones who are getting hurt and so it
would be nice if I'm low you know keeps
his rhetoric up and put some drill
muscle behind it I mean I would just add
that you know it's been pretty amazing
to see the concern
with which you know writers at the
Financial Times and Wall Street Journal
and Bloomberg have paid to the poor in
Mexico over the past couple of weeks and
then you start to see you know the
reality of you know of how the media
pressure plays its role when when you
recognize that you know people are
pissed at home low because he's not
willing to put the country further into
debt you know to international creditors
and I'm not even trying to make a
prescription necessarily but what Allah
needs to do specifically with the
coronavirus case but just sort of trying
to understand it from the United States
financial community why they're so
pissed you know as we're watching
Argentina right now struggle for the
right to be able to practice democracy
within their own nation you know
basically harass on low over his you
know financial plans with the
international finance community and to I
mean like I said yet I think you're
absolutely right to highlight this and
how brave it is for all mode to stand a
with Venezuela at a time when that is
obviously not the easiest thing to do it
would be it would be exceptional even
without the corona virus pandemic going
on in the background but you know
especially so with it
absolutely Daniel bessner thanks a
million brother appreciate your time
safe stay strong talk to you soon see
you around bye guys so you know you know
Matt could we take a question or two
from the discord and David did we get
something from al-jazeera on uh yeah we
have okay great yeah and then we just
got it we'll take one or two questions I
think it's a few more stories and we'll
wrap okay ten best questions here we go
this is from a Jim Jim stir if it
doesn't come up from best nurse Conville
I should have read this before I started
it but anyway cops and live PD have just
been can't be bummed in my area about
propaganda manufacturing and being since
the Oh Brooke and comes from that was
just more of a comment here's another
one from the real nada
how can the current revolutionary mood
be leveraged beyond the current demands
is it really only about police reform
and so can't
it about much more should be worried
about co-opted purposes sorry am i
cutting out sorry a little bit go ahead
man I mean I was just gonna say I think
it is being made about more than police
form and then like the aid can't wait
camp ain't got a lot of blowback yeah
because it was just about reform I think
actually there's some good indications
on there but of course co-option is is
being attempted there's meetings
happening about it right now I'm sure
yeah I mean I think that's the that's
the reality I you know I've just been
amazed watching this with my experience
watching movements in the United States
in my lifetime
how focus it's been just like how many
people have tried to co-opt it and just
take away the energy from the this
movement and the fact that it continues
to push forward and that doesn't mean
that we shouldn't still be suspicious
and you know trying to analyze to make
sure that that you know doesn't happen
that it gets co-opted but this this
movement really I feel like it's they're
not gonna be able to put this away as
you know we've we've mentioned many
times on the shows like the demand just
keep on getting stronger and larger as
we go forward watch I want to plug one
other thing a commentary actually also
did for the Jackman show called we can't
let I think it's title though something
like we can't let the protests turn into
HR politics so I think there's sort of
three there's a couple of different
tiers to it and also I'd really
recommend if you haven't seen it yet
definitely watch the bonus conversation
which we've unlocked the conversation I
had with Cedric Johnson that's I mean
you know Cedric's like really
indispensable scholar in my opinion and
great conversation so I think there's
kind of like a couple of different tiers
like one is to be honest like I I said
before like I think the way the
Democratic leadership is trying to
co-opt minimize and cynically exploit
what people are risking their lives for
is obviously disgusting and then at the
same time like there's actually if
something is properly understood as a
narrow reformist civil rights package
that's fine
and if and as I say a million times if I
was in Congress I'd absolutely vote for
that
that's like 5% of what's required but
it's something that should be voted on
and and so as long and then the next
thing is this broader politics of
co-optation and I think it's splitting
in two very interesting directions
because I think that the movement itself
and a lot of the work coming on around
it are you know in terms as David said
the demands have made remained really
clear and really strong and then I
totally think that you know it
absolutely is gonna lead to you know I
was we were saying with Cedric like you
know more sort of like essentialist
white middle class metaphysics which
i-i-i think is both I think actually has
a lot of serious problems because it's
it is in fact a middle class class
politics as vivec chibber pointed out
and also um it's sort of to me I mean
it's not to me it's not as you know I
don't want to exactly equate things like
this with really important you know
literal legislative stuff but like as
Cedric said in the interview of you know
it's like something like there should be
training in institutions against things
like implicit bias there should be like
and diversity is an incredibly important
and positive thing but when you start
all of a sudden noticing the way that
something that is very structural and
implicates again just literal
materiality turns into a kind of like
you know morality tale that's always a
major red flag and you know again this
the shorthand is I acknowledge my
privilege can I keep my money and that's
a problem and also again I think a lot
of those just a lot of the essentialist
discourses and you know I I don't know
if we have time to get into it but that
you know that white fragility book is
trash and terrifying and nothing I would
encourage nothing that could ever I mean
people should read about Ronnie Kasrils
in a read an example of a serious
material ruthless anti-racist fighter
it is not gonna come from you know a new
middle-class moral panic and attempt at
cleansing imperfection those projects
are toxic and they don't lead to serious
material redistribution and fulfilling
the rights revolution I think the
movement itself I think the way Andrew
Cuomo was like you want everybody
immediate was like fuck you we're
staying on the street and it's
absolutely beautiful
all right anyone who got one more maybe
oh um you did that what's y'all's
favorite this is from Dave from Jamaica
what's y'all's favorite satirical movie
I've been enjoying the Christopher Guest
movies rest in peace
what's his name the guy who'd just
passed away uh Oh Fred Willard Fred
Willard is amazing yeah Fred Willard is
so fuckin funny man all those movies are
great yeah those are all those are all
great movies history of white people in
America is also really funny in with
Fred Willard Martin Short we're in there
Martin mole I want to say but all I saw
it years ago but yeah all those movies
are really funny um buts it's
specifically satirical huh that's
catching me off guard too I have to say
yeah I think the Christopher Guest
movies Wayne's World one end to a great
satirize ation of the indie music scene
and oh you know what for lions by
Christopher Morris or Chris Morris it's
a it's crazy also like there's a lot of
those British comedians that have
Twitter and kind of ruined them they're
lame politics quiet Chris from I think
Christopher Morris probably has better
politics but let's just hope he doesn't
get on Twitter to prove us wrong this is
just funny actually will play will will
do we've got I think three more to get
to this is pretty funny Oliver I mean
look I'm a big build BER fan oh by the
way if you haven't seen it yet
definitely watch the new Chappelle
special really it's available on YouTube
definitely watch that and so you know
yeah I think you know I'm a huge
Bilborough fan - I think he's very funny
I think he's also you know again I
always say these are like very good
examples of how broader sets of folks
are thinking about things and this kind
of like this is this the way Jill Rogan
is gonna start the concern troll about
the fucking masks here I mean again and
we said like yes
what Amber Lee frost pointed out that
underlying left impulse we're not gonna
just say oh yeah digital ID that's great
but then at the same time that's kind of
like just basic right-wing bullshit you
know we're a mask
I love how bill burr answers this I
think this is hilarious and I went out
and popped my mask on it's with the walk
after I saw this I want people to walk
down the street with a mask on let's not
start this Jim you though let's not
start this okay let's turn I don't want
to start this bullshit I'm not gonna sit
here with no medical degree listening to
you with no medical degree with an
American flag behind you smoking a cigar
acting like we know what's up better
than the CDC all I do is ID list I watch
the news once every two weeks I'm like
mask or no mask steel mask
alright mask that's all I give a fuck
about I don't care but even they say he
shouldn't wear a mask unless you're
treating a coronavirus patient well the
World Health Organization they didn't
say that in it what does that mean I
don't know what I don't know what what's
he referring to there I definitely think
they're still telling you to wear masks
well the thing is like in look there's
there's a point to be made that like
initially that we were lied to
yeah we're saying that the wearing a
mask wasn't important because they were
afraid that people were gonna buy up all
the masks
yeah they lied to us because they didn't
have production yeah no one I think we
should be you know rightfully upset
about this but Joe Rogan is completely
off on this one yeah totally let's keep
calm initial they didn't say it
initially no they didn't they did and
then it gradually then he brand it
wailing up and then everybody wore the
fucking masks this is like rollerblading
everybody fucking roller bladed and then
it was that one fucking homophobic joke
and then everybody acted like they never
did it
and then a hundred million fucking
rollerblades got thrown into the fucking
ocean
we all wore masks people have fucking
sitting there well you don't have the
body type for two fucking knuckles would
scrape on the ground inches I just love
how wearing a mass became like this
fucking like soft thing that you were
doing like I mean relax but on the
fucking mask yeah have the deeper
concern of course it's also something
that's so like you get into this like
shit about digital ID and national
databases and you know and and and ankle
monitors and you know how your phones
can monitor your heart rate and you know
there was this whole thing I was reading
about years ago about like that you know
is there gonna be a regulation between
what your cell phone provider can sell
your insurer about you know your
second-by-second biometrics right this
is serious stuff there's something
honestly so charmingly analog about hey
you just pop on a fucking mask and look
out for your fellow human beings there's
no tag on the mask
there's no biometrics on the mask it's
the simplest thing in the world it's the
same thing people did a hundred years
ago
mmm-hmm the last time there was a
pandemic like this yeah it's amazing you
know you're talking to best nerely about
the whole Fuko thing and he talks about
the sort of plague as a forerunner to
the panopticon whereas the Heuer
literally stayed according up the city
into neighborhoods having a specific
state watchman there to you know count
make sure people would have to come to
their windows and show themselves and if
they didn't show themselves you would
have they would assume you were sick and
you know consequence would follow and to
kind of tie in another ongoing thematic
thing is there's these stories and Defoe
talks about this and the literary
hangover episode instead of people going
out
in the last time in 1721 the plague
erupted going out and killing Watchmen
because they were abusing people and
then and he's like well they were also
people who needed jobs anyway so they're
from the same class so the aristocracy
was like fine with it basically but you
see they're like development of a police
state and the sort of dynamics of
desperate jobs and you know people a lot
of like wealthy people escaped to the
suburbs and left their workers in the
city to fend for themselves not you're
not coming with us sorry
and I mean pretty amazing stuff but good
thing we've put all that behind yeah
exactly it's so nice though we're at a
completely different reactions to a
hundred years ago are so frightening
that's four hundred three hundred four
hundred years thought so I thought your
time at the United States and oh right
Todd geo that's even wilder I don't know
I've just been reading a lot about lake
in Texas for example like the Spanish
flu was really devastating in Central
Texas because they reopened really
quickly you know and then there was a
massive second way of you know just I
don't know it just it's scary to think
that this is actually this thing that
feels so world's historic has happened
in like somewhat recent history and
we're still not learning the lessons
learn the lessons of you know the way
the Obama administration fairly well
managed Ebola in the United States it's
like well you can learn the lessons you
just can't enact them right you can do
others anything you want have a great
idea of how you doing free to read it
obviously not to go to Bob Mosley for me
like the Joe Rogan my god this is like
oh this will be a vivid memory from for
up for me like right when this first
started and we started realize how
serious it was I remember listening to
the Joe Rogan podcast the camera who his
guest was but you know he's like a
disease expert like talking about how
serious coronavirus Michael osterholm we
had him on majority report after Wow
yeah you and I just remember you're like
wow there's just so seriously it's so
funny for me to now watch your Rose
later be like oh we should wear masks
anymore you don't you know no joke my
dad like that's the only time he's ever
listed
he's like my somebody shared me with the
Rogen thing and this guy was actually
impressed me about like I've been
telling him about coronavirus but it
took some other but sharing a Rogen
interview it was my foster home I'll be
honest we're talking about Croatoan
virus and I was like I don't know
awesome
secure no bad who fucking listen to his
show
Rogan Fat Joe Rogan would say the best
way to cure help me
is actually when it's raining outside
but uh fucking Coronas coming honestly
that's that Joe Rogan could talk about
stuff like that is actually useful to
him Oh 100% I mean actually uh Russell
Brand had a really good commentary on
Joe Rogan and Spotify and in like male
spirituality stuff it's actually that
one's worth watching all right do we
have this clip because I'll I'll set
this up if we have the AJ clip yeah okay
so in 1962 India and China thought oh
you know a war that dealt with a border
dispute in the Ladakh region this is a
region that's that's close to where the
Chinese government occupies Tibet the
border has never been fully resolved and
it's a kind of ongoing source of
tensions in the Chinese and Indian
relationship and now of course is a very
different you know dynamic we have a you
know extreme far-right ultra-nationalist
consolidating and Indian government
obviously I do think you know the there
have been shifts in Chinese foreign
policy they're definitely you know the
silent rises over as it were and so
there is much more assertive 'no sand
aggression in chinese foreign policy
there's a deep relationship that's
developed between China and Pakistan and
just yesterday
it was horrifying I mean at least 20
Indian soldiers were killed in a clash
in the border with China the incident
follows rising tension between the two
Asian superpowers I don't know if we
have any video here I know sorry ok I'll
read it at least 20 soldiers have been
killed and face off with Chinese forces
in the disputed border region Indian
Army said in a major escalation of weeks
long standoff in the Western Tomales in
a statement the army said on Tuesday
that 17 critically injured Indian troops
to come to their wounds in addition to
officer and two soldiers who had died
earlier he's scroll down Indian and
Chinese troops have disengaged in the
area where the where the clashes took
place the statement said anding adding
that China's firmly the India's firmly
committed to protecting territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the nation
so look this is as much as people are
worried about the peninsula and much as
people are worried about you know North
Korea which obviously is not gone away
this is according to most analysis even
just the equation between China and
Pakistan this is the most likely area in
the world for you know in atomic
exchange now you have this dispute that
has lasted to some extent for forty-five
years between China and India that has
not been resolved heating up at a time
with two governments with a very
unlikely posture and desire to back
right down back down and I and I think
it's you know it's interesting and this
is just a you know this is just a
distinction in government structure like
China obviously like any other state in
the world can use foreign conflicts to
fortify domestic position but because I
mean obviously China isn't a democracy
and there is a responsiveness the public
around certain things but not others I
mean China can sort of China can
potentially guide these things more
right and you see like as an example at
certain times like it's okay to go
protest aggressively at the Japanese
embassy now we're proving now we're
going to pull back
if you keep doing it might get in
trouble and India you know is has never
been I mean it's been formally a
democracy for decades it's obviously
always been a place that has had
everything from the horrifying
occupation of Kashmir that of course has
gotten worse but has always been I mean
one of the most militarized places on
the planet there's been pogroms against
Sikhs there's you know persistent
inequities and brutalities in India but
at the same time you know Modi is still
a leader that's competing in elections
and that is consolidating and I think
the relationship between the vicious
assault on Muslims inside India and then
also an example you know an opportunity
that chests up against Pakistan and
China is pretty irresistible I I don't
know in this case I don't really know
who has more validity in their claims I
think in the 60s
I would imagine and certainly my read is
that you know Nehru was a much more kind
of herbivorous leader than Mao more
interested potentially in kind you know
finding an arrangement but I don't know
validity of that particular territorial
claim I was just going to add a little
bit of context to it at least like what
some people have been the hypothesis of
what led to the conflict is that and
again yet I don't know like the actual
like I I think it's you know it's a
purely like disputed area I think it's
really good Apple to come up with any
kind of judgment I think that says a lot
more about what side you prefer than
anything but specifically what I think
what I've read there the India the
Indian nation has been really building
up their infrastructure in the area
around like areas that are disputed on
while the Chinese have like very
established roads and systems on their
side so I think this sort of like lead
you know to basically you know the
dispute basically coming to the
forefront oh is that India has been
spending a lot of energy right now like
trying to build infrastructure in the
area that's disputed but I mean it's
think it's definitely wild
yeah so we'll keep following that do we
have one more discord question or two
and then we'll do we got one final piece
of sound before we we end for the night
we have all three discord questions okay
great well anyways let's alright let's
play this this is really significant
this is a new video put out for the
fight for 15 and just you know we talked
about Tyson Foods in the meat packing
industry just the rate of exploitation
the absolute lethal abuse of the
fast-food industry and its workers and
the fact that this organizing his head
and going on for so many years for just
the bare minimum of decency $15 an hour
to work an incredibly hard service job
and McDonald's but obviously it could
you know be Burger King at Wendy's or
whatever KFC this is just extraordinary
and of course when these as this video
point McDonald's as this point a video
points out is you know it's quite
willing I'm quite eager to identify
itself with you know fighting racism as
an example this is a very important new
video from the fight for 15 struggle hi
my name is James Watt and I'm a
McDonald's worker from Kansas City
Missouri McDonald's just released their
second dividend payment of 2020 and in
total the company has spent two billion
dollars in giveaways to shareholders and
Wall Street so far this year that's two
billion dollars too long the pockets of
wealthy shareholders that should be
going to us the frontline workers in
this
Dimmick McDonald's is making a
deliberate choice since the start of the
Cova 19 pandemic McDonald's has failed
to protect its workers particularly
workers of color or contracting and
dying from Kovach 19 in
disproportionately high numbers
mcdonald's chooses to spend billions on
their investors they choose to spend
money lobbying the Trump administration
against passing sick leave laws for all
their workers and they're paying for ads
to say they support black lives matter
instead of fighting the systemic racism
that company perpetuates every day
McDonald's chooses to put profits ahead
of its workers us who make the company
run every day McDonald's is making a
choice to silence our voices we deserve
15 in a union and benefit mr. Weiser's
violently okay McDonald's tells us we're
accentual workers but they treat us like
dogs
when George Floyd was killed they came
out and said they were one of us that is
very insulting
McDonald's you are the second largest
employer in America but your actions
have spoken louder than words we need 15
and we need a union McDonald's it's time
to be a part of the solution and not
continue to be part of the problem
excellent yeah and anytime these
companies come out and say that they're
with you like that know that like those
stats about how most Americans only have
like $400 or less in case of an
emergency
all of these companies dine on that like
that it that means labor force to them
and I mean yes disgusting
they literally dine on that they these
companies are predicated on I mean again
not only are they not standing with
black lives matter not standing with
anything to do with protecting or
respecting social essential workers and
forget that word respecting protecting
social essential workers you you
arguably I mean you cannot have
specifically a second largest employer
that treats its employees that way
without a surplus labor population of
which the police are there to terrorize
so not only are they not in terms of the
fact that they are Union Buster's and
they treat their own employees
grotesquely they are elemental to a
whole set of pathologies I mean it very
pitifully as a company their elemental
to you know the creation of the suburbs
to all of the ecological crisis and
alienation that can tell you that gets
tied up in that and their whole model is
predicated on the systems that that he
just identified there and I'm not even
to mention the fact of course overall
global supply chain and you know meat
production that they're involved with is
you know has labor and human rights
consequences across the globe as well as
being a major major contributor to the
climate crisis you know I would just add
to further the conversations we were
having earlier making that point that
they did in the videos that like oh this
statement that you're making about black
lives matter
is ridiculous when you're spending all
of your time exploiting your employees I
think is really important not only is it
important rhetorically because it really
you know it's a very strong point but
it's also exactly what we're talking
about not allowing the movement to get
co-opted right because it makes it very
clear like look you know any any company
that has like a functioning PR
department can put out the statement
that they're supposed to put out now
right but what really matters is
actually making the serious material
change in people's lives in the way that
you interact with the world and you know
I think that we're gonna have to
continue to be making sure that that
point is made because there's a lot of
people that really understand that you
know they hit a couple key words
buzzwords and hashtags that there's a
certain segment of the population be
like oh well great you know now they're
progressive company meanwhile they're
just you know they're just exploiting
they're putting a bow on the
exploitation that they're there
practicing so I you know I think this is
a phenomenal ad and I think this is like
it's ridiculous to by the way that we're
still having the fight with McDonald's
on this question after show after show
many years it's so much exposure about
how nasty of a company they are to their
employees and unlike the Adolph Reid
thread there are ways in which you know
McDonald's in terms of some of the
executive leadership team and
advertising companies and so on like
have done and that neoliberal sense
pretty well and that's fine right that's
you know sure but that again reveals you
know the three big choices that a
toll-free outlines do you want brutal
inequities and capitalism with white
supremacy or do you think it's totally
fine to have absolutely brutal grotesque
and inequities in capitalism as long as
the top 1% of the predator class is
proportionally represented across
various lines of diversity or do you say
we need actual democracy and public
provision for all period full stop and
you know that's what that struggle is
about and we support it in any way we
can in any way shape or form I think
that was a very very effective video and
I'd really
urge all of you or you know using social
media to really I mean you know
definitely amplify content like that as
much as possible and thank you to the
great Harvey Kay for sharing that with
me to begin with
um I know he was pushing that very
strongly because he cares very deeply
about you know the labor movement all
right folks this Sunday second part of
the Pakistan series with these long Wars
which is just great and next week
William shocky Ronin Burtenshaw join of
East is gonna return to talk to use this
great piece on this very positive new
Supreme Court decision on equity but
also the broader struggles on the shop
floor and on the street and she's also
gonna connect it with her work against
biomedical essentialism I'd go back and
listen to the first conversation we had
beyond intersectionality which is
available for patrons we're gonna do
another to partner with her she's
brilliant I'm very much looking forward
to that thanks Matt thanks David thanks
to each and every one of you thinks
everybody makes as possible stay strong
stay safe be well
