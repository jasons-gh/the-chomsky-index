I wanted to turn to the latest that's
happening in Venezuela and with view s
Venezuelan relations Venezuela has
announced the arrest of an unspecified
number of Americans on charges of
espionage at least some of whom have
reportedly been released and left the
country speaking at a rally the
Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro said
the suspects were trying to stoke
anti-government political sentiment we
detected activity and we have captured
some US citizens and undercover
activities in hidden activities
espionage trying to win over people and
towns along the Venezuelan coast trying
to win over people in some neighborhoods
into jira we captured a pilot of a u.s.
plane of Latin origin with all sorts of
documentation president Maduro also
announced new restrictions on the number
of US diplomats allowed in Venezuela and
rule changes that will subject Americans
to the same visa requirements
Venezuelans face in the United States
president Maduro has also unveiled a
list of American politicians barred from
entering Venezuela in response to US
sanctions against Venezuela officials
last year Maduro has repeatedly accused
right-wing opponents of fomenting a coup
with u.s. support
now the White House has denied the
charges but said last week it's
considering tools to quote steer the
Venezuelan government in the direction
they should be headed unquote professor
Noam Chomsky your response what's
happening
well one kind of question we should
immediately ask ourselves is brought up
by your observation that Venezuela is
planning to impose on US citizens the
same restrictions that the United States
imposes on Venezuelans why do we impose
those restrictions suppose say that Iran
was sending people to the United States
to foment
opposition to the government and the
call for changing the regime how would
we react to that unimaginable but we
consider it our right to do that
elsewhere incidentally that is not this
is not a justification of Venezuelan
actions the fact that we do it doesn't
make it justified if others do it no
it's not justified then as well has
severe internal problems there's no
doubt about that what is your assessment
of Maduro and how he compares to
President Travis well Maduro Chavez had
a charisma and popular support an appeal
that Maduro doesn't have but there is a
heart there are difficult economic
circumstances to face within Venezuela
the the economy is in difficult shape
for the during the Chavez years there
were progress in many areas but there
was no success in moving Venezuela away
from a strictly oil based economy that
was very little in the world
diversification of the economy a
development of agriculture development
of industry and so on and that's a
pretty weak read for an economy to rest
on it's not a successful development
program and that's now showing up there
were there inflation problems as they
were never able to deal with the problem
of internal violence it's a not the most
violent country in the atmosphere but
it's pretty bad and these are serious
internal problems they're undoubtedly
being exacerbated to some extent by US
involvement
by rights we should be trying to support
the Venezuela to overcome its internal
problems not trying to light fires that
will make them worse how could the u.s.
do that we could for example eliminate
those restrictions that you're talking
about we could be providing economic and
technical assistance that could be used
to overcome internal difficulties and
these are things that could be done
instead what we're doing is maintain a
position of extreme hostility this is
not this plenty of problems internally
and our actions are purposely making
them worse it's not by accident we want
the US government wants to make them
worse because it wants the regime
overthrown the Chavez's own estimate
whether it's accurate or not I can't
judge but what he his position is that
that the United States was willing to
tolerate his government up to the point
when he began to play a significant role
in OPEC and convinced the OPEC countries
the oil-producing countries to lower
production in order to raise prices and
the US was strongly opposed to that and
what he says is that's when the US
government turned against him in fact
the US backed openly backed a 2002 coup
which which briefly overthrew the
government and has continued the
subversive activities that's his
judgment MIT professor Noam Chomsky
coming up he talks about Edward Snowden
drone warfare the legacy of slavery in
the United States and nomes new love all
that and more coming up
