you may point in the book that the claim
that governments are primarily concerned
with security begs the question of
security for movements and how security
is to find the owner keeping the library
on that point
well the academic professions study
international relations and so on but do
take for granted that the main role of
governments is to provide us to protect
the national interest as both the
national interest which means basically
security but they rarely have some
security for whom so the first question
that comes to mind is is it security for
the population go through a lot of the
record their states same elsewhere and
it's insure pretty clearly very
persuasively that security of the
population is a very minor concern and
it's often sacrificed dramatically for
other interests so security for whom
well there two answers first of all for
state power states to try to protect
themselves and they want to protect
themselves against their enemies and one
enemy is the domestic population the NSA
surveillance systems expose the domestic
population is also always considered a
real or potential enemies you gotta
control so we need security of state
power from them but state power doesn't
exist in a vacuum
that's one of the weaknesses of
international relations theory it
depends on the internal distribution of
power within the domestic society and
there's no secret about what that is
plenty of academic and other research
sort of common sense simply tells you
the obvious it resides overwhelmingly
concentrations of economic power
the corporate the corporate system
well financial sectors are that's where
policy is overwhelmingly determinant
there are exceptions but it's
overwhelmingly true so their security
has to be guaranteed
they say the trans-pacific trade
agreement just discussion right now
whose securities of defending not the
population populations but very good for
the pharmaceutical corporations it's
called a free trade agreement in the
press
it's a highly protectionist agreement
which it's which offers protects the
exorbitant profits of the pharmaceutical
media and other major conglomerates with
the kind of patent protection measures
which never existed in the past
just like the World Trade Organization
their security has to be protected a
crucial part of the TPP like not a bit
of others is that corporations have
astonishing right they're granted the
right to sue governments but they can
they can sue governments if governments
undertake policies which they claim harm
their future profits
so if say Mexico sets up an area for
environmental protection whatever some
US company can and in fact does is
invented sue them because it's taking
away the potential profits of a u.s.
corporation which might want to build
the goldmine this is the fact that these
are called free trade treaties is
ludicrous but for that matter than I
even trade treaties these are investor
rights agreements designed to protect
the security of the
have an overwhelming role in formulating
state policy namely the corporate sector
not a hundred percent of the wealth so
that's the two forms of security that
has to be guaranteed our state power
private our closely interlinked welfare
of populations is incidental
