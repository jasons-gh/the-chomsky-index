that issue is not a new one it rose in
april nineteen ninety one right after
the gulf war at that time shiite
rebellion took place in the south which
might have overthrown the monster but
the bush administration intervened it
refused to allow rebelling iraqi
generals access to captured equipment
and it authorized saddam to use military
helicopters and other arm means to drown
the rebellion in blood later stormin
norman who was in charge claimed that
he'd been snookered by the devious
Saddam he hadn't realized that when he
authorized him to use air power he would
actually use it the basic problem at
that time was explained by Thomas
Friedman who was in chief diplomatic
correspondent under the New York Times
so he's articulating State Department
concerns he pointed out that the best of
all worlds for the United States would
be an iron-fisted Iraqi military junta
ruling Iraq just as Saddam did much to
the pleasure of US allies Saudi Saudi
Arabia and Turkey and of course the boss
in Washington but since clones couldn't
be found the US was stuck with second
best namely Saddam himself well that
problem still remains currently the
State Department and CIA are reported to
be developing contacts with Sunni Iraqi
generals recent defectors and they might
be suitable replacements as clones but
here there are some problems to the
favorite general has Raji who's Saddam's
former chief of staff he may not be able
to make it to a planned meeting in
Washington in a couple of weeks because
he's under investigation in Denmark for
war crimes charged with participation in
the gassing of the Kurds at Halabja so
some difficulties another problem is one
that's all over the front pages namely
strong regional opposition even from
queit which of course has been
I serve aided by the recent us-israeli
operations in the West Bank and they are
joint operations that's well understood
in the region even if a different story
is preferred hear the story preferred
here is that the United States is an
honest broker trying to deal with two
naughty children one of them is a man of
peace Ariel Sharon who sometimes gets
out of control and the other is the evil
Palestinians who refused to renounce
terror and to maintain this pose which
is close to a hundred percent it's
necessary to overlook as few small facts
namely that one of the adversaries is
the leading military power in the region
in fact one of the most powerful in the
world fully supported by the global
superpower the other is a weak
defenseless population that the
us-israeli alliance has ruled with
considerable violence and brutality for
35 years meanwhile rejecting every offer
at every effort at diplomatic settlement
while they proceeded to integrate the
territories within Israel in gross
violation of international law war
crimes severe grave breaches of the
Geneva Conventions and all that
continues I already mentioned the
Washington's renewed steps last December
to bar the obvious measures to reduce
violence and it takes considerable
discipline not to see what seems obvious
to commentators elsewhere particularly
in the Middle East namely that Powell's
mission was very carefully crafted to
ensure that the man of peace would have
time to complete his terrorist
operations in the newly occupied
Palestinian cities now it's true that
the president insisted that he must
withdraw without delay but Powell was in
a quick to explain in a press conference
right away that the words without delay
mean as soon as possible kind of recalls
Clinton's deliberations on what is means
the man of peace is not asked to
renounce terror and of course the master
in Washington rather it's the adversary
who is imprisoned by Israeli tanks
unable to flushes toilet he has to
renounce terrorism in terms acceptable
to the master even though everyone
understands that those statements are
completely meaningless have no effect
whatsoever why well the story's familiar
again it's useful to look back a bit
Powell who's the administration's good
guy is following the model of Secretary
of State George Schultz who was the
official moderate back then in the
Reagan years this was at a time when the
United States was becoming an object of
international ridicule late 80s because
of its unwillingness to hear that the
PLO was calling for negotiations and
political settlement with increasing
intensity while the United States and
its Israeli ally were refusing on the
alleged grounds that the PLO had not
renounce terrorism unlike say the United
States and Israel which can't carry out
terrorism by definition in his memoirs
Schultz recalls all this with pleasure
he describes how he informed the
president President Reagan that Arafat
had said uncle and Cole Cole Cole but he
hadn't yet said uncle with sufficient
humility to be acceptable to masa the
purpose is humiliation and degradation
not of our effort specifically but of
the Palestinians as a whole for whom
he's a national symbol and they have to
be taught that they cannot lift their
heads in standard Israeli parlance 20
years ago during another one of the
periodic outbursts of state terror in
the occupied territories very respected
centrist commentator in Israel Yoram
harry wrote that 15 years that's what it
was then 15 years of occupation have
taught Israeli soldiers that the task of
the army is not only to defend the state
and the battlefield
against foreign enemy but to demolish
the rights of innocent people because
they are a bushing living in territories
that God promised to us our aboushi ms
the hebrew word that's the equivalent of
niggers or kikes he and others were
horrified and not only by the vicious
brutality but also by the techniques of
humiliation for example writing
identification numbers on arms of
prisoners on a day of the Holocaust
which is a practice renewed in the past
few weeks again arousing heart 10 years
before that Moshe Dayan had informed his
cabinet colleagues that the Arabs must
be told that they will live like dogs in
the hope that they will leave and ever
since then the us-israeli practice has
followed the advice of one of the
leaders who was actually most
sympathetic to the palestinian plight
well none of this breaks new ground
these are familiar elements of
domination and repression humiliation
and degradation are at their core comes
second nature to anyone with their boot
on someone's neck it's well known to
anyone who studied the history of
imperialism and conquest and it's not at
all surprising that the United States
and Israel should now be infuriated by
their loss of a monopoly of violence and
terror though by virtue of their power
they remain well in the lead well the
official justification for the
perpetuation of many years of repression
and terror is that the Palestinians
rejected the magnanimous and generous
offer of Clinton and Barack at Camp
David in the year 2000 so they deserve
their fate and there's a simple way to
evaluate that claim very simple have a
look at a map okay unfortunately it's a
difficult task to carry out because none
were published which is interesting it's
not that it's hard to publish Matt you
want to know if the offer was
magnanimous take a look at the map that
will tell you the that's easy enough I
mean they were published in Israel and
the Israeli press they were published in
marginal
publications here and unless there's
something to conceal they would have
appeared regularly on the front pages
here along with the chorus of self
praise about our magnanimity and a look
at the maps it reveals very quickly why
they did not appear it is true that the
Clinton Barack offers registered some
progress at the time of the negotiations
Palestinians in the West Bank were
confined to over 200 isolated Canton's
and the magnanimous offer reduced it to
four therefore it approached from below
remember it approached from below the
moral level of South Africa in the
depths of apartheid 40 years ago when
the first bantu stands were established
bush and powell have regressed even
below that they are offering no more
than a vision of what South Africa
actually implemented 40 years ago
