you are listening to pacifica radios
democracy now as economies around the
world continue to plummet from Asia to
Russia to Latin America we bring you a
speech by America's leading dissident
Noam Chomsky professor of linguistics at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology well I want to at least
mention quite a number of different
topics dimensions are inevitably going
to be far too brief every one of them
deserves intensive thought and
discussion and there are not at all
comprehensive but what I want to kind of
suggests if I can do it is that these
are some of the threads that ought to be
woven together to give some kind of
coherent picture of where we stand the
day what kinds of problems we have to
face and where we might find at least a
standpoint to begin to think about them
in a constructive way I want to go back
a half a century I think we live very
much within an era that was more or less
created then there are occasional
moments in human affairs where power
relations make it possible to establish
social and economic arrangements that
actually merit the term world order
Merritt might not be the right word it's
not necessarily a phrase that should be
invested with positive connotations this
history amply reveals one of the most
dramatic and in fact most easily timed
of those moments was about 50 years ago
in the aftermath of the most devastating
single catastrophe in human history
which took place right in the heartland
of Western civilization at the end of
the war the United States of course had
an overwhelming share of global wealth
and power and perfectly naturally
dominant forces within the state
corporate Nexus in the United States
plan to use that power to organize the
world as much they could in accord with
their own conceptions of their interests
and those they represent it of course
there were conflicting visions both at
home and abroad and they had to be
contained or better rolled back to
borrow some cold war rhetoric that was
done with varying degrees of success but
in fact the basic conflicts persist and
for elementary reasons they persist
because they're about fundamental values
they're about freedom justice human
dignity human rights in a world of
inequality great inequality and great
concentration of power the real world
that is these values quite commonly
constitute an arena of conflict between
centers of power and most of the rest
good deal of history revolve revolves
around these conflicts in the last half
century is no exception I'm sure the
next will not be either well at the
onset of the current era about half
century ago the framers of the World
Order of that day New World Order of
that day they faced these challenges
everywhere at home what had to be
contained maybeee rolled back were the
very strong commitments of a large
majority of the population to social
democratic ideals that the business
world rightly perceived as a grave
threat to their traditional dominance
they were the hazard facing
industrialists in the rising political
power of the masses as the National
Association of Manufacturers put it in
their internal literature it was the
crisis of democracy that was posed by a
population that sought to enter the
political arena
as frightened liberal internationalists
deletes phrased essentially the same
problem after the ferment of the 1960's
expressing particular concern about the
what they called the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young which were failing to carry
out their disciplining role properly
similar problems were faced throughout
the industrial world they were enhanced
by the prestige and appeal of the
anti-fascist resistance which was a
complex affair but often had radical
Democratic thrusts they were enhanced
further by the discrediting of
traditional conservative the traditional
conservative order which had been linked
closely to the fascist system
reinstating that traditional order in
its essentials was a primary task of the
early post-war years and it was achieved
a large extent often in not very pretty
ways as in the United States this
project continues it's taken new forms
in the last 25 years as here and as
throughout the world under the guise of
neoliberalism or economic rationalism or
free-market doctrine which is permeated
with a good deal of deceit hypocrisy
maybe outright fraud and all of these
issues are strongly very very much alive
right now here Europe and elsewhere in
the third world the South the developing
world as its euphemistically called
similar problems were compounded by
strong pressures uncontrollable
pressures to overturn the imperial
systems and the legacy of dependency and
subordination that they had left the
basic issues were very much the same in
most of the world but they're revealed
with particular clarity with starkest
clarity
in Latin America for the simple reason
that the United States face no challenge
there no outside challenge so you see
the principles operating in their purest
form the only challenge was in the
channel there was a real challenge but
it was from the domestic population and
no outside challenge as in Europe these
conflicts in Latin America came to a
head even before the war was over in the
case of Latin America very dramatically
in February 1945 at a hemispheric
conference in Canada was not part of the
Western Hemisphere in those days
remember so Western Hemisphere means
United States to the south the the
atmospheric I don't think Canada
attended the conference and maybe I'm
mistaken the hemispheric conference was
supposed to organize affairs with
hemisphere we know from us internal
records now that the United States was
deeply concerned with what the State
Department called the philosophy of the
new nationalism that was spreading all
over Latin America indeed all over the
world putting State Department documents
it the philosophy of the new nationalism
which embraced policies designed to
bring about a broader distribution of
wealth and to raise the standard of
living of the masses on the principle
that the first beneficiaries of a
country's resources are the people of
that country and that heresy is called
radical nationalism or economic
nationalism and of course it has to be
stamped out the first beneficiaries of
country's resources are US investors
their counterparts elsewhere and local
elites who are associated with them at
the hemispheric conference the United
States given the power relations of
course the US prevailed and it impose
what was called an economic charter for
the Americas which called for an end to
economic nationalism in all its forms in
the cruel and bloody history of the half
century that followed these remain
central themes and they will continue to
they're very much alive today now
they're often framed differently in the
context of the investor rights
agreements that are mislabeled free
trade agreements NAFTA the forthcoming
maybe multilateral agreement on
investment ma I and the whole
globalization what's called
globalization which is a specific form
of international integration not by any
means the only necessary form it's the
specific form that's crafted primarily
to serve the interests of its designers
again not terribly surprisingly
transnational corporations financial
institutions and the bureaucracy is that
they control and of course the major
states that are part of the system the
most critical part of the third world
was then and I think remains today the
Middle East for the very simple reason
that it's the locus of the world's major
energy supplies for as far ahead as
anybody can see hen says it was
considered to be and is still considered
to be of particular importance that the
first beneficiaries of those of that
wealth are not the people of the region
rather the the resources must be under
effective us control they must be
accessible to the industrial world on
terms that the United States leadership
concedes appropriate and crucially the
huge profits that are generated must
flow primarily to the United States
secondarily to its British junior
partner to borrow the term used by the
British Foreign Office rather roof
ruefully to describe its new role in the
post-second World War Europe the this is
done in various ways in part it's
recycled by local managers who have to
be dependent on the global rulers a long
story which continues well quite
naturally these arrangements breed
continual conflict internal us documents
describe them in the conventional way
the conflicts or conflicts with radical
nationalism radical Arab nationalism
that threatens us dominance for the
public put a little differently varying
over time these days it's international
terrorism or the clash of civilization
tomorrow I'll be something new these but
it's basically the same ones all the
time question is who's going to be the
first beneficiaries of the region's
resources these conflicts are likely to
become more virulent than ominous in the
coming years at least if the analysis
and projection of quite a number of
geologists or anywhere near accurate the
a reasonably broad consensus this plenty
of room for disagreement and uncertainty
but a reasonably broad consensus was
captured in a in the headline of a major
review article on the topic in the
journal science generally the American
Association of advancement of science a
couple of weeks ago the headline was the
next oil crisis looms
large and perhaps close may the Lord the
believe in a period when gasoline prices
are at historic low but there are many
who regard that as an aberration
short-term aberration the crisis that
many people fear is that the rate of
discovery has been declining for some
time after having risen steadily since
the earliest discovery of oil and for
some the Gulf region the Raven Peninsula
Persian Gulf region that has by now
regained the share or virtually regained
the share of energy production that it
had in the early 1970s you recall that
that was sufficient to bring the era of
super cheap energy to a sudden n happen
to be a temporary end but the foretaste
of what lies ahead the basically back to
that share meaning that degree of power
and that share is expected to increase
in part because world consumption is
increasing very rapidly and most of the
known energy reserves by a long by a big
measurer in that region and it's also
speculated not apparently not
implausibly that something like the
fifty percent the fifty percent mark of
exploitable capacity may not be too far
away maybe within the next few decades
and all of this combines to suggest to
policymakers and others that the need to
control that region is going to become
increasingly important and that's going
to mean very likely increasing
confrontations with radical nationalism
as a kind of a sidelight to this I think
that very likely the latest terrorist
exchange last few weeks might well be
seen in this context i'm referring to
the terrorist bombings of the US
embassies in africa allegedly by groups
were
pposed the u.s. nomination of the major
oil producers and the US missile attacks
on sudan and afghanistan that one might
ask why those targets well like the
bombings of the embassies in Africa the
US missile attack was selected it
selected targets that were vulnerable
not the ones to which the messages were
aimed in either case the message for the
missile attacks may well have been
directed elsewhere in this case very
likely to readd and Tehran there have
been recent steps towards rapprochement
between Saudi Arabia and Iran historic
enemies that's not an appealing prospect
for us global managers it raises fears
which have been lingering for a long
time of regional groupings that will get
out of control in the strategically most
important part of the world which holds
the greatest material prize in world
history it's quoting us assessments from
the late 40s which still prevail the US
missile attacks have been criticized you
read plenty of criticisms of them as
being counterproductive a lead opinion
has held that counterproductive because
their effects on the sudan and
afghanistan well its pragmatic judgment
apparently same opinion seems to be
largely unconcerned by the fact that
effective or not there were war crimes
that's now partially conceded in the
case of sudan however just keeping to
the pregnant pragmatic judgment it might
be evaluated in the light of a secret
1995 study of the US Strategic Command
called essentials of post Cold War
deterrence she was released recently
under the Freedom of Information Act
some interesting
it resurrects Nixon's madman theory as
it was called it says that the United
States should portray itself as
irrational and vindictive with
leadership elements out of control and
it should exploit the nuclear arsenal
for that purpose this madman posture can
be beneficial to creating and
reinforcing fears and doubts among
adversaries real or potential in this
case perhaps the big players in the
region Saudi Arabia and Iran whose
potential rapprochement which has been
going on now for almost a year is
doubtless a very frightening prospect in
Washington well we don't have
documentary evidence so that speculation
but i think it's not unreasonable well
there's a lot to say about all these
topics these are things I'm just
mentioning and related aspects of the
post-war global system that haven't even
haven't even mentioned but let me just
leave it something to think about and
turn to something related namely the
institutional structures the
institutional framework that was
designed for World Order 50 years ago
and how it's fared what it looks like
today the institutional structure had
three basic components one was an
international political order that's
articulated in the United Nations
Charter a second part was was concerned
with the human rights and the norms for
the behavior of governments towards
their citizens that's the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights where its
50th anniversary will be celebrated or
maybe mourn in December 1998 the the
third component was an international
economic order that's the Bretton Woods
system as it's called designed by the
United States and Great Britain the
global manager and the junior partner
I want to talk mostly about the third
but a few words about the first to the
first the international political order
essentially the UN Charter that's based
on a very simple straightforward
principle and elaborated in various ways
the principle is that the threat or use
of force in international affairs is
disallowed unacceptable has to be barred
totally with two exceptions one
exception is when the threat or use of
force is specifically authorized by the
Security Council after the Security
Council determines that peaceful means
have failed the second is the famous art
of article 51 which says that nothing in
this charter abrogates the right of
self-defense against armed attack until
the Security Council acts as a rather
narrow and specific notion it means for
example that if Cuban armies invade the
United States the United States is
supposed to notify the Security Council
and then until the Security Council has
a chance to do something about this
terrible threat it's allowed to defend
itself in any way that's necessary
whether that example is hypothetical or
not you know it depends on what you want
to believe the Cuban threat to the
United States was recently downgraded by
the Pentagon so we don't have to tremble
and total fear anymore that elicited a
good deal of anger and Congress and the
conclusion was rejected by the White
House which appealed to the which
invoked the national threat Cuba's
threat to the national security in
existence of the United States just a
few months ago in the course of
rejecting World Trade Organization
jurisdiction when the European Union
protested before the WTO gross
us violations of trade agreements in
international law that already been
condemned by sweat every international
agency including even the normally quite
compliant Organization of American
States so depending on where you sit
that example was real or hypothetical
but whatever it is that's the exception
permitted by the UN Charter by the
framework of inner of the political
order and the International received
international law the those are the only
exceptions to the threat or use of force
now of course there's no in for
enforcement mechanism this has to be by
acceptance I the only there is in fact
an enforcement mechanism mainly the
great powers and to be realistic exactly
one of them namely the United States so
that's the enforcement mechanism but
that's the physis to show that the whole
system is null and void because the
United States rejects the principles out
of hand and it rejects them both in
practice and in fact in doctrine there's
no need to waste time on the practice in
the past half-century the bombing of a
pharmaceutical plant and the Sudan a
couple of weeks ago as a recent
illustration but one that's completely
trivial in historical context though I
suppose that the terrorists destruction
of half of the medical supplies and
fertilizers in the United States might
be taken a shade more seriously whatever
the practice maybe and you can know that
perfectly well or should what's
interesting about the recent years is
that official doctrine expresses with
great clarity and precision the utter
contempt for the principles of world
order that are of course grandly
proclaimed when they serve some power
interest this has been going on since
the Reagan years and it is a change
since the Reagan a doctrinal change
since you might say as a change towards
greater honesty
it's change the since the reagan years
the United States has officially
reinterpreted the article 51 the crucial
article to justify its repeated reliance
on force it has held that article 51 or
Thun quoting actually article 51
authorizes self-defense against future
attacked article 51 permits the United
States to defend its interests this even
became even more ludicrous in the
Clinton years it was all formulated
rather straightforward laid by
ambassador Albright now Secretary of
State when she informed the UN Security
Council which was then refusing to go
along with some us demands about Iraq
she informed the Security Council that
the United States will act
multilaterally when we can unilaterally
when we must in an area important for
our interests that's unmans
unconstrained by the World Court which
had already been dismissed as irrelevant
10 years earlier by the most solemn
treaty obligations the foundations of
World Order and so on stressed that the
only innovation in all of this in the
past 15 years is that contempt for these
high principles is now openly proclaimed
with the acquiescence and the applause
of the educated classes that's a change
but it serves to indicate where the
foundations of World Order stand after
50 years in brief the United Nations and
its charter are fine when they serve as
an instrument of power otherwise the
decisions and the condom nations don't
even are there not even worth reporting
and they are not reported little um
obeying incidentally there's you've been
following i'm sure the recent debate
about founding an international criminal
court on war crimes
and as you know the United States
essentially alone I mean few minor
powers the United States is essentially
alone refused to go along with that a
u.s. opposition is effectively a veto
when the General Assembly votes you know
151 to one on something or two if the
u.s. picks up a client state that
amounts to Evita just first-rate power
reasons nothing obscure about it and
this effectively vetoes the Criminal
Court of on war crimes the official
argument that was given was by the
Clinton administration in Congress was
that an international tribunal might
bring a might carry out frivolous
prosecution of US soldiers engaged in
peacekeeping operations that's not very
credible especially if you look at the
u.s. role us is mostly disqualified from
peacekeeping operations that's literally
true the reason is because it has a very
unusual maybe unique military doctrine
and that is that no military forces are
permitted to come under any threat so if
there's any threat at all they're you
supposed to react with overwhelming
force and that means that in any
situation that involves civilians or you
know anything short of total war the US
military simply can't be deployed and in
fact isn't if you look at the
peacekeeping operations so that's not a
plausible argument but there are other
ones that are plausible in are barely
beneath the surface surface and that is
the very likely concern that an
independent judicial a query if it
existed cut might as it should move up
the chain of command and that's going to
lead it very soon to pretty high places
including the White House that would be
true whether the issue is Indochina or
Central America and Panama or Somalia or
other exploits but let's turn to the
second element of World Order the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
you will doubtless we will all here much
rhetoric in the coming months about the
universality
of the high principles that are
proclaimed than about the challenge of
relativity that's posed by various bad
guys around the world those charges will
be accurate enough unfortunately but and
probably understated but you're unlikely
to hear about a different topic namely
us adherence to the Universal
Declaration both in action and in
doctrine well again I'll put aside
action and just keep to the doctrine if
you look at a doctor and you find out
quickly that the United States is a
leader of the relativist camp on one is
unlikely to see headlines about that but
it's pretty clear the United States
dismisses one fundamental component of
the Universal Declaration completely as
having no status that's the component
that's concerned with socio-economic the
socio-economic provisions which have the
same status as any others in the
Universal Declaration but the US doesn't
agree they are a letter to Santa Clauses
ambassador Jeanne Kirkpatrick put it
they are preposterous and the dangerous
incitement as they were described by US
ambassador Morris Abrams he was in fact
testifying at the discussing part of the
discussion of the UN Commission on Human
Rights which was considering a
declaration of on the right of
development which very closely
paraphrased the socio-economic
conditions of the Universal Declaration
and which incidentally the u.s.
proceeded to veto well again there's
more to say but let's proceed to the
third point the international economic
order the Bretton Woods system as it's
called in its institutions that's all
over the front pages right now with the
fears of global meltdown that might
affect privileged folk like us as well
as just the usual victims so therefore
it's news well the Bretton Woods system
had two basic principles set up
institutions like World Bank in the eye
but it hat which are called the Bretton
Woods institutions but it had two basic
principles which one has to keep in mind
they're important one principle was to
liberalize trade a goal was to
liberalize trade more free trade the
second principle had to do with capital
flow and it was the opposite the goal
was to regulate capital flow and control
key fixed exchange rates keep capital
controls and so on that was agreed by
both the US and the British negotiators
the u.s. negotiator main negotiator was
harry's extra white british John Maynard
Keynes and it expressed a very common
conception at the time which has a lot
of plausibility it's built into the
rules the IMF so up till there's now an
effort u.s. is leading an effort to try
to change those rules but up until now
they've been breached many times the
rules of the IMF still authorized
countries to regulate capital flow and
they prohibit the IMF from giving
credits at the cover capital flight and
even you who follow these affairs will
know how well that one's been observed
anyhow it is a rule well there was a was
thinking behind this there were reasons
the reasons were in part theory with
with some international economists call
an incompatibility thesis which in fact
remains the guiding principle of punk
Ted the main UN Commission conference
and scrawled on trade and development
and the the theory is that capital
flight so short-term speculative flows
lead the exchange rate fluctuations and
so on that they're going to undermine
trade they're going to undermine trade
and investment so they're inconsistent
with one another can't liberalize both
and recent experiences I think
consistent with that the assumption the
second reason was not a theory it was a
true
the truism is that free flow of capital
definitely undermines democracy in the
welfare state which was at that time far
too popular to ignore to the mid 20th
century the basic point on essentially
paraphrasing white and canes here the
basic point is that capital controls
allow governments to carry out monetary
and tax policies to sustain unemployment
incomes social programs maintain public
goods without fear of capital flight
which will punish this irrational
behavior irrational and that it's only
for the benefit of people not for the
benefit of investors and speculators and
it will be punished by capital flight
for obvious reasons the so capital
that's the essential point free flow of
capital and quickly creates what some
international economists call a virtual
Senate of financial capital which will
impose its own social policies by the
threat of capital flight which leads to
higher interest rates at the economic
slowdown budget cuts for health and
education and recession maybe collapse
it's a powerful weapon all of that was
articulated quite explicitly and
essentially the words I've you repeated
at the time by the US UK negotiators and
it's not particularly controversial fact
not controversial at all then or now if
you think it through it's kind of
obvious as it was to them and all of
that is quite important to keep in mind
in looking at the current period because
there's a challenge to that in the last
25 years and we see the consequences the
and it's now being re-evaluated because
the consequences are even hitting the
rich people that's where we are right
now well the Bretton Woods system as
formulated that his efforts to
liberalize trade and regulate capital
that was in place it was never you know
they were always discrepancies and so on
but in in essence it was in place and a
substantial to a substantial degree
through what is through the first half
of this period first quarter century
after it was established that's what's
sometimes called the Golden Age of
post-war state capitalism high rates of
growth of the economy of productivity
expansion of the social contract right
through the 50s and 60s the system was
dismantled from the early 1970s Richard
Nixon unilaterally abrogated its basic
principles other major financial centers
joined in by the 1980s the capital
controls were mostly gone in the rich
countries and the smaller economies like
South Korea were simply compelled to
drop them that incidentally is widely
regarded now as a major factor in its
recent collapse alongside of quite
extreme market failures in the private
sector throughout East and Southeast
Asia and also the West which was
involved in crazed lending i should add
at this point that in the light of the
recent economic crisis in east asia that
the more serious analysts recognizance
insists that the east asian economic
miracle was quite real and
distinguishing East Asia from Southeast
Asia here they're quite different so one
of the most important and influential
and I think intelligent Joseph Stiglitz
is now the chief economist of the World
Bank is formally head of Council of
Economic Advisers here and it plays a
very important role he emphasizes in
recent World Bank publications and
elsewhere that this is post-crisis that
the East Asian economic miracle was not
only real but it was in his words and
amazing achievement historically without
precedent and furthermore he points out
based on very significant departures
from the official
so called Washington Consensus and that
it should should last it should thrive
in fact unless it's destroyed by
irrational financial markets as it could
be Stiglitz points out remember this is
the chief economist of the World Bank
I'm talking about in World Bank
publications that in the East Asia the
basis for the amazing achievements and
the miracle which has no precedent is
that government took major
responsibility for the promotion of
economic growth abandoning the religion
that markets know best and intervening
to enhance technology transfer relative
equality education health along with he
doesn't stress this be should have along
with industrial planning and
coordination and in fact strict capital
controls until they were forced to
relinquish them in the last few years
stiglitz also mentions though he doesn't
go into it that the rich countries every
one of them from England through the
United States up to the present every
single one of them had followed a
somewhat similar path actually far more
so than the World Bank has yet
acknowledged another big topic I can't
go into but an interesting one well
again worth keeping in mind well what
has happened since the system the
Bretton Woods system essentially
collapsed in the early 1970s it did in
the Golden Age of post-war state
capitalism just focusing on the rich
countries primarily the United States
and Britain though others happens to
others in various degrees and an
integrated economy over the rich
countries as a whole the growth of the
economy and the growth of productivity
have slowed very markedly actually
contrary to which you read trade also
slowed if you look closely in the United
States specifically in England incomes
stagnated or declined throughout this
period for the great majority of the
population working conditions
deteriorated
social services have been significantly
cut infrastructure has is in serious
danger with very little required public
spending the welfare state has
significantly rodin there has also been
a closely correlated dramatic increase
in incarceration it's closely Karthik
correlated because a large part of the
society is just becoming superfluous for
wealth formation in a uncivilized
societies and out the death squads to
kill them in a civilized society you
throw them in jail the since 1980 when
the system really took shaped you know
was in place at that time incarceration
rates in the United States were roughly
like other industrial countries kind of
at the high end but not off the scale
and Sony crime rates in the united
states are not unusually high contrary
to what you read i mean again sort of
toward the high end but not unusual with
one exception namely killing with guns
but that's a separate matter has to do
with laws cultural patterns on the main
do with crime the and that remains the
case fact crime rates have declined
since 1980 but the incarceration has
gone way up it's a reflection of the i
think it's a direct reflection of the
inequality in the need for social
control it tripled in the 1980s been
rising very fast through the 1990s it's
now five to ten times as high as other
industrial societies in fact the US is
world champion in imprisoning its
population at least among countries
where there's any minimally reliable
statistics if you take the prison
population into account that adds
another 2% to the unemployment rate
which places the u.s. squarely in the
middle of the European level actually
even without that it's not at the bottom
believe it or not it's about thirty
percent of course this requires a little
you have to
decide what you're talking about if you
count in prison labor which is not
trivial and very good for folks like
Boeing aircraft and AT&T and others
terrific workforce if you count them in
well then of course the unemployment
figures change again high borrowing I
highly leveraged the character of
investment is something new incidentally
a lot of things are old but this is new
that's accelerating the irrationality of
markets they've become financial markets
they've become much more volatile and
unpredictable they've been wildly
fluctuating exchange rates related to
speculative flows and there have been
increasing financial crises the IMF
really recently did a study of the
period nineteen eighty to nineteen
eighty and ninety five 15-year period
and it found that about eighty percent
of its roughly 180 members had had one
or more banking crises ranging from
significant to quite serious and again
that's wouldn't a surprise canes and
white or any of the framers of Bretton
Woods or the economists of the thinking
behind them same period again in
conformity with their thinking has been
an assault and attack on free markets a
sustained assault on free markets to
quote the head of Economic Research of
the World Trade Organization in a major
technical study that was led by the
Reagan nights they were talking free
markets for the poor but doing something
else for the rich he this analyst
Patrick low estimates the effect of
Reaganite protectionist measures at
about three times as high as those of
the other industrial countries which
were bad enough well again that's what
was expected during the Reagan years
what's a lofty rhetoric but protection
was essentially virtually doubled the
public subsidy which is another
violation of free-trade principle was
increased bailouts increased both for
domestic banks international banks
the in the United States has happened
throughout the world but mostly in the
United States in the United States the
goal was to somehow overcome very
serious management failures that were
leading to a decline of us industry and
we're a matter of great concern at the
time all of this continues under Clinton
alongside the free-market rhetoric
radical interference with free trade is
standard when convenient professor Noam
Chomsky speaking in june nineteen ninety
eight at the university of calgary in
canada
