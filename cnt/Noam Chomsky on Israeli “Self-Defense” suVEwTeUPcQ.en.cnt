also recently there was an Israeli
attack on on Gaza that ended up
I believe murdering the whole family of
Palestinians and what days alleged was a
reaction to an attack by gossips on
Israel and and there's been a lot of
reactions mainly by presidential
candidates that Israel what it's doing
is essentially goes along with it's
right to defend itself and defend its
sovereignty
how would you react that kind of react
to that the same way Nazis reacted to
the fact that they were defending
themselves in the Warsaw Ghetto against
an uprising against the Germans which
was true of affect yes that's first of
all about this destruction of the family
there's a little more behind it around
what you looked into Israel claim that
they were aiming the attack at an
Islamic Jihad leader who wasn't there
and never lived there and may not even
exist the great Israeli intelligence
just didn't have any intelligence about
it was at in huts and where he wouldn't
have lived even if he had existed so
okay we'll kill some more hours you know
but if you look back at the record you
know I've reviewed it in detail in print
if you want to look but it's very
straight there's a standard procedure
starts back in November 2015 when Israel
withdrew its settlers from Gaza but kept
the army there so it's still occupied
but they made a deal in November 2015
with the Palestinians Palestinian
Authority at a time
the deal was they would withdraw the
settlers and
they would Alston's would agree no
violence and they would permit the
airports to be rebuilt and open they
allow trade and other arrangements it's
interesting to look at that because
that's replicated over and over what
happened is a couple of weeks later
there was an election January 2016 free
election validated by international
observers actually the first free
election in the arab world there was
only one problem with the wrong people
one Hamas won the election Israel
responded at once by violence and by
imposing an embargo us did the same also
the u.s. initiated plans for a military
coup overthrew the government this is
reported by the US consulate does that
we have detailed information about it
okay then a couple months later the
Israel again escalated the attack
finally the coup Hamas preempted the
coup they knew that who was coming off
that stop that there was a civil war
they want that's called your Hamas
forcefully taking over the government
overthrowing the u.s. sponsored coup
then there's a regular pattern there's
an agreement reached like the kind I
just mentioned Hamas lives up to it is
really ignores it at one point
Israel escalates its activities it's
violence
Hamas reacts and Israel comes in with a
major attack saying we're defending
ourselves then another agreement is
reached same story this is repeated over
and over so yes it's true Israel's
defending itself you have your jackboot
somebody's neck and every once in a
while they respond
you got a defender
