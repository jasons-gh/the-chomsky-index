thanks very much for agreeing to be
interviewed by the world network for
saving children from radiation I wanted
to start off by asking you about a nun
Grover who's the UN special rapporteur
and and Grover on the right of everyone
to the enjoyment of the highest
attainable standard of physical and
mental health just released a report on
fukushima from his extensive visit in
november 2012 and it has over two pages
of recommendations it's quite damning
report I mean some of the main points
have been reported elsewhere but they
include the Japanese government's lack
of real safety measures the response
system that was on coordinated and
inadequate or underutilized the
radiological emergency plans were
piecemeal and inadequate and then the
ties between the Japanese government's
nuclear regulatory body and the Japanese
nuclear industry particularly TEPCO the
company that owns the Fukushima Daiichi
nuclear complex were not transparent and
far too close to allow for independent
regulation based on the best science
available and as a result safety was
compromised since the accident the
Japanese government refuses to take
responsibility for resetting people
particularly children from areas where
the long-term radiation dose exceeds
internationally accepted levels
furthermore the Japanese government has
indemnified tapco against further losses
by underwriting the cleanup effort and
other financial liabilities this has
left the Japanese people responsible for
paying tepco's debt in the section on
radiation safety and school textbooks
reported safe dose according to the text
textbooks that now given to Japanese
children is up to 100 millisieverts and
as the report notes that the UN report
notes this is not consistent with law in
Japan international standards or
epidemiological research then there are
host of other problems identified in the
report that affect the mythical of
physical and mental health of the
communities in around Fukushima as well
as the nuclear workers in the plant in
charge of Deacon
Nation efforts so first of all what is
your response to the findings from the
UN special rapporteur and your knowledge
of how the Japanese government has gone
about dealing with this horrendous
catastrophe that happened in March 2011
well from the very beginning the
government has held back information has
tried to back off from taking action in
many ways has made the catastrophe
considerably worse naturally one can
only be critical of that and I hope that
international and domestic pressures
will lead the government to proceed in a
more constructive fashion we should
recognize that they're not alone so for
example it hasn't been investigated
closely because there's a principle
which as we never investigate our own
crimes only crimes and someone else it's
a overriding principle but there's
pretty substantial evidence accumulating
from Iraqi and international scientists
that the levels of radiation in parts of
Iraq which have been the targets of
primary us British attack are extremely
am I some reports from Fallujah indicate
that the radiation levels are
approximately Hiroshima my level well we
don't know if in detail because it
doesn't get investigated but those are
questions we should be asking ourselves
to when we condemn rightly condemned the
Japanese government for not taking
measures that it should the
as many consideration things to think
about including ourselves and of course
the u.s. rolled in radiation in Japan
and need not be discussed we should but
we should know about it and think about
it and want to do something about it on
the specific issue every measure of
course should be taken to ensure the
safety of the children to take positive
steps towards either eliminating nuclear
power efforts entirely or else at least
ensuring that the highest standards are
maintained in pursuing yes it's
interesting to mention Hiroshima because
according to the UN's report the amount
of radioactive cesium released by the
Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns 168 times
that released in the hero shopping for
Shima bombing and yet there are 300,000
children living in the radioactive areas
in Fukushima Prefecture the mandatory
evacuation started in Japan is settled
lower than that of the Chernobyl
disaster and it seems that the Japanese
government as you mentioned is not
currently taking its responsibilities
seriously with regard to helping people
relocate making sure that they can
relocate economically speaking and so on
particularly the question of children
which is related to the legal case that
is being pressed against the Japanese
government by the world network for
saving children from radiation we're
whittling
yep obviously think the Japanese
government should do more but I think we
should as well it's a the use of nuclear
power is an international responsibility
nuclear power is being used because of
the extraordinary damage it caused by
fossil fuels and the lack of
Independence particular case the lack of
direct access to fossil fuels that
imposes a severe responsibility on the
wealthy countries to vastly expand their
research development and efforts of his
regard the sustainable development which
will reduce the threat of disasters like
this and both the threat to the children
of course that should be a primary
concern right now so it's a broad
responsibility it's fine for say me to
criticize the Japanese government for
its theaters which are substantial but
there's more urgent tasks were you and
for me right yeah in fact the
international atomic energy agency is
incorporation now and part of the
cleanup of the health issues in japan
and yet they have to set this agencies
at the same time responsible for
promoting the nuclear power well that's
a tricky issue in fact as some of the
most prominent and active climate
scientists like kids handsome for
example after in favor of pursuing
nuclear power arguing that with all of
its dangers its which are not slight by
any means the alternatives could be a
lot worse fossil fuels are of a
devastating impact
like the real alternative would be
developing sustainable options for
energy maybe some others and that
requires a substantial efforts which are
much to limit so and in their history of
the world Japan is the only country to
have suffered a nuclear attack and it
was under occupation from the US until
nineteen fifty four and yet it's also a
country that is at the same time as
developing nuclear power it's 54 nuclear
power stations it is highly geologically
active and so much of the nuclear
technology in Japan was a product of us
technology westinghouse in general
electric what to what extent do you
believe the original decision to develop
nuclear power in japan was a japanese
decision versus a question of what the
u.s. thought was best for the
development of the country well expand
was very much under view at US influence
of course and under direct occupation
and remains under US influence so for
example when just a couple of years ago
by the Japanese Prime Minister dared to
raise the question of the removing US
bases from Okinawa over the population
has been struggling against them for
years he was pretty quickly ousted under
us pressure so yes the u.s. role was
significant however we have to ask what
the options were right after the Second
World War the US made great efforts to
shift both Europe and Japan to use of
fossil fuels of oil particularly that
was a century of us monopoly but
close to it and the singeing was
explicit George Kennan one of the
leading planners pointed out what was
then secret naughty classified documents
that the if the United States can
maintain control over the major energy
resources of the world from Maryland at
least it will have what he called veto
power over Japan because it will have a
kind of a stranglehold require our royal
well there were other alternatives and
then as there are now they should have
much more obvious now than they were
then but the choice of nuclear power was
in part of reaction to this it's one of
the ways of escaping a fetish crowd of
course has the immediate fossil that
does not have rich fossil fuel resources
some cold not much and therefore the
Second World War was in the Pacific was
one major factor of it mr. pounds effort
to gain access to the fossil fuels of
Southeast Asia oil Southeast Asia after
the Oracle T the ABCD countries of
America Britain China Dutch
at cloak of that France had closed off
the Empire in the early 1930s the
imperial system closed because in an
effort to protect the west from rising
Japanese competition and Japan reacted
and very brutally by trying to comfort
those resources that led to the same
World War after the war the u.s. plan
was to restore Japan's Empire to provide
Japan with what Canon called an empire
toward the south which essentially
restored Japan's no border but under us
control and that meant the US would
maintain what an incall veto power over
and within that context it was a turn to
the clear fuel so there's many factors
that should be considered when we think
about this the real option and I think
most knowledgeable scientists others
would agree with this is to find
alternatives to destructive energy
resources and that includes fossil fuels
and nuclear energy including elsewhere
maybe solder and which brings us forward
to today because Japan has a sizable
stockpile of plutonium as a result of
its civilian nuclear power operations
and there are some elements within
Japanese political society you want to
overcome overturn the ban on nuclear
weapons develop nuclear weapons the
United States is saying you're safe
under our nuclear umbrella which has
been their policy since the Second World
War and yet there are increasing
tensions in the region is a VR more
assertive China I wonder how that boy in
your view plays out in terms
what is going on now with the US as
you're safe under our nuclear umbrella
that begs a lot of questions after the
nuclear umbrella is extremely hazardous
it's practically led to destruction of
the United States that's worth
remembering that states do not at
contrary which read international
relations theory states do not take
security as I per hour you can easily
show that so just take us history us is
in the lead on this most important
country and it's also an unusually open
society so we have a lot of evidence we
just take a brief look at the record
which includes Japan in the early 1950s
the United States had extraordinary
security enormous power half the world's
wealth that incomparable security there
was one potential threat ICBMs with
hydrogen bomb words they didn't exist
but there were potential threat well the
Russians knew that they will far behind
the u.s. in technology and technology of
war making so they actually offered it
to a treaty to the united states to ban
these destructive weapons how did the
u.s. react well we know there's a harley
authoritative history of nuclear weapons
a written by mcgeorge monday the
national security adviser from kennedy
and johnson via access to rich array of
internal documents he writes more or
less in passing that he could not find a
single document paper that even
considered the possibility so the idea
of even considering the possibility of
saving yourself from total destruction
didn't arise because other factors were
issues were more important we go ten
years beyond that 1962 john f kennedy
was willing to face a subjective
probabilities on judgment of a third to
a half of nuclear war which would have
been massively destructive in order to
establish a principle the principle was
that the United States has the right to
have offensive nuclear weapons
everywhere and no one else has that
right that was the principle if you look
closely and in order to establish that
smiling face nuclear war that involved
Japan right before the Cuban Missile
Crisis six months before Kennedy had
sent that mr. long albury by CB and
long-range missiles to Okinawa with
nuclear warheads that was threatening
China at a period of great tension in
Asia that was a major conflict
developing between India and China well
that would have brought the destruction
to Japan that was nineteen sixty-two you
want to ten years later in 1973 Henry
Kissinger called a nuclear alert what
was the reason the reason was that there
was a war in the Middle East Israel Arab
War Russia and the United States had
made an agreement to impose a ceasefire
but Kissinger secretly advised Israel
that they didn't have to observe the
ceasefire they can continue and the
nuclear alert was intended to warn
Russia to stay away a nuclear alert
everyone knows so that's 1973 another 10
years Ronald Reagan's in office and his
administration decided to test Russian
defenses by simulating nuclear attack on
Russia with you know advanced bombers
and so on the Russians and entirely
understand was going on they didn't know
whether it was real or simulated so they
fall the major ruler we came pretty
close to war we can go on right till
today right just in fact just a couple
of weeks ago months ago if actually if
you listen to the President Obama's last
speech the big speech on shifting
nuclear a global pivot to Asia yeah well
more than that the new military policy
that he announced couple weeks ago there
was an interesting sentence in he said
that are assassinated meeting called
that but the assassination of Osama bin
Laden is it carried dangers and
threatened our relations with Pakistan
will you take a look beyond that it's
much more than that the Navy SEALs who
were sent in to assassinate bin Laden
were under orders to fight their way out
if they had to if they had had to the
old weight of US military force would
have entered and passed on as a
professional army dedicated to defense
of the sovereign to the country they
have nuclear
weapons probably laced with jihadi
elements the chief of staff of Pakistan
was informed about the intrusion and
mobilized forces he thought it was from
India General Petraeus in Kabul mobile
as US forces scrambled us plant and
pretty close to a war which was grown
into a nuclear war this was in order to
carry out an assassination in someone
else's territory what this tells us
that's easy to go on is that being under
a nuclear umbrella is a threat it's not
security it's a major threat these are
the weapons that can instantly destroy
everything they're under the control of
leadership elements that do not regard
security is a high priority and never
have and are willing to take serious
risks so the very existence of these
weapons is a major threat to survival
and in fact there is a legal obligation
if anyone cares but determined by the
World Court that the nuclear powers have
a legal responsibility to live up to
their conditions under the
non-proliferation treaty to make good
faith efforts to eliminate these
destructive weapons so talk about a
security blanket i think is extremely
misleading how do you compare the
reporting on the Fukushima disaster
thinking back to the reporting around
Chernobyl in the nineteen of room Geno
in the 1980s do you see significant
differences launch moguls we regarded
correctly as a major crime of the Soviet
Union
more reason to condemn the evil empire
for its crimes argue about whether it's
operable but it's certainly pretty awful
and the reason is so now I check the
client we should be much more honest
about that and as I say we should always
look in the mirror and ask well whatever
responsibility is and what we can do
about it I think we can do a lot how do
you think we could best place pressure
on the Japanese government because
similarly in Japan it's not being
reported there are lots of problems
already starting to see health effects
of children in the region women who are
pregnant at the time of the nuclear
disaster they didn't have a proper
evacuation plan some people stayed in
highly irradiated areas as the plume
came across beyond the 20 kilometers
exclusion zone that people were
evacuated from but they were not
evacuated in the direction that the
plume was traveling so they were
irradiated for over a month and they
state that not being told to be
evacuated and very little of this has
been reported in the mainstream Japanese
media in a similar way that it's not
really reported here about crimes of the
US government and I wonder what we could
do to help force the issue into the open
with regard to what's going on in Japan
because when I was over there many
people were extremely concerned with
they were not getting the correct
information from the Japanese government
their health concerns were not being
taken seriously they were very the UN
report talks about not just the physical
welfare and health of the people but
also their mental health some people
were moved multiple times some people up
as ten times the different emergence
centers very dislocating older people
were moved all over the country onion
110,000 people are still in evacuation
centers around have not been able to
move back and yet kuriyama cities the
second biggest city in fukushima is
there's just over 300,000 children still
in the area of fukushima who are in
areas that are above 1 millisievert the
Japanese government is saying we don't
need to do anything about that and the
Japanese media is following that live
what would you advise over in Japan that
they can do and also here with respect
to employment there's an immediate kind
of blackout of the story like many other
media blackout can try to put pressure
on the media to report it can support
the domestic groups in Japan that are
protesting it and trying to gain some
make some progress in dealing with the
issues we can pressure our own
governments to provide aid and
assistance to carry out the very
substantial task of a proper relocation
and resettlement and beyond that we can
pressure our own governments which you
should be doing independently Fukushima
to take very seriously far more suitors
than they're doing now the task of
developing alternative sustainable
energy systems which will cut back the
use of destructive technologies which
won't leave us with the awful choice
between the clear energy and fossil
fuels and just to kind of finish on that
question because as you mentioned
earlier James Hansen who has really
brought to life from the late 1980s the
question of climate changing global
warming that we're currently worsening
as co2 levels
you need to increase the use of fossil
fuels continues to increase and more
extreme forms of energy are being
utilized so that the US has gone from
being worried about running out of
natural gas to having a glut of natural
gas lights and oil and is predicted to
rival saudi arabia by 2020 or so in
terms of its ability to get more oil out
of the ground what are some real terms
is because james hansen is very much in
favor of nuclear power which is
surprising when you see not only the
effects of fukushima that are going to
go on for decades that could happen at
any time at any of the other four
hundred-odd planets around the world the
nuclear industry is very much in favor
of expansion of course and there are any
number of arguments not just not safety
but also on economics that there's no
way that nuclear power could be an
answer to a Triscuit generation and of
course once you build a nuclear power
plant they're so huge that they
practically have to be run all the time
they require you to justify them by
ramping up energy use so there's out of
the window goes in a concept of energy
conservation and that was quite
noticeable in Japan when they closed all
54 reactors thirty percent of the
electricity supply there were no
blackouts and Japan continued in other
words they didn't need the nuclear power
reactors in one sense questions would be
used to reclose Brooklyn dry so they
practiced a lot of conservation but
moving forward how could Japan
realistically move away from fossil
fuels
away from nuclear power because the
Japanese government now is investing
heavily in the extraction of methane
clathrates frozen methane deposits which
is supposed to rival fossil fuels by two
to one incredibly dangerous so they seem
to be going exactly the opposite
direction what do you think is the
answer that well I don't know mr. Hansen
personally but I suspect you'd agree
with everything you said I understood
his statements to be saying look we have
an immediate choice between two awful
alternatives and we have to evaluate and
see which is worse and he thinks he's
right the fossil fuels are worth but
that doesn't mean were restricted to the
two alternatives there are many other
things could be done they in fact what's
imma take say of the United States
richest country in the world enormous
advantages Canada pretty much the same
they are in the lead internationally in
trying to destroy the environment right
there in the lead no they have to be no
I'm and then the United States and
Canada for example there's lots of
things that can be done very simply in
fact like weatherization of homes which
would first of all I'll be a big shot in
the arm for the economy with a lot of
bloke people to work and would very
sharply restrict the use of energy would
improve living conditions with safe
wasted resources all sorts of advantages
sorry been done in many places like in
England not here or simply we do not
have to leave it to China to be in the
lead in developing advanced
technologically advanced solar panels
I'm its kind of hurt test and are they
the best approach well maybe so maybe no
technically competent to judge but I
know there are proposals right here in
this institution effect from engineers
and somebody else would have to evaluate
them to use solar energy with collectors
outside the Earth's atmosphere that we'd
use microwave transmission to bring
power to earth is it feasible well I'm
not one to judge but these are the kinds
of options that should be pursued
seriously and the resources are
available the at in fact they're being
cut back like right at this moment of
research in the United States is being
reduced it's being reduced because of
pressures and Congress to cut back
scientific investigation and that's
happening across the board the a couple
of weeks ago there was an issue of
Science magazine main science journal
which had three interesting news items
in it the one was that measured new
measures of the ocean temperatures
showed that they were ironed that ever
been a second was a technical study on
the new discoveries about the extreme
dangers of kind of reaching a tipping
point with the use of fossil fuels the
third news item was from Congress the
House of Representatives has three
committees concerned with energy and
they had picked
the new chairs of the three committees
all climate change deniers the two of
them with long-standing ties to the
fossil fuel industry that's the richest
and most powerful country in the world
and if we're going to if we're not going
to take the lead and worse if we're
going to black way behind then the
chances of avoiding the horrible choice
between fossil fuels and nuclear energy
are very slight so there are things we
can do right this minute there are major
efforts in the United States to turn
this into what sometimes called the
stupid nation that is insisting on the
moving as rapidly as possible towards
the proverbial lemmings do let's race
toward the cliff and that's what we're
doing I mean actually of roughly a
hundred relevant countries the United
States the only one that it does not
even have a national policy on energy
conservation and or or of the use of
sustainable energy as random policy
scattered around but no national policy
every other country does and we should
be in the lead not liking the behind and
I think those are the it we should
certainly be doing making every effort
to support the popular groups in Japan
that are concerned with their immediate
and overwhelming problem of saving
hundreds of thousands of children them
overcoming this disaster but at the same
time we should be looking inwards and
asking why we are making where are we in
the lead in making the problem worse
much worse and leaving people like James
Hansen with this terrible choice it
seems to ask one find a question about
that for now
for the various countries around the
world despite the ongoing horrendous
catastrophe in Fukushima that is not
being dealt with appropriately by the
Japanese government according to the UN
and many others and the clear links
between nuclear power nuclear weapons
and then the question of how do we move
forward in terms of reducing co2 levels
back down to what they've been now that
they exceed their highest level and
three million years what is it I mean
everybody lives on the same planet and
yet the people who are making the
decisions the politicians are that at
the top and obviously the corporations
that they seem to answer to more than
there are people who elect that what is
it systematically that seems to drive
them towards solutions that are false
and continue down this path that the
best science tells us is essentially
suicidal in terms of civilization
biodiversity and so on do you think it's
possible within the confines of
capitalism to move to a completely
different energy paradigm capitalism's
of deaths note and you can also prove a
theorem about it I mean we don't
actually have capitalist systems we have
kind of mix systems various sorts but to
the extent that capitalist market
principles prevail and there's
substantial the extent they are a death
sentence for well-known reasons I mean
the if you're the CEO of corporation you
have a legal institutional requirement
to maximize profit
and market share fact that's a legal
responsibility there are what are called
externalities in the economics
literature they get a Flipnote here in
there the externalities are that in a
market transaction say you sell me at
carbs only we don't take account of the
effect on on her we take account of our
own welfare well you know sometimes the
externalities the ex nails are always
significant but sometimes they're
horrendous so take the current financial
crisis that's substantially reducible to
a mark to a well-known market for an
inherent market failure in Europe namely
when financial institutions make risky
transactions they do not take into
account what's called systemic risk the
risk of the whole system will collapse
that's an extra nella so you disregard
it but as much worse one the fate of the
species that's not taken into account in
principle is market transactions so to
the extent that these institutions
continue to function it's a death
sentence they're driven to try to
destroy the species so it's kind of hard
to blame the CEO of Exxon Mobil for
trying to destroy the planet which is
legal responsibilities under the
existing institutional structures don't
think that makes him a nice guy but we
might as well realize with the fall
floods and that has to do with you
mentioned before the relation between
decision-making a popular opinion the
relation is very slight there is also
really existing democracy which there
have been debates over the years but
whether democracy and capitalism
well abstract to be very concrete
question is really existing capitalism
compatible with democracy answers right
in front of us certainly not that we
live in a plutocracy not a democracy and
the evidence of this is overwhelming the
large majority of the population
literally has no influence on policy the
matter what they think if you look at
public studies of public opinion for
extensive in the United States and well
done you find that the most what I think
you and I would agree or the most
destructive policies both economically
ecologically and so on are much more
strongly supported as you move up for
wealth an income level for good reasons
and these of people will gain from in
the short term the children made by the
dull game will return and that's true
pretty much across the board and they're
the ones of making decisions in
photography not the population now
furthermore there are major efforts made
by the powerful institutions to try to
create a stupid tension so just to give
you one example Lee there is an
organization American Legislative
Exchange Council corporate funded
organization which develops legislation
for state legislatures and they are a
lot of money behind them says a lot of
clout most them go through you can
imagine what they are one new one that
they're starting is for schools k-12 the
program is to try to introduce what they
call a critical thinking into schools
sounds nice what's critical thinking
means balanced education so if in sixth
grade you teach what stated 99% of
scientists believe you also have to
teach to balance
what Senator Jim Inhofe believes that
there's nothing happening that's
balanced education while the idea is to
try to create a very stupid nation which
will continue to support which will
support the drive to destruction which
is institutionally required by the way
our institutions are constructed so it's
a big there's a lot to dismantle here
it's not just let's put money into
developing solar energy but let's ask
what structures we live in that are
driving us to destruction right I was
very hard on a positive note very hot by
the growing movement in Japan of
ordinary people to challenge their
government on mass with huge
demonstrations tens of thousands and not
just in Tokyo but all around the country
demanding the end of nuclear power and
in view not just a new way of generating
energy but much more transparent
government more answerable to the people
because the connections between
corporations and the government
particularly the nuclear corporations
the so-called nuclear village was so
intense something that we saw recently
in with the BP 2010 since I way i always
think we should look to ourselves
there's a reason for that too after the
Second World War of the United States of
course occupied japan and controlled it
the first couple of years after the war
the proconsul who basically ran it was
general McCarthy McCarthy probably
believed what he was taught in eighth
grade civics so he allowed Japan to move
on a course of democratization and it
was pretty significant
there were quite important developments
and in reaction to japanese fashion up
happening all over japan when the
liberals in Washington discover that
Japan was being democratized that were
appalled and they instituted what was
called the reverse course to impose upon
Japan essentially corporate rule much
like here and it was done they had the
power to do it so this connection that
you're mentioning maybe would have
developed anyway but it developed with
direct us initiative under US controlled
something similar happened in Europe of
course it happens here so our hand is
everywhere for good reasons the rich
powerful country most powerful in
history and has enormous impact and what
happens so it makes sense to take a look
at all of these issues and ask what have
we done about it what can we do there
are always good answers to that well
thank you very much
