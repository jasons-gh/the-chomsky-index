moral relativism discussing skepticism
there there are no skeptic but you can
discuss it in a philosophy seminar but
no human being and in fact be a skeptic
would survive for two minutes if they
were so they're not and I think pretty
much seems true of moral relevance there
are no moral relativist people who
profess it discuss it abstractly but it
it doesn't exist in ordinary life and
sharpen the discussion level should
recognize that the concept moral
relativism rages over quite a broad
spectrum so the form of moral relativism
which is totally uncontroversial
Christmas true but there are s put this
there are ethical norms that very widely
over space at the time
that's a observation of fact denies that
similarly every other aspect of humans
varies quite widely so for example human
visual systems it can vary quite widely
in the way they function depending on
early experience that she's been shown
by experiment not with humans but with
other animals with essentially the same
visual system that you can change you
can change them right and just by early
experience that you can change you can
change them rather than just by early
experience at every biological system
and I assumed we were biological
organism so ever tomorrow
values ethical systems are also
biological systems every one of them can
vary quite widely depending on
experience that's not
so for example the human visual system
can be very experimentally so that it
will have district different
distributions of receptors that respond
to horizontal and vertical lines and
that will give very different perception
you can show it with cats and monkeys
same visual system on the other hand you
can't turn that human visual system into
a an insect visual system as you change
experience and this is quite general
across the biological domain including
moral systems there are there's a range
of options that's possible as variation
within that range but there also limits
to the range and in fact this takes us
to the is a tendency to move from the
uncontroversial concept of moral
relativism to a concept that is in fact
incoherent and that's to say that moral
values can range indefinitely that
belief which is hell is literally
incoherent it's based on the assumption
that moral values reflect culture but
then that raises the next question how
does the person acquired how does a
person acquire its that his or her
culture you don't get it by taking a
pill that you get your culture you
acquire your culture to fight observing
rather a limited number of behaviors and
actions and from those constructing
somehow in your mind of the set of
attitudes and beliefs that constitute
your culture but that act is very much
like learning a language form like
developing a visual system or in fact
that finding a scientific theory it's a
matter of making a great leap from
scattered data to some outcome and that
leap is made essentially the same way by
all individuals given relatively fixed
experience
and it's only possible if you have
extensive built-in innate structure just
as you can develop the human rather than
an insect visual system only if it's
guided by genetic instructions very
specific ones the same is true
acquisition of language the acquisition
of arithmetic all capacity acquisition
of a culture hence acquisition of moral
values but that means that the most
extreme form of moral relativism is
actually a committed of the belief in
universal values namely those that set
the frame in which this a tremendously
from data scattered data to a complex
relatively fixed system and take place
that's why the extreme version of moral
relativism which is common and I think
if we probe professed it is simply
incoherent if you adopt that position
you are committed to far-reaching
universal values and their existence
those that just as if you are studying
the visual system and you discover that
it can vary over a wide range you're
nevertheless affected by that very fact
that committed to the belief that there
are fixed in a genetically determined
constraints that set the framework in
which it can develop and then guide the
development of the structure even though
allowing a certain degree of variation
and in fact I think that the I won't
talk about post-modernism that's beyond
my capacity to discuss with which at
least has the merit of being into
coherent I'm not sure that
post-modernism even reaches that for
famous comment probably a pretty acid
person that used to say sometimes when
someone proposed something that's not
even false the take these examples a
slavery subjugation of women repression
of homosexuals and let's forget about a
variety of cultures just think about her
own in her own culture not that far back
but these were all perfectly accepted
dorms so it takes a repression of
homosexuals at one of the greatest
mathematicians of the 20th century Alan
Turing who also was a war hero in
Britain he's one of the people who
really saved Britain from the the German
assault II was instrumental in
developing the techniques that decoded
the German signals of the British were
able to determine where the bomber hit
and so on and so forth he was that
killed by the British government by a
forced treatment to cure his disease of
homosexuality it wasn't that long ago I
mean I wasn't when I was a graduate
student
normal values has advanced I would say
that what it means is that we have
penetrated more deeply into our own
actual moral ladders and seen as the
moral sphere extends that some things
that were considered completely normal
and admirable aren't so atrocious you
can't even think about it and the same
is true of the slavery subjugation of
women is very recently overcoming one
way to go yet but the changed
dramatically in the last 3040 years as I
mentioned beginning just with the
consciousness-raising groups brought
women to recognize that what they took
to be normal and necessary and even
unacceptable is in fact that completely
should be totally rejected okay that's
same thing widening of the morals your
seems true slavery a little bit earlier
they're still our slaves
estimated 30 million or so in the world
but it's regarded in fact if you look at
the history of overcoming of slavery in
the West that was substantially moral
arguments incidentally it's not that the
slave owners had no arguments they did
and it's worth attending to those
arguments in fact some of them really
have never been answered and the fact
that they're not answer it gives us some
insight that's always in fact in general
contrary to the views of the extreme
moral relativists relativists that
Marlow's the disagreements can be
debated you don't just have to scream at
each other you can look at the arguments
try to find some common ground it work
from the common ground try to reach a
conclusion that's immoral
it's often successful I think slavery
that one of the arguments during the
American Civil War of the slave owners
which is a serious argument is that they
argued that they are more moral than
north and industrialists and if for a
very simple reason they owned their
workers and therefore they take care of
them that just as if you own a car
you'll take care of it northern
industrialists rent their workers and
they don't take care of there's no
responsibility for them just as if you
rent a car you probably won't take care
of them
so therefore slavery is more moral than
industrial policy but instead of
concluding from it that saved slavery is
legitimate that we should conclude what
the working people in the north with in
the century and a half ago but we should
grow their inclusion there's a very
common belief among working people in
the United States that the wage labor is
fundamentally no different from slavery
the only different is it's temporary in
fact that was such a popular view that
it was a slogan to the Republican Party
it was Abraham Lincoln's view you could
read it in the New York Times it's taken
a long time to drive that understanding
out of people's heads and I don't think
it's driven very far I think it's a
right below the surface and it
continually comes out yeah I know but
let me quickly get to the second
question it's only just a comment on
this idea about regimes of truth I
suspect we agree about this but I mean I
think who go for probe wildly
exaggerated again there's a kind of a
truism which
not controversy that our systems have
some effect on the way the scientific
work recedes can be accepted and so on
sometimes it's at the extreme it's a
Stalinist good biology okay
there's corporate influences on how drug
trials are conducted that's true there
are professional constraints that I've
lived through them in my entire life
when I started my own professional work
I couldn't publish because it was too
inconsistent with accept that ideas in
fact the first book I wrote in 1955 it
didn't come out for 20 years that it
came out then it was submitted rejected
it came out later just as kind of like
for historical interest but then filled
and grown so sure that happiness but
it's Martin and there are
self-correcting procedures in the
sciences which work pretty well not
perfectly the pretty well so there is an
element of you know power relations that
enter into say scientific work but the
talk about regimes of power
it seems to me radically overstating the
case kind of like the move from
non-controversial moral relativism to
inhale here
