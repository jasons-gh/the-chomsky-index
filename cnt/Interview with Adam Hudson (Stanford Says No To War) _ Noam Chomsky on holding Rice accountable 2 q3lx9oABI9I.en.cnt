okay well I don't know a great deal
about the background of this event they
just found out about it but my
understanding is that that there's
essentially two issues that you're
confronting that one is the issue of
accountability the second is the issue
of University policy so it's a couple
words about each of these on the issue
of accountability the that's really not
much to debate Paul George just
mentioned that there is a standard for
the use of force in international
affairs the first of all is in the UN
Charter any use of force of
international affairs or for example any
threat of force such as the current
threat against Iraq is a criminal
offence it's a violation of the
fundamental principles of international
law codified the UN Charter alongside of
that stands the nuremberg tribunal which
has all just mentioned defined
aggression aggressive war as the supreme
international crime differing from other
war crimes
it encompasses all of the evil that
follows well the Iraq war is a kind of a
textbook example of aggression which is
also defined in the Nuremberg Tribunal
it's a perfect example that that means
that those responsible for the
aggression have committed the ultimate
crime and that includes everything
followed including the killing of
hundreds of thousands maybe ever made
people these refugees the country
virtually destroyed so much so that
Iraqis referred to it as comparable to
the Mongol invasions the sectarian
warfare which was inspired by then
everything else includes all the evils
of follows well there was discussion
that Berg about pre-emptive war the Nazi
a foreign minister was tried to charged
and convicted and hanged for various
crimes of which one of the most serious
was pre-emptive war he supported the
charge was he supported the Nazi
invasion of Norway at a time when
Germany knew that the British were
intending to invade Germany from Norway
so it was a clear case of pre-emptive
war
not considered a legitimate defense was
hanging in Tokyo Tokyo tribunals there
was an argument by the Japanese were
criminals that they were involved in
pre-emptive war remember how the war
that weird we were involved in started
10 years after Japanese freshman they
bombed two military bases in US
territories which had been taken from
their inhabitants with the violence of
guile half a century ago they bombed
those military bases because they knew
in fact they could read in the American
press that they were being prepared for
a major assault against Japan which
would as they could breathe would
incinerate the ant heaps in Japan in
which those creatures rolled around they
knew that piece of b-17 teams flying
fortresses were rolling off the Boeing
sembly lines and being said they're
prepared to incinerate the an teams and
that they were even being sent from the
European theater at that point the
attack to note the two military bases
from which the attack was to be launched
that's what we call the 8 which will
live in infamy they tried to offer that
defense but it was not considered
acceptable they were hanged
now those are pretty clear cases of
pre-emptive war now the Iraq war does
not price to that look there's no
serious in submission to a preprint
divorce
essentially this defensive irrelevant
the Japanese and the Nazis of course
professed the most noble ideals fact
it's hard to find
the case of the aggression of the
atrocities of history which are not
defended that way that was not
considered to defense and shouldn't have
been
well that's the stand it's not that the
Nuremberg standard is so noble in fact
it was deeply flawed morally in ways to
be Oh to be concerned about the
Nuremberg trials were based on the moral
principle that a war crime is a crime
that you committed and we didn't so for
example heavy bombing of the urban
concentrations was not committed to work
it considered a war crime because the
Allies did more of it than the Germans
German war criminals were able to defend
themselves successfully if they could
show that there are American or British
counterparts had committed the same
crimes
so as by no means an oval stand but it's
nevertheless a serious dent at a minimum
standard we shouldn't stand up for the
person who presided over the Nuremberg
tribunals the US Justice Robert Jackson
addressed the tribunal in a important
address and he said that we are handing
these defendants a poisoned chalice and
if we ever sip from him we ever do
something similar we must be subject to
the same judgments otherwise this trial
was a complete farce that poses the
question of accountability do we say
that the trial was a complete farce or
do we accept that in that limited
standard there's no question of the
applicability of the charges seems to me
that essentially finishes the question
of accountability on the korish question
remains to make a decision and what
about the question of University policy
well there is a principle which i think
is defensible and pretty much accepted
and always said that the university
should not consider the extracurricular
activities of its stakeholders students
faculty staff anyone say they should ask
if they're fulfilling their University
of responsibilities I think that's a
reasonable print of defensible principle
only however if it's taken seriously
so for example suppose that I say a
mathematician in Stanford
decides to take off a couple years and
rob and burn banks or to go off to South
Waziristan and advise al-qaeda on how to
carry out the nuclear terror in New York
Rome by this principle Stanford
shouldn't care when he comes back he's
admitted
if that condition is satisfied then we
can take the principle seriously I
suppose however that this person is
let's say a political economist and he
comes back after these activities to
teach courses on how to rob and burn
banks with good reason he suggests
that's the way to deal with the plunder
of the terrible and financial crisis
just robbing them burn them down and
teaches courses on how to do it or
suppose he comes back and that offers
instruction on how to construct small
nuclear weapons and sneak of into the
United States but I'm in New York let
the place up on the not implausible
grounds that that's the way to stop it
be really rational of the world nothing
else gonna work well at that point I
think the university does have a vision
is that meeting University
responsibilities make your own and if it
doesn't accept that and it shouldn't
accept that in even worst cases like
launching an impressive war crime well I
don't pretend to offer new answers to
these questions I think you should think
of through but I did think they are the
kinds of questions that should be
considered should be up
than your mind but consider the
questions of accountability and
university policy I think the message
was very clear we're calling for
more crimes particularly
executing a war of aggression against to
show me he said then also I said my
speech supreme enough so I think that
message has been paid for at least 200
people who have a maybe or maybe like
250 had the very least 2 minute
a lot of people I haven't seen before
other students so I think it did a
really good job of reaching out to a
wider
mr.
I think for the most part it was the
best rally I see in my own ears
wait very well there's nothing
