we're faced with this destructive
juggernaut and we there's a growing
sense that time is running short with
global warming corporate control of our
government and other governments and I
wonder if you believe that non-violence
is capable a non-violent approach is
capable of saving the day or do we need
to expand our strategies to encompass
other tactics if a non-violent approach
is not capable of doing it we might as
well kiss each other goodbye because
there's no question that a violent
approach won't work in fact a violent of
[Applause]
violence is exactly what systems of
power want you're moving to the arena
where they can where they dominate I
mean I remember debating this with kids
in the 60s who wanted you were going out
to demonstrations and you know one of
the wear the helmets because the police
are gonna attack and what I argued it on
I think is correct is that you shouldn't
if you wear a helmet they're going to
come back with assault rifles and if you
have an assault rifle they're gonna come
back with tanks and if you have tanks
they'll come back with nuclear weapons
I mean force is their strength the only
strength we have is non-violence and it
works in fact if you take a look at Iraq
it's quite a striking example nobody
looks at it this way but think about it
the United States was defeated in Iraq
it was it had to abandon its war aims
and if you look at the record step by
step the United States had to back down
it had to permit elections which had
tried to bar in all sorts of ways they
tried to control the outcome it couldn't
as late as January 2008 that late George
Bush announced that
err he finally announced the war by the
end they were announcing the war I'm
specifically explicitly no no more
fooling around about democracy and so on
they said the we must have a settlement
in which the United States has freedom
to compare it to carry out combat
operations indefinitely in Iraq and any
settlement must privilege us
corporations for investment meaning in
oil that was January 2008 had to back
down on that Forces Agreement back at
least formally they back down on it and
Obama's least formally living up to the
bush agreements every step of the way
the Iraqi victory was based on
non-violence the insurgents were never a
problem the US can kill insurgents
easily you know no matter how many there
are
if for the same reason I mentioned so
that's okay that's that's the
comparative advantage of a powerful
state but they could not deal with five
hundred thousand people in the streets
for testing you know what cold out by
you know Ayatollah Sistani and so on so
step by step there to back down it ended
up with a u.s. defeat which is quite
unusual you know state this powerful
fighting at a non-existent country it's
almost never defeated but it was in this
case and it's not the only case I mean
if you look at the achievement so there
were a lot of achievements of the past
even the past generation civil rights
movement women's rights anti-war
movement a lot of things have happened
all non-violently that's the only domain
in which the population can hope to
prevail so going back to your question
if non-violence doesn't work well like I
said kiss each other goodbye
