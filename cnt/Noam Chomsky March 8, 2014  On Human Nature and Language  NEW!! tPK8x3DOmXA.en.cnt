first question always is whether this is
working can you hear me way back there
okay yeah good
second if don't feel restrained if you'd
like to speak up in the course of these
informal remarks don't hesitate it's
kind of a lot of people but we'd better
if we could treat it as a seminar
interactive so please just speak up if
you'd like ask questions make comments
produce refutations whatever maybe okay
well start with a couple of general
comments the very briefly the as he says
said the field is roughly 60 years old
they've been enormous changes over the
time over this period about a few things
have remained fairly constant pretty
constant one is the recognition that at
the core of language there must be some
generative procedure recursive
compositional procedure the second is
that the field auto beam I think framed
within a biological context so we're
interested in what's come to be called
AI language internal individual language
viewed intentionally we care about the
actual system of rules not just some
class of objects it might enumerate
those two stands I think have remained
constant
but many changes in the implementation
and development well it follows from
this that the main thrust of theoretical
work I mean apart from the minimal
condition those trying to achieve some
kind of descriptive adequacy for the
variety of languages the main thrust of
theoretical work would be to simplify ug
and partly from the first place because
that's just normal scientific practice
so you do it in every field try to
eliminate stipulations achieve deeper
explanations by reducing complexity and
so on that's just the nature of science
so that's one reason because of the
biological context there's another
reason here and that is in the
background is a concern to try to show
how this biological system could have
originated
what's misleadingly called evolution of
language of course misleading languages
don't evolve but the language capacity
ug does evolve or must have evolved it's
around so one thing the and the more
stipulations and complexity and the
richer the assumptions about the nature
of ug the harder it's going to be
obviously to try to account for how the
system might have originated so that's a
separate reason apart from normal
scientific practice to seek the simplest
possible system
well the we can especially in the last
20 or 30 years and envision enough
progress was made I think over the 60
years that maybe 20 years ago it was
possible to envision with relative
clarity what the optimal system would
look like the ideal to which we might
strive the optimal system would have
would conform to what's been called the
strong minimalist hypothesis it's not
precise but some aspects of it can be
made reasonably clear that one element
of it would be that the combinatorial
operation the generative operation
should be as simple as possible now
there is a simplest possible
combinatorial operation it's found in
every generative system any combat or a
recursive system it's the operation
that's come to be called merge
basically set formation in its simplest
form notice that and as you know merge
has two special cases external and
internal and there are no copy
operations and no operation of reemerged
contrary to what's often claimed just
plain murders the simplest possible
combinatorial operation in effect set
formation so that should be that the
optimal system will have that alone as
the combinatorial operation I think a
further step is necessary if there's
time we go into it but at least that and
beyond that if it's optimal it just
should refer to that what have sometimes
been called third factor properties
general laws of nature in the case of a
computational system that would mean
loss of computational complexity these
are again not totally clear by any means
but some things are pretty obvious like
less is better than more or short less
search is better than more search things
like that and from very few simple
assumptions about maximizing minimizing
complexity you can draw a fair number of
conclusions well the best system then
would be one that meets just these
conditions merge is the operation beyond
that minimal computation in the talk I
gave the other day if some of you were
there I tried to show how this ideal
system and of course the system is
interesting if you can get significant
results out of it so what I tried to
show the other day is that by just
assume just rough sketch but you all
know the detail so I won't go into it by
just assuming nothing but this merge and
minimal computation you can derive some
pretty surprising conclusions one of
them is that
the output of the generative system
yields the proper forms for somatic
interpretation in quite complex
structures as you know I gave simple
ones but it generalizes to quite complex
ones now that means that what's
generated is essentially a language of
thought maybe I suspect probably the
only language of thought it kind of
creates a system of thought one
conclusion the second conclusion is that
externalization in one or another
sensory modality usually speech but
could be sign or something else
externalization is just an ancillary
process it's not part of the core of
language does its properties do not
enter into thee from this from these
assumptions that do not enter into
syntax and semantics or the core systems
of language rather their reflexes of the
sensory motor system and the the the
nature of the externalization depends on
which sensory motor system you're using
so the kinds of organization and
arrangement that you haven't sound are
different from the ones that you have in
sign and would be different from ones
used in some other modality which is
also possible touch for example the
that's the second conclusion the third
and and of course this is quite a hard
task to relate the internal system which
is just based on which satisfies
presumption is this strong mental most
pieces to relate this to the sensory
motor system is a very hard cognitive
task can be satisfied this sensory motor
system is not specifically adapted the
language it was apparently around
hundreds of thousands of years before
language suddenly emerged and there are
many ways to map one to the other and
it's a hard process and in fact that's
what we find is that the
complexity of language which you have to
learn when you learn a leg which is
almost entirely externalization and it
varies a lot because there are many ways
to do it of course there are principles
it's not just arbitrary the principles
of phonology and morphology which are
non-trivial but they have many possible
the implementations and it's also
susceptible the easy variation so
changes all the time that's basically
what we're all familiar with a third a
conclusion is that most of the doctrines
about the nature of language in the
related fields in linguistics philosophy
philosophy of language cognitive science
most of them are just flat wrong there's
a doctrine which is held virtually at
the level of dogma that the way it's put
is the function of languages
communication it's a kind of a curious
notion because biological systems don't
have functions they do all sorts of
things like the spine for example what's
the function of the spine hold the body
up preserve the nerves produce white
blood cells all kinds of things there's
no particular function but the the dogma
is that language uniquely among
biological systems has a function and
the function is communication but if
these first two conclusions are correct
that has to be false because
communication is based on
externalization and if externalization
is an ancillary property of language
then communication is even more so this
really is dogma if you look at the
related fields it's simply taken for
granted that it just has to be true but
apparently it's false if this these
arguments are correct so that's another
significant conclusion
it's gonna it's extremely hard to get
anyone in the fields to even contemplate
it because it's a contrary to standard
assumptions of recent recent years now
if you go back far enough the it also
follows from this that virtually all the
work that's done on what's called
evolution of language is on the wrong
track it's almost entirely speculations
about evolution of communication and
whatever one thinks of those
speculations that are gonna say anything
about language so that if this is
correct that literature can be as
naturally dismissed and the final
conclusion that comes from this is they
do get explanations for some non-trivial
properties of language the one I talked
about is the long-standing puzzle of
structure dependence of rules which is
actually a very surprising property of
language if you look at it it means that
from a from the point of view of a
production and perception parsing the
language is systematically ignoring the
simplest computational operations and is
using much more complex ones
and that should puzzle people hasn't
puzzled them enough but was recognized
to be a puzzle 50 years ago lots of
efforts to deal with it but in fact
would follow automatically if the strong
minimalist thesis is correct
that's basically what I talked about the
other day well the you can decide to
what extent you think that's convincing
but to me it looks convincing and all
assume it here if so the major problem
of linguistics that the driving issue in
theoretical linguistics ought to be to
ask to what extent other aspects of
language can be brought within the same
set of assumptions so can what else
couldn't conform to the ideal
and ideally we should try to show that
everything can oh that's the I take it
at least from my point of view that
seems to be the nature of the field the
field should be an effort to try to
determine to what extent the every
aspect of language is either ancillary
like externalization or else falls under
the strong minimalist thesis including
crucially syntax and semantics what's
called semantics such I should say that
what's called semantics it's actually
syntax it's a simple manipulation a
simple manipulation of the kind that may
have some significance about the outside
world of justice phonology has some
significance about sound but nobody
confuses phonology with sound and we
shouldn't confuse say model theoretic
semantics with semantics it would become
semantics only if it's related to mind
external objects and it makes no effort
to do that so in fact all of this is
syntax in the technical sense some of it
oriented towards meaning and truth and
inference some of it oriented towards
noises but it's all syntax as long as
it's in the head as long as it's just
computation but crucially the parts of
that are called syntax and semantics
they order ideally oughta fall within
the strong minimalist thesis I think
that's the goal
we'd like to achieve and what I'd like
to do now is just pursue the question a
little bit beyond and see if we can
incorporate other aspects of language in
the same framework I'm going to use here
examples of he says and comments of his
which all I don't know if other people
have seen them but know okay this is
just private between the two of us
modify some of these as I go along
I'd like to assume a recent fairly
recent paper the paper problems of
projection which I understand that the
number of you familiar with so I'll kind
of take that for granted if if you look
back this introduces some changes in the
way the baton the basic questions have
been looked at but me and others if you
go back to six eight fifty years ago
there were a number of properties of
language which were subject which were
immediately taken to be subject to
inquiry have to be understood one of
them is composition you know phrases
bigger phrases and so on second is order
things appear in a linear order the
third is projection phrases are of a
certain type so the early rules would be
you know V P ro V and V and so on VP is
the projection fourth was displacement
we understand phrases and positions
other than where we hear them these were
the basic notions the way it was divided
up the vision of labor in the early work
was that composition projection and
order were part of phrase structure
grammar displacement was part of
transformational grammar the and over
the years their most theoretical work
has been an effort to try to simplify
these two components of the system so
for a structure grammar by the 1960s was
simplified to x-bar theory which
eliminated a lot of rich stipulations
unnoticed was the fact that x-bar theory
actually introduced a new stipulation it
introduced the requirement of endo
centricity so x-bar theory forces endo
centricity
I think that was a mistake I think in
fact there are very clear examples of
non Indo centricity in fact every case
of internal merge is none the output is
NaN end of century there have been
efforts to get around that but I think
there a mistake and probably the same is
true just a subject-predicate you go
back to the you know syntactic
structures and so on the first rule was
s aro n PvP the traditional fuel that
viewed rule that the sentences consist
of subjects and predicates and that's of
course EXO centric and I think that's
probably correct the endo centric
hypothesis forced a great deal of
complexity and arbitrary decisions but
that that was a consequence of the sip
of the simplification a phrase director
grammar - x-bar theory well over the
years went on finally leading to a beer
phrase structure but it still maintained
the end of ex-offender centric
stipulation with regard to
transformational grammar that went
through various stages ultimately
reached elastic in Saito's theory of
move alpha that's what was going on for
roughly 40 50 years the way it looks now
at least is different order I think is
out as I said that's just part of
externalization so that's not one of
them properties that we have to deal
with the composition and displacement
fall within merge so they fall within
the simplest combinatorial operation and
stress again contrary to a lot of
technical work that's coming out right
now there is no notion of copy there is
no notion of reemerged
just merge period that that leaves
action and projection is different from
the others
the other three notions composition
order and displacement are transparent
you virtually see them they're right in
the data you know the projection on the
other hand there's a theory internal
motion you don't see it in the data and
I think it doesn't belong in the whole
system I think it's rather and operate
it's it's the result of a principle of
minimal computation a principle that
tries to identify the nature of a you of
a syntactic object by minimal search
it's probably a third factor principle
just the assump there is an empirical
assumption here the empirical assumption
is that at the level of conceptual
intentional interface the thought
interface it's necessary to know what
kind of a unit a particular syntactic
object is so will interpret verb phrases
differently from noun phrases
differently from clauses and so on so
that's be some procedure of
identification and optimally it should
be minimal search finding the most
prominent element and of that assumption
is sufficient again to yield a couple of
crucial consequences one of them it
turns out it follows at once from this
that internal merge what was called move
has two possibilities only one is that
its successive cyclic which is a good
consequence but it is successively a
second is that it that the success of
cyclic operations stop when the
operation when that the generation
reaches what Luigi Ricci called a
criterion position a certain type of
position and then it stops there can't
go on that's
- Richie called the halting problem you
keep going successive cyclical e you're
forced to go successive cyclical you
can't stop and you have to get to a
criterion then you must stop these are
observed features of internal merge and
they follow it once if you assume that
the only properties are the ones I just
mentioned that's what's discussed in in
this paper so I won't review it there
there are the cases of internal merge
that are significant for this are
basically two types one indirect
questions embedded WH phrases we have to
look into the nature of those and the
second is subjects in subject predicate
constructions and subjects have a number
of curious properties which have never
which have always been mysterious I'd
like to talk about them one is the
property bpp the extent of projection
principle so why do things move into
subject position altogether if we accept
as looks plausible the subject the
predicate internal subject hypothesis
which looks reasonable why do you ever
satisfy epp or why must you satisfy epp
that's one open problem involving
subjects and another one is the empty
category principle ECP why in certain
structures is extraction from subject
blocked though in the same structures
extraction from object is perfectly free
I suspect that these two properties are
the same property they correlate in
striking ways so there are if we take to
type major types of language English
type languages which have overt
expletives and Italian type languages
which have null subjects the two major
categories of language it's striking
that in
the English type languages they have to
satisfy both EC EPP and ACP the Italian
type languages don't satisfy either of
them and this is true over quite a broad
range and it strongly suggests that
these should be reduced to the same
property
maybe that's why they've looked so
mysterious they've been studied in quite
different ways anyway I'll try to pursue
that suggestion I should say
incidentally that there's something a
little misleading and just the history
of the field by accident the first
language that was studied in any depth
was English and other languages that
were studied were kind of investigated
on the model of English and that's
probably a serious error English looks
like an outlier it's a very unusual type
of language in these regards if you look
at the languages of the world the
languages that have overt expletives are
pretty rare and where they do have overt
expletives there's something weird about
them always every case I know
so in English the overt expletive is an
adverb and why I mean it has a vaguely
locational notion but you have to really
have to have you really have to use rich
metaphors to make it locational like you
know there are there there are reasons
for expecting it to snow tomorrow
there's no location the you take a look
at say German it's just an invented
phrase escape doesn't I think do with
anything
Icelandic it's a determiner in French
it's yeah again nothing to do with
anything
furthermore these invented expletives
actually have contradictory properties
so if you take something like yeah in
French the it has to agree with an
associate but the expletive is singular
and the associate could be plural
and the verb connected with the
expletive is singular it should be
plural so you actually get
contradictions from the expletive in
Hebrew the expletive is just some
made-up word there's nothing there with
anything yesh no structure no nothing
same in Arabic every case I know and
there aren't a lot of cases the
expletive is a strange unit so to take
this is the model for language is
probably a bad mistake in the italian
type languages the null subject
languages it's always been assumed that
there's a null expletive but as far as I
can see the only reason for assuming
that is that in English there's an overt
expletive and that's obviously not a
good reason probably there is no not
expletive it's just that epp isn't
satisfied in these languages period and
strikingly ECP isn't satisfied either
but interesting work by Luigi rootsy on
that years ago and that seems to be
quite general so I think that suggests
that we should look for a common origin
to ECP in epp we should regard the
English type languages as having some
kind of extra superficial extra property
with for some reason they stick
something into the expletive position
we'll want to ask why well that's what
I'd like to try to look at I'm also
going to assume stricter clarity in the
version that all assume here is a phase
theory it's a particular version of the
property of strict security that's been
found all over the place and that has a
kind of obvious computational motivation
it's a much more economical computation
if you can construct a unit and then
forget about it not bother changing it
again obviously that reduces
mutational burden very significantly and
I think that's probably the core driving
motive beyond behind the design of
language as involving stricter Cliff
City phase theory gives one version of
this and all assume the phase internal
phase impenetrability condition P I see
as it was originally formed so it
formulated so what's transferred and
I'll be concerned here really only with
transfer to the CI interface secondary
the what's transferred is the interior
of the phase the edge of the phase
meaning the head and whatever may be
merged to it
that's not transferred that's accessible
for later computation incidentally in
this approach there is no notion of
specifier and that was another mistake I
think that came from x-bar theory x-bar
theory because of its endo centric
stipulation had a notion of first merge
second merge third merge always merged
to a head and that introduced notions
like specifier second specifier and
third specifier but all of those are
just stipulated there's no motive for
any of them and I assume I mean I'll use
the notion but just for expository
purposes it has no no meaning just to
refer to that position but so in that
just with that proviso the specifier in
the head or at the edge the all
specifiers in the head or at the edge
there may be more than one and they're
accessible to later computation but
what's transferred is frozen you don't
have to look back at it anymore
I'll take that as the nature of Phase
theory in my own recent work I did
suggest some problems with that I
thought were problems but I think it was
a mistake so if you take a word like say
leave in English the verb le AV e leave
if you just look at the interior part
leave NP it's undetermined whether it's
an unattractive and it'll get a
different interpretation whether it
means you know say suppose you have
leave the class it could come out to
class left okay not accusative or it
could come out the teacher left the
class transitive if you just look at
leave the class you can't tell so I
assumed incorrectly that in order to
determine the interpretation of this
phrase that's getting transferred you
had to look and see if there was a
subject okay if there is a subject it's
going to be transitive
if there isn't a subject it'll be uh
nakusoo t'v now the subject is inside
the phase but it's outside what's being
transferred so I assume that in order to
transfer you had to take a look at
what's outside of what's being
transferred but that's just a mistake
there's a subject if and only if the
head is V star it's a property of the
head which is going to be one-to-one
correlated with whether there's a
subject furthermore because of
inheritance of features the properties
of the head will in fact be inherited by
the V that's inside okay so if you look
at the V that's inside you know right
away whether this is transitive or
annika t'v so therefore it's not
necessary in cases like these there are
a lot of cases like these it's not
necessary to inspect anything outside of
the interior in order to transfer the
interior so that complication as far as
I know can be eliminated it was just a
mistake of mine so I will assume that
just that P I see works straight no
complications
well let's proceed further with visas
examples and I guess it would help the
faith I don't know how good your
imaginations are but let me use the back
of the blackboard I think we'll probably
easier so you might get this to work so
take his first example the boy and then
here we have saw the dog and call this
which do I want call this one alpha and
call this one beta and there's many
bright brackets as you need okay how
does this work how do we generate it
well the first assumption this is now
based on work of last naked Saito
actually derived from suggestions with
muscle Koizumi going back to postal
years ago about raising two object
the first assumption which is an
interesting one is that this goes over
here okay and you know the arguments for
that it's a pretty suppressor the case
where this is significant is EC M you
know exceptional case market so if you
have the sentence John expected and Bill
to come is bill in the higher Clause of
the lower clause
I mean matically it's in the lower
clause but it turns out that for a lot
of properties it acts as if it's in the
upper clause that was postal original
observation last nichkhun site so have a
version of it in contemporary terms and
I think that's correct I think they have
personally I resisted it for a long time
tried to find ways
but I think it's great so that means the
dog the dog is really over here I'll
drop the article and here you this is of
course it just means the same thing it's
copy but I won't write the copy you're
familiar with it well how does that work
first of all what gets transferred well
we want beta to be transferred it's
nothing the phase this whole thing is a
phase but this is the edge so that's not
gonna get transferred but beta oughta
get transferred and by the basic
assumption it'll be transferred over
only if everything's labeled if
something is not labeled it can't be
transferred because a little crash there
won't be any way to interpret it so the
crucial question is is beta labeled this
well the way it's I assume it works is
that V Star has features like sines
accusative case and so on and in some
language is visibly there's agreement
with the object so there isn't all
languages it's not always visible so the
features of this go down to this thing
dog has features this is an XP YP
structure the kind that's not allowed by
x-bar theory but that clearly exists and
the assumption in the paper that I'm
assuming here is that you can if to the
two XP and YP have the same most
prominent feature okay then that serves
as the label the search procedure
minimal search will just find the same
thing in both XP and YP so it will label
it by essentially the five features
okay so beta is labeled by five features
so that's okay can get transferred now
there's an interesting question that
arises about the raising to object the
last thing in sight though gives some
evidence that indicates that it's
optional there's other evidence that
indicates that it's obligatory so if you
take a sentence like jump to take ECM
John expected him to leave condition B
applies obligatory and according to the
whole framework of the discussion it
shouldn't if it's optional because the
conditions for an A for supposed to be
basically clause bound
okay but it looks obligatory and I'll
assume that it's obligatory that raises
a question what about the cases that
they gave where it doesn't seem to be
obligatory so that's the homework
assignment show that there's something
wrong with those cases but let's take it
to be obligatory which I think it
probably is then that asked the race is
the question why it's obligatory okay no
one possible answer to why it's
obligatory which I suspect is correct is
that sort is not actually a verb but
that it's a root now I'm going to be
assuming the approach the lexical items
that's developed and discussed by Alec
Marantz but discussed in enormous detail
three thick volumes by Barrera quite an
interesting work it basically assumes
that every language is essentially proto
semitic has roots and inflections that
determine what the category the root is
may not be accidental that Hebrew is its
native language but what the tendency to
make your own language the universal one
but this I think there's pretty good
evidence for this you can look at so I
suppose what we have here is really a
root and the reason we're interpreting
it as a verb
is because this thing is a verb okay so
that means that the roots get there
categorical character by the
inflectional element that identifies
them okay that incidentally cuts out a
redundancy namely the redundancy between
small V and big V if this was small and
and this would be an N you know so we
eliminate that redundancy if that's
correct
then it's it's it's plausible that roots
are simply not candidates for labeling
don't have any properties they're
thought of enough properties so roots
are not candidates for labeling let's
assume that and I think there's good
reason for that even if you just look at
head to head constructions discuss it a
little bit in that paper
so if roots aren't candidates for
labeling then raising is forced
otherwise this thing can never be
labeled right so that forces raising
which seems to be the case and it'll
give this as being labeled by the shared
features of XP and YP notice that the
same argument will carry over to raising
the subject okay and that's what I think
we should be looking for some similarity
between the various operations that take
place so take a pee-pee okay
EP P is going to end up with a DP let's
call it and a tea
it's an XP YP phrase X bar theoretic
approaches have not permitted it to be
viewed as XP YP arbitrarily it was
regarded as a TP with the DP the
specifier of TP but that's perfectly
arbitrary you could have just regarded
TP as the specifier of D the theory
tells you nothing the opposite was paid
Cousins correct but not because there
was any evidence for it okay so we want
to throw that out it's not an exit in
this entry construction and the question
a pp the question of the EPP problem is
why this has to be here okay why say in
English UNAC users would notice that the
issue arises specifically for unyk use
ative or passes you know something with
there's no look nothing driving in
nothing internally driving the subject
to raise so why in English
don't you have sentences like they're a
ride actually why aren't there normally
sentences like there arrived a man
notice that there are such sentences but
there are two but they have a very
peculiar properties you can't say who
did their arrive let's say anything you
can't relativize it and the reason I
think is that the a man is actually
adjoined its underlying ly there but it
raises and in fact you see that in
sentences where you put more structure
in like there arrived last night three
men from Germany you can't say there
arrived three men from Germany last
night interesting you off at the edge
and it doesn't raise and so on so
actually there are no sentences like the
Italian on accusative it appears and
when you don't have that the question is
why there has to be inserted why doesn't
it come out like Italian where you can
just have arrived a man that's perfectly
normal
no nothing wrong with it as I mentioned
before in Italian linguistics it's
generally assumed universalism that
there's an empty pro there but I think
that's just because it's modeled on
English natural assumption is there's
nothing there doesn't satisfy you Fifi
well what this plainly a parametric
difference between English and Italian
English is a type you know Titan is a
type not these particular languages
what's the parametric difference it's
usually been related to richness of
inflection it does seem to correlate
very closely with richness of inflection
let's pursue that intuition and take a
look at thee in the English type
languages T probably has no features at
all it derive its the native the
features that it has depends on the
context that it's in so if T is in a see
T construction it's gonna have the
feature tense and have five features if
it's not if there is no C if it's an
infinitive it'll I've essentially no
features okay
so T itself is basically featureless
it's just a position which has to be
there for a variety of reasons but it's
it it's let's call it weak that makes it
like R it it would be the kind of
element that can't function as a label
okay it's too weak in English and notice
that that requires exactly is in this
case it requires that raising be
obligatory or else that something be
there so that you can get the XP YP type
labeling well the two things that can
happen is or either the subject raises
or you get next with the expletive some
arbitrary element which I presume is do
there so you can get the shared features
and label the subject predicate
construction but what about Italian well
Italian the T is rich so it all have the
property that it can serve as a label so
you don't have to raise you don't need
next Lu okay that would distinguish the
Italian and the English type and it
would be similar to this with one
difference the difference is that in
both the English and the Italian type
you do have to have raising to object
because R is always weak it's not
parameterised T is parametrized ours
okay are just universally is not a
possible
able T in itself is not a possible label
but if it's enriched by inflection
intrinsically than it can be I think
that is part of the story as to why
English type and Italian type languages
differ with regard to the inflection but
not with regard to the raising the
object okay that's beginning of that
okay let's proceed on with this take a
suppose we extend this and we have I'm
still following pieces yeah we extend
this by adding some see here let's say
that to start with others and here we
have another element let's bullet gamma
which will include T and then alpha that
went up there okay well we know what has
to happen this position has to be filled
either by an expletive or by raising of
the subject let's take that case this
the raising of the subject is formally
the same as the raising to the object
okay but it's different in that it's
parameterised if our English it has to
happen just like object for Italian it
doesn't can but doesn't because the T is
already rich enough that means that for
the English type II PP is obligatory and
that gamma here gets transferred cuts
all label the the connection between
these two is the shared most prominent
element essentially the
my features and that's the label so gam
is fine we can interpret that let's
before going on with this for me move
over here and take a slightly closer
look at the the property of head
movement that's involved okay notice
that both of these involve head movement
cases the root is raised in the lower
case and other and the V goes to T and
the sum of some languages you know
French not English in the other case so
let's look at that what's all that about
well a head movement has been a
problematic for a long time it has their
conflicting there's conflicting evidence
as to whether head movement is syntactic
or phonological okay it looks and tactic
because the successive cyclic so for
example here the the root will go to V
Star and ultimately it'll go to T and
then it can even go on to C okay and
each time the assumption is is a join to
the next highest head but that's success
of cyclic movement and that can't take
place in the external ization right it
has to be syntactic so that's the there
have been many attempts to try to
interpret head movement as an
externalization property but this is the
basic reason why they they run into
trouble it has this essentially
syntactic property on the other hand
there's strong evidence that it's
phonological that it doesn't feed the
CIA interface the strongest evidence is
this has no semantic content a movement
and a bar movement always have very
significant semantic content that's
duality of cymatics basically which
looks like a deep linguistic property
the head movement never does so you go
back to save luxe original arguments
about this distinguishing French from
English French and English verbs are
interpreted exactly the same way though
the French ones are raising the tea and
the Englishman's are not and furthermore
internal to French if the verb raises to
tea or stays behind say because of
Xillia raised to tea they still have the
same interpretation and so the head
moved quite generally head movements not
doing anything semantically which must
mean that it shouldn't be feeding the CI
interface and that's been the problem
that had moving for a long time there's
other related problems but this looks
like a straight contradiction well how
could we resolve it remember that all
know if I'll need this all operations
are taking place at the phase level
right except for external merge because
you have to construct the phase in the
first place
but apart from external merge all
operations are at the phase level that
that includes internal merge and it
includes transfer however notice that
there are various orders in which these
operations could apply at the phase
level so for example one possible order
is the transfer could apply before
raising applies I think that's probably
what's happening with head moving the
transfer is proceeding before the hip
raising of the head so you have no
somatic effect of the raising the
raising then takes place which puts the
head at the edge position so it can be
picked up by the next size next phase
that gives you the syntactic property
okay if that's the way that's one of the
options that's automatically available
if all operations take place at the
phase level so let's and that would
resolve the contradiction right so I
suspect that that's what's going on so
let's assume that's head
if directed Souls that set of problems
okay let's go on beyond suppose that
instead of the dog we had which dog I'll
just write it this way okay
the boy so which dog want to come out as
a question or maybe a relative depending
on how it ends up
same as before this is gonna have to
raise to here but now it's gonna have to
raise to here okay because it's going
successive cyclically so let's put
something else in here we have the I'm
sorry wrong yeah well let's here we have
boy this is the v-star phase and the
which is going to appear here and
keeping - he says notations which you
don't have but it makes it easier for me
that's lambda okay maybe you can
circulate your notes help so we have to
look at this thing we have this is a V
star P right it has the WH phrase moving
to the edge on its way to where it'll
end up boy is just the external
arguments stayed in place and the rest
is the same now what happens here
well now what this thing is still alpha
keep that the way it was changed but
alpha here has no label notice because
it's an XP YP structure this is the YP
but these share no features okay
this is the inflectional element that's
connected with the object position and
it doesn't
anything about the subject okay like you
could have object plurality and subject
singular and so on
so that means that alpha can't be
labeled okay so something has to happen
and we know what has to happen this has
to raise in the next phase that's EPP
okay once that raises in the next phase
then because the whole nature of
visibility of units that's discussed in
the paper I won't go through it this
thing will simply alpha will simply be
labeled V store this will its copy
essentially makes it invisible for the
reasons that are discussed in the paper
there's kind of a discontinuous element
okay look at the paper from details
so therefore EPP will permit alpha to be
labeled and alpha at least will be
transferred on the other hand what about
lambda well that's another XP YP
structure and that's not going to be
labeled so on the next phase where we're
trying to label this thing will get
stuck well we know the answer to that
one the WH phrase has to raise okay that
will then enable lambda to be labeled at
the next phase and everything you get
transferred okay that's the second
that's why this is a case where WH
phrase is raised to the edge of the V
star P but then it's compelled to go on
to the next phase which you'll say be a
CP okay could be a feast our people will
pretend that's a CP same thing if you
either way all right that takes care of
that now suppose we do raise it all the
way then we get something like which dog
and here we have see and then the rest
of it that's after the raising from the
V star P what about that well whether
that's labeled or not depending on what
the C is if the C has a Q feature it's
inherently interrogative that's an
inherent property of a clause it's
inherently interrogative then the
feature will match the interrogative
feature of that there's more to say here
but let's just go into it more if you
like but match the I should stop no okay
well just just a second I'll try to
finish the then though if if this is a Q
this these two will match and that's the
criterion so it stops that we have to
ask why it stops we should all have the
halting problem to deal with if it's a
say that a declarative then we got the
same problem we have to have success of
cyclic movement okay that's that
category of things suppose now let's
take a look at violating freezing I
suppose that this is a Q watch it
suppose this is a Q and we try to raise
this farther so we now get a sentence
like which dog do you wonder and
inherent to down below which dog you
wonder you know will will the boy will
the boy see something like that well the
problem with that's a problem because
the internal sentence is a yes or no
question it's now a yes or no question
right just as it cubes nothing else so
you're trying to embed a yes or no
question inside a wh free at wh question
and that's just incoherent so it's
for at the interface level by
incoherence that would solve the halting
problem for this case I'll refer you to
he says work for what happens in
Japanese which is interestingly
different okay maybe you'd like to bring
it up but for for the English type
language is the halting problem for this
case is solved by the fact that just get
in coherence you're getting a question a
yes/no question inside a wh question
cannot happen next case suppose you get
a sentence take the sentence which dog
I'll go over these fast because it's
getting late
do you wonder if say the boy likes here
the which phrase came here normal way to
the v store then it came to this
position edge of the CP and then it went
on and it's okay but the question we
have to ask is why didn't it stay right
here okay it looks like an indirect
question well if you take a look at it
you have to ask what if is notice that
if the same would be true if instead of
if we had a Y or weather or something
like this
and in fact if it's probably in that
category okay it's a cube basically it's
a W it's but in the same category as the
WH words but that means that if we have
a wh phrase here we're going to have an
XP YP structure which is unlevel they
have no features in common
right the the thing that has moved
successive cyclically has no features in
common with the the WH phrase that's
inside so therefore a can't stay and
therefore it's going to have to move on
and you get the correct sentence which
dog do you wonder if the boy likes or
which dog do you wonder why the boy
likes or any of those they all work well
that raises the last question I suppose
we tried to raise the subject why don't
we get which boy do you wonder if likes
the dog looks exactly parallel right
instead of raising that we ought to get
Oh to come out the same way if to raise
the boy which boys are here then raise
it to the front and get which boy which
boy which boy do you wonder if likes the
dog well that's obviously out that's ECP
right so why should a CP be blocked
notice it's blocked for English it's not
plucked for Italian okay that's crucial
well we have the answer to that already
if we raise the boy we're going to be
left here with the T which is too weak
to be labeled okay because this is
English remember it has the weak T it
has to have this here in order to get a
label so this is stuck that's the
halting problem for subject which gives
the ECP okay reduces to the same
property that gave the epp distinction
for the English and the Italian type
languages so without going on any
further the EPP and ECP do fall together
from this point of view and the two
different types of languages differ as
we want they differ for option no
subject but not null object um there are
null object languages but that's
different the these two category
or as we like the object raising is
obligatory the subject raising is
obligatory for the English type not for
the Italian type that's the epp property
the halting problem holds for the
English type but not the Italian type
that's ECP property so again all of this
seems to follow just from the ideal case
the perfect case nothing assumed other
than minimal merge and minimal
computation well that is the house is
closed there that's I think the ideal
towards which theoretical English oughta
strive to ask how much can be
accommodated with no assumptions and for
reasons I mentioned the other day this
would fit quite well with the very
little we know about origin of language
so it's it's plausible from other
directions that this ought to be the
right kind of answer and the task is
show that it's true true because on the
surface it doesn't look true too many
problems but that's the nature of
science nothing looks like it works on
the surface the idea is to try to show
that it does
they'll have three microphones that we
can have run around the room and we have
approximately 20 minutes for questions
so questions comments discussions
specific to the last illustration of the
successive cyclic cases of embedded
integral you said the if or whether or
something like that
interrogative T is also weak T that for
English or English type so that the is
this strong T is only for the
declarative C for the Italian for
English cases well for English but my
assumption is that the parametric
difference there is a parametric
difference between English type and
Italian type that's the null object
distinction and I'm suggesting that the
parameter resides in the nature of T if
the Italian type T is Richard that's in
fact the usual assumptions about rich
inflection for the English type it's
weaker and that therefore is too weak to
serve as a label which means that it has
to be enriched metaphorically speaking
by being paired with something which
shares the same 5 features but then if
you raise that thing it's invisible
again so it won't label the lower thing
so in English across the board is T
person in English across the board T is
we that cross that board is weak that's
that's us and that's going to force EPP
and for CCP it unifies the two things
and for Italian it's rich so it doesn't
have either room I have
as a related question about DPP so that
what what to me is that even the Atari I
is it language varies from worried final
construction there is course that in
Italian case it's strong but how about
the entirety of Italian case how about
it t-i-is the EPP EPP yeah doesn't hold
for turn now it's some I mean if you'd
ever what if you typos in Italian
infinitives you can have an infinitive
without a subject it's usually assumed
to have a subject but the subject is not
how do we know it's there my guess is
that this assumption about Italian is
based on a false analogy to English just
because of a historical accident English
was studied first so the other languages
that were studied kind of picked the
English model but that's a very bad
model because English is extremely
unusual and in fact most languages you
just don't have an expletive you can
have a subject but you don't have to
so the standard Italian sentences just
have like verb subject verb object
something like that they assume that
there's something left in the subject
position so when you have saved what's
called a raising of subject to the to
the right in the Italian linguistics
literature they're assuming that it
starts in the subject position raises to
the right and leaves the trace but
there's no reason for that other than
that's the way English would work that's
obviously not a reason so it it's
probably the case that the Italian type
language just don't have EPP and don't
have any no likes loose
yeah well two questions first
so in English if T is weak across the
board what happens in the case of
infantile and braising in feed table
where T you know no really not basically
no future no features right and so if
that's the case even raising the subject
into this if he titled just ordinary
like a movement yep
but even if you raise the subject you
can still get labeled right since
because T has no features at all there I
suspect it's probably the answer the T
is so weak it just gets absorbed into
the T store so do you think but I think
that's probably yeah and do you think
there is a successive secret a movement
or do you do you think there is
successive cyclic a movement
well there is that's tricky right you
know the literature is kind of
conflicted on that the question is
whether you get reconstruction today and
it's a pretty complicated story there's
some evidence for this but it's pretty
weak evidence and the evidence for
reconstruction and a movement is things
like they they seem to her to like Mary
where you seem to get a condition C
effect and on the other hand if you take
they seemed to Mary to like herself you
can't get it so condition a is blocked
and condition C works which would follow
if there's something in the embedded
subject position so that's the kind of
evidence that suggest you get
reconstruction on the other hand there's
plenty of evidence that says you don't
elastic has papers on this
Selenia treat of his'n question but they
it they depend on pretty complicated
arguments about negation and
quantification and how they get
interpreted and so on but I think it's
kind of like an open question whether
the successfully yeah and what do you
think about the label for topical
ization CP well capitalization is
presumably only a root phenomenon sure
you don't really have to label it so I
thought you're claiming that I'm in
order to get interpreted UD label right
I think you you claimed in problems of
projection that I usually do have a
label in order to get it right yeah but
you know there are a lot of questions
about root sentences that every approach
has to say something special about
what's at the root
yeah like hedgerows they've tried
performative analysis and others have
tried other things but whatever special
about the root we can just say the
labels just root now there are embedded
topical eyes Asians but if you take a
look at them they have the pers otic
structure of separate sentences so they
probably are actually embedded root
sentences the crucial case is wh because
that's clearly embedded topic and focus
look like word phenomena the topical
ization is an interesting case because
you know in the case it has to do with
this thing which i kind of waved my
hands about about how they get the Q on
the WH fairies notice that WH phrase is
basically ambiguous it could turn out to
be a relative it could turn out to be a
WH phrase if it's Italian I could just a
Japanese could just be an indefinite
pronoun you know so it doesn't seem to
be marked for one of the other which
suggests that it actually has an
unvalued feature and that feature is
determined by what its
related to if it's related to a queue
that unvalued feature will become Q and
then you get to shared features if it's
a relative the associative the
declarative who get minus Q or where
these cool right and if it's just didn't
definite all stay in it definite what
about topic but now that raises a
question about hospitalization a topical
causation it doesn't any phrase can be
virtually any phrase can be topic alized
it can't be marked by a feature saying
I'm a topic because can even be a
generated phrase like you can say what
you like
surprised nice wear what you like it's
topical eyes but it's generated so there
can't be a feature on the phrases that
get topical eyes and say I'm a topic
which must mean that the operation is
free and that it becomes a topic because
of the way it ends up that may be
because of you know reaches left
periphery or maybe just because of
something general about the position of
roots but that's why the WH raises are a
little misleading because they have a
property that makes it look as if in the
earlier systems where movement was
restricted to agreement that you know
the feature agreement topical ization
ever fit because there's no property to
a topic or focus could be anything I
hope just just the same as on accusative
suppose you have an Italian and unyk is
it is like arrived a man okay
a man is nominative singular arrived is
going to be singular and
now the same five features as a man
that's just a long-distance agreement
okay Louis agreement works I mean I
think that is agreement they fight the
unvalued five features of the t relate
to the valued features of the associate
the unvalued features that t get valued
and the structural case feature of the
associate gets valued so if it's a t
it'll get valued nominative it's this
v-star get valued use ative but that's
just long distance agreement which you
get in english type languages too but
they're defective in the manner that I
said so you do get things like you know
they're arrived a man or there was
killed a man but effectively like they
don't honor go WH movements on but
that's a long distance agreement that's
the normal case the it doesn't have to
move to I mean what was called spec head
agreement at one point has a residue in
this system namely sharing features but
there's no spec head agreement the
agreements taking place before it gets
raised by the long distance agreement
okay so if you have a sentence like John
so the man that whatever that was the
voice or the dog in the base position
for the boy as internal subject VP
internal subject it agrees with the tent
that's independent of its raising it
agrees with the tense even if it stays
there okay why does it raise because of
labeling problems I'm just curious about
the notion of change uniformity in the
case of a CP businesses yes that the
change must be uniform right a change
must be uniform and a bar change must be
uniform
I'm interested in the notion of change
uniformity uniformity train uniform but
a change must be uniform our chains must
be uniform
and I think we need the notion as far as
I know I mean there is a notion like
chain if you want when you raise
something you get two copies and that's
basically a discontinuous cell at the
phase level you can see that that's a
discontinuous element beyond the face
level you can't see anything
but at the phase level you can tell that
two occurrences are copies not right we
have to distinguish in any theory
between copies and repetitions
okay so there's going to be a difference
between the sentence take the sins he
saw him or the boys or the boy that's a
possible sentence if the boy if the two
occurrences the boy are independent of
one another it can mean that voice or
that boy
and that is intuitively that means you
draw them from the lexicon separately on
the other hand if you say the boy was
killed there were also two occurrences
of the boy but they're the same they're
not repetitions they were drawn from the
lexicon once and you can tell that at
the phase level the reason is that it's
at the phase level the whole operations
apply so at the phase level you know
whether internal merge applied and
therefore you can tell whether two
identical elements or copies or
repetitions if internal murder
I mean in the last case that of which
boy case in the last subject extraction
case the phaser head can distinguish the
two copies one in spec T and one in spec
C
the head see can distinguish can tell
with the best case with which boy you
wonder if like the dog and one copy is
sits in spec see speck of if and the
other copies its inspect II but if
inspect II yeah but that's within a
single fit that's actually I skipped the
restart be free there's a V store P in
between I just skip that one but if the
WH phrase is first want to go to the
these expect V star right that's inside
a phase you can tell that they're copies
then the next one is in another phase
you can tell that they're copies and
then we have trans divet of identity
each successive cyclic movement requires
that at every phase you determine
whether two identical things are copies
if they're copies then at the next phase
you're going to get copies and then you
have transitivity of identity it should
be formalized but that's the intuition I
think work straight yeah I like to ask
the question about the syntactic object
named lambda you know it's a multiple
spec structure so that's the WH for and
store P determined by minimum search the
label of alpha the head of the alters
the phrase in the outer spec of little
bit star right so you're asking about
alpha the V store P the subject of this
Dorothy yeah yeah that's
then test base position of the subject
yeah but what I means to say is it's
what I'm what I'm talking about is
lambda which includes yeah WB lambda has
a wh phrase attached to it so the
question is why is it way don't get any
labeling what yeah well you don't get
any label you understand it seems to me
that the label of lambda should be the
head of WH no because it's an XP YP
structure yeah but when you have an XP
YP structure the algorithm doesn't know
which head to pick but the label of WH
place is closer to complicated to WH
phrases but you say the other one also
has a prominent feature but in fact the
most prominent the most prominent
feature of the other one is restore okay
um but but I think I think you say
subject and little bit stuff when you
when you talk about external argument
and its sister you say minimal search is
ambiguous
so the meme of such locates tee and
little-- easter so understand in in a
same way if we consider in the same way
but the lambdas label should be Q or the
we have to understand search of XP YP to
always be ambiguous and notice that how
deep it will be depends on the structure
of the phrase so if it's pictures of
which book did you see it's going to be
deep but it'll still be a wh phrase
so the the con
and but you're quite right the concept
of ambiguous search will have to have
the property that for XP YP it's always
ambiguous unless there's a shared
feature which is equally prominent
otherwise it could go either way
depending on the structure of the phrase
yeah done we clearly don't want that you
assuming the labouring is determined in
the case of head movement after transfer
right then now do you think you are
going to extend that position to the a
Junction instructor January you mean I
mean the timing of labeling the raising
is after transfer I mean suppose we have
a junctions thruster okay any time a
five-hit movement XP XP XP YP case I'm
sorry again especially we have we have
an a junction structure that Junction
yeah this that I didn't go into a
junction structures here that's an
interesting question that I said at the
beginning that I think merge is not
quite rich enough the reason it's not
quite rich enough is because of a
junctions director okay so suppose we
have created or merged and they end up
with a junction structure if we have one
suppose we have we moved and we have a
pretty internal merge to something then
we have a junction structure yeah
well the head movement itself I think is
the junction yeah
then the how about XP case the one I
don't XP cases where it's not a junction
yes it's just set merge
that's one of the differences between
that's one of the reasons why a junction
why a head movement in the past has been
sometimes thought of as phonological
notice it doesn't meet the extension
condition head movement does not meet
the extension condition it's adjoined
internally to the unit and that was one
of the arguments for saying it's really
phonological okay okay but I think that
property of head movement has to be
maintained so head but when you add when
you join a seis the V star to t it
remains at t-- doesn't become a B story
and if it's moving up to C it's the T
that's moving up not the V store so the
thing that's joined is always a
symmetrically related to what it that
joins to and that's para merge I think
kind of like relaf clauses are
indefinite numbers of adjectives they're
all para merged they're not submerged
that's why you can have an indefinite
number of them because the early days of
phrase structure grammar one of the big
problems that Howard Laz Nick had papers
on this and others is how you can get an
indefinitely long coordination that John
is tall happy you know angry at his
brother tired of the world and so on and
so forth it's just unstructured
coordination and I can go on
indefinitely and has no hierarchical
structure and that's impossible with
phrase structure grammar right you can
generate things like that and I think
the answer is that that's not set merge
all of those cases have an ask symmetry
built into them the adjective
traditional grammar what you say is the
adjective is predicated of the verb of
the noun the adverbs predicated of the
verb but once you've predicated it it
remains what it was okay the same with
relative clauses you can stack up
relative clauses indefinite
they have no internal hierarchy but when
you add a relative clause to a noun it's
still a noun so I think that that
requires another operation the next more
complicated operation after set merge
which is pair merge which gives in a
symmetry and that seems to be the way
head movement works it gives you an
asymmetry okay so the V that's a joined
to tea leaves the unit as a tea kind of
the way an adjective a joined to an alum
leaves the unit is now and if that
doesn't satisfy the extension condition
so it's not that was as I said one of
the arguments were saying it's not
syntax and I think it's got a it's kind
of it is a kind of a mixture of syntax
and externalization which probably
relates to the timing of the transfer
and raising operations it could just
reduce to that but I don't think you can
get around the fact that it is always in
a junction operation I mean there are
attempts to get around at like aroma to
shun ski has a article in which he
argues that head movement really goes to
spec and then you have some kind of
merger operation but that's just of the
merger operation there's just a way of
saying it ends up being a junction
there's no other function
