spute whole thing is outrageous I mean
he's an outstanding scholar he's
produced the book after book he's got
recommendations from some of the leading
scholars and many areas in which he's
worked the faculty at the departmental
committee unanimously recommended for
tenure the only it's amazingly hasn't
had full professorship a long time ago
and as you were saying there was a huge
campaign led by a Harvard Law Professor
Alan Dershowitz with the to try in a
desperate effort to defame him and
vilify him so as to prevent him from
getting tenure the details of it are
utterly shocking and as you said it got
to the point where the departed
ministration called on Harvard to put an
end of this work that's already
significant there were one university to
crawl under the leadership of another
University to stop one is from yes yeah
what's behind it very simple and
straightforward Norman Finkelstein wrote
a book which is in fact the best
compendium that now exists of human
rights violations in Israel and the
blocking of diplomacy by Israel in the
United States which I mentioned very
careful scholarly book as all of his
work is impeccable also about the use of
the uses of anti-semitism to try to
silence a critical discussion and the
framework of this book was a critique of
a book of apologetics for atrocities and
violence by Alan Dershowitz that was the
frameworks that we went through this
with his chart claims showed in great
detail that they are completely false
and outrageous that he's lying about
facts that he's an apologist for
violence that he's a passionate opponent
of civil liberties which he is and he
documented in detail there sure it is
intelligent enough to know that
can't respond so he does what any 10-3
lawyer does when you have a rotten case
you try to change the subject maybe by
vilifying opposing counsel all right
that changes the subject now we talk
about whether you know closing counsel
did or did not commit this iniquity and
the tactic is a very good one because
you win even if you lose I suppose your
charges against are all refuted you
still won you've changed the subject the
subject is no longer the real topic the
crucial facts about Israel virtue it's
is vulgar apologetics for them which are
very reminiscent of the worst days of
Stalinism we've forgotten all that we're
now talking about whether or Finkelstein
did this that and the other thing and
even if the charges are false the topics
been changed that's the basis of it
there so it has been desperate to
prevent this book from being personally
tried to stop it from being published
and I outlandish effort which I others
anything like it the hiring major law
firms or threatened libel suits are
writing to the government of Governor of
California it was published by
university of california press when he
couldn't get stop the publication he
launched a jihad against Norman
Finkelstein simply to try to vilify into
Fame it in the hope that maybe what he's
writing will disappear that's the
background it's not incidentally the
first time I'm you know actually I
happen to be very high on their
shipments of his hit list hate list and
he's also produced outlandish lies about
me for years you know I told him I was
like an agnostic about the Holocaust and
I wouldn't tell him the time of day you
know and so on am sorry that he made
that charge against yes and on and on i
went to talk about it what's the reason
it's in print even look at in
the internet in 1973 i guess it was the
leading israeli human rights activist
israel show
who incidentally is a survivor of the
Warsaw Ghetto in bergen-belsen and
headed a small human rights group in
Israel which was the only real one at
the time came to Boston had an interview
with a boston globe but she identified
himself correctly as the chair of the
israeli league of human rights a
Dershowitz rode a vitriolic letter the
globe condemning and claiming he's lying
about Israel he's even lying about being
the chair he was he was voted out by the
membership I knew the facts I were in
fact he's an old friendship shopping so
I wrote a letter to the globe explaining
it wasn't true in fact the government
did try to get rid of him they called on
their membership to flood the meaning of
this small human rights group and vote
him out but they brought it to the
courts and the courts said yeah we'd
like to get rid of this human rights
were to find a way to do it it's not so
blatantly illegal so I sort of worked
that their shirts that he could brazen
it out you know Harvard Law Professor so
here another letter saying chuckling I'm
lying and he challenged me to quote from
the Israeli Court decision never
occurred to them for a minute that I'd
actually had the transcript but I did so
I read another letter in which I quoted
from the court decision a demonstrating
that it was polite but that they're sure
it's is a liar he's even falsifying his
early Court decisions he's a supporter
of atrocities and he even is a
passionate opponent of civil rights this
is like a Russian government destroying
an amnesty international chapter by
flooding it with Communist Party members
to vote out the membership well he was
went berserk and ever since then I've
been one of his target in fact anyone
who exposes him as what he is is going
to be subjected to this technique
because he knows he can't respond so
must return to vilification and in the
case of Norman Finkelstein he sort of
went off in outer space but it's an
outrageous case and the fact that it's
even being the paid at this outrageous
so very it just read his letters of
recommendation from literally the
leading figures in the many fields in
which it works most respected people
know it's interesting the letters of
support from the leading Holocaust
scholars like roll hello uber is the
founder of Holocaust Studies the most
distinguished figure in the field fact
he says Norman didn't go far enough
