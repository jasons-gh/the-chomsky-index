the term neoliberalism is very curious
when first of all it's not it's not
liberal by any means as we've discussed
and Sun knew that's it was neoliberal
policies or something rather like them
that created the third world if you go
back to say the 18th century the Centers
of the world economy were China India
mostly and they changed the differences
between the rich and the poor we're not
very great not nowhere near like today
Europe grew and developed first England
and the United States Germany Italy and
so on
they developed by radically violating
what are now called neo liberal
principles strong states direct
intervention in the economy and so on
India and later China were devastated
and the same is true what we now call
the third world how by imposition of
forced imposition of market principles
and this is furthermore well known so if
you read serious economic historians
full bios for example he simply points
out protectionism and state intervention
created the rich and developed societies
and he doesn't call it neoliberalism but
the forced liberalisation and pretty
much created the third world to see how
every element of the neoliberal package
is specifically designed to undercut
democracy it's rarely discussed and
people talk about its economic effect
but just think it through
let's take say financial liberalisation
core for Keynes the greatest achievement
of the Bretton Woods system post-war
system was to institute financial
regulation and there's a reason that
provides space for governments to
undertake programs that are supported by
the population if you have no
constraints on capital flow then you can
attack currencies frequently that freely
now that creates what
International economists sometimes call
a virtual Parliament of investors and
lenders who can from quoting from
technical literature that can carry out
a moment-by-moment referendum on
government policies and if they think
the policies are irrational they can
vote against them by capital flight
thereby attacks on the currencies and so
on the policies that are irrational are
by definition those that benefit people
but don't improve profit and market
access and so on and therefore
governments faced what's called a dual
constituency in their own population and
the virtual Parliament and the virtual
Parliament usually wins especially in
poor countries the rich country sort of
is modulated you know then first of all
there they didn't accept the neoliberal
package as completely as say Latin
America but to the extent that they did
the effects are predictable and the same
is true of other elements of the
neoliberal programs so it takes a
privatization which became a mantra well
by definition privatization undercuts
democracy take something out of the
public arena and puts it into the hands
of unaccountable private tyrannies that
are created and supported by the state
which is what corporations are
