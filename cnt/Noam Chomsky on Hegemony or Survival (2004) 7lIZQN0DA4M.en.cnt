well this is strikes me while I'm here
that this is about the time of the year
when my students are going around for
job interviews if they're lucky enough
to get them I say this is the time of
the year when my students are going
around for job interviews if they're
lucky enough to be invited and if they
are they are expected to give a talk
technical talk have a few questions if
they don't consult too many people on
the faculty that he may even be offered
the job and I guess that's the same
format so I'll try not to insult too
many of you and maybe I had a chance at
the award every self-respecting
president has a doctrine attached to his
name the for the current incumbent and
Washington that's been expanded from a
doctrine to visions and dreams as well
but most presidents it's just doctrine
these doctrines are interesting to
investigate they're often important I'm
sure it I'll keep just to the current
bush doctrine which happens to be
unusually prominent clearly articulated
very dramatically implemented so there
would be no doubt as to what it means
and widely discussed with an unusual
extent the Bush Doctrine has several
related components all of them clearly
articulated I'll just quote the first
and most general component of it is that
it is our responsibility to history to
drive evil from the world and that's a
far-reaching doctrine a special case of
this has got to be relentless war on
terror and furthermore quoting any state
that harbors terrorists
is a terrorist state and will be treated
accordingly as we drive evil from the
world the third and more formal
enunciation of the doctrine is the
national security strategy of September
2002 which effectively declared the
right to use force to eliminate any
perceived potential challenge to us
global hegemony as Colin Powell put it
the u.s. reserves the sovereign right to
take military action where and how it
chooses he happened to say that in Davos
at the World Economic Forum meeting
eliciting quite a negative reaction from
the people who the business press the
International Business press called the
Masters of the Universe it was only a
slight touch of irony the national
security doctrine also at the same time
the Bush administration made it very
clear some of the first aspect of the
implementation of it was to make it
clear where they stood with regard to
international law and international
institutions even before Powell's
statement the government had made it
clear to the United Nations that it
could be relevant that was the term used
if it endorsed what the US was planning
to do anyway or else it could be as
Powell explained the debating society
but those were in effect the choices be
relevant and endorsed what we're going
to do or you can have polite discussions
somewhere the told that some people at
the back can't hear you very well
open treasury one using the hand tool
okay is this going to interfere with the
other
they better so I undo the other okay
well this this announcement to the
United Nations of its choice between
relevance and debating society actually
has come to thee is right on the front
pages of the press in England not here
right now in the Katherine John case I'm
sure you know Katherine Gunn is being
tried because she leaked to the British
press reports that she had seen from the
American Embassy calling on British
intelligence to illegally attack members
of the Security Council so that the
United States would know how to coerce
or pressure them into becoming relevant
that is endorsing what the US was going
to do those of you who know the history
of the United Nations will recognize
that this is coming full circle the San
Francisco conference which established
the UN at that conference delegations
were also illegally attacked by the FBI
so that the US would be able to control
the proceedings properly so we know have
a nice completion of the of the circle
but that's expresses from the beginning
and dramatically today the attitude
towards international institutions and
international law and it's not very
surprising it's pretty much the way
anyone would predict that the world
dominant power would behave it may be
surprising to people who prefer
illusions but historically it's not a
great surprise the national security
strategy the formal version of the
doctrine it not only elicited great
anger among
international business a lead but also
among the foreign policy elite at home
so immediately after it was announced in
September 2002 the major establishment
Journal foreign affairs a few weeks
later had a published its next issue
with the lead article called describing
what the author called the the new
imperial grand strategy and warning that
it was going to cause serious problems
for the world and for the United States
the even before the doctrine had been
officially announced it was clear what
was gonna be a Henry Kissinger had
described the doctrine as what he called
a revolutionary doctrine which
undermines of the UN Charter undermines
international law in fact undermines the
whole Westphalian system since 1648
which barred forceful intervention into
the into other sovereign states of
course that was West Fed who was only
for great powers do anything you want to
anyone else
I was hardly observed very magnificently
even among the great powers but this as
he as Kissinger correctly pointed out
the new doctrine simply tears this whole
framework to tatters which he thought
was a good thing he basically supported
the doctrine but like many others in the
many other of the critics in the foreign
policy a li criticized the
implementation said reasonable position
but not the way the implementation has
many flaws and will call cause all sorts
of dangers
he also Kissinger is a realist scholar
and he pointed out that we must not
permit this doctrine to be universalized
it cannot become a universal principle
the
in simple words this is a doctrine for
the United States which it the right to
use force it will against perceive their
potential enemies is to be reserved to
the United States it can delegate that
right to some of its clients but no one
else should line up for the privilege
that's clear and explicit the national
security doctrine was immediately
followed by exemplary actions to make it
clear to the world that it was meant
seriously it's not just rhetoric the
most obvious of them and the one that
attracted the most attention was the
invasion of Iraq the there were others
that were to which less attention was
paid but that might over the long term
prove more significant one of them was
the announcement just weeks after the
national security doctrine the
announcement by the Air Force Space
Command of that US policy in accord with
the national security doctrine was going
to shift from control of space that was
the Clinton doctrine to ownership of
space so from now on the US would own
space not just control it and then they
went to spell out it spelled out what
that difference is it means that any
potential competitor in space will be
destroyed and space means militarization
of space as they explained and it we
have docked the documents leading up to
it spelling it out it means placing
space platforms for highly destructive
offensive weapons nuclear and
non-nuclear this is under a first-strike
doctrine which is official the world
will be under very tight surveillance by
hypersonic drones so you can tell if a
somebody's walking across the street and
Bangkok and so on and it means in
principle a command post could
instantaneously without warning attack
and destroy any place in the world
without much need for forward facing and
other annoyances and this system has to
be owned not just controlled that was
November 19 November 2002 the u.s.
continued meanwhile to oppose
unilaterally UN efforts to ban the
militarization of space that has been
going on for some years the most recent
case was less December and again
unilaterally with the reflexive votes of
Israel and I think Micronesia the u.s.
opposed the otherwise unanimous decision
to reserve space for peaceful uses this
has been going on for some years now UN
disarmament Commission's have been
deadlocked over Washington's refusal
respect Clinton to ban militarization of
space however the advance from control
to ownership is a substantial one and in
line with the national security doctrine
and very ominous in its implication
I mean others plainly don't just say
that's fine Russia has already responded
by sharply increasing its military
spending its offensive weaponry it has
moved to launch on warning automated
response systems which were dangerous
enough in the past and are far more
dangerous today with the deteriorating
command and control systems of this
Russian state as the economy collapses
just to cheer you up you may recall in
1995 what before the deterioration had
set in we came
two minutes from a missile launch which
probably would have destroyed much of
the world went when I count there was a
ten minute countdown
after the Russian computers had
misidentified a space rocket as a
missile attack it was aborted two
minutes short of flight instant
retaliation presumably go beyond what
Eisenhower predicted in nineteen the
1950s that any such exchange would be
mean the destruction of the northern
hemisphere we've gotten much more
violent and powerful since then these
dangers are being enhanced Russia has
also moved to a first-strike doctrine
China is responding the same way as
predicted what's called ballistic
missile defense is understood both by
adversaries and by advocates in the
United States as being an offensive
weapon it's called a shield a sword not
just the shield on both sides and the
reaction to it is to build up offensive
military forces very threatening with
the obvious ripple effects don't have to
go into it so these are all severe
challenges threats being significantly
escalated all implementing the same
thinking can't just attribute it to the
Bush administration mentioned as roots
before but the sharp escalation of it is
significant very significant the
moonshot that Chinese and American moon
shots are very likely related to this
the moon is it if any of this gets off
the ground they use a appropriate
metaphor probably the moon will be used
for military purposes as part of the
militarization of space system and the
Chinese challenge to land a shuttle
is challenged to the US official
position of ownership of space which
does not lead to attractive consequences
if you think it through well let's get
back to Kissinger and the justification
for the revolutionary new doctrine and
its implementation in Iraq the he gave
the conventional justification the
justification is that Iraq possesses
weapons of mass destruction and is
connected to terror well it's by now
clear even from the scandalous Hutton
report that bush and Blair and their
associates sexed up the intelligence
reports borrow the notorious BBC phrase
which elicited a interesting hermeneutic
disquisition from Lord Hutton as you may
have seen if you put yourself through
the pain of reading the report but that
the intelligence data was sexed up is
not seriously in question and the
purpose was to establish that Iraq was
dangerous imminent threat because of its
weapons of mass destruction and its ties
to terror recall that that was presented
as the only question repeatedly the only
question by Colin Powell Jack Straw and
others and it's rather clear that they
had to they had to know at that time
that any evidence they had was shaky at
best now we know how shaky but what is
important is what they knew then
well the failure to find weapons of mass
destruction has been significant but I
think its major significance has been
somewhat overlooked the main
significance of the failure to find
weapons of mass destruction is that the
bars
for aggression have been lowered so the
original doctrine was what Kissinger and
the national security strategy stated
state countries that have weapons of
mass destruction are too dangerous if
there are no rogue states or whatever
well now you have to change the doctrine
and has been changed so it is now just
the possession or the intent or ability
to produce weapons of mass destruction
is sufficient to justify aggression the
supreme crime of Nuremberg that's a
significant change because almost
everyone has the ability the high school
and your local community probably has
the ability to produce chemical and
biological weapons and the intent was
just subjective evaluation which means
that anyone is subject to attack now
that's been made even more clear just a
few days ago by Condoleezza Rice who
reviewed what are now the official
reasons for that justified the attack
against Iraq and it's worth looking at
them not as a criticism of her but to
see what the conditions are that are now
accepted for free aggression according
to her Iraq the attack on Iraq was
legitimate because it had used weapons
of mass destruction in the past she
omitted conventionally the words with
our support those are never added
secondly it had attacked neighbors twice
again omitting the fact that the first
attack was with our support and the
second attack was followed by us
authorization to Saddam Hussein to crush
a Shiite rebellion which might well have
overthrown him a fact which is has an
eerie similarity to what's happening
right at this moment as the US the CPA
is desperately evading
the call of Iraqis for an election
because in which the Shiite majority
would obviously dominate so that's the
second the reason the third reason is
that Saddam Hussein allowed terrorists
to run in his country and was funding
terrorists outside of his country well
she didn't bother providing evidence for
that we do have evidence namely that was
that it was false but that it's but that
now something like that is true so the
evidence that we have and intelligence
agencies and independent analysts have
pretty much agree on this is that before
the US invasion Iraq had kept quite far
from the international terrorist
organisations but after the invasion
predictably Iraq itself has become a
terrorist state a another front in the
war on terrorism and that recruitment
for al-qaeda
style groups has significantly increased
so as predicted the war did increase the
threat of terror and indeed succeeded
for the first time and turning Iraq into
a nest of terror fourth she there her
fourth argument is that Iraq has refused
to account for its weapons of mass
destruction and that I'm concealed his
programs well that's partially true
actually Iraq was more closely
investigated by inspectors than other
countries which have anything like
comparable programs but that aside there
is another country in the region which
has refused to account for its weapons
of mass destruction and concealed its
programs even though it's well known
that it has hundreds of nuclear weapons
and is producing chemical and biological
weapons and is regarded as extremely
hazardous in fact by the US military
command and the strategic command
stretch
but that one doesn't count because
that's us client so it's there for free
of any of these obligations another US
ally as we have has recently been made
public that was known for a long time
Pakistan has been openly involved in the
illegal proliferation for years it's all
been quite public inconceivable that US
intelligence agencies didn't know the
worst of what's now being exposed was in
the late 80s in the early 90s and it's
hard to imagine that the National
Security Adviser at the time or the head
of the Pentagon didn't know what was
publicly available on the streets of
Islamabad meaning that the current
Secretary of State and Vice President
had to know about this right at the time
there's no fuss being made properly
because it is indeed extremely dangerous
well those are the four reasons for
attacking Iraq run through them they in
effect eliminate any barriers to the use
of force at will almost no pretense lift
well let me drop that and turn to the
corollary the idea that states that
harbor terrorists must be attacked to
eradicate evil here we have to make an
exception we have to agree to exclude
the category of harboring government
officials if we open that door
the doctrine instantly reduces to
absurdity so let's not talk about
harboring government officials who are
large-scale terrorists and keep to
harboring set what are called
sub-national terrorists those aren't at
the level of state planners or heads of
state so what about heart which
countries Harbor sub-national terrorists
well there are many charges about
pre-invasion Iraq kind that I've
mentioned that you've heard
they're rather dubious and it isn't but
there's much point paying much attention
to them because there are some very
clear cases of harboring terrorists
therefore terrorist states where this is
no controversy so take for example a
current a case that's currently timely
the case of the Cuban five which ought
to be front page news everywhere their
appeal is coming up in about two weeks
what are the Cuban Five well as I'm sure
you know the United States has been
engaged in large-scale terrorist attacks
against Cuba since 1959
the US government direct participation
in those attacks ended in the late
seventies at least officially but sin
and since that time instead of directly
attacking Cuba the United States has
been harboring terrorist networks that
attack Cuba well again this is not
particularly controversial it's accepted
for example by the FBI and the Justice
Department so it takes a Orlando Bosch
who's now living happily in Florida he
is accused by the FBI of about thirty
acts of terrorism quite serious ones
like blowing up Cubana airliner with
killing seventy three people and many
others some committed on US soil
the Justice Department the US Justice
Department regarded him regards him as a
dangerous terrorist whose presence in
the United States is a serious threat to
the United States and says that for
thirty years he has been engaged in
implementing or organizing terrorist
activities George Bush the first gave
him a presidential pardon at the request
of his son the governor of Florida so
that major terrorist is now carefully
harbored in Florida what about the Cuban
five where do they fit in to this in the
early 90s when it was clear that
terrorist attacks were going to go on
from there Cuba Cuban agents infiltrated
Florida terrorist groups for several
years at one point they the Cuban
government informed the FBI that they
now had large-scale information about
terrorist groups operating in the United
States the FBI sent high-level officials
to Havana where they were given
thousands of pages of documentation and
hundreds of hours of video and audio
tape documenting terrorist actions being
planned and some carried out in Florida
and the FBI did react namely by
immediately
arresting the people who gave them the
information that's the Cuban five they
reacted by leaving the terrorist cells
untouched and not pursuing the
information but arresting the informants
who had infiltrated them and provided
them with the information three are now
facing life sentences
several spent a long time and this went
off whatever that is in solitary
confinement their wives are not allowed
to visit them the visas the unity
government insisted on trying the case
in Miami the request for a change of
venue was turned down the foreman of the
jury opened by saying that I regard
Castro as a communist dictator and other
members of the jury went on the
prosecution conceded that they couldn't
prove the case but a Miami trial was
sufficient so that's the case of the
Cuban five now coming up for appeal why
is Cuba such a target for u.s. terror
well actually that was explained nicely
yesterday in the lead story of The Wall
Street Journal they look at the lead
story you see it described it says that
Cuba has been dedicated to the cause of
the railing the US agenda in Latin
America and therefore is a justified
target for attack actually the author of
the story probably didn't know it but he
was virtually quoting from declassified
CIA documents 40 years earlier which
explained the reason for the attack at
that time extensive terrorist attack on
Cuba on the grounds that Cuba the that
the very existence of the Castro regime
is successful defiance of US policies
going back 150 years so it just can't be
meaning back to the days of them on or a
doctrine when the u.s. intended to take
over Cuba so no Russians nothing like
that
so obviously that can't be accepted and
the Wall Street Journal more or less has
it straight when they say that the crime
is the dedication to the cause of the
railing the US has agenda in in Latin
America the same article of the Wall
Street Journal goes on to say that
Chavez in Venezuela is the heir apparent
to Castro's cause of derailing the u.s.
agenda in Latin America which makes
Venezuela the successful existence of
that government an unacceptable
successful defiance of US policies going
back 150 years with consequences that
will be familiar to people who know
about the history of this region and
again it's timely just a few days ago a
Venezuela sought extradition of two
military officers who had fled Venezuela
after they were charged with setting off
bombs in Caracas they're now here
Venezuela's asking for extradition
two more terrorists harbored here for
the moment we'll see what happens with
that this is connected with the military
coup
a couple months ago which was openly
backed by the Bush administration
although it drew back when the aroused
an enormous opposition in Latin America
and the military coup was overthrown
according to the British press very good
correspondence in the British press of
Latin American specialists so they
claimed to have amassed evidence that
the coup was instigated working at least
in part instigated by three major
figures of the Bush administration who
have a long record of involvement in
terrorist crimes in the 1980s namely
Elliott Abrams Otto rife and John
Negroponte II their involvement in
terrorist crimes in the 1980s again
isn't controversial for that we can turn
to the World Court judgement that Tony
mentioned and to Security Council
resolutions endorsing the World Court
judgement which of course were vetoed by
the United States with Britain politely
abstaining well just to draw some
conclusions the Bush Doctrine quite
directly implies that the United States
is a terrorist state and should be
treated accordingly
so obviously harboring terrorists might
a few examples could easily add many
others just add one more right across
the river there's a leading terrorists
being harbored amano a constant who was
the head of the paramilitary
organization that was responsible for
killing thousands of Haitians during the
in the period of the military junta
which was supported not so tacitly by
bush one and even more by Clinton Haiti
has asked for his if sentence did him in
absentia they have asked for his
extradition repeatedly they never get a
response the general suspicion is that
the
doesn't want to extradite him because in
a trial connections with the
disconnections with the US intelligence
will come out but whatever the reasons
are
he's another terrorist Harvard here one
might say that killing several thousand
four black people doesn't really count
as much of a crime so maybe it's not
like other cases of harboring terrorists
won't go into that well without
continuing it's it's not very hard to
evaluate the doctrine of driving evil
from the world if we accept the
condition of universality but as Henry
Kissinger accurately pointed out that's
an error
the doctrine is is holds only only
selectively the power is a doctrine that
the powerful may invoke but not anyone
else so therefore you could say that all
the examples I've given are completely
irrelevant and any others like them as
for the imperial grand strategy this I
think its implications are as
revolutionary as Henry Kissinger
indicated I think a good case can be
made that the implications go far beyond
and that it should be a matter of rather
considerable concern No thank you very
much
I hope we have time for a few quick
questions I know Hannah check wants to
present you with the medal of excellence
but I think there are a few people who
want to ask some questions and normally
I I give myself the right to ask the
first one but today I won't hug the
microphone and I'll go to Ricardo I'll
die of not Emacs first
hi mr. Chomsky we got all that from not
Emacs I would trust good to talk brave
questions what is in your view the risk
of four more years of Bush both inside
the United States
I'm full international system what the
impact will be and secondly do you think
Kofi Annan should cede to us pressure to
send back you and personnel to Iraq and
does he have any room not to say I mean
to say no it's very hard to predict the
weather and predicting human Ferris is
extremely difficult but there is a fair
possibility no possibility beyond what I
think any rational person would want to
accept that another four years of the
same policies it could be extremely
dangerous for the country and the world
and could cause maybe irreparable harm
remember we have a lot of evidence it's
not just the past four years the same
people essentially we're in office for
12 years 1981 to 1992 and there is a
rich record of what they accomplished it
is not discussed in the United States
because we have a kind of a principle
here that you're not supposed to look
into the mirror it's not unique to the
United States but very striking here so
anything that happened in the past
didn't happened okay because we've
changed course or some miracle has taken
place
so we're therefore not permitted to
carry out the rational approach that we
would to anyone else
I mean if Saddam Hussein appears in a
trial and says well why are you bringing
up all that old stuff from the eighties
that mean anything now I'm a nice guy I
just had a born-again experience and you
know I'm going right to heaven we
wouldn't even bother laughing but when
that is done year after year after year
as it is by our own leaders
we applaud okay that's what it means to
be a disciplined intellectual and if we
don't want to accept that discipline we
can treat the matter just as we would in
the case of Saddam's cry
or Stalin's crimes or anyone else's we
can ask well what did they do during
those 12 years and what are they been
doing the last four years the more
reactionary it's a reactionary selection
from the first 12 years and it's clear
enough they have a domestic agenda which
is not hidden I mean they're trying to
unravel the progressive legislation of
the past century to overcome the
achievements of popular struggles hard
ones to gain some benefits for people
what we call a minimal welfare state to
transfer power into the hands of
unaccountable private tyrannies in one
way or another every aspect of the
program is like that internationally
they have the programs that I've
described they may back off from them
because they may find them unfeasible
but the programs are clear and that's
only part of them I mean it's also
program is about international economic
Arrangements I think these could be very
dangerous in fact the kinds of programs
I just talked about it could literally
lead to the destruction of the species
you know again you can't put a
probability on that we don't know what
the likelihood was of a devastating
nuclear war in 1962 man when literally
the world was one word away from a
nuclear exchange one Russian submarine
commander countermanded in an order to
shoot off nuclear tipped torpedoes
during the Cuban Missile Crisis which
very likely would have led to a
devastating nuclear response and then on
and on and then Eisenhower's destruction
of the northern hemisphere one word that
was 1962 January 1959 1995 was much more
dangerous far greater destructive
capacity at that point we were two
minutes away as these threats are being
increased militarization of space alone
is increasing the
significantly and you know rational
people don't take chances like that and
no matter what your subjective
probability is but it will increase
Financial Times
oh well you know basically no one has a
right to be in Iraq but Iraqis so they
should take the lead in determining what
happened what the invasion has left such
wreckage that how Iraqis might decide to
deal with what remains you know I can't
say I mean we know what they say in
polls and you can make your own
judgments from that in recent Iraqi
polls the the most favorable rating for
a foreign leader is Jacques Chirac the
but by about five to one they regard the
US British forces as occupiers not
liberators right after Bush made his
speech about how we're changing course
once again and want to bring democracy
to the world actually reiterating what
Reagan had said 20 years earlier and
everyone else after that speech which
was greeted with the usual reverential
awe in the United States there was a
poll in Iraq about asking you know
Iraqis why they thought the US was in
Iraq and some agreed with President Bush
and the commentators here 1% 1% thought
that the goal was to bring democracy to
Iraq about 70 percent thought it was to
controller X resources and to reorder
the Middle East and consistently with
the goals of the United States and
Israel actually their responses were
more nuanced and sophisticated when it
went further it turned out that about
half although one percent thought the US
was trying to bring democracy about half
thought that the United States wanted
democracy if the US could
now that's the sophisticated response
the one that's based on history the one
that is understood by everyone in Latin
America for example or the one that
Iraqis understand perfectly well from
their own history I'm sorry they were
free you know under British rule since
the 1920s but they know without reading
British secret records that they were
granted freedom on the grounds the
internal British records that they would
be an Arab facade behind which Britain
would rule with various constitutional
fictions and so on and same in Central
America and Caribbean yes you can be
free and democratic as long as you do
what we say and I presume that's the
reaction of Iraqis and usually the
victims have a reasonably good
understanding of the world the people
holding the hammers and guns usually
don't understand very well but I think
we should try to respond to their
understand and if they want UN officials
there a UN force there okay
I mean if they want a military forces
from the region to try to control the
miserable security situation that's
resulted from the invasion okay that's
their decision if they want to accept
the economic program that has been
rammed down their throats by the CPA
which no sovereign country would accept
just opening the country up to complete
purchase by foreigners meaning mainly US
corporations they decide they want that
like they want to commit economic
suicide all right fine
if they decide they want the kinds of
social and economic programs every
sovereign state with any independence
pursues that's fine too then we throw
that out and so on my child he was in
this room not so long ago and he told us
he loved the program he may I mean that
program we'll have we know what that
effect what effect such programs have
those are the programs that created the
third world I mean if anyone knows any
economic history knows
that say 200 years ago there wasn't much
difference between what's now the first
world and what's now the third world
actually India and China where the
commercial and industrial centers of the
world Europe was kind of backwards in
most respects but now they're very
different hugely different
how did it happen the European states
the developed States England United
States France Germany Japan the one
country that resisted colonialism up to
the East Asian you know Tigers without
exception they radically violated the
principles of economic liberalism they
insisted on massive state protection and
subsidy just as the US economy does
today it they were very highly
protectionist an interventionist on the
other hand they forced what is now the
third world to accept economic
liberalism program that Chava he wants
an extreme form of it and it had the
predicted effects so at the end of two
hundred years of British rule India was
not the commercial industrial center of
the world anymore from which Britain was
stealing technology and so on it was an
impoverished peasant country with
mortality rates about the same as they'd
been two hundred years earlier began to
develop afterwards somebody could follow
its own principles
however in every one of these
third-world countries
everyone there is an elite which is
extremely wealthy and privileged serves
the interests of the foreign masters and
they do just fine you know you go to the
poorest country in sub-saharan Africa
and there are people living at a lavish
lifestyle we can't dream of so in Iraq
too under this system there will be such
people the ones working with the foreign
bankers and international investors and
with Halliburton and so on they're gonna
have local managers know what fast
running out of time there are various
people who want to ask questions
I see three hands but I can identify I
think they're more back there I'd like
to take three questions and then I think
what I should do is allow those who
want to leave to leave so I'm gonna
recognize the Financial Times the
Iranian news agency in tempo and any
others who want to ask any questions
I'll ask you to pause well have they
will be in the medal ceremony those who
want to leave can leave and those who
want to stay in are some more questions
if you if you can do it and we'll let
you do that the other thing is perhaps I
could ask you to be at a griefer in your
responses you never hear that um
actually I was gonna ask two questions
but I'm just gonna ask one now very
specific question I was very interested
in the stuff you're saying about space
do you have a sense of where the debate
is going now in the United Nations in
terms of its - something I haven't
followed enormous didn't hit our radar
screen and what's going to be coming up
over the next year Thanks well we can
that's very easy when an answer just
take a look at the last debate was
December at the General Assembly it's
the first committee I guess the
Committee on the space and disarmament
which is essentially the full General
Assembly was last December there were
several resolutions that came to the
floor
one was a reiteration of the effort to
ban militarization of space I remember
the numbers but I think it was voted
something like you know 174 to 3 or
something like that
at a u.s. Israel and some Pacifica
Pacifica Island there was another
important resolution which called for
removing weapons of mass destruction
from the middle-east and that was also
voted overwhelmingly I can't I don't
remember the numbers but overwhelmingly
with the u.s. Israel and maybe a Pacific
Islands opposed but you can look at the
debates they're right there on the you
know in the UN record and that's been
going on for years the the first
committee this the disarmament and
Security Committee I think it's called
has been dealing has been meeting
regularly for seven years and has been
hung up on the question of
militarization of space everyone on the
committee's led by China but it's
and essentially unanimous has been
trying to put some teeth in the 1967
Outer Space Treaty which does loosely
reserve space for peaceful uses and they
want to enforce that and strengthen it
and it's been blocked all the way by the
United States all the way and there is
no reporting on this in the United
States thank you virtually none had some
friends do database searches you know
you find a little newspaper in Utah that
mentioned it or something all right so
it's basically unknown but it's public
new coming up yeah the disarmament
committee will continue to meet and the
General Assembly will continue to meet
but they can't do anything if the United
States vetoes it
I mean the same is true in the Outer
Space Treaty itself there is a 1967
Outer Space Treaty which is not terribly
specific but the implication of it us is
to prevent the use of space for military
purposes for a long time nobody did much
with it a few years ago effort started
coming along in the General Assembly to
ratify it again re verify it the reason
was the recognition that the u.s.
intends to violate and it's come up year
after year forget how many now that one
the US doesn't vote against it abstained
everyone votes for it and the US and
Israel I abstain okay Israel doesn't
matter but an au s abstention is
ineffective veto a double veto the u.s.
abstention vetoes the proposal and
vetoes it from history which is why you
don't know about so it's not reported
and not discussed and so on so the
double veto has succeeded in blocking
efforts to so I said abstain but when
the u.s. abstains it's in effect a veto
it's because that means not going to
happen okay when the most powerful state
in the world says look I mean do with is
that's infected veto and in fact a
double veto
because reporting is also effectively
Veta and it disappears from history the
and and that's been the course of the
issue of militarization of space for
probably five or six years now this goes
back to the Clinton administration all
of this completely public incidentally
so if you read the if you look take a
look at the website of the Space Command
that's open back around 1997
it's a Clinton era era the Space Command
announced clearly its programs fuller
than control of space not ownership of
space now it's up to ownership for
control of space very elusive Lee I mean
what kind of reading like a little
Maoist
book it said the US must control have
military control of space to protect our
investments and commercial interests and
then it went on to give a little bit of
history it said in the past countries
needed armies and navies like written to
control their commercial interests and
investments and now the next frontier is
space and we're going to take control of
that to control our commercial interests
and investments okay very friend and
then they also pointed out here they
agree with US intelligence projections
that the process of so-called
globalization will have exactly the
opposite effects of what is predicted
and then it will increase the it will
lead to a widening economic divide a
growing gap between the haves and the
have-nots the US intelligence
projections are the same it'll lead to a
growing economic divide also financial
volatility meaning lower growth and in
this case of in situation with a growing
with a widening economic divide and a
growing number of have-nots it's going
to be harder to keep them under control
so therefore we knew new devices like
for example militarization of space
during usages professor what would be
the role and situation of other players
such leaders of Russia China France and
others when they have to give up to some
kind of compromise or what nobody has to
do anything what they are likely to do
is pretty much what they are doing
Russia as I mentioned has in the last
year has sharply increased I think by
about thirty percent its military
spending for offensive military purposes
new offensive weapons and so on
China is widely expected to do the same
or maybe already be doing the same in in
part and just in reaction to the
ballistic missile defense development I
mean everyone involved in that has
predicted that of course China is going
to respond by increasing its offensive
military capacities others will respond
in other ways I mean nobody is going to
say thank you please cut my throat if
you announce that you're going to attack
people of will and destroy them at will
they are likely to find some mode of
response that's why many international
well known international scholars have
said that these policies in Crete are
tend to increase proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and to
increase terror those are reactions that
people can use and sooner or later
weapons of mass destruction and terror
will come together maybe right here it's
just a matter of time so those are
possible reactions there are other
things going on as well I mean
militarily the world is unipolar no
question about that
I mean the u.s. probably stands as much
as the rest of the world combined
they're close to it and military force
and as far more advanced for example
there isn't a space race no because
there's only one country racing when the
u.s. is talking about going from control
to ownership it's not as if someone else
is in
with the control they're not so
overwhelmingly ahead from a military
point of view but not economically
economically there have been an are
three major economic centers or less on
a par your Europe Northeast Asia Japan
and China South Korea others interacting
with them they're kind of on a par
Europe is an economic unit of the same
category as the United States Northeast
Asia is the most dynamic economic region
of the world it's it also happens to
have about half of global foreign
exchange reserves the former head of the
Clinton's Council and Economic Advisers
Laura Tyson really recently described
the International economy in four simple
words she said America spends Asia lens
and how long that's going to go on
nobody knows but it it's it's an area
which has reserves which is growing fast
which already has a greater GDP than
North America does Europe is the same
Europe country through a lot of talk has
approximately the same growth level
productivity growth level per capita as
the United States and can go off in its
own direction these are issues that go
way back to the end of the Second World
War I mean it's right throughout the
Cold War one of the concerns of u.s.
planners was that Europe would become
what's called a third force would go off
on its own well that still remains the
end of the Cold War hasn't changed that
and now there are comparable problems in
East Asia a lot of the maneuvering
around control over Middle East oil and
the lesser but significant central of
Central Asian oil resources a lot of
that nuvaring including Iran has to do
with who's going to control those energy
resources because whoever controls them
if the u.s. control
as it intends to do it will have what
George cannon once called veto power
over the decisions of other actors that
was fifty years ago
it's even more the case now so a lot of
lot of alternatives for example of
integration of the world on the war in
Iraq
what do you think that is the fine I
mean there's a lot of studies this by
and large media transmit a doctrinal
position which is shared by state power
by corporate power and by the media
elites themselves were part of it it's
easy to document it if you want to and
if you want a close analysis concerning
with concerned with Iraq I'd suggest
that you take a look at one careful
study done by we didn't pick up on the
web done by the most important public
attitude study program in the world it's
the program on international policy
attitudes of at the University of
Maryland p IP aid or Aikido they did a
study about a month ago or so called
misimpressions of iraq okay in which
they investigated beliefs that are so
obviously outlandish that there's no
serious debate about whether true or
false and those are the misimpressions
of Iraq and they evaluated them among
the public they're extremely high but
then in response to your question they
traced those misimpressions to media
sources turned out if you're getting
people who are getting their news from
Fox News about eighty percent had at
least one
is misimpression many more people who
are getting their news from major print
media you know Haley print press about
50% serious misimpression those who are
getting it from National Public Radio
about 25 percent serious misimpression
these incidentally are misimpressions
that I don't think anyone would have in
Europe or Asia or anywhere else and
that's misleading estimate as they point
out because about twenty to twenty-five
percent of the public somewhere in that
neighborhood are getting their
information from talk radio you just
turn that on and you'll find out what
that means and among young people when
you sort of break down the demographics
forgotten the numbers but I think a
majority from say 18 to 22 roughly that
range are getting their news from a
comic shows that are on television late
at night you know these political comic
shows well you know taking out that
piece of the population but this is an
indication of the way effectively the
corporate media transmitted a kind of
propaganda line not because they are
subordinating themselves to it but
because they agree with mr. Chomsky we
clearly could go on all afternoon here
there are a lot of people I could see
who would like to ask questions but we
don't have time and hands yellow check
does want to give you your medal for
your sterling work over the years I'm
going to allow my colleagues who need to
go off and file to leave and what goes
to the medal ceremony and then those who
want to stay and ask some questions
perhaps we might be able to squeeze in a
few before lunch hands
professor Chomsky it's a great honor for
us that you accepted our invitation but
even more so that you accepted our Award
of Excellence which the Society of
writers has been giving annually to
outstanding literary and political
figures for their contribution to peace
and understanding in fact over the past
15 or 17 years so far and it was
previously awarded to international
statesmen such as McCabe is Gorbachev
and great writers like Norman Mailer the
members of the Society founded in 1989
our diplomats and journalists accredited
to the United Nations as well as
individual staff members with a
distinguished literary record we deeply
believe that there is a link between
politics or diplomacy on one hand and
literary art on the other because there
many things that you cannot say in a
political or diplomatic fashion you need
a literary element and this is one of
the things that we have admired about
you for so many years it's not only what
you say it's how you say it and you can
see what a response you have and you
never raise your voice and you never
swear and you never hit the table with
your fist you always keep calm but
persuasive peace persuasive indeed and
this is why the citation for the award
which is a medal I will take I will show
it which is a medal on the blue ribbon
with the inscription x-men T Office
which I puts a translator
as from the spirit of the world but
there are also other interpretation but
what it means really is the conscience
of mankind and that's what it's all
about professor Chomsky be honor you
today in gratitude he had kept the flame
of reason and common sense alive when
they were threatened you stayed calm in
the clash of civilizations but recorded
the conflict in a uniquely somber and
persuasive style your voice is heard all
over the globe
you have earned the respect of millions
eager to find the truth in a troubled
world there is no better place to
express our respect to you then here the
United Nations whose spirit and
principles you represent
[Applause]
[Applause]
very much appreciate it and now I know
how my students feel when they get
offered the job all right well we're I
mean we're going to be taking the
professor upstairs to have some light
shortly but are there any more questions
does anybody well I only seem I only see
I see three hands so I'm going to take
those three questions and then I'm
afraid that's going to be it and to
leave the pioneer of India thank you Oh
yesterday George Bush he announced his
budget and there's a increase in defense
spending how alarming is that can you
comment how alarming is the increasing
defense spending well I mean it's
alarming in many respects for one thing
spending on one area provides what are
called forgone opportunities means you
don't spend on another there are very
serious problems in the country that
require major spending I don't have to
enumerate them and there if you have
more spending for what's euphemistically
called defense you don't spend on those
other things or those problems get worse
and they are serious the military
spending itself has two functions one
function is of course intimidation and
domination
it's what's described in say the Clinton
era is if you're a Space Command
document the public document brochure
that I quoted to use military force to
secure us investments and commercial
interests and now that means
in accord with the national security
strategy as by now sharpened according
the right to attack anyone you like
without you know without pretext and in
accord with the means now available with
ownership of space and so on so that's
one aspect and we don't have to talk
about what that implies it's not pretty
however there's another aspect of
military spending which is often
suppressed it keeps the economy alive
now this is not what's called the
military-industrial complex that's wrong
what's called the new economy you know
that everyone is so proud of what on
Greenspan hails as the result of the
entrepreneurial spirit of the free
market and you've heard all of this
stuff almost all of that comes out of
the dynamic state sector of the economy
that's one reason why the third world
became the third world while the first
world remained became the first world
the first world relies on a dynamic
state sector no country more than the
United States so take a look at all the
things you're you use you know computers
electronics generally the internet trade
which is based on containerization
containers biotechnology run through the
list they almost all derive from the
state sector the public there are
devices by which the public pays the
costs and shares the risk and then if
anything comes out of it it's handed
over to private power so like say the
internet it was for 30 years it was in
the state sector that's when all the
hard work was done around 1995 it was
marketable so was handed over to private
corporations computers throughout the
nineteen fifty in the 1950s computer was
something about the size of this room
with vacuum tubes blowing up all over
the
and paper of flooding all over during
the 1950s under the pretext of air
defense the places like MIT I am we're
able to get computers down to the point
where you could sell them to somebody
first mainframes company was a spinoff
from that around 1960 that's why IBM has
shifted from making typewriters to
making computers they were part of this
and it's the same with almost the entire
dynamic part of the economy furthermore
this goes way back in history so the if
you go back a century the major
engineering problems metallurgical and
engineering problems and mechanical
problems the major ones the hard ones
that had to do with putting huge guns on
moving platforms which were able to hit
another moving target meaning naval guns
that was an extremely difficult problem
required complicated engineering
electronics metallurgy and so on
and it was carried out primarily by the
English and the Germans then under the
rubric of defense but then of course
it's spun off into the automotive
industry and all sorts of other things
that gave the economy of that day
economic historians of technology point
out maybe accurately that space that the
problems of space today
are comparable to the problems of naval
gunnery hundred years ago and I'll have
the same effect
so that's without proceeding that's
another part of the defense's so-called
defence system it's a way of socializing
risk and cost and creating the profits
of the future economy everyone you know
I mean this is all kind of suppressed in
a way so we talked about free markets
and the entrepreneurial spirit and
everything else but the actual way the
economy works is crucially like this and
that's part of the military system too
you could ask is it a good thing
you know is it nice to have computers
and the Internet and so on well maybe
maybe not
but the real question is is that the way
to do it I mean sure the decision to
spend public funds but to develop
computers rather than say a health
system should that be made by deceiving
people into believing they're being
protected from enemies or should it be
made by the people themselves who are
evaluating these decisions in other
words do we believe in democracy if we
believe in democracy back in the 1950s
there wouldn't have been you know an air
defense system designed to create
computers that IBM could later sell
there would have been a public informed
discussion of whether we want our
resources to go into having pcs 25 years
from now or have a decent healthcare and
school and transportation system I mean
I know which way I would have blowed it
but that's for people to decide and that
those decisions are taken out of
people's hands in large part through the
military system it's another one of the
devices for undermining democracy and
for creating a particular kind of
private run economy in the future
that's quite apart from its role in the
use of military force so all of this has
to be considered
I was just wondering would you have any
comment on the presidential race so far
on the presidential race well no it's
not a great secret that in the United
States elections are basically bought
large part of the population accepts
that as true so right before the 2000
election before the election so no
Florida trickery you know no Supreme
Court before the election about three
quarters of the public regarded it as
mostly farce some game involving rich
contributors party bosses and the public
relations industry huge public relations
industry
which trains candidates to keep away
from issues to present what are call
qualities you know I'm a nice guy to
invent to talk about values but to keep
away from the issues that are important
to people and if you even if they talk
about those issues to do it in such a
way that nobody can figure out where
they stand which was essentially the
case that's the attitude of about 75% of
the public and it's not inaccurate and
the result is that whoever can flood the
can flood the propaganda system
overwhelmingly pens to win look at the
statistics over the years it's dramatic
now in a democratic culture that
concentration of power could be overcome
so to say take Brazil recent case I'm in
Brazil concentration of capital
concentration of media is worse than it
is here
it's a much more repressive state than
here here the state is minimally
repressive by comparative standards
nevertheless popular organizations were
able to reach a level of activism
engagement in which they were able to
overcome these consequences in the
United States right now that's just not
imaginable it should be but it isn't in
order to reach the level of say Brazil
we would have to have a reconstruction
revitalization of a democratic culture
that has been very severely eroded
consciously eroded I mean doesn't just
happen by itself and that's a hard work
it's not going to happen by this
election so this election will be like
the standard one I presume in which it
will be bought who's gonna buy it well
you know the Bush administration has
money coming out of their years the
financial industry who loves them the
pharmaceutical industry's salivating
over the wonderful gifts they're getting
the rich in general are getting an
enormous gifts from the administration
and they're going to pay it back because
they want to they want
train ride to continue fantastic for the
extreme rich wealthy the financial
institutions other pop sectors of the
economy they love it so they want it to
stay and that means in the last no
matter what Democrat is nominated in the
last couple of weeks of the election
campaign you can expect huge PR campaign
I mean we can yes here's one guess as to
what it will be pulling it out of a hat
I mean if I was Karl Rove you know say
planning what's going to happen the last
couple of months I'd say well you know
here's a nice scenario let's right
before the Democratic convention
let's either kill or capture Osama bit a
lot almost certain they know where he is
you know how hard can it be to find
somebody in a small area of Afghanistan
Pakistan so let's wait until right
before the Democratic convention
suddenly killer captures that Osama huge
victory in the war on terror let's say
Kerry runs let's paste this achievement
alongside of a picture of him standing
next to Jane Fonda and stabbing our
three boys in the back and you know on
and on then on to the coronation right
here in New York by accident timed with
the anniversary of 9/11 I don't have to
tell you what that's going to look like
yeah I mean you don't have to be a PR
genius to figure out how to do this so
something like that all
presumably happen and unless there's
some very surprising changes like it's
very hard for me to see how it can fail
I hope I hope it fails but
you know I had say that just take one
more but how can I turn down a request
like that so I could you identify
yourself I do Greek newspaper a little
to be a professional many people claim
that the Republican Party has become the
official party of the religious right
what are the consequences of this in the
following year and the second part is
why the anti-war movement in the USA was
not successful in stopping stopping
the war in Iraq who I couldn't represent
the public opinion again first question
yeah there's no doubt that I mean the
Republican Party is basically a party of
the super-rich and they have to have a
popular base and one way in which
they've organized the popular base is
what are called in the PR industry
values keep away from issues and focus
on values in other words don't let
people think about the fact that they're
not gonna have a job that don't let him
think about the fact that in the 20
years since the Republicans basically
took over with a little interim average
real wealth has actually declined for
about ninety percent of the population
don't let him think about that don't let
them think about the fact that Americans
have the highest workload in the world
the lowest benefits the least social you
know that only country with basically no
advanced country with no health services
other can't take care of your elderly
mother and don't let people think about
that sort of thing let them think about
rising to heaven when all the evil has
been destroyed and these souls are saved
okay
or let them think about having a lot of
guns that big and running around with
and killed all the aliens are gonna
attack them or something like that let
them think about those things
but keep away from the issues okay don't
let them deal don't deal with the fact
that they really
these internet these corporate run
globalization systems everybody opposes
them so let's not talk about and if I
let's just keep away from all the issues
and focus on values so yeah you get a
mobilization of the extremist
fundamentalist group which is big in the
United States this goes back to the are
its origins not new and it goes back to
the origins of the country this extreme
fundamentalist strain I mean the people
who conquered New England you know early
at the pilgrims I mean they were raving
fundamentalist II wanted to you know who
were waiting the holy book couldn't
declaring themselves the children of
Israel and exterminating the Amalekites
story okay and it's for various reasons
that stayed like that it didn't become a
major political phenomenon until Carter
Carter who I presume was sincere
presented himself as a pious Christian
and that it was clearly understood
pretty well that that's an electoral
gambit that we can use since that time
just about every candidate for president
almost everyone pretends to be a very
religious you know Christian I mean you
know like Bill Clinton made sure that
every Monday morning there'd be a
photograph in the newspaper about him
lustfully singing and prayers at the
Baptist stones Oh what's going on in his
mind
anybody's certain question but this is
just a precondition for entering the
political system ever since this was
discovered and it's a way of keeping
people away from the issues just like in
fact if you take a look the last
election year 2000 Bush managed to get
roughly 50/50 split by getting a large
white working-class vote and where the
two main issues were not my job
or the trade issues I hate or that kind
of stuff the two main issues were
religiosity and guns
that's running a successful campaign
keep entirely away from the issues that
bother people and just go to something
you can throw them read Mina so yeah
that's a connection that's real there
was a second part of the anti-war
movement well I think it's a funny
question to ask I mean it's like asking
why in 1962 didn't the anti-war movement
succeed in stopping the u.s. attack
against South Vietnam well one reason is
it wasn't anywhere okay why didn't the
anti-war movement in France in 1950
prevent France from reinvade in their
former colony same answer there wasn't
any idea where movement I mean by now
opposition to war has reached far
greater proportions by now you can have
massive a tea war movements even before
a war is officially declared so so it's
true it you know didn't quite succeed in
stopping it but that's an enormous
change over earlier years in the case of
Vietnam for example it was seven or
eight years before there was any visible
and iwere movement by then South Vietnam
was virtually destroyed in the case of
the French conquest of Vietnam nothing
you know destroyed yeah a couple of
people protested but no movement and
those are changes over the years when
the Belgians you know got rid of Lumumba
and took over the Congo any protest no
it's it's become a much more civilized
world incident so yeah we should be
thankful for that there's never been
anything like the protests last February
never here or anywhere else
is it enough to stop another active
aggression well maybe not but it's
certainly a lot better never was so key
identify see my name is a chica mama I'm
a retired librarian from the United
Nations 1990 I retired I do not
present any newspaper I have a question
that Twitter might not be an easy answer
the Berlin conference of 1886 imposed
boundaries on African countries and with
what we have had to live for 100 and
what 20 30 years do you think that the
United Nations should take the lead in
freeing Africa from the burden of these
imposed boundaries that have no logic
whatsoever in considerations of the
ethnicities involved the prime example
is Nigeria of course from which I can
where we have struggled with whips
struggled endlessly with the ethnicity
the diversity is which diversity is good
in America diversity in Nigeria has
given us a lot of trouble is it
reasonable for the world to lift this
burden from of the Africans shoulders so
that peoples that cannot live together
can peacefully they help to separate if
they are if they have a potential for
viability in the intervening years
Czechoslovak a little chuckle
Czechoslovakia is peacefully split into
two things are going on in Yugoslavia in
Soviet Union where people have separated
peoples have separated not almost
peacefully but I know in Nigeria Biafra
tried to separate and was crushed
so my question simply is should they
be an end to the burden of the Berlin
conference of 1886 thank you I actually
think that's a sub case of a much
broader question first the narrow
question should the world overcome this
problem for Africa they say the UN I
don't think so I think those are
problems have to be overcome in Africa I
think Africans should overcome that
problem in their way with whatever
support and sympathetic support the rest
of the world can give them how are these
problems as you say are not unique to
Africa these this is the development of
the modern nation-state system in the
last hundreds of years
I mean Europe which is the center of it
was the bloodiest and most savage part
of the world for hundreds of years
because Europeans were slaughtering each
other trying to establish a totally
insane system namely the nation-state
system which exactly as you say just in
Europe doesn't correspond with people
what people's cultures are what their
connections are what their languages are
whatever it's just some irrational
system of force and domination that is
imposed on people with tremendous
violence I mean that's how Europe
developed the kind of culture of
violence which allowed it to conquer the
world
they were very practice and slaughtering
each other like the 30 years of war
alone you know that led to the Treaty of
Westphalia probably killed about maybe
40 percent of the population of Germany
these are not little things and in fact
it would have gone at which to it would
still be going on and a lot of talk in
political science about democratic peace
you know democratic countries don't go
to war well and look at the statistics
but there's one fundamental reason why
you're getting any results at all
in 1945 Europeans you know the
democratic countries realized that the
next time they play their traditional
game of slaughtering each other will be
the last because they had constructed
means of destruction so fantastic that
this game is just over okay did it for
the last 500
we can't debate so I gotta fight each
other anymore we'll fight defenseless
people but not each other you know go
snow otherwise it's over I can't do it
so yes there's a kind of a democratic
peace does that mean that for Europe
this is the right system that's a highly
artificial system in Europe too that's
why you see in Europe in opposition to
the centralizing tendencies of the
European Union there are also regional
tendencies development so if you look at
Spain and England and other parts of
Europe there's a kind of devolution
going on into regions that are more
autonomous that are reviving independent
local cultures and languages and I think
that's so much it's a very healthy
development in my view and not just free
and this in in the rest of the world
most of the conflicts that are going on
not just Africa Asia Middle East every
world are the results of Europe's
forceful imposition of the state system
in a way which had nothing to do with
the people I mean thank you what's a
rack rack was created by the British in
order to ensure that they would have the
oil not Turkey and that the country
wouldn't have an access to the sea so
they could control it okay and make it
free and democratic yeah and and that's
the same everywhere you look I mean
personal remark I'm happened to be under
investigation by the State Security
courts and Turkey because of the talk
that I gave in the Arabic here southeast
Turkey and which I said something nice
about the Ottoman Empire you know I
didn't suggest they would go back to the
Ottoman Empire you know a lot of rotten
things about it but I did say I thought
in many respects the Ottoman Empire had
the right idea it there was a center
which fortunately was very corrupt so
did interfere with people too much right
but for the most part it left people
alone to run their own affairs so you
know an Armenian part of you know
Lebanon could run its affairs and
somebody else could run something else
and you could travel from one place to
another without having a visa you know
and the local regions were pretty much
autonomous and federated and related and
so on and so forth and that's pretty
sensible way for the world to be
organized I think but that means
unraveling a complex system of
nation-states now very tightly linked to
private power because they're called
multinational corporations but they
heavily rely on their home state for all
kinds of support that in the financial
cost and risk provision militaries and
support and so on and so forth so this
whole kind of thing has to be slowly
unraveled and and I don't think there's
any formula for it it's really gonna
have to be done by people themselves
coming to terms with this just in a
destructive residue of history I take
the United States take take the
us-mexico boundary what's that you know
I mean half of Mexico was conquered by
the United States okay now it's called
the United States the Mexican US border
was like most borders was a result of
conquest it wasn't a natural awarded it
was a very porous border so people of
the same similar people lived on both
sides and they tend to the movie up and
back in 1994 something interesting
happened in 1994 NAFTA was passed with a
lot of rhetoric about how we're unifying
you know North America and so on and so
forth also in 1994 Clinton who was no
fool militarized the border for the
first time operation gatekeeper
militarized the border to make sure that
people wouldn't move up and back Capitol
yeah but not people so we got to stop
this free movement of people up and back
across a rather porous border and impose
of a border that's semi-porous capital
goes up and back
easily but not people because these
systems are not designed for people
their divine design for capital and
since then you get you know hundreds of
people being killed on the border and so
on and so forth well you know that word
shouldn't be there
just like other borders should but those
are things that are going to have to be
changed entirely through understanding
and social revolution of it and social
change I don't think they can be imposed
from the outside professor Noam Chomsky
it's been fascinating thanks so much
