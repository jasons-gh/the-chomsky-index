we have systems of of state subsidized
private enterprise which is by its
institutional nature seeking to maximize
profit and market share and of course it
will therefore meet the consequences
like these so say take your iphone the
minerals many the crucial minerals may
come from eastern Congo where
multinationals are kind of waiting while
the vicious militias murder people and
give opportunities to get the minerals
and the whole history that I described
before lies behind it but the iPhone is
actually manufactured in China it's
manufactured by a subsidy I wanna score
bration
Foxconn which is which runs assembly
plants in China the Foxconn in turn is a
subsidiary of Apple Corporation it
world's biggest corporation if you look
at the economics of iPhone production
turns out that the profits that Apple
makes from the sale of an iPhone are
about ten times as high as the profits
at Foxconn makes and the profits that
Foxconn makes are not sure what the
figure is but far higher than the
profits that the assembly plant in China
makes so China is actually making is
assembling the thing and it's called a
Chinese export but China makes almost
nothing from it the Taiwanese
corporation makes a lot more an Apple
makes a huge amount more and that goes
back to Apple stockholders and you know
people at cost and so on of course
highly concentrated among the extreme
wealthy but those are the economics of
production of iPhones now if you look
further and
we're the technology from iPhones came
from most of it came from the taxpayer
in this case mostly the US taxpayer of
for example the GPS system it came from
the Navy US Navy but who funds the US
Navy well American taxpayers you look at
the Rio micro electronics developed
mostly through pentagon funding who pays
for that taxpayer in fact virtually all
the technology comes from the dynamic
state sector of the u.s. British German
economies in a system that amounts to
public subsidy private profit so the if
we had a capitalist system than the
people who invested in the iPhone
technology would make the profit from it
that's the way capitalism supposed to
work you invest in something you make a
risky costly investment if some day its
profitable you're supposed to get the
profit but that's not the way it works
here the taxpayer doesn't who paid for
it in various indirect ways gets no
profit at all the profit goes to the
private enterprises that produce them
that are they're granted the technology
handed the technology so they can tweak
tweak it for marketing and then sell it
make profit so the profit goes to Apple
and Microsoft and Bill Gates and so on
and so forth but the carpet the said but
the risky investments over decades often
are made by the public so it's a
complicated system of state supported
private profit which is
built into the whole so-called
globalization system so if you take a
close look at the trade treaties that
are now being debated transatlantic
trans-pacific these are called free
trade treaties but that's part of the
general system of delusion imposed by
our ideological institutions they're not
free trade treaties they're investor
rights treaties they have almost nothing
to do with free trade tariffs among the
major traders are already very low
they'll barely change few cases here and
there they have the crucial element of
them is what are what's called
intellectual property which is a nice
term to cover monopoly pricing rights so
it grants pharmaceutical corporations
media mega corporations and others
enormous rights to steal from the public
through monopoly pricing granted by the
free trade systems there are pretexts
for this they claimed they needed for
research and development but if you look
closely that collapses pretty quickly
it's mainly a way to make the rich more
powerful more richer and more powerful
another element is invest investor state
dispute settlement which means the
rights to corporations remember
corporations were granted the rights of
personhood by the courts over century of
litigation grants the rights of these
immortal persons state created immortal
persons to sue other states something
that persons of flesh and blood can't do
sue other states because they may take
actions which might interfere with
profits so for example if Mexico wants
to set up an environmental protection
area where some US corporation wants to
mine gold let's
they consume mexico for taking away
their profits potential profits you
can't do that
I can't do that but these persons can do
it that's the basis them goes on like
this for what are called free trade
agreements just as the sale of iPhones
is called free market enterprise if you
look closely it's anything but so going
back to your question the end result of
the way these things are distributed is
the nature of the institutions that in
which we live in which we support at
least insofar as we tolerate them after
all we have a right to change and even
the capacity to change but you got to
understand them first and so I've got a
broader question which is with the
current way that international society
is organized and the spread of global
capitalism do you think we're really
capable of dealing with the economic
crisis well with all the crises that you
mentioned I don't think anyone knows the
answer to that question global
capitalism state capitalism is a pretty
flexible system a lot can have a lot of
different variants so the European
Social Democratic welfare state
innovations of the post Second World War
period changed the nature of state
capitalism in significant ways it's now
being reversed the intent and the nature
of the austerity programs is basically
one of dismantling democratic systems
and welfare state arrangements I think
that's pretty good evidence for this but
it's a flexible system and the question
is is it flexible enough to allow to
make it possible to deal with crises
like for example the environmental
crisis if we had real market system
we'd be finished market systems in
principle cannot deal with the
environmental crisis they can only
exacerbate it and there's a reason for
that simple reason market systems ignore
what economists call externalities so
when there's a transaction between two
units say people or corporations or
whatever they look after their own
interests but they don't pay attention
to the effects on others
that's an extra not negative externality
and if the so for example when global
goldman sachs makes a transaction if
they're paying attention they'll make
sure that may be a risky transaction
we'll make sure to cover their own risk
if they're careful but they're not going
to pay attention to what's called
systemic risk the the fact that if
something goes wrong with this
transaction the whole system may
collapse that's an externality well in
that case there's an answer the taxpayer
can step in and save them which is what
happens
but there's another externality which
nobody can step in and save and that's
destruction of the environment so to the
extent that we have market systems were
basically dead the question is will the
modifications of market systems that
fall within the rough range of state
capitalist systems is that sufficient to
deal with the problems of catastrophic
climate change or must the whole system
be dismantled and turned into a system
concerned with use rather than profit if
we don't know the answer to that
question but the answer will determine
whether organized human life continues
and it's an urgent question it's a
question for this generation that can't
be put off
