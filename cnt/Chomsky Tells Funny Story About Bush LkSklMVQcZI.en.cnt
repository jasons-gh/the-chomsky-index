hooded but i'm going to know well
actually i learned this story about five
years ago and i couldn't believe it so I
never properly but it's since been very
good so it's true that's here's the
story I received a letter and an article
from a well-known Belgian theologian the
article was a learning disorder in
Ezekiel which nobody understands it's
the passage about go and Magos coming
from the north Armageddon and so on a
circle I mean nobody knows whether
goguen Mago there are people or places
some other thing for whatever they may
be so the Prophet the passage is
extremely obscure but it enters into
evangelical Christian theology goguen
Mago or whoever your current enemies are
so when Reagan talked about these things
Gogan Mago the word of the Russians and
they were coming down horrible things
now goguen na go at that time this is
january 2003 who's the first that I'm
saying he was
we'll be coming down to Israel we start
getting souls that have been saved rise
to heaven everyone else got the
Christian evangelical tradition which
this is a part is very strongly
pro-israel than one of the main
pro-israel blocks but they are also the
most anti-semitic element in the world
they're in history probably their
picture is all the Jews will be killed I
mean unless they happen to convert time
can't get more a semitic than that
anyhow bush was meeting with jacques
chirac the president of France he was
trying to convince your act to join in
on the war against Iraq fortunately
didn't have that problem 10 Downing
Street didn't have to quote physique you
but of course of the discussion with
sure acts he started going on about this
Go Go Go than Ezekiel and so I'm sure
academically stuff he approached the
other day the Foreign Office asking can
you explain to with this maniac is
raving about and they do so they
approached this Belgian theologian who
explained to them what it was all about
that's what we survived it's kind of
amazing that we're all alive but we
survived a world in which finger on the
button that can destroy us all five
seconds is
often some world where Joe DiMaggio
there is the same break in fact that in
st. to the last few years on for years
the large part of the fate of the world
has been in the hands of One lunatic
who's waiting for the second coming
Armageddon and so on and another one
who's waiting for the 12th Imam who's
about human serve somebody was watching
this on Mars they would think that human
survival is a miracle the way it can
continue like this chances are it can
