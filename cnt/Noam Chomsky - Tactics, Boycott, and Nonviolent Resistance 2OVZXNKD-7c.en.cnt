and people take power and fight against
arms trade drugs trade and so on and if
so can they should they do it by
violence well you know justjust forget
about principle for a moment and just
think about tactics I mean you want to
pick tactics that are likely to achieve
something otherwise it's just posturing
well if you if you if you look for
tactics that might achieve something you
don't accept the battleground that your
opponent prefers now the state power
prefers violence do they have a monopoly
of violence you know no matter how much
violence protestors have use they'll use
more that's why I say from the 1960s
when I was talking to students about
activism I advised them not to wear
helmets in demonstrations I mean yes the
police are violent but if you wear a
helmet they'll just get more violent and
if you come along with you know a rifle
they'll come along with the tank you
come with a tank they'll come with a
b-52 you know that's it's not it's a
battle you're gonna lose and their you
know their strength is violence the
strength of the opposition is popular
mobilization and non-violence actually
that's what happened in Iraq strikingly
in Iraq of course it's never discussed
that way you know governments and media
intellectuals don't want you to know
about the power of about popular power
and what can be achieved by non-violence
but if you think about in Iraq that's
pretty much what happened there was
violent resistance us easily crushed it
you know they can kill insurgents they
can level Fallujah they can you know
destroy towns and villages no matter
what it is they have much more violence
at their command what they could not do
was deal with nonviolent demonstrations
when the Ayatollah Sistani called for
people to come out in the streets and
demand elections which the US was trying
to prevent all the way through they
wanted to prevent elections to impose
their own clients and so on they just
couldn't respond they couldn't do
anything with hundreds of thousands of
people in the streets so they permitted
elections then they tried to control and
manipulate the elections well they ran
into the force of Iraqi nationalism
finally at the end it's what I said by
January 2008 they were insisting the
u.s. that they have to have permanent
military bases permanent right to carry
out military actions and control Iraq's
oil resources they had to back down in
the face of mass popular nonviolent
resistance well those are the tools of
of the week you know that's what makes
you strong I think that boycott and is a
very good idea if it's properly targeted
so I think it makes good sense to
boycott say American corporations or
French corporations that are operating
in the occupied territories and they're
criminals and they should be blocked but
what about an academic boycott
and personally I've never been in favor
of academic work that's even South
African and in this case either let's
put aside any question of principle and
reduce it just to the question of
tactics again now you have to add
whenever you make tactical decisions you
have to ask who are you trying to help
are you trying to help yourself
so that you'll feel good are you trying
to help the victims so that you'll do
something for them now that leads to
very different tactical choices always
in this case suppose that the question
is boycotting say - University that's a
gift to the hardliners they're going to
immediately say and correctly you're a
total hypocrite
why aren't you boycotting the Sorbonne
or Harvard or Oxford their countries are
involved in much worse atrocities so why
boycott Haifa University so it's total
Apocrypha it's a gift to hardliners who
can undermine the content of the the
Goldi theoretical goal of the boycott it
may make the people who are doing it
feel good but it's harming the
Palestinians that's pretty common for
example in during the Vietnam War I was
rather struck by the fact that the
Vietnamese were strongly opposed to
actions like say the Weathermen young
kids nice kids
you know I admired them i under
sympathized with them but their way of
opposing the war was to go down the
street and break store windows ok the
Vietnamese were strongly opposed to that
because they want to survive they don't
care if American students feel good and
they understood correctly that marching
down the street with signs and breaking
store windows just increases support for
the war which is exactly what it did
it's a tactic that it's a feel-good
tactic like I'm doing something but it's
harmful to the victims what the
Vietnamese were impressed
and said so is you know if there was a
silent demonstration of women at a grave
let's say that they thought it was
impressive and this kind of thing you
should do and it's true if you want if
your goal is to help the victims and the
same is true in this case if you want to
help the Palestinians think about what
the consequences of the tactics are
there's also questions of principle but
I've put that aside what about the
consequences okay and it's not hard to
figure out
