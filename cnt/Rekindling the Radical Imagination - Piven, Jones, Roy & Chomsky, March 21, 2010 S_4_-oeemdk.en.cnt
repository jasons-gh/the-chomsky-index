you have really glad to see all of you
and welcome to the closing session of
what has been a great conference of the
left forum the largest conference of it
I don't know about you but I've been
here since sometimes Friday afternoon I
did go home to sleep a couple of times
and I went to lots of panels I chaired a
lot of panels actually and I'm so
pleased we had more people here than
ever before we had more young people
here than ever before we had lots of
undergrads we have high school students
we have lots of people who work in the
communities we have activists and a lot
of people who come here for the first
time tonight
I'm gonna talk a little bit first but
just a little bit and then you won't
believe this but we're going to have
Karl Marx here for real Karl Marx is
going to come out
and perform for us and then we're going
to hear from Arundhati Roy can you
imagine and then noam chomsky is going
to as the program said we all of us are
dedicating this evening to a great grand
man who was our comrade who died in
January Howard Zinn
Howard was all beloved figure he was my
friend for about 40 years and I want to
tell you why he was so admired and so
loved by so many of us first and some
historians don't know this yet Howard
Zinn was a great historian he was a fine
historian he was part of a generation of
historians who tried to redress the
traditional effort of emphasis that
historians had placed not only on war
and the affairs of state but on princes
kings presidents legislatures Howard
following in the footsteps of the
British social historians who also
studied the lives and political actions
of ordinary people
Howard studied the lives and the
Magnificent moments when ordinary people
burst into politics and reshaped the
course of American history Howard told
us about American history from Columbus
on to today focusing on Native Americans
on slaves on women on labor protesters
on anti-war protesters on civil rights
protesters his work was distinctive for
its sweet its lucidity and you know
people learned how special it was when
that book first came out around 79 or 80
like a lot of books written by
professors it didn't have a big sale but
it had a kind of row
motion people who bought the book told
other people who bought the book about
the book high school teachers who
assigned the book told other high school
teachers about the book and
undergraduate teachers and in the end
the people's history of the United
States sold over 2 million copies and
then came people's voices the and you
know there's something else about
Howard's work it was living work in the
sense that he revised it it changed
there were a lot of additions of
people's history the first edition was
full of empathy and compassion for the
poor people the working people the
underdogs of American history but as he
thought about it and wondered about it
and revised that book the stories the
accounts the narrative changed so not
only were these people magnificent for
their testimony to their experience and
their environment but they were
magnificent also because they were
changing the United States well there
was another facet to Howard that I think
helps explain why he was so beloved I
certainly think it's why I loved him as
a good friend and that is that he didn't
make a big fuss about his politics he
didn't say look at me look at how
courageous I am look at how hard I work
look at the risks I take he never said
that he did work hard he did have
courage he did take risks paid costs but
he was not a martyr and you know why he
was now tomorrow
he was not a lottery did not think of
himself for a moment as a martyr because
he understood that he was having such a
good time that he was having such a good
life that the political life was the
good life you know he took some knocks
for his political activism both at
Spelman where he was fired and the
Boston University where John Silber
froze his salary but never was there the
hint of martyrdom at Howard's recounting
of these events Howard understood that
he was in fact blessed with the special
joy of an engaged and politically active
life with the pleasures of solidarity
and comradeship with the exhilaration of
exerting oneself and even risking
something to make an imprint on one's
community one Society Howard never
pretended to be a hero
it wasn't exactly modesty he knew he was
living the good life and enjoying
himself too much with that I want to
turn the stage over to our own Karl Marx
join me in welcome
thank God an audience good of you to
come
you weren't put off by all those people
who said Marx is dead well I am and I'm
not that's dialectics for you hmm you
might be wondering how I got here
public transportation I didn't want to
return here I wanted to return to Soho
that's where I lived in London but a
bureaucratic mix-up and Here I am Soho
New York well I always wanted to visit
New York
why have I returned to clear my name
I've been reading your newspapers
they're all declaring that my ideas are
dead it's nothing new these clowns have
been saying this for over 160 years
don't you wonder why is it necessary to
declare me dead again and again well
I've had it up to here I asked for the
right to come back for a short while but
I told you there are rules it's a
bureaucracy it is permitted to read even
to watch not to travel I protested of
course and had some support Socrates
told them the untraveled life is not
worth living Gandhi fasted Mother Jones
threatened to picket Buddha chanted Oh
Mark Twain even came to my defense in
his own strange way and the others kept
quiet my god at this point what have
they got to lose
yes there too I have a reputation as a
troublemaker and there to protest works
finally they said all right you can go
you can have an hour or so to speak your
mind but remember no agitating they do
believe in freedom of speech but within
limits
they are liberals
so you can spread the word Marx is back
but understand one thing I am NOT a
Marxist I once said that to peeper and
he almost croaked I should tell you
about peeper we were living in London at
the time Jenny and I and the little ones
two dogs three cats two birds hardly
living a little flat on Dean Street
right near where they dumped the city
sewage we were in London because I had
been expelled from the continent
expelled from my Rhineland yes from my
birthplace I had done dangerous things I
was the editor of a newspaper there
initials item hardly a revolutionary
although I suppose the most
revolutionary act one can engage in is
to tell the truth you see the police
were arresting poor people for gathering
firewood from the estates of the rich I
wrote an editorial protesting that they
decided to censor our newspaper I wrote
an editorial declaring there was no
freedom of the press in Germany they
decided to prove me right they shut us
down isn't that the way it is you know
then we became radical our final issue
of Zeitung had a huge headline
in red ink revolt that annoyed the
authorities they ordered me out of the
Rhineland so we went to Paris where else
do exiles go where else can you stay up
all night and drink wine and tell lies
about how revolutionary you were in the
old country yes if you're going to be in
exile be one in Paris Paris was our
honeymoon Jenny found a tiny flat in the
Latin Quarter heavenly months heavenly
months but soon the word was out from
the German police to the Paris police
seems the police develop an
internationalist consciousness long
before the workers
so he went to Belgium expelled again and
then we came to London where political
refugees come from all over the world
the British are admirable for their
tolerance and insufferable for their
boasting about it the the doctors said
the COFF would go away in a few weeks
that was in 1858 so anyway I was telling
you about peeper you see in London the
political refugees from the world
marched in and out of our house peeper
was one of them he was a flatterer
sycophant he buzzed around me like a
Hornet he would stationed himself six
inches from me so that I could not evade
him and he would quote from my writings
I used to say peeper please do not quote
me to myself he had the audacity to say
thinking I would be pleased that he
would translate Das Kapital into English
the man could not speak one sentence of
English without butchering it English is
a beautiful language it is Shakespeare's
language if Shakespeare had heard people
speak one sentence of English he would
have taken poison
Jenny felt sorry for him she used to
like to invite him to our family dinners
one evening he came over and he
announced the formation of the marxist
society of london a marxist society I
asked what's that he said we meet every
week to discuss another of your writings
we read aloud and examine sentence by
sentence that's why we call ourselves
Marxists we believed completely and
wholeheartedly in everything you've ever
written completely and wholeheartedly
I asked yes
and we would be honored hair dr. marks
he always called me mr. dr. marks I
don't know if you would address the next
meeting of the Marxist society I cannot
do that
why not because I am NOT a Marxist I
didn't mind his bad English mine wasn't
always so perfect it was his way of
thinking he was an embarrassment a
satellite encircling my words reflecting
them to the world but distorting them
and then defending the distortions like
a fanatic then out seeing anyone
interpreted them differently I used to
say to Jenny do you know what I fear
most she would say that the workers
revolution will never come they said no
the revolution will come but when it
does we'll be taken over by men like
paper flatterers went out of power
bullies and braggarts
went holding power dogmatists they will
speak for the proletariat they will
interpret my ideas for the world they'll
organize a new hierarchy a new
priesthood with excommunications it
indexes inquisitions and firing squads
all in the name of communism they'll
divide the world between capitalist
empires and communist empires muck up
our beautiful dream and it will take
another revolution maybe two or three to
clean it up that's what I fear
nohow I was not going to have people
translate Das Kapital to represent it 15
years of work in the conditions of Soho
making my way every morning passed the
bodies of beggars sleeping amidst the
sewage and then to the British Museum
there with its magnificent library
reading until dusk reading reading is
there anything more boring than reading
political economy writing political
economy then home through the darkening
streets past the vendors calling out the
prices of their wares veterans of the
Crimean War some blind others without
legs begging for a penny and the noxious
air the poor smell of London yes some of
my critics trying to minimize what went
into the Scapa tar would say as they
always say about radical writers oh he
must have had some dreadful personal
experience yes yes if you want to make
much of it I walk home through Soho fuel
the anger that went into Das Kapital but
I hear you saying well of course that
was then over a century ago
only then gesundheit
on my way here this morning I walked
through the streets of your city
surrounded by garbage breathing foul air
past the bodies of men and women
sleeping on the street huddled against
the cold instead of a lassie singing a
ballad I heard a voice in my ear some
change sir for a cup of coffee and you
call this progress because you have
motorcars flying machines a thousand
potions to make you smell better
and people sleeping on the street an
official report last year the United
States gross domestic product yes
gross was 7,000 billion dollars most
impressive tell me where is it who is
profiting from it who is not less than
500 individuals control 2,000 billion
dollars in business assets these
individuals more noble more hardworking
more valuable to society than the mother
in the tenement nursing three children
through the winter without any money to
pay the heating bill didn't you hear me
say 160 years ago that capitalism would
greatly increase the wealth of the world
but that that wealth would be
concentrated into fewer and fewer hands
Goldman Sachs
I'll say no more
do you know the you know the Oliver
Goldsmith poem the deserted village ill
Affairs the land to hastening ills of
prey where wealth accumulates and Men
decay that's what I saw
as I walked through the streets of your
city buildings decaying schools decaying
people became but then I walked a bit
farther and I was suddenly surrounded by
men of obvious wealth women and jewels
and furs suddenly I heard the sound of
sirens was a crime being committed
somewhere nearby was violence being done
was somebody trying to take a part of
the gross domestic product illegally
from those who are stolen it legally the
wonders of the market system human
beings reduced to commodities their
lives controlled by the super commodity
money
the committee doesn't like that
not Karl Marx but Brian Jones let's give
him another hand
and now I'm really thrilled to introduce
the well-known well-loved admired
everywhere Arundhati Roy
thank you for that I actually wasn't
really prepared to speak for long hair
but I wanted to come and say that I
loved Howard to a great deal and so did
a lot of people far away in that others
fake democracy called India when when
Howard died it made so many people in so
many parts of the world so sad and and
really those were parts of solidarity
which are subcutaneous you know even I
was surprised at how many people knew
him and knew his work so the last the
last time I spoke to him I it was just a
few weeks before he died and I said
Howard I just wanted to tell you that I
still have a crush on you and he said
look Arundhati I take that sort of thing
very seriously but but but he died like
a poet he died
swimming who could ask for more I
haven't been to the US for a long time I
certainly haven't been here since change
you can believe in him so I wanted to
just say a few words about what that
kind of change looks like from my part
of the world basically
obviously the war in Iraq hasn't ended
the war in Afghanistan has expanded
hugely it spilled into Pakistan and it's
having very very serious effects in
India actually sitting there you know
it's almost impossible to believe that
that the US government has any idea of
what it's doing in Afghanistan does it
have any idea what
it means when it says Taliban we must
wipe out the Taliban you can't because
the Taliban is not a group of people the
Taliban is an ideology and you can't
fire bullets at an ideology so if you
look at what's happening in in that part
of the world it's it's interesting that
from Afghanistan into worries was either
Stan and the north west of Pakistan into
all the tribal areas of India which are
known as the red corridor actually
what's happening is a tribal uprising
which in Afghanistan looks like a and is
a radical Islamist uprising and in India
it's a radical left uprising but the
attack is for the same reason the attack
is the attack of the free market and
it's the attack of capitalism it's been
resisted in different ways but this is
the push that's coming I just before I
before I came here I spent almost three
weeks in in the forests of Central India
where the Indian government has declared
war against its own indigenous people
because in those forests are a lot of
mineral is a lot of mineral wealth which
is you know which all the biggest mining
companies in the world have signed up
for and and I can't tell you what's
going on there it's it's a situation the
war that the Indian government caused
the war operation green hunt and it's a
hunt of tribal people who are living in
the forest
basically the villages are being burnt
and something in central India or
something like 644 villages have been
burnt and something like 300,000 people
are off the government radar they are
hiding in the forests or they've
migrated out of the forests but it's
what an Indian government report called
the biggest land grab since Christopher
Columbus and all of this is being done
in the name of the free market in the
name of growth in the name of
development so it was it was it was sad
you know when even though many of us are
in some ways cynical people about
elections so I certainly am when Obama
won the elections even the most cynical
of us could not help but be moved by the
tears you saw in the eyes of people who
had been through the civil rights
movement and had been through history
the kind of history that you know the
kind of things they had fought against
so so we were moved even our deeply
cynical hearts were moved so imagine how
awful it was when he won the Nobel Peace
Prize and he gave a speech there
justifying war and those same tears of
there was old black people who were cut
and pasted into the eyes of the most
powerful people sitting in that Swedish
Academy applauding him for justifying
their war and that and that war is is
what we have to find ways of opposing
you know and the thing is that in in in
places like Pakistan or in India now it
has come to a stage where none of us can
oppose these things without suffering
serious consequences and I think that
time has gone now where you can call
yourself a person who resists without
inviting consequences so I think all of
us have to move into another stage
now where we are not frightened of the
consequences you know it's not a
question of just marching on a weekend
or distributing stickers or labors
because it really has come I mean we are
really in a time where we have to
dismantle the system somehow we have to
dismantle it and and that can only
happen when we lose the fear of
consequences in in India every day
people are being killed every day it's
happening that even even organizations
like the Civil Liberties of
organizations and the democratic rights
organizations are now being called front
for the Maoist parties but the battle is
on in those places you know the battle
is on very seriously and and I hope that
that somehow it spreads to make
international links because today the
biggest scam in the world is democracy
you know the
the fact is that it is countries that
call themselves democracies that are
administering the most vicious military
occupations so you have Palestine you
have Iraq you have Afghanistan
you have Kashmir in in in Kashmir there
are 700,000 Indian troops supervising
elections and calling them and and this
is a country that calls itself a
democracy we have a hundred thousand
farmers who've committed suicide in
India over the last few years because of
the push of the corporate free market
and of course people much before farmers
to commit you know farmers committing
suicide then to have to deal with
suicide bombers it's a much nicer thing
you can feel great pity for them you
know it's such a pity but actually I
think they're quite happy if people
would somehow poor people would somehow
find a way of killing themselves or
disappearing from the picture so I won't
say more because I think everyone's come
here to to hear no meat and I'm very
honored to to be here and to have said
these few words to you thank you very
much
after the plenary Arundhati will be in
the foyer ready to sign her books there
will be other books available for sale
as well and now the main speaker of the
evening a man we have come to Revere for
his intellect and his moral leadership
Noam Chomsky let's give him a hand
one month ago Joseph Andrews stack
crashed his small plane into an office
building in Austin Texas hitting an IRS
office committing suicide
he left the manifesto explaining his
actions
it was mostly ridiculed but I think it
deserves a lot better than that Stax
manifesto traces the life history that
led him to this final desperate act the
story begins when he was a teenage
student living on a pittance in
Harrisburg Pennsylvania right near the
heart of what was once a great
industrial area his neighbor I'm mostly
quoting now his neighbor was a woman in
her 80s surviving on cat food the
widowed wife of a retired steelworker
her husband had worked all his life in
the steel mills of central Pennsylvania
with promises from big business and the
Union that for the 30 years of his
service he would have a pension and
medical care to look forward to in his
retirement instead he was one of the
thousands who got nothing because the
incompetent mill management and corrupt
Union not to mention the government
raided the pension funds and stole their
retirement all she had was Social
Security to live on and stack could have
added that there are concerted and
continuing efforts by the super-rich and
their political allies to take even that
away on spurious grounds a stack decided
then that he couldn't trust big business
and would strike out on his own only to
discover that he couldn't trust the
government that cared nothing about
people like him but only about the rich
and privileged
and he couldn't trust a legal system
which in his words in which there are
two interpretations for every law the
one for the very rich and one for the
rest of us a government that leaves us
with the joke we call the American
medical system including the drug and
insurance companies that are murdering
tens of thousands people a year with
care a rationed by wealth not need all
in a social order in which a handful of
thugs and plunderers can commit
unthinkable atrocities and when it's
time for their gravy train to crash
under the weight of their gluttony and
overwhelming stupidity the force of the
full federal government has no
difficulty coming to their aid within
days if not hours and much more which I
won't repeat stack tells us that his
desperate final act was an effort to
join those who are willing to die for
their freedom in the hope of awakening
others from their torpor it wouldn't
surprise me if he had in mind of the
woman eating cat food who taught him
about the real world when he was a
teenager and her husband's premature
death her husband didn't literally
commit suicide after having been
discarded to the crash heap but it's far
from an isolated case at which we can
add to the colossal toll of the
institutional crimes of state capitalism
there are poignant studies of the
indignation and the rage of those who
have been cast aside as the state
corporate programs of financialization
and the industrialization have closed
plants and destroyed families and
communities these studies reveal the
sense of acute betrayal on the part of
working people who believed that they
had fulfilled their duty to society in
what they regard as a moral compact with
business and government only to discover
that
they had only been instruments for prop
profit and power truisms from which they
had been carefully shielded by doctrinal
institutions their striking similarities
in the world's second largest economy
this has been investigated in a very
penetrating study by Jing Kwan Lee into
Chinese labor lead Raw's the close
comparison between working-class outrage
and desperation in the decaying
industrial sectors of the United States
and the fury among workers in what she
calls China's Rust Belt this state
socialist industrial center in the
Northeast and now abandoned by the state
in favor of state capitalist development
of the southeast Sun Belt as she calls
it in both regions Lee finds massive
labor protests but different in
character in the Rust Belt workers
express the same sense of betrayal as
their counterparts here but in their
case betrayal of the Maoist principles
of solidarity and dedication to
development of the society that they had
thought had been a moral compact only to
discover that whatever it was it's now
bitter fraud in the Sunbelt workers who
lack that cultural tradition still rely
on their home villages for support and
family life they denounced the failure
of authorities to live up even to the
minimal legal requirements of barely
livable workplace conditions and payment
of the pittance called salaries
according to official statistics there
were 58,000 mass incidents of protests
in 2003 in just one province of the Rust
Belt with three million people
participating some 30 to 40 million
workers who were dropped from work units
accordingly are plagued by a profound
sense of insecurity arousing rage and
desperation around the country and she
expects that there's worse to come as a
looming crisis of landlessness in the
countryside undermines the basis for
survival of the Sunbelt workers who
don't even have a semblance of
independent unions while in the Rust
Belt there's nothing like the civil
society support that exists to some
extent here both Lee and the studies of
the u.s. Rust Belt make it clear that we
should not underestimate the depth of
moral indignation that lies behind the
bitterness about what is perceived to be
the treachery of government and business
power acting exactly as we should expect
them to unfortunately something similar
can be found in rural India their food
consumption has sharply declined before
the great majority since the neoliberal
reforms were partially implemented all
of this amidst accolades for in these
fabulous growth and indeed it is
fabulous growth for some though not for
the rural areas where peasant suicides
are increasing at about the same rate as
the number of billionaires not far away
and in fact not so attractive for the
workers American workers who were
transferred to India to reduce labor
costs by IBM which now has
three-quarters of its workforce abroad
Businessweek calls IBM the
quintessential American company which is
quite appropriate it became the global
giant in computing thanks to the
unwitting munificence of the US taxpayer
who also substantially funded the whole
IT revolution on which IBM relies along
with most of the rest of the high-tech
economy mostly on the pretext that the
Russians are coming
no iBM is paying them back there's much
excited talk these days about a great
global shift of power with speculation
about whether or when China might
displace the US as the dominant global
power along with India which if it
happened it would mean that the global
system would be returning to something
like what it was before the European
conquests and indeed their GDP growth
has been spectacular
but there's a lot more to say about it
so if you take a look at the UN Human
Development Index basic measure of the
health of the society it turns out that
the India retains its place near the
bottom it's now one hundred and thirty
fourth
slightly above Cambodia below Laos and
Tajikistan actually it's dropped since
the reforms began China
ranks 92nd a bit above Jordan and below
the Dominican Republic and Iran by
comparison Cuba has been under harsh US
attack for 50 years is ranked 52nd it's
the highest and Central American
Caribbean and barely below the richest
societies in South America India and
China also suffer from extremely high
inequality so well over a billion of
their inhabitants fall far lower in the
scale furthermore an accurate accounting
that would go beyond beyond conventional
measures to include serious costs that
the China and India can't ignore for
long
ecological resource depletion many
others these common speculations about a
global shift of power which you can read
all over the front pages disregard a
crucial factor that's familiar to all of
us nations
divorced from the internal distribution
of power are not the real actors in
international affairs that truism was
brought to public attention by that
incorrigible radical Adam Smith who
recognized that the principal architects
of power in England were the owners of
the society in his day the merchants and
manufacturers and they made sure that
policy would attend scrupulously to
their interests however Grievous the
impact on the people of England and of
course much worse the victims of what he
called the savage injustice of the
Europeans abroad British crimes in India
were the main concern of an
old-fashioned conservative with moral
values to his modern worshippers Smith's
truisms are ridiculed as quote elaborate
theories of how world history was being
manipulated by shadowy corporatist
imperialist networks I'm quoting New
York Times thinker David Brooks it's one
of the is one of the many illustrations
of the intellectual and moral decline of
what's called conservatism from the
understanding of its heroes actually in
the interests of full disclosure I
should mention that I'm identified as
the villain who adopts an Adam Smith's
heresy that's in fact they do well
barring Smith's radical truism in mind
that we can see that there is indeed a
global shift of power though not the one
that occupies center stage it's a shift
from the global work force to
transnational capital that's been
sharply escalating during the neoliberal
years another cost is substantial
including the Joe Sachs tax of the US
starving peasants in India millions of
protesting workers in China where the
labor share and
income is declining even more rapidly
than in most of the world Martin Hart
Landsberg quite important work on this
and he reviews how China is playing a
leading role in the real global shift of
power the one you read about in the
newspapers it's become kind of an
assembly plant for a regional production
system Japan Taiwan other Asian
economies export parts and components to
China and provide China with most of the
advanced technology that's used there's
not a lot of concern about the growing
US trade deficit with China but less
noticed is the fact that the trade
deficit with Japan and the rest of Asia
has sharply declined as this new
regional production system takes place
u.s. manufacturers are following the
same course providing parts and
components for China to assemble and
export mostly back to the US for the
financial institutions the retail
giant's like say Walmart ownership and
management of manufacturing industries
and sectors closely related to the Nexus
of power all of this is heavenly
not for Joe stack and many others like
him to understand the public mood it's
worthwhile to recall that the
conventional use of GDP gross domestic
product to measure economic growth is
highly misleading it's a highly
ideological measure there have been
efforts to devise more realistic
measures that one of them is called the
general process progress indicator it
subtracts from GDP expenditures that
harm the public and it adds that the
value of authentic benefits well in the
u.s. the general progress indicator has
stagnated since the 1970s although GDP
has
increased the growth going into very few
pockets that result correlates with
others for example these studies of
social indicators the standard measure
of health of a society social indicators
tracked economic growth until the mid
70s then they began to decline and they
reached the level of 1960
by the year 2000 it's the latest figures
available the United States is one of
the very few countries that has no
government inquiry into social
indicators the correlation with the
financialization of the economy and
neoliberal socio-economic measures is
pretty hard to miss and it's not unique
to the United States by any means now
it's true that there's nothing
essentially new in the process of
deindustrialization
owners and managers naturally seek the
lowest labor costs occasionally there
are efforts to do otherwise Henry Ford
is the famous example but his efforts
were struck down by the courts long ago
so in fact it's a legal obligation for
corporate owners and managers to
maximize profit one means of doing this
is shifting production in earlier years
this shift was mostly internal
especially to the southern states their
labor could be more harshly repressed
and major corporations like the first
billion-dollar corporation the US Steel
Corporation of the sainted
philanthropist Andrew Carnegie could
also profit from the new slave labor
force that was created by the
criminalization of black life in the
south after the end of Reconstruction in
1877 that's a core part of the American
industrial revolution which continued
until the Second World War that's
actually being reproduced in court right
now during the recent liberal period the
drug
used as a pretext to drive the
superfluous population mostly black back
to the prisons also providing a new
supply of prison labor in state and
private prisons much of it in violation
of international labor conventions in
fact for many African Americans since
they were exported to the colonies life
has scarcely escaped the bonds of
slavery birth sometimes worse in the
ultra respectable bulletins of the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences we
can read them quoting that the prison
system in America has grown into a
Leviathan
unmatched in human history making the
u.s. the home to the largest custodial
infrastructure for the mass depredation
of Liberty to be found on the planet
mostly black increasingly Hispanic
that's a product of the past 30 years
the neoliberal years as is the fact that
the United States quoting again leads
the world not only in incarceration
rates but an executive compensation
quoting a Harvard Business School
professor who points out that these this
correlation this is increasingly
recognized to be linked as is the fact
that the United States is lagging and
far behind much of the world
particularly China but also Europe in
developing green technologies now it's
easy to ridicule the ways in which Joe
stack and others like him articulate
their concerns which are very genuine
and real but far more appropriate to
understand what lies behind their
perceptions and actions and particularly
to ask ourselves why the radical
imagination is failing to offer them a
constructive path while the center is
very visibly not holding and those who
have real grievances are indeed being
mobilized with mobilized in ways that
are
that poses no slight danger to
themselves and to the rest of us into
the world
Jos tax manifesto ends with two
evocative sentences which all read the
Communist Creed from each according to
his ability to each according to his
need the capitalist greed from each
according to his gullibility to each
according to his greed stack immense 'as
no words about the capitalist Creed we
can only speculate about what he meant
by the communist greed that he can
opposed to it it's not unlikely that he
saw it as an ideal with a genuine moral
force if that's so it wouldn't be very
surprising some of you may be old enough
to recall a poll taken in 1976 the year
of the Bicentennial
in which people were given a list of
statements and asked which ones they
thought were in the Constitution well at
that time no one had a clue what was in
the Constitution so the answer in the
Constitution that presumably meant so
obviously correct that it must be in the
Constitution that a one statement that
received a solid majority who was Joe
Stax communist Creek
well I qualified that comment was a
phrase at that time today a segment of
the population memorizes and worships
the Constitution at least the words
about the meaning there was a tea party
convention week ago which produced a
catechism for candidates one requirement
is that they must agree to scrap the tax
code and replace it with one no longer
than four thousand five hundred and
forty-three words long that's to match
the length of the Constitution
only some amendments share this holy
status one of them the second under the
recent interpretation by the
reactionaries of the Supreme Court the
First Amendment is suspect and because
of what it might be taken to imply about
separation of church and state according
to the current version of conservatism
the u.s. is to be a Christian state kind
of like the Islamic Republic of Iran or
in the Jewish stage of Israel in that
connection incidentally Golda Meir is
listed in the Catechism as required
learning for children but no Hispanics
well along with normal racism that
reflects the very curious amalgam of
extreme anti-semitism and support for
Israel among right-wing religious
sectors and such matters should not be
lightly dismissed when we try to look
ahead encouraging the the this anti-tax
extremism that you see in the Tea Party
movement it's not as immediately
suicidal as joe stacks desperate action
but it's suicidal nonetheless and for
reasons that I don't have to elaborate
what's happening right now in California
is a dramatic illustration right there
the may be in one of the richest parts
of the world the world's greatest public
education system is being systematically
dismantled and the governor Governor
Schwarzenegger says he'll have to
eliminate state health and welfare
programs unless the federal government
works over some seven billion dollars
and other governors are joining in at
the same time a very powerful states
rights movement is taking shape
demanding that the federal government
not intrude into our affairs
that's a nice illustration of what
Orwell called doublethink the ability to
hold two contradictory ideas in mind
and while believing both of them this is
practically a motto for the times
California's plight results in large
part from anti-tax fanaticism and that
extends over much of the country
well encouraging anti-tax sentiment has
long been a staple of the business
propaganda that dominates the doctrinal
system so people must be indoctrinated
to hate and fear the government for very
good reasons
of the existing power systems
the government is the only one that in
principle and sometimes in fact is
answerable to the public and can impose
some constraints on the depredations of
private captain of our the corollary to
getting government off our back is
groaning beneath the even greater weight
of unaccountable private tyranny
so-called libertarians don't seem to see
that that's what they're calling for but
business any government propaganda has
to be nuanced business of course favors
a very powerful state which serves Adam
Smith's principal architects the owners
of the society today not merchants and
manufacturers but multinationals and
financial institutions now constructing
this internally contradictory propaganda
message is no easy task so people have
to be trained to hate and fear the
deficit which is a necessary means to
stimulate the economy after its
destruction at the hands of the dominant
financial institutions and their cohorts
in Washington but at the same time the
population must favor the deficits
almost half of them are attributable to
the military budget which is breaking
records under Obama and the rest of the
deficit is
is predicted what's predicted to
overwhelm the budget is the cruel and
hopelessly inefficient privatized health
care system which is a gift to insurance
companies and big pharma well that's a
tricky propaganda task but it's been we
can see we can see it all the time it's
been carried out with pretty impressive
success one illustration is the public
attitude towards April 15th when tax
returns are due well let's put aside the
thought of a much more free and just
society and just have a look at this one
in a functioning democracy of the kind
that formerly exists
April 15th would be a day of celebration
we're coming together to implement
programs that we've chosen here it's a
day of mourning some IDI enforces
descending upon us to steal our
hard-earned money well that's one
graphic indication of the success of the
intense efforts of the highly class
conscious business community to win what
its own publications call the
everlasting battle for the minds of men
another stunning illustration of the
success of propaganda which has
considerable import for the future is
the cult of the great killer and torture
Ronald Reagan and one of the grand
criminals of the modern era
he also had an unerring instinct for
favoring the most brutal terrorists and
murderers around the world from
ziyal and globin and Hekmatyar and
what's now called ass back to the most
dedicated killers in Central America to
the South African racists who killed an
estimated 1 point made in 1.5 million
people in the Reagan years and had to be
supported because they were under attack
by Mandela's African National Congress
that one of the more notorious terrorist
groups in the world of the Reaganites
determined in 1988 and on and on with
remarkable consistency his grisly record
was quickly expunged in favour of mythic
constructions that would have impressed
Kim il-sung among other feats he was
anointed as the apostle of free markets
while raising protectionist barriers
more than probably all other post-war
presidents combined and implementing
massive government intervention in the
economy
it was a great exponent of law and order
and while he informed the business world
that labor laws would not be enforced so
that illegal firing of union organizers
tripled under his supervision his hatred
of working people was exceeded perhaps
only by his contempt for the rich black
women driving their limousines to
collect their welfare checks well there
should be no need to continue with the
record but the outcome tells us quite a
lot about the intellectual and moral
culture in which we live for President
Obama this monstrous creature was a
transformative figure to go over to
Stanford University's prestigious Hoover
Institute
he's a colossus who's some quoting whose
spirit seems to stride the country
watching us like a warm and friendly
ghost
well painfully to record that many of
the Joe stacks whose lives he was
ruining join in the adulation and
hastened to shelter under the umbrella
of the power and the violence that he
symbolized all of this evokes memories
of other days when the center did not
hold and they were thinking about the
one example that should not be forgotten
as if I'm our Republic that was the peak
of Western civilization in the sciences
and the arts also regarded as a model of
democracy through the 1920s the
traditional liberal and conservative
parties that had always governed the
right entered into inexorable decline
that was well before the process was
intensified by the Great Depression the
coalition that elected general
Hindenburg in 1925 was not very
different from the mass base that swept
Hitler into office eight years later
compelling Hindenburg he was an
aristocrat to select as Chancellor the
little corporal as he called him that he
detested as late as 1928 the Nazis had
less than 3% of the vote
at two years later the most respectable
Berlin press was lamenting the site some
quoting of the many millions in this
highly civilized country who had given
their vote to the Communists
holloa stand crudest charlatanism the
center was collapsing the public was
coming to despise the incessant
wrangling of them our politics the
service of the traditional parties to
powerful interests and their failure to
deal with popular grievances they were
being drawn to the forces that were
upholding the grandeur of the nation and
defending it against perceived threats
in a revitalized
armed a unified state which is going to
march to a glorious future led by the
charismatic figure who in his words was
carrying out the will of eternal
Providence of the creator of the
universe by May 1933 the Nazis had
largely destroyed not only the
traditional ruling parties but even the
large working-class parties Social
Democrats and the Communists which are
quite strong along with their very
powerful associations the Nazis declared
May Day 1933 to be a worker's holiday
that was something the Left parties had
never been able to achieve in fact many
working people took part in the enormous
patriotic demonstrations more than a
million people in what was called red
Berlin they were joining farmers
artisans shopkeepers paramilitary forces
Christian organizations athletic and
rifle reak Loubs and the rest of the
coalition that was taking shape as the
center collapsed by the onset of the war
and perhaps 90% of Germans were marching
with the brown shirts well the world's
too complex for history to repeat but
there are nevertheless lessons to keep
in mind and even memories I'm just old
enough to remember those chilling and
ominous days of Germany's descent from
decency to Nazi barbarism quoting the
distinguished scholar of German history
fritz stern who tells us that he has the
future of the United States in mind when
he reviews what he calls a historic
process in which resentment against a
disenchanted secular world found
deliverance in the ecstatic escape of
unreason that sounds familiar it is this
is one possible outcome of collapse of
the center when the radical imagination
which
fact was quite powerful at that time and
nonetheless fell short
well the popular mood today here is
complex and ways that are both hopeful
and troubling one illustration is the
attitudes towards social spending on the
part of people who identify themselves
and poles as anti-government it's a
recent scholarly study which is kind of
illuminating it finds it by large
majorities they support I'm quoting it
they support maintaining or expanding
spending on Social Security child care
and aid to poor people and other social
welfare measures the support falls off
significantly when it comes to aid to
blacks and welfare recipients half of
these anti-government extremists believe
that spending is too little on
assistance to the poor in the population
as a whole that majorities in most cases
substantial majorities feel the
government is spending too little to
improve and protect the nation's health
and on Social Security drug addiction
child care programs and so on
though again there's an exception on aid
for welfare and black welfare recipients
and blacks that's probably a tribute to
Reaganite February I suppose
well these results give some indication
of what might be achieved by commitments
that are even far short of the radical
imagination and also some of the
impediments that are going to have to be
overcome for these and much more for
reaching purposes the Massachusetts
election last January which undermined
the majority rule in the Senate that
gives some further insight into what can
happen when the center does not hold and
those who believe in even limited
measures of reform failed to reach the
population and the election the
elections as you know were to fill the
seat of the Senate's so-called liberal
lion
Kennedy in that election Scott Brown ran
as the 41st vote against health care
which Kennedy had fought for throughout
his political life a majority turned out
opposed Obama's proposals but primarily
because they gave away too much to the
insurance industry and much the same is
true nationally if you look at the polls
on which the headlines are based one
interesting feature was the voting
pattern among union members it's Obama's
natural constituency you'd think most of
them didn't bother to vote but if those
who did the majority chose brown and
union leaders and activists explained
why they said workers are angered at
Obama's record generally but
particularly incensed over his stand on
health care one of them reported he
didn't insist on a public option or a
strong employer mandate to provide
insurance it was hard not to notice that
the only issue on which he took a firm
stand was taxing benefits for the health
care that had been won by union
struggles are attacked retracting his
campaign pledge there was a massive
infusion of funds from financial
executives in the final days of the
campaign now that's one part of a
broader phenomenon which reveals
dramatically white Joe stack and others
have every reason to be disgusted at the
farce that they were taught to honor as
democracy Obama's primary constituency
all along was financial institutions
their power has increased enormously
their share of corporate profits rose
from a few percent in the 1970s to
almost a third today they preferred
Obama to McCain and they largely bought
the election for him and they expected
to be rewarded and they were don't have
to go through the details but a few
months ago responding to the rising
anger of the joe stacks obama began to
criticize the greedy bankers
who'd been rescued by the public and he
even proposed some measures to constrain
their excesses punishment for this
deviation was swift the major banks
immediately announced very prominently
front page the New York Times that they
would shift funding to Republicans if
Obama persisted with his offensive
rhetoric and Obama heard the message
within days he informed the business
press that bankers are fine guys and his
words singling out the chairs of the two
biggest banks two biggest crooks
JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs they
got specific praise and he assured the
business world that quoting him I liked
most of the American people don't
begrudge people success or wealth and
such as the huge bonuses and profits
that are infuriating the public that's
part of the free market system Obama
continued not inaccurately as free
markets are interpreted and state
capitalist doctrine his retreat however
was not in time to curb the flow of cash
that gained the forty-first seat well in
fairness we should concede that the
greedy bankers had a point their task is
to maximize profit and market share in
fact as I mentioned that's their legal
obligation if they don't do it they'll
be replaced by somebody who will these
are institutional facts as are the
inherent market inefficiencies that
require them to ignore what's called
systemic risk know full well that that's
likely to tank the economy but such
externalities as they're called are not
their business it's also unfair to
accuse them of irrational exuberance
it's Alan Greenspan's phrase and his
extremely brief departure from wertha
doxy during the tech gloom of the 90s
their exuberance was not at all
irrational it was quite rational in the
knowledge that when it all collapses
they can flee to the shelter of the
nanny state clutching their copies of
Hayek and Friedman and 9r and the same
is true of the Chamber of Commerce of
the American Petroleum Institute and the
rest of the business leaders who are
running a huge propaganda campaign now
to convince the public to dismiss
concerns about anthropogenic global
warming and with great success has been
a sharp decline and people who take it
seriously those who believe in this
liberal hoax as it's called have
declined to about a third of the
population the executives who are
dedicating themselves to this task know
perfectly well that the hoax is very
real
and the prospects very grim but they're
fulfilling their institutional role they
don't do it somebody else or place them
who will the fate of the species is
another externality that they must
ignore insofar as market systems prevail
so you can't criticize returning let's
go back to the very instructive
Massachusetts election turns out that
the major factor in Brown's victory was
voting patterns in the affluent suburbs
the voting was high and enthusiastic and
the urban areas which are heavily
democratic and voting was low and
apathetic so the headlines were right to
report that voters were sending Obama a
message the message was very clear from
the rich the message was we want even
more than what you're doing for us and
from the rest the message was Joe stacks
in his words the politicians are not in
the least bit interested in me or in
anything I have to say though they're
very much interested in the voices of
the Masters well there was no doubt some
impact of the populist image that was
crafted by the PR machine
Scott Brown this is my truck regular guy
all that stuff but that appears to have
been a secondary role the popular anger
is very real and it's entirely
understandable you know with the bank's
thriving thanks not only to the bailouts
but all sorts of other benefits that
they're getting from the nanny state
while the population remains in deep
recession even official unemployment is
at ten percent actual much higher and in
manufacturing industry official
unemployment at the level of the Great
Depression
one out of six unemployed and very few
prospects for recovering are the kinds
of jobs that are lost as the economy is
being reshaped in the manner that with
the global shift of power that I
described
well national polls reveal much the same
phenomenon the latest one I've seen was
just a couple of days ago history
journal it shows what they call a 21%
enthusiasm enthusiasm gap between the
parties with 67% of Republicans saying
they're very interested in the coming of
mber elections as compared with 46% of
Democrats there's also a major shift
from the norm in the there's a 10-point
margin by which registered voters to say
they believe that Republicans are better
at dealing with the economy that's a
combination of solid Republican mostly
quite affluent sector and disillusioned
Democrats who see what's happening the
jurist acts 1/2 of Americans would like
to see every member of Congress defeated
in the election including their own
representatives very remarkable
a remarkable picture of how the center
is not holding and it evokes memories
which we shouldn't forget some of which
I mentioned the public conception of
democracy is almost as negative as the
aspirations of the business world of
course they hate democracy naturally but
they're now lobbying very fiercely one
of their highest objectives is to ensure
that even shareholders should have no
say in choice of managers
Halil owns what called stakeholders
workers in the community that's out of
the question
but to quote the Wall Street Journal as
some liberals are seeking to find a fair
position that straddles the divide
between companies and shareholders it's
a very interesting phrase that divided
between companies and the people who own
the companies the shareholders but
they're right they're recognizing the
decision of the courts a century ago
that the corporation should be
identified with the management the
shareholders are irrelevant just like
the rest of the public well it's true
that there was a federal stimulus and
even though it was much too small did
have an effect it's estimated it was
saved about two million jobs according
to the Congressional Budget Office but
the perception of the Jos tax that it
was a bust has a basis over a third of
government spending is by States and the
decline and state spending approximated
the federal stimulus so the aggregate
fiscal expenditure stimulus was flat
there was no stimulus that's according
to a study recent study by the National
Bureau of Economic Research that
standard source of economic information
well the center is clearly not holding
and those who are harmed are once again
shooting themselves in the foot the
immediate consequence in Massachusetts
was to provide another vote at the block
the appointment of a pro-union voice
at the National Labor Relations Board
which has been virtually defunct since
Reagan's successful war against working
people well that's what could be
expected in the absence of constructive
alternatives
well are there constructive alternatives
take a look at the industrial heartland
in Ohio where General Motors among
others continues to close plans there's
one one of the few journalists in the
United States who pays any attention to
labor issues Louis would tell of the New
York Times he reported recently from the
scene of one recently closed plant
he writes that President Obama that
never sought to reopen the factory even
after the federal government became
controlling shareholder and GM during
the auto bailout so they could do what
they wanted what Obama has done instead
is to try to ease some of the pain by
sending an ambassador as a solve for the
community's wounds offering hope
remember that and aid the aid is
suggestions which can't be implemented
and meanwhile there's another ambassador
who he doesn't mention the Secretary of
Transportation Ray LaHood and that other
ambassador is in Spain he's offering
federal stimulus money to Spanish firms
to produce the high-speed rail
facilities that the US badly needs and
that could surely be produced by the
highly skilled workforce that's reduced
to penury in Ohio well Obama shuts down
the factories that's Joe stacks
experience in Harrisburg again in 1999
LaHood who was at a Republican
congressman introduced a bill that would
have provided federal funding for
transportation infrastructure he would
have authorized the Treasury to provide
seventy two billion dollars a year in
interest-free loans to state and local
governments for capital investments that
includes
investments in transportation and
transportation infrastructure and
interestingly his bill called for not
borrowing the money but using us notes
that's much as Abraham Lincoln did to
finance the Civil War and as FDR did
during the Great Depression well that
that was 1999
today LaHood is using federal stimulus
money to obtain contracts and Spain and
for the same purpose it's another sign
of how the center has been disappearing
in recent years past 30 years
well the radical imagination shouldn't
suggest an answer the factory in
question and many others could be taken
over by the workforce with the support
that would of course require the support
of the communities that are left
desolate and in fact the rest of us and
they could be converted to production of
high-speed rail facilities and other
badly needed goods
I said radical imagination but the idea
is not particularly radical in the 19th
century it was intuitively obvious to
New England workers quoting them that
according their papers that those who
work in the mills should own them and
the idea that wage labour differed from
slavery only in that it was temporary it
was so common that it was even a slogan
of Lincoln's Republican Party while
during the recent years of
financialization and the
industrialization there have been
repeated efforts to implement worker and
community takeover of closing plants few
have succeeded but not most the ideas
have immediate moral appeal to the
affected workforce and the communities
and they should be quite feasible with
sufficient public support and they would
be very far-reaching in their
implications well for the radical
imagination to be rekindled and to lead
the way out of this desert what is
needed is people who will work to sweep
away the mists of carefully contrived
illusion reveal the stark reality and
also to be directly engaged in popular
struggles that they sometimes help
galvanize so what is needed in short is
the late Howard Zinn terrible loss
well there won't be another Howard Zinn
but we can take to heart
his praise for the countless small
actions of unknown people that lie at
the roots of the great moments of
history the countless Joe stacks who
were destroying themselves and maybe the
world when they could be leading the way
to a better future
