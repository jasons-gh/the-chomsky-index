you're on democracy now democracynow.org
the war and peace report
i meani goodman as we continue our
conversation with Noam Chomsky we turn
now to Latin America Democracy Now is
Aaron Matta sat down with Noam Chomsky
yesterday on Democracy Now the MIT
professor emeritus we asked him to talk
about the thawing of u.s. Cuba relations
and us meddling in Cuba the US has been
at war with Cuba for since late 1959
Cuba was had been essentially a colony
of the United States virtual colony in
January 1959 the Castro guerrilla forces
took over by late that year around
October u.s. planes were already bombing
Cuba from Florida in I think it's March
1960 there was a formal decision
internally to overthrow the government
John F Kennedy came in shortly after at
the Bay of Pigs after the Bay of Pigs
that was almost hysteria in Washington
about how to punish the Cubans for this
Kennedy made some incredible speeches
about how you know the future of the
world is at stake and dealing with Cuba
and so on the u.s. launched a major
terrorist war against Cuba we kind of
downplayed it and what you'd get
reported is CIA attempts to you know to
kill Castro bad enough but that was a
very minor part of the major terrorist
war as part of the background for the
Missile Crisis which almost led the
terminal nuclear war right after the
crisis the terrorist war picked up again
meanwhile the sanctions have been very
harsh sanctions against Cuba right from
the Eisenhower
picked up extended by Kennedy extended
further under Clinton who actually
outflanked bush from the right on
extending the sanctions the world has
been totally opposed to this the votes
at the General Assembly can't do it at
the Security Council Casillas vetoes
everything but at the General Assembly
the votes are just overwhelming I think
the last one was 182 to the US in Israel
and sometimes they picked up Papua or
something like that this is going on
year after year the u.s. is utterly
isolated not just on this issue many
others finally notice the Obama didn't
end the sanctions in fact he didn't even
end the the restrictions many of the
restrictions on travel and so on they
made a mild gesture towards moving
towards normalization of relations
that's presented here the way it's
presented here is we have to test Cuba
to see if our long as Obama put it our
efforts to improve the situation in Cuba
have failed right big efforts to improve
the situation terrorism
sanctions the sanctions are really
incredible so if say Sweden was sending
medical equipment somewhere which had
Cuba nickel in it that had to be been
just went on into the 90s
the worst part was under Kennedy then
picked up again in the late seventies
and so on
a major terrorists are provided refuge
in Florida the late Bosh was one Orlando
Bosch Posada is another you remember
there was something called the Bush
Doctrine pushed to a country that
harbors terrorists is the same as the
terrorists themselves that's for others
not for us we harbor them
and also the support their activities
but we have to test Cuba to see if
they're making successful gestures now
that our old policy of bringing freedom
and democracy didn't work Swift for a
new policy I mean the irony of this is
almost indescribable the fact that these
words can be said is shocking it's a
sign of again failure to reach a minimal
level of civilized awareness and
behavior but the steps it's a good it's
good that there are small steps being
taken it's interesting to see what the
Cuban the Cuban intellectual community
there is a dissident intellectual
community in Cuba how they've been
reacting to in fact is an interesting
article about it by my daughter who's a
Cuba specialist but we don't look at
that we don't hear what they're saying
the what are they saying what they're
saying is approximately I was just
saying you know it's a good step that
the u.s. is beginning to move but we've
got to begin to face up to the reality
of what's been happening which is the
u.s. been attacking Cuba and the reason
for the primary reason probably for
Obama's slight moves are that the US was
becoming completely isolated in the
hemisphere it's not just that the world
is opposed the hemisphere is opposed and
that's a remarkable development
