from the point of view of us power he's
harming it but from the point of view of
us elites he's giving them everything
they want I mean in fact what's going on
in the United States if you think about
it is kind of a two-level wrecking ball
if you want to call it that Trump his
role whether this is conscious or not I
don't know that you can see what what's
happening
Trump's role is to ensure that the media
and public attention are always
concentrated on him
so every time you turn on a television
to trump open the front page of the
newspaper Trump and in order to maintain
he's a con man basically a showman and
in order to maintain public attention
you have to do something crazy otherwise
nobody's going to pay attention to you
if you do normal things you'll be you
know way back somewhere so every day
there's one insane thing after another
and then you know the media makes them
crazy why you know you have the biggest
crowd in history or something
but meanwhile he's on to something else
and then you go to that one and while
this show is going on in public the what
in the background the wrecking crew is
working Paul Ryan executive orders and
what they're doing is system matters my
14
government that works for the benefit of
the population this goes from workers
rights to pollution and pollution
pollution of the environment the rules
for protecting consumers I mean anything
you can think of is being dismantled and
all efforts are being devoted kind of
almost with fanaticism to enrich and
empower their actual constituency which
is super wealth and corporate power who
are delighted that's why the stock
market goes up stock market us and not
much to do with the economy but keep
moving because that's the rich people
and they love being granted now the
worst policies that he's carried out the
most dangerous are barely discussed
those are the two existential threats
that we face you have to face the fact
that humans are now in a situation which
has never arisen in human history this
generation has to decide whether
organized human existence is going to
continue and it's not a joke
it's global warming and nuclear war
those are the major issues they ought to
be big headlines every day and Trump's
actions are making both of them much
more dangerous in the case of nuclear
war the policies are significantly
increasing the threat of nuclear war in
a case of global warming it's almost
indescribable but not only has the u.s.
pulled out uniquely alone in the world
it's pulled out from the international
efforts do at least something about it
but beyond that it's the Trump
administration is going out of its way
to increase the threat look listen to
his State of the Union address the only
phrase about global climate was to talk
about our beautiful clean coal the worst
polluter there is which we have we have
a thousand years of it you know and look
at the new budget that's coming on
sharply cuts of research and support for
any kind of renewable energy more
subsidies and support for the most
polluting destructive things and it's
not just Trump it's the entire
Republican leadership so if you look at
the 2016 election of the primaries every
single candidate not a single exception
either denied the global warming is
taking place or said maybe it is we
shouldn't do anything about it which I
think it's worse they were called the
moderates like Kasich so then and if you
look at Trump himself or say Rex
Tillerson Secretary of State and they
know perfectly well that humans are
causing global warming in fact that
Trump has golf courses all over them
he's he hasn't built a wall in Mexico
yet he's building walls around his golf
courses to make sure that the sea level
doesn't destroy them that Rex Tillerson
was CEO of Exxon Mobil since the 1970s
scientists at Exxon Mobil have been we
now know they've been made public forced
to be making public they've been
producing severe ones the leadership
about the effect of the use of petroleum
on destroying the environment so they
won't know about it but they're not
doing anything about it which is a level
of criminality that
most hard to find words to describe I'm
here you know educated well-off rich
people a very lead who know that what
they're doing is destroying the
prospects for a human resident organized
human life and do it anyway because they
make more profit tomorrow can you think
of an analog to that in human history
I mean I've said sometimes what's
considered an utterly outrageous comment
that the today's Republican Party is the
most dangerous organization in human
history sounds outrageous but think
about it for a moment
I mean Hitler didn't intend to destroy
the prospect for human existence
Attila the Hun didn't intend that nobody
finished but that's what these guys
intend and it's not ignorant uneducated
you know religious fundamentalists
whatever you want to blame people these
are the most educated best-supported
people in the world and they're doing
this eyes opened coaching make more
profit tomorrow it's hard to imagine
anything like that's it's not just my
opinion who takes a the bulletin of the
atomic side the Doomsday Clock famous
Doomsday Clock it's set up by The
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists since 1947
the each year they gather distinguished
physicists political analysts others to
look at the state of the world and make
a judgment of how far we are from
terminal disaster Midnighters terminal
disaster in 1947 the clock was at 7
minutes to midnight after the out of mom
moved up and back since now it's at the
closest that's been the mid night ever
as they just moved it to two minutes to
midnight that's where it was in 1953
when the US and later the USSR exploded
thermonuclear
weapons which were could totally
destroyed the world
I went to two minutes now it's back to
two minutes and that's the Republican
Party that's the ones who were running
the country and dominating the world
there's never been a situation like this
