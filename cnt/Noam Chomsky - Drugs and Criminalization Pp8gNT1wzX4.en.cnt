a little village boys piece a while back
where he wondered if prohibition was
100% bad you mentioned that there were
some public health benefits I was
wondering that's irrelevant or prayer we
should cut down the use of alcohol and
alcohol is very destructive oh it's much
worse than drug I don't so it's not
enough I mean I think it's I don't think
there's an obvious answer
criminalization of behavior is very
dubious kind of project in my opinion
and if you look at the history of
criminalization of behavior which is
what provision is it's I think
invariably class linked it's in very
like I said last night it's it's every
case I know of it's linked to control of
classes of people you don't like them
not us marijuana is an extremely
dramatic case of that if you look at the
ups and downs of it in the case of
alcohol or say tobacco tobacco is I mean
probably the most lethal substance is
sugar that causes more deaths than maybe
all the others put together so okay
could give an argument for
criminalization of sugar let's say and
that means all the sugar substitutes do
because they really are very harmful a
lot a lot of people die from on the
other hand I don't think it's a good
idea you know what about the
criminalization of other substances well
in my III I think that these are things
you have to be cautious about an
experiment with so for example takes in
the case of marijuana I think there's a
reasonably good case for
decriminalization one reason is it has
no it among the like none of these
things are good for you
I'm sure this stuff whatever it is it's
not good for you in fact the old friend
of mine who died recently it was a Nobel
prize-winning biologist who was a head
of the Cancer Center at MIT one of his
favorite lines is was that when people
kept finding things that were
carcinogenic he'd say yeah that's
because they looked at it
and in fact its life that's carcinogenic
no and you know eat tomatoes are gonna
turn out to be carcinogenic and so on
so you know anything is nothing the
things have varying degrees of their
varying effects but of the variant of
the things with varying effects
marijuana is not at the high end of the
farm in fact I don't think there has
ever been an overdose recorded with the
last time I saw figures but five or ten
years ago is like 60 million users and
no overdoses that's not too bad a record
it's probably it's certainly not good
for you you know beyond some limited use
but the same is true of everything it's
true of coffee it's true of tobacco you
know it's true of meat it's true of
vegetables of eat too much of them I
mean anything so probably in the case of
marijuana there's a fairly good argument
for decriminalization with regard to
other drugs and my own my own view is
that the right approach is probably the
one that the British took back around
1800 when drinking was becoming a big
thing the the tax system was modified in
such a way that things like beer were
much cheaper than things like say
whiskey okay that's a reasonable
incentive system because it moves people
over to drinking things that are less
likely to be harmful and in big
quantities then more likely to be
harmful in big quantities and I think
things like that are possible but
overwhelmingly the right answer is
education I mean I think that's just
obvious I mean the reason why use of say
Tibet tobacco is a very striking case in
the United States I don't know I suspect
that not many of your friends smoke it's
extremely rare these days to find I've
seen a student at MIT come into my
office wanting to smoke for 20 years
it's just not done among wealthy
educated people anymore it's still true
among older people who didn't shake the
habit and it's very common among young
people who are poor so you go to a
working-class section of town and go to
a local fast-food place and every kid
has two cigarettes in their hands okay
on the other hand you go to the upscale
restaurants and it's not very likely
it's just it became very sharply
class-based just on the basis of
education and the same has been true of
other things like take say red meat
there's no criminalization of red meat
but you but consumption is going way
down simply because of education you
know of people learning about the
effects of it and I think that's true of
everything I mean if people are drew
it's what makes a game they say the
lottery I don't know if Wisconsin has a
state lottery a lot of states do the
lottery is a highly regressive tax you
it's I don't know that I've never I
don't know the figures here but I'm sure
that the same is everywhere and that's
just it's been pretty well studied
it's a very highly regressive tax you
take the towns in Massachusetts and you
ask how much money people spend in the
state lottery it's predictable by level
of education and income the lower the
education and income the more they spend
on the lottery I mean like in a town
where I live nobody would waste a cent
on the lottery I mean it's just it it's
like giving your money away you know
that's what the state lottery is poor
and uneducated people do it you go to a
town where the average per-capita income
is maybe $10,000 they may be spending a
couple of thousand dollars per family on
the lottery so what it amounts to is a
highly regressive tax that's why it's
pushed so hard like this kind of
advertising for it I don't know here but
in Massachusetts a very heavily
advertised and what kind of wonderful
gifts about you're going to get five
million dollars and this and that and
the other thing yeah yeah and the reason
is because it's terrific way to soak the
poor you know you want it now should you
illegal make it illegal well I mean I
don't think it should be legal to
advertise it frankly anymore dan I think
you should allow ads for cocaine up in
the
you know on television but I don't think
he should criminalize it either what I
think you ought to do is exactly what's
done in every sector of educated people
make get people immediately to
understand that you're throwing your
money away you know if you want to throw
your money away throw in the ocean you
know and when people understand that
there's anime not a anymore than there
is in the town where I live they
couldn't sell a lottery ticket there if
they tried you know and and I think the
same is true of every of every form of
the ways of harming yourself whether
it's driving fast or you know wearing
seatbelt or you know I don't know what's
that stuff free to jump off a mountain
holding a rope yeah that kind of stuff
you know anything I mean if there are
people who want to experience danger
okay they'll be allowed to do it on the
other hand it should be a rational
decision something that people are in a
position to make a reasonable decision
about and that requires understanding
and education and recognition of the
consequences and so on and so forth I
mean that's the answer to drugs I think
the answer that they want it's
overwhelmingly true it is also true as
Alex Coburn pointed out in that column
that Talco values did decline during
Prohibition budget uh you know that's
you could you could get the consumption
of the milk to decline by criminalizing
