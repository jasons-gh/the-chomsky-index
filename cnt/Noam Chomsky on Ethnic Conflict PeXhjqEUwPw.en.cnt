being able to overcome the futility of
engaging in ethnic conflicts the
uselessness what I would be able to

progress that takes a Europe the first
centuries new Europe was the most savage
place in the world the Europeans are
just slaughtering one another in the 30
Years War of the 17th century maybe a
third of the population of Germany was
wiped out there was another 30 years war
in the 20th century from 1914 to 1945
total Horror Story Teddy what happened
in Europe the rest of the world that
since 1945 there haven't been any major
wars in Europe is that because we're
more civilized well that's because it
was understood that the next time you
have a war you're finished
humans have created the capacity to
destroy themselves and everything else
and we've come very close to blowing
everything up many many cases were
terminal nuclear war was extremely close
and the Stratis in fact increasing now
that across the board it's close
