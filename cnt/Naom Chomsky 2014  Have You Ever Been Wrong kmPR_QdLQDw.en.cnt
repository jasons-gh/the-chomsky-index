and a consistency and I want to ask you
you don't have to answer Fifth Amendment
but do you think you've ever been wrong
about an issue you know not know they're
laughing they're laughing they're
laughing nervously it is not a lot of
thought it is not it is not a coy route
in a subversion know plenty of times I
can think of a case after case I'm going
to take the worst crime of the post-war
era post-world War II right now the
worst crime was the u.s. attack on
Indochina really horrendous crime it
destroyed three countries they may never
recover millions of people killed you
know that's devastation chemical warfare
destroyed crops every atrocity tan think
of the time to have become opposed to
that was 1950 I didn't I didn't do
anything in the 1950s it was pretty
clear what was going on it wasn't until
the early 60s when Kennedy sharply
escalated the war that I started trying
to that was a bad mistake and there are
plenty of others like it
