well you know talk about one should
think through these things carefully
let's let's think about a revolution I
mean if a revolution is going to be at
all constructive you know not just
establish some horrible dictatorship
worse than you happened there's only one
way it can come about that's if a large
mass of the population in fact the large
majority come to recognize that changes
that they want cannot be instituted
within the framework of existing
institutions that means that if you're a
real dedicated revolutionary you're a
reformist there's no conflict between
reform and revolution what you want to
do is press the institutions as far as
possible to yield to just popular
demands and if the population comes to
recognize look it can't be done anymore
ok then you can talk about a revolution
but not before and if you look at people
who are really interested in revolutions
like Karl Marx they they press this all
the time in fact he even believed that
in the in England you know country that
interested the most the freest country
of his day parliamentary system England
in the United States might be possible
to establish a communist revolution
without any violence at all just by
pressing forward within the framework of
the institutions that they have well
maybe so maybe not but that's the
criterion so I think just again endorse
what Juan and Amy said you have to try
in every possible way to bring the the
changes bring about the changes that we
think ought to be made by means that are
available and going back to occupy I
agree with Amy it was a tremendous
achievement but there's a gap the 99%
have to participate and that hasn't been
achieved and that's pretty important
it's good it's good to bring it to
public attention put it on the national
agenda get people to think about it
but that's only the first step the next
step is to engage the 99% and that's a
hard task just as it has been with every
popular movement and you have to
remember if you look at the history of
popular movements they have had
successes now it was a much freer
gesture country than it was not that
long ago but it's always partial
successes
