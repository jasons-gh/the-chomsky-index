research on what we teach and learn a
very live issue right here in fact with
the monk proposal for the global affairs
institute yeah it's a serious problem
but we have to remember that when you
talk about a funding for the university
it's always coming from the outside the
universities do not produce commodities
for sale okay they don't make they're
not profit-making institutions at least
they shouldn't be they're supposed to
meet other goals the ones that Linda
quoted from the very eloquent statement
of University of Toronto well since you
don't since it's a parasitic institution
by its nature it's going to get funding
or won't survive well in a decent
society it would just be a public
obligation to ensure the healthy
survival of institutions that meet those
fine ideals well we don't we're not a
healthy society so that doesn't happen
and therefore you have to look for other
sources of funding it for a long time go
back not too far say when I was a
student you know not ancient history for
me at least public education was free so
I mean I happen to go to a private
college but in Causton was nothing I
could hun dred dollars actually could
get a scholarship and the public
institutions were publicly funded now
since the 1970s that's changed radically
by now in the United States in most
states more than half of the funding for
the public universities is coming from
tuition okay now what that does is
impose a huge debt burden on
students and that has a function it
traps them it's a mode of indoctrination
and control if you come out of college
with a hundred thousand dollars in the
dead your control maybe you wanted to
become a public interest lawyer but
you're going to have no choice but to go
to a corporate law firm and once you go
to a corporate law firm you get absorbed
in the culture you're off and soft and
running and the same is true and
everything else so there is a technique
of indoctrination and control that's
been developed since the 70s in part I
think a large part in reaction to be
activated under the 60s which was to
democratic to free you know terrified
they leads and they're all sorts of
techniques of control that are being
restored and this is one of them well
that's undermining public education
funding coming from tuition you know not
the way it's supposed to work also it
restricts it pretty much to the wealthy
who can pay it the what about corporate
funding well you know corporate funding
like say the monks the foundation has
its problems serious problems is it
going to affect academic programs and
the research and so on if it is I think
it should be resisted and there are
plenty of ways to resist it in fact some
of them Linda mentioned in the case of
say the monk gift it's just you know the
it's coming from gold mining mining
altogether is a totally international
scandal most of it's coming from Canada
and it has horrifying effects all over
the world destroying communities
destroying the environment and gold
mining is the worst apart from which
barrick gold has its own very credible
human rights charges of human rights
violations well that's a proper topic I
think Linda mentioned this for a
Institute of global affairs in a
Canadian university particularly one
fund funded by the criminal
a proper topic is what are they doing
you know and that's not just academic
the people who are being harp harmed by
these practices have no voice but people
here have a voice and can help protect
them and people do they're our
solidarity groups my daughter for
example works and one that work on these
issues I've been involved too well you
know a university program is a perfect
place for that and this would be a fine
place to do it it's not outlandish I
talked about this a little bit yesterday
but just in my own institution I
happened to be in a for a long time as a
Pentagon funded University long's
totally funded by the Pentagon it was
also the center of anti-war resistance I
don't mean protest I mean resistance
real resistance so number of us were
facing prison terms and so on well I was
taking place under one hundred percent
Pentagon funding it can be done you know
and a lot of latitude but the idea the
fact that there's going to be external
funding is essentially inescapable if
the society does not recognize it as
just an obligation to sustain free and
independent institutions well it's just
going to have to come from somewhere
else all right so we'll take two
questions to my left and then we'll look
into the overflow rooms mr. Chomsky
first of all it's my pleasure to see you
in person as you know some South
American countries like Bolivia
Venezuela and Ecuador or moving towards
a more democratic and just society and
that alone creates enemies powerful
corporations and countries related to
them try to discredit them in turn they
try to have alliances with different
countries and progress
people in the world what concerns me is
that when these South American countries
get close to countries with history of
human rights abuse and brutal
dictatorship wouldn't that partly negate
their purpose of creating support
especially amongst the people under
repression and also progressive people
in the world I understood most but not
the last part could you repeat the last
part what I mean is that when they click
when they get close to countries when
who goes with the South American
countries like Venezuela Bolivia when
they get close to countries that have
history of human rights abuse yeah and
also brutal dictatorship what do you
mean get close to critically well
economically politically so like your
phone as well it gets close to Iran
exactly yeah and okay so wouldn't that
negate the fact that the people that are
in those countries under repression they
wouldn't be able to support the
countries that so people in Iran would
not support Chavez was too I suppose but
what am I supposed to do with that I
mean I meant it what is your opinion in
regards to just kind of a you know
should run I was takes a Brazil Chavez
is everybody whipping boy so let's put
that aside if he says two words you have
to attack it so let's take Brazil the
most admired country in the south
the most popular political leader in the
modern world Loula they were below is
very supportive of the rent okay now
that the United States was furious in
fact Brazil and Turkey you know the
major raised regional power infuriated
the United States by working out a deal
with Iran to handle the problem of the
production of the fissile materials that
it was kind of interesting that Obama
had favored that in fact the United
States immediately denounced it but as
soon as they did the Brazilian foreign
ministry released release that a letter
from Obama to the president urging him
to proceed with this the reason surely
was that Obama assumed it would fail and
then it could be a weapon to beat the
Iranians over the head when it succeeded
they were furious and they immediately
rammed through an almost meaningless UN
resolution to try to undercut it but
it's true that Brazil was supportive of
Iran in this respect it tried to along
with turkey major regional power to try
to find a way to get out of this crisis
both Iran and ed Brazil and Turkey
incidentally are increasing economic
relations with fear at so turkey for
example is announced that around the
same time that is tripling trait they
opened a pipeline to we're at now
they're trying to integrate I ran into
some sort of a regional system well okay
I mean we can decide whether we like
that or not but I don't see the problem
with it i'm in favor of it i think that
i'm sorry i think they ought to be doing
this
so I'm not sure I understand what the
problem is should the Iranian people
should the Iranian people support the
fact that Turkey and Brazil are trying
to find a resolution for the nuclear
issue an increasing trade I suspect they
probably do support though they remember
that on uranium yeah so you know better
than I do that in Iran there's
overwhelming support for the nuclear
energy program on several I supports it
so if somebody's finding a way to get
around the conflict I imagine they think
that's fine they don't want to be bomb
as for increasing trade well you know
you have to ask them but I wouldn't be
surprised if it's a popular movement on
the other hand if it's supporting the
repression that's a different story but
I don't think Brazil or turkeys doing
that actually you might add we might ask
ourselves why we're while we're on this
and what's the issue of that Iran okay
it's a big issue I mean that is the
issue the leading issue in u.s. foreign
policy the leading issue is the Iranian
threat that's this is called the year of
a grin we got to deal with the Iranian
threat everybody's hysterical about it
that one thing you don't see discuss is
what is the Iranian threat okay try to
find the discussion of that actually we
have a authoritative answer to that
question it's just not recorded the
authoritative answer comes from the
Pentagon and from US intelligence can
get hired matt every year the Pentagon
and the intelligence system provide a an
analysis to Congress of the global
security situation and the last one of
course that a lot of time on Iraq and
here's what it said
don't take my word for it look it up you
can find it in the internet what they
said is there's no military threat they
said Iran has very low military
expenditures even by the standards of
the region it's a military strategy is
that his defenses it's to try to protect
the country against an invasion and
delay an invasion long enough so that
diplomacy can set in they said they were
almost no capacity to deploy force in
fact General Petraeus ahead of the
Central Command not long ago said
something something like he said that
the coterie Air Force could take out the
Iranian Air Force in 15 minutes or
something but they're not they said if
they're developing nuclear weapons which
they don't know it would be part of the
deterrence strategy and if any country
needs a deterrence strategy it's Iraq
it's completely surrounded by hostile
military forces of a aggressive brutal
superpower totally surrounded countries
next to it or occupied and the United
States and its allies are constantly
threatening an attack which happens to
be in violation of the UN Charter if
anybody cares and in violation of
specific security council resolutions
which ask the countries not to do that
they're polite enough not to mention the
countries that are doing and so yeah
they need a deterrent in fact one of
Israel's leading military historians
Martin funk Rayfield after the he
doesn't want Iran to have nuclear
but after the invasion of Iraq he wrote
that if you're honest we've just seen
that the US and Britain attacked Iraq
for no reason at all and if he ran is
not developing nuclear weapons they're
crazy that was just straight description
well I don't want to have nuclear
weapons even though most of the Arab
world does but it's not whatever it is
it's not a military threat and then in
fact the intelligence the Pentagon go on
to describe the actual threat and it's
interesting reading tells us a lot about
ourselves the threat is that Iran is
trying to extend its influence into
neighboring countries so it's trying to
extend its influence into Iraq and
Afghanistan that is a word for that it's
called destabilization they're trying to
destabilize the neighboring countries
when we invade and occupy and destroy
those countries that's called
stabilization I'm not joking I'm not
joking and they're trying to destabilize
them by expanding their influence well
obviously that's totally illegitimate we
can't accept that that's a trick now the
Iranian government is a threat it's a
terrible threat to its own population
I'm afraid it's not unique in that
respect the same is true of the number
of our closest allies but that's a
threat or right however what's called
the Iranian threat as is not that and
people would understand it this is the
major issue in farm policy now so at
least understand what it is
hi professor Chomsky I was actually
gonna ask about the Goldstone report but
that got tackled right off the bat so
forgive me if this questions little
improvised but right after 911 you and
Christopher Hitchens had a sort of
dispute in the nation and you know he
sort of cused you being an apologist for
Islamic fundamentalism and you accused
him of you know using these horrible
acts to justify u.s. foreign policy but
my focus is more his kitchen staunch
secularism and those of other so-called
new atheists like sam Harris who seem to
have the stoppage secularism which I
personally agree with but use it to
justify you know an aggressive foreign
policy so I'm just thinking how to word
this as a question do you see a way to
wreck it not reconcile do you see a way
to sort of separate the staunch
secularism of Harrison Hitchens from
their warmongering in in Harris's case
outright sport for torture well there
are maybe I detected yeah if I
understood you texting
what's going on this is okay no okay
yeah well the two questions I understood
it one is about the claim that I was
justifying 911 well I why did you why
did you bring up Hitchens one looks kind
of can i skip the first part of the
question because just total fabrication
then there's no point wasting time on it
but the second part what about the
secular isn't well first of all I don't
I think that they are religious fanatics
they happen to believe in the state
religion which is much more dangerous
than other religions for the most part
so they both of them happen to be
defenders in the state religion namely
the religion that says we have to
support the violence and atrocities of
our own state because it's being done
for all sorts of wonderful reasons which
is exactly what everyone says in every
state and I don't regard that's just
another religion like the religion that
markets know best it doesn't happen to
be a religion that you pray through
every once a week but it's just another
religion it's very destructive okay so
I'd like to I see if there's any
questions in the East common rumors are
there any rush into the East common room
so you just stop okay um my question is
a little bit separate from the topics of
today relates to your work on
linguistics so originally when you
attack Skinner's behaviorist model of
language acquisition you did it on the
basis that the poverty of stimulus
required that we had some prior faculty
in our mind that allowed us to learn
language from limited examples do you
think there's a similar argument or
account of a common human morality can
be given and you have such an account or
to have an idea of what such an account
would look like respond if you look at
that as far as the review of Skinner was
concerned almost ninety-five percent of
it was just running through claims that
he was making and arguing that these are
totally observed based on nothing I mean
I did at the very end of the review say
look there's another way of looking at
this which comes out of mainstream
biology mainstream biology just takes
for granted that every capacity you know
your visual system your ability to walk
whatever maybe is based on some genetic
property I mean assignment distress and
that's in linguistics that happens to be
called poverty of stimulus but it's
universal what it means is that the kind
of creature you are is not determined by
the input like you can't change human
embryo into a cat embryo by
the nutrition didn't in the uterus you
know it's going to become a human being
you know that's because it's built that
way that's just a biological truism and
it's presumably the reason to doubt that
it's also true of language I think it is
what about morality well I think it's
the same thing after that was pointed
out by David Hume he's he is you know
the leading empiricist but there's a lot
of confusion about what empiricism is
the empiricists like Locke and Hume and
others contrary the illusions they
believed in in eight structure and the
reason is they were not idiots I mean of
course everything that happens comes out
of an extra in a large part out of an
age structure well what about morality
Hume couldn't you much of a proof but he
said he just made some observations
which are correct he said the look we're
constantly making moral decisions in new
situations and they're pretty consistent
and other people pretty much comprehend
them and so on well if we're doing that
it must be that we have some principles
that are lying behind it and the
principles can't be picked up by
induction and effectively in his view
nothing can it's all what he called
animal instinct it's coming from animal
instinct that's what's now called
genetic endowment so genetic endowment
is determining our capacity to gain
knowledge understanding develop moral
principles and so on and so forth and I
think that's probably I don't see how
that can be false well the next problem
is to try to go on and find out what
they are well there's plenty of work on
that that's in fact a large part of the
content of the classical moral
philosophy and it's picked up again in
modern work for example of John roses
famous theory of justice probably the
most influential work in political sign
political philosophy in the last century
the that's what he does in fact he picks
a linguistic models you look he says
it's good our concept of justice that
part of morality that has to be just
like our acquisition of language and
then he discusses parallels and base
then he tries to show what the
principles would be you know kind of
original condition type thing with what
they would be all right you can say you
got a right or we got it wrong but
that's the program and I don't see what
other program that could be there is
more contemporary what recent work
proceeding further with this there's
even empirical studies by now of
children's moral judgment the
comparative moral judgments in different
societies and some theoretical structure
about what might lie behind them well
yeah that's a empirical inquiry into the
nature of them into what our moral
nature is but that it must be there I
think is pretty obvious even from your
comments okay great so we'll take one
question from the debate room one second
please yeah hello mr. Chomsky I just
like to thank you first of all for
coming and for answering more questions
that Stephen Harper seems to be
answering on his on his election cycle I
just like to ask you've discussed a lot
of the title of your talk today was the
estate corporate complex you've made
your views pretty clear in the long term
that you think that libertarian
socialist solution is a practical one
for society you've called it a natural
extension of classical liberalism in the
short term what do you see volva me
usefulness of programs like campaign
finance reform and things of that nature
simply for the short term in the short
term what is the use of things like
finance reform for example yeah well you
know in the short term it was not a very
far-reaching proposal that we should go
back to something that's worked very
well in
past finance regulations say of the New
Deal type was very successful there were
no financial crises the financial crises
are pretty devastated plenty of people
suffer from them and they're going to
get worse you know so yes regulatory
reform the kind that for example Folker
was advocating so I was thrown out and
others sure their make perfectly good
sense I mean there was a bill that came
out of the Senate the dodd-frank bill
which if it were implemented it would
probably have some dampening effect on
crises it's getting chipped away at by
lobbyists so what's going to be left is
probably nothing but sure I would it
would make perfectly good sense just
like the reasonable health reform would
make good sense for example in the
United States again it's not the
particularly dramatic proposal but if
the United States had a health care
system like every other industrial
society there wouldn't be any deficit in
fact it'd be a surplus well that's
important because the deficit is being
used to cut away at extremely useful
programs furthermore the fact that
they're 50 million people uninsured and
that healthcare is pretty much rationed
by wealth that has all kind of horrible
consequences so sure ever nothing wrong
with reforms there's a lot of simple
reforms that can be made and I think we
can go way beyond them but just very
simple straightforward reforms could
make a much better world I don't know if
I got the question correctly but yeah
okay so we are going over time so we're
over pretty much towards the end we have
time for one more question so we'll take
it from yeah
yeah second Mic Check dr. Chomsky it was
always a little odd to me that you don't
identify as a semi efficient and I was
just wondering maybe she could talk
about the field of semiotic which you
see if there's a future for that in
academia maybe which are experiences you
better semiotic as well as remember when
Goering was supposedly asked what he
thought about culture he said he reaches
for his revolver but it's not quite that
bad but I don't know what it is I'm it's
the general theory of everything
symbolic of muse of science that's I
think that's too broad to be a real
field but their particular aspects of it
that are interesting like linguistics or
like animal communication or like the
visual arts and so on whether there's
anything unifying to say about those
well if there is fine you know in favor
of it but a lot of the work that's being
done at least my judgment looks pretty
shallow and the draw your own
conclusions him okay well thank you so
much I'm it's a pleasure to see you
again and it and I'll thank you for what
you've brought us this afternoon you
know I had the pleasure of presenting
Noam Chomsky at a Hart House meeting
against the Vietnam War in 1966
it's really nice to see him still
rolling along a now heart house has
contributed a huge amount to the
possibility of this meeting and they
many of the volunteers and the central
organization and I want to point out
another aspect of history that heart
house is represented here by Louise
Cowin the warden by Linda mcquaig did
you know that she was an undergraduate
debater and the heart house debates
committee and by sem resetting who
pulled all of this together who did a
lot of the cheering here this afternoon
all of whom would have been forbidden
prior to nineteen seventy because under
the bequest it was an all-male
institution and I think it's a we didn't
plan it this way but it's a it's a happy
coincidence that three women are the
face of heart house this afternoon and I
also want to thank all the others who
helped us out Bev stole in Massachusetts
planning norms trip and are many
volunteers and the two organizations
science for peace of which I'm a
representative and near East cultural
and educational foundation of which I'm
also a member and our material is
outside I urge you to take a look at it
not only because we were good hosts
which I hope we were but because as
professor Chomsky reminds us of the
challenges and opportunities of the
present which are masters in
corporations and government refused to
face or the tell the truth about we must
take their place we must find the truth
and act on it and I invite you all to
come forward with us in this
you
