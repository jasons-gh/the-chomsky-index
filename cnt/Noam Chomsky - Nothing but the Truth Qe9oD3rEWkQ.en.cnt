good evening I hope you are all enjoying
this new piece we appreciate your
support and hope that you will be
inspired by the evening tonight it's a
special night we honor Noam Chomsky
well it's superfluous for me to say how
much I'm honored and pleased to receive
this distinguished award and to be able
to join the wonderful list of people my
friend Dan Ellsberg and others who've
contributed so much to the difficult
ongoing necessary search for peace and
justice on an occasion like this
what instantly and forcefully comes to
mind is August 6 1945 a day that will
never be forgotten by those who were
alive then and had their eyes open the
day that I personally remember all too
well if I can add a personal anecdote I
at that time was a counselor and a
summer camp the news came in the morning
to the assembled campers and counselors
and then everyone went off to their
usual activities in baseball game
whatever it might be I was so stunned by
it both by the event and the reaction
that I simply took off and went off into
the woods and stayed alone for three or
four hours just thinking about what it
all meant finally came back and those
to what David calls that terrible
silence and one of his evocative poems
was overwhelming and since that time
these two demons haunting are haunting
over everything that goes on in one form
or another both the event and the
terrible silence and I'm sure all of you
are haunted in one form or another by
the same two demons it was on that day
that we learned that human intelligence
had devised the means to bring the human
experiment of 200 thousand years to an
inglorious end it was never seriously in
doubt that the capacity to destroy would
escalate and that it would diffuse to
many other hands increasing the threat
of self annihilation on that day in 1945
humanity entered into a new era the
nuclear age at one that's unlikely to
last very long either
we will soon bring it to an end or it's
likely to bring us to an end it was not
understood at the time but a second and
no less critical new era was beginning
at the same time a new geological epoch
what geologists call the Anthropocene an
epoch defined by extreme human impact on
the environment by now it's understood
that we're well into this new epoch but
there has been disagreement among
scientists about when changes became so
extreme when
see kind of pointed in flat of
inflection to signal its onset a couple
of months ago the official working group
on the Anthropocene reached a conclusion
on the matter recommending to the
International Geological Congress that
the dawn of the Anthropocene should be
given the same day the end of World War
two August 1945 according to their
analysis then the Anthropocene and the
nuclear age coincide opposing a dual
threat to the perpetuation of organized
human life both threats are severe and
eminent and neither receives a fraction
of the attention it demands with without
exaggeration we might identify the end
of world war 2 as the moment when the
lemmings in human form set off on their
determined and disciplined march to the
precipice that kind of thought is what I
found
terrifying while sitting alone in the
woods in August 1945 and now we know how
much more serious it is and it is
impressive to watch how dedicated this
march to self-destruction is we've just
been witnessing a remarkable
demonstration of the dedication to this
vocation for the past several months all
eyes have been on the quadrennial
electoral frenzy to determine who will
lead the most powerful country in human
history the country that will set its
stamp on what comes to pass issues as
you know are barely discussed at all and
there has been scarcely immense
of the most important question that has
arisen in all of human history and that
has to be answered very soon is
organized human life going to survive on
the growing threat and it is growing of
nuclear war and on nuclear policies
generally there have been a few
scattered phrases which are hardly
encouraging on destruction of the
environment the one of the two political
parties does in fact that take a very
clear position that we should do nothing
or it's not happening at all during the
Republican primaries every single
candidate denied that what is happening
is happening with the exception of these
sensible moderates like Jeb Bush who
said that it's all uncertain but we
don't have to do anything because we're
producing more natural gas thanks to
fracking or John Kasich the other
moderate who agreed that global warming
is taking place but added that quoting
him we're going to burn coal in Ohio and
we're not going to apologize for it
and in general we should do nothing the
winning candidate as you know calls for
a rapid increase in use of fossil fuels
including coal
dismantling of all regulations rejection
of the commitment to help developing
countries that are seeking to move to
sustainable energy and in general racing
to the cliff as fast as possible and the
effects have already been felt the cop21
Paris negotiations agreement they've
just gone into force the date was
accelerated by concern that a Republican
victory in November might dismantle what
little
has been achieved and Republican
denialism already had a significant
impact it was hoped that cop21 would
lead to a verifiable treaty but that
hope was abandoned because the
Republican Congress would not accept any
binding commitments so it emerged was a
voluntary agreement that evidently much
weaker just a couple of days ago a
significant agreement was reached to
face down the use of hydrofluorocarbons
HFCS
super polluting greenhouse gases much
worse than co2 it is delayed for India
and Pakistan where increasing heat which
is making much of the country unlivable
and shocking poverty make cheap air
conditions air conditioners a desperate
necessity and the right response is
quite evident the rich countries should
provide subsidies to accelerate the
provision of advanced non HFC devices
the ones we use here very limited cost
but nothing like that seems to have been
proposed and if it were it would go the
way of a verifiable cop21 treaty when
you think about this it's hard to find
appropriate words to express the fact
that in the most powerful country in
world history with the decisive impact
on world affairs a major political
organization is quite literally
dedicated to the destruction of much of
life on Earth including us that might
seem to be an unfair comment but a
little reflection will show that it is
not and we're still these astonishing
fact
pass with virtually no comment of the
twin demons again well I won't take time
to sample the record familiar to you I'm
sure and not our topic here but it's
nevertheless worth at least recalling
how imminent and dramatic the problem is
so let us take one example that's not
much discussed every year about 25
million people flee from the effect of
disasters such as floods and storms the
predicted effect of global warming
that's one person every second
considerably more than the miserable
victims fleeing from war and terror and
the numbers are bound to increase with
the rise of sea levels very likely not
far off very recently as you may have
read and particularly hominis our recent
discoveries about the rate of melting of
the huge Antarctic glaciers which could
raise sea levels by several feet quite
quickly in Bangladesh alone mostly a
low-lying coastal plain tens of millions
are expected to be forced to flee in
coming decades simply because of sea
level rise with some justice the
Bangladesh is leading climate scientists
says that these migrants should have the
right to move to the countries from
which all these greenhouse gases have
been coming millions should be able to
go to the United States alone although
this is a coming so-called refugee
crisis that makes today's pale into
insignificance and it's also a profound
moral crisis for the rich societies
which will only intensify as Himalayan
glaciers melt already
threatening the water supply of South
Asia that we're already hundreds of
millions of people elect adequate
drinking water but all of this and a far
more does not even reach the sidelines
while the game of triviality and
vulgarity commands obsessive attention
and when we turn to our topic here by
the pictures not more encouraging should
be an imperative for an educated citizen
any educated citizen to review carefully
the history of the nuclear age
it's a harrowing experience for anyone
who's willing to endure the painful
record of missed opportunities and near
misses sometimes from accident an error
in a few shocking cases that are not
well enough known from recklessness and
the threat is growing right now
ominously escape from catastrophe for 70
years has been a near miracle and such
miracles cannot be trusted to perpetuate
a new information is appearing regularly
about how lucky we are to have survived
so far as I'm sure you all know the
Doomsday Clock of The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists has been moved to minutes
closer to midnight to the point three
minutes to midnight and where it last
was in the early 1980s during a major
war scare about which we have recently
very recently learned more so to recall
the basic facts in 1983 the Reagan
administration launched what was called
Operation Abel Archer to probe
defense's simulating attacks on Russia
including nuclear attacks it would
happen to be a moment of grave
international tensions among other
threat escalations pursing two nuclear
missiles were being installed in Germany
with a short flight time a few minutes
to Russian territory and we now know I
didn't know this before that Soviet
specialists feared that they had a range
of 2500 kilometers which would have
posed the direct threat to the
leadership in Moscow at the same time
Griffen cruise missiles although slower
it could reach Moscow and also could fly
low enough to avoid Soviet radar leaving
the Soviet nuclear command vulnerable to
a decapitating first strike actually
quoting from a new study by the National
Security Archive which has significant
new information about able Archer a
couple of years ago with the
declassification of Russian archives it
was learned that not too surprisingly
the Russians took able Archer pretty
seriously
there has been uncertainty however about
how much was understood in Washington
the National Security Archive has been
trying for many years to have the record
Declassified and they've now partially
succeeded the record reveals that
Washington recognized very quickly that
able Archer was bringing the world to
the verge of terminal war presidential
board was established which concluded
right away that the CIA had been
mistaken in its judgment that the wreck
that the Russians recognized able Archer
to be just an exercise on the quite the
contrary I'll quote the words
bored the Russians took Abel Archer so
seriously that it may have inadvertently
plays placed our relations with the
Soviet Union on a hair-trigger that
means we were on the verge of nuclear
war which of course means terminal
nuclear war terminal for everyone these
newly released documents have other
revelations they revealed that US
intelligence determined that the
Russians were mobilizing forces to what
they call an unusual level of alert
which according to protocol u.s.
protocol meant that the US should have
reacted in kind one hi US air force
officer Leonard Perutz
decided on his own not to follow
prescribed procedures and to do nothing
as the record says now perhaps averting
terminal war we already knew that
shortly after this Russian automated
systems detected a massive US nuclear
attack and the officer in charge
the Stanislav Petrov also decided to do
nothing instead of transmitting the
information to a higher level which
might have triggered a massive nuclear
strike
so Perutz and Petrov therefore belong to
the honor roll of men who decided that
the species should survive joining with
us of the osipov who blocked orders to
launch nuclear torpedoes of your tip
torpedoes when Russian submarines were
under attack during a very tense moment
of the Cuban Missile Crisis which could
have easily had escalating effects
without limit no doubt there are others
whose names are unknown I've just been
reading drafts of Dan Ellsberg
a way to book on nuclear strategy which
he was kind enough to send me though I'm
not sure that kind is the right word
it's an appalling record beginning early
on then maybe talking about it himself
so I won't say much but one of the most
frightening parts is Dan's 1960
inquiries into these sophisticated
failsafe mechanisms that had been
devised to prevent accidental launch of
nuclear weapons by pilots and and for
the first time undertook to investigate
these mechanisms at forward air bases
but and he was able to show that also
although they might have looked good on
paper in practice the mechanisms had
fatal flaws and pilots were in fact
ready to launch a nuclear war under
circumstances that were not at all
unlikely to arise this adds another
chapter to the horrifying record of near
misses and missed opportunities and that
record was already appalling enough
including for fatal flaw flaws of
command and control that could have been
terminal some of them are recounted in a
memoir by beep if be 50 to pilot major
Don Clausen he took part in the the
missions the chrome-dome missions during
the Cuban Missile Crisis it was a
mission of b-52s on airborne alert with
unfolding him nuclear weapons on board
and ready to use his own conclusion is
that we were damned lucky that we didn't
blow up the world and though thanks to
the political or military leadership of
this country
Clausen reports that he flew 15 24-hour
chrome-dome missions and that the
official commanders on quoting him did
not possess the capability to prevent a
rogue crew or crew member from arming
and releasing their thermonuclear
weapons or even from broadcasting a
mission that would have sent off the
entire airborne alert force without
possibility of recall and once the crew
was airborne carrying thermonuclear
weapons he writes it would have been
possible to arm and drop them all with
no further input from the ground there
was no inhibitor on any of these systems
Saxon Strategic Air Command was
technically in charge of it appears to
have had little control and the deciders
so-called who were pondering the fate of
the world that the XCOM meetings in
Washington apparently knew even less
that's a conclusion that is underscored
rather bitterly in an oral history of
this period by General David Bertrand
all who commanded the operation his
attitude toward the civilian leaders is
pretty shocking
maybe justified well I was pretty
skeptical when I read major Clausen's
account but the skepticism fades for me
rapidly when after reading dens chilling
discoveries about some delegation of
authority much of it authorized directly
by President Eisenhower and presumably
by his successors who are much less
knowledgeable about military affairs
than he was it's on such decisions
that the fate of organized human society
has relied all too often in the nuclear
age and it simply cannot go on but it is
going on in fact with mounting threats
partly in Syria where proposals by John
McCain and Clinton advisers Michele
Flournoy and Mike Morell if they were
implemented that could easily lead the
uncontrollable escalation but the main
tensions are on the Russian border with
highly provocative actions on both sides
along with ominous military buildups one
can only imagine with trepidation the
command and control flaws that might
suddenly become lethal any minute
literally jets military jets buzzing
each other
provocative military actions a couple
hundred meters from the Russian border
and so on notice that all of this is at
the Russian border it's not at the
Mexican border where even the remotest a
hint of such a threat it would have led
to nuclear war long ago and we'd be done
we should at least be asking why the
threats are at the Russian border and
more generally what were the
opportunities for a global security
system with the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991 well the two sides at the
time had conflicting visions Gorbachev
for the Russians called for dismantling
of all military alliances and replacing
them by a unified Eurasian security
system which would integrate the former
Soviet Union collapsing at the time
and the and Western Europe on the other
side President Bush and his Secretary of
State James Baker had a different plan
NATO would expand while the Soviet
system collapsed what happened at the
time has been the subject of a very
interesting and searching scholarly
inquiry and there are some new and quite
revealing discoveries the issue of
course was joined over the fate of
Germany for obvious reasons Gorbachev
did agree the German unification even
German accession to NATO hostile
military alliance which is a pretty
remarkable concession in the light of
recent history after all earlier in the
century Germany alone had practically
destroyed Russia twice long history
before that but he did agree there was
however a quid pro quo and NATO would
not extend one edge to the East that's
the phrase that was used in the
negotiations that meant to East Germany
there was no discussion of anything
beyond if it was contemplated it was
only in secret on the US side
well Bush and Baker agreed to this but
only verbally it was a gentlemen's
agreement
handshake not in writing it was and NATO
instantly expanded these Germany in
violation of the pledge but as bush and
Baker correctly stated they were not
violating a written commitment just a
gentlemen's agreement well there's a
rich scholarly literature seeking to
determine exactly what was going on at
the time and there has been one primary
open question that's been debated what
is it that Bush and Baker intended and
do
this is actually a persuasive answer to
this question that's just been given for
a recent article in the MIT Harvard
Journal international security by Joshua
it's boo it's shiver Anson did a lot of
new archival studies and they indicated
pretty clearly that the Bush Baker
verbal commitments to Gorbachev were
very explicitly designed to mislead
Gorbachev while US dominance extended to
the east it's a matter of some
significance that shouldn't be confined
to the dry prose of a scholarly Journal
well under Clinton NATO expanded farther
to the east in 2008
apparently later the NATO even offered
membership to Ukraine a highly
provocative move right at the
geostrategic heartland of russia quite
apart from long historical and cultural
connections george kennan and other
senior statesmen had warned right at the
beginning that NATO enlargement would be
what they called a tragic mistake a
policy error of historic proportions
it's now contributing to rising tensions
on the Russian border raising a risk of
nuclear war that is not slight the
options in 1991 were another in a long
series of missed opportunities to move
from confrontation to cooperation
opening ways to eliminate the scourge of
nuclear weapons entirely and also to
move on to a more peaceful world it's
not the only case and some of the
earlier ones from very early in the Cold
War and since offer quite suggestive
lessons for today
one of the most intriguing was an offer
by Stalin in 1952 to permit unification
of Germany on condition that it not join
NATO and perhaps leading to elections
that were certain to have inclined
Germany to the West at the time the most
vocal support for exploring the
opportunity was by a very respected and
influential analyst James Warburg in his
book Germany key to peace he was ignored
and the scattered later references to
this have mostly elicited ridicule as I
found myself several times
declassification of Russian archives a
couple of years ago has led to some
serious rethinking of this matter one of
the leading scholars of Soviet Union
bitterly anti-communist Soto Soviet
scholar Adam Coulomb he observed that
unquote him after the archives came out
Washington wasted little effort in
flatly rejecting Moscow's initiative on
grounds that were embarrassingly
unconvincing as in fact Warburg had
shown right at the time coulombs own
judgment is that what he calls the basic
question remains open was Stalin
genuinely ready to sacrifice the newly
created German Democratic Republic East
Germany on the altar of real democracy
with consequences that could have been
enormous Cold War historian melvin
Leffler one of the most distinguished
Cold War historians also citing Russian
archives points out that Lavrentiy Beria
the sinister brutal head of the secret
police proposed that the Kremlin offered
the West a deal on the unification
neutralization of Germany agreeing to
satisfice the East German communist
regime to reduce east-west tensions and
improve internal political and economic
conditions in Russia there's a spate of
recent scholarship and cited by these
Russian archival releases which has
sought to show that Stalin never meant
what he proposed there hadn't there was
a good way to find out at the time to
take him up on the proposal but that was
not seriously tried and to my knowledge
scholarly inquiry has focused on whether
Stalin was serious and not on a question
more significant to us why was there no
effort to find out and it's not the only
time but any means this raises an
interesting question highly relevant to
nuclear destruction at the time the
United States basically faced no threats
but there was a potential threat ICBMs
with hydrogen bomb warheads yet
developed by say in 1950 but in the
offing and that raises a question
whether there could have been a treaty
negotiation with the Russians which
would have eliminated the only serious
threat to the security of the United
States and in fact the survival of the
world there's an interesting study of
this by McGeorge Bundy the standard
scholarly study of the history of
nuclear weapons and he does devote two
or three sentences to it in the middle
of the book he points out that he he had
access to high-level classified material
he said he could not find even a staff
paper raising the question whether there
should be an effort to eliminate the
only potential serious threat to u.s.
security and survival it's not the only
case when
the striking features of the pentagon
papers dead released is that you find
cases like this over and over well there
have been other opportunities how real
we don't know they weren't seriously
explored they provide a historical
counterpoint to the abysmal record of
incidents that were much too close to
disaster to be tolerable and both missed
opportunities and threatening
provocations are all too real today
posing challenges that should be the
focus of concern for populations
policymakers alike and certainly for all
of us who hope to escape the threats
pursue the opportunities the goal of
abolishing nuclear weapons is not a
utopian dream it's been forcefully
advocated by mainstream establishment
figures among them George Shultz Sam
Nunn Henry Kissinger or William Perry
four signers of an op-ed in The Wall
Street Journal calling for elimination
of weapons altogether another respected
national security expert Luce Blair its
form the new organization called global
zero which calls for an international
treaty abandoning nuclear weapons the
International Court of Justice came
close to that stand and it's 1996
advisory opinion on the legality of the
threat or use of nuclear weapons this
month for the first time the United
Nations is considering a resolution to
launch negotiations or quote on a
legally binding instrument to prohibit
nuclear weapons leading towards their
total elimination
the resolution is sponsored by Brazil
Austria Ireland Mexico Nigeria South
Africa and it's expected to win the
support of more than
and 20 states but without large-scale
public support it will pass into
oblivion just like the other lost
opportunities and the same holds
regarding the steps that should be taken
right now to reduce the international
tensions that are escalating the threat
of nuclear war there are steps that can
be taken that must be taken if we are to
dispel the oncoming storm that may
consume us all
on behalf of the foundation I want to
thank professor Chomsky for accepting
the distinguished piece of leadership
award this evening and for his powerful
talk let me take you back for just a
minute to about 2400 years ago it's a
long time but it's when Alexander the
Great
ruled in the fourth century BC he spent
most of his ruling years at war and if
he had decided at that time to spend 1
million dollars per day every single day
up until today on his war efforts he
still would not have spent 1 trillion
dollars yet that's how much the u.s.
plans to spend on modernizing its
nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years
think about that $1,000,000 per day for
over 2,400 years and it still wouldn't
equal our nuclear weapons budget for the
next 30 years it's staggering and it's a
frightening statistic a10 APF we believe
that we as a people need to humanize not
modernize modernize sounds nice right
but what's it mean it means new nuclear
warheads nuclear armed submarines
land-based missiles bomber aircraft some
of which are proposed to be deployed
until the 2080s
it means smaller more precise weapons
that many argue can be considered more
usable on the battlefield lowering the
threshold for nuclear weapons use it
means many of our country's top
scientific minds will be focused on mass
destruction now imagine a world in which
the US and the world's other eight
nuclear-armed nations directed their
nuclear weapons funding instead to
address human need
we could provide tens of thousands of
scholarships for young people to attend
college I think there's a few people
here tonight who might think that's a
good idea
we could transform our fossil fuel
economy in order to stave off the worst
effects of manmade climate change we
could pay more for teachers and even pay
them what they're worth
my daughter's elementary school right
here in Santa Barbara might have to lay
off its librarian this year it's not
okay so I could probably name one
trillion ways in which this money could
be better spent but the point is this if
the US doesn't stop modernizing and take
seriously it's legal and its moral
obligations to negotiate in good faith
for nuclear disarmament neither will the
other eight nations we've got to work
toward total global nuclear disarmament
and here at na PF we never lose sight of
our mission to achieve a world free of
nuclear weapons we also actively oppose
each nuclear modernization program as it
rears its ugly head in Congress there's
no up-and-down vote on whether to spend
a trillion dollars it comes in many
pieces over many years and we need your
support to keep it from moving ahead
now professor Chomsky relates some
shocking information tonight in his talk
and now that you know I ask you to
please join us sign up for our action
alert network at waging peace org or at
our information table in the back of the
room share the information from our
website or information that you pick up
here with your friends and family at the
opening of his talk tonight Noam Chomsky
said that we will soon bring the nuclear
age to an end or it will bring an end to
us so what we modernize our nuclear
weapons or will we humanize our society
and make the world a better place for
everyone we can't have it both ways
thank you all again and good night
you
