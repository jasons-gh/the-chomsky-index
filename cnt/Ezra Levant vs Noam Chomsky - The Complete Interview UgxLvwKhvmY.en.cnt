professor Chomsky what a pleasure to
have you today I'd like to talk to you
about two things because you're an icon
of free speech and if criticism of u.s.
foreign policy both are very interesting
to me let's talk about free speech the
Left used to be associated with free
speech does the left care about free
speech now as much as they did in the
60s and 70s well there are they were the
struggle for free speech and the sixties
and the seventies was an effort to break
through constraints against what could
be articulated and what people could
hear actually the notion of freedom of
speech is a not so trivial
so take say the First Amendment of the
Constitution let's doesn't really say
very much but the way it's been
interpreted over the years there are two
dimensions to it one is the freedom to
from a government constraint the notice
that not freedom from corporate
constraint which is very severe can give
examples but freedom from government
constraint the other dimension is the
freedom to obtain information and to
express oneself now that's different and
in fact if you look at the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights of the
United Nations the article I think it's
article 19 that's concerned with this
speaks of the freedom to impart and
receive information now if you go back
to the early history of the United
States the founding fathers were
concerned with both rights so the state
policy things like postal rules and
others were designed to permit the
freest possible imparting of information
expression of opinion but also of
receiving information
well professor I want to go back to the
the thing you said at first which was
that in the 60s and 70s it was about
breaking through and especially about
protesting the Vietnam War and other
social change civil rights movements for
African Americans but I want to follow
up on that because it seems to me that
now that the sixties leftists have
broken through have taken over the deans
offices and the highest political
offices of 60s activists community
organizers now the president or at least
in the mold of a 60s activist is that
why today's leftists are the enforcers
of speech coach whereas in the 60s they
would prove protesting outside the
dean's office now they're the ones with
the politically correct speech codes
because they got their way so they don't
need the tool of free speech anymore it
was just a temporary weapon to smash the
conservative hegemony I don't think
that's true at all the constraints on
breaking through to the public are
probably greater than they were and this
or at least comparable to what they were
in the sixties so where are the leftist
free speech activists today aren't they
now the enforcers of political
correctness on conservative ideas on
gender or sexual orientation aren't
there more speech codes being enforced
by leftist now than ever before that's a
dramatic exaggeration how big a problem
is fiction is on freedom of expression
and come from the corporate sector of
the state sector and they're very
they're pretty rigid so nothing prevents
me from saying in the United States that
the Iraq war was the worst crime in the
21st century but I can't publish I can't
I can only reach very marginal audiences
on what is a pretty obvious fact there
are very you can say in the United
States within the mainstream that the
Iraq war was a strategic blunder as
Obama did but try saying that
it's a crime of aggression of the kind
that led to the hanging of Nazi war
criminals at Nuremberg try to write an
op-ed about that well but you're but
aren't you confusing things professor
aren't you saying my power to force
someone else to carry my views is a
receive es NBC carry my views is a form
of censorship isn't that that's not
censorship that's their right to be free
from your views where is if you said
certain things on campus about sexuality
about women's women or minorities you
wouldn't just face a lack of media that
would carry your views you would face
student misconduct hearings you would be
expelled you would be drummed out of
institutions I'm not talking about
someone refusing to print your offense
I'm talking about someone proactively
gagging you it is a very marginal
phenomenon on campus which barely exists
but there's a major phenomenon and that
is the virtual monopolization of the
major media by private corporate and
about the internet that's on the
Internet you can go around them may I
continue
ethically restricts the opportunity for
freedom of for expressing opinion and
providing information it's true that you
can get around it in peripheral ways but
this is an enormous constraint on
freedom of speech I can give you dude
let me give an example of one of the
cases that's not regarded interestingly
as constraint on freedom of speech I've
published a number of books with
colleague Edward Herrmann the Wharton
School the University of Pennsylvania
the first book we published was
published by a small but profitable a
textbook publisher was called counter
revolutionary violence the they
published 20,000 copies of it the
advertisements for it reached the
congelante hit one of the executives in
the big conglomerate Warner
Communications now part of Warner
Brothers that
on the the publisher he didn't like it
he ordered the publisher to not to
distribute the book when they refused he
put the entire publisher out of business
destroying all of their stock is that a
constraint on freedom of speech
yeah but it's not considered that
because it's not state censorship well
professor I mean you talked about 20,000
copies of a book I predict our
discussion here will have more than
20,000 views I mean I I think you're
disregarding the Democrat
democratization of the internet that
allows anyone with a blog or a YouTube
page or even a Facebook page to talk to
literally millions do you discount that
now of course I don't discount it in
fact I've written about it but it
remains the case that overwhelmingly the
media that reached the general public
are under corporate control and highly
restrictive are you not a a form of a
celebrity are you not a star i if i
thought of a top ten academics in terms
of their reach and the passionate
following they have despite this
corporate you know embargo that you
refer to i would put it to you that
you've been enormous ly successful your
ideas have found great purchase aren't
you a living disproof of your theory not
at all in fact it has nothing to do with
me it's quite general I mentioned one
example describing accurately the Iraq
war virtually impossible in the major
sources of information in the United
States same with the Vietnam War I mean
you mentioned the Vietnam War before did
the left win that I mean is it possible
to point out in the major media and if
if so please tell me where that the
United State under John F Kennedy the
United States invaded South Vietnam
carried out a major act of aggression
which then expanded to the point where
it destroyed virtually all of Indochina
in the worst crime since the Second
World War tell me where you've seen the
phrase in the
Asian of South Vietnam in the mainstream
media I think that most movies about war
both in the Vietnam era and certainly in
the Iraq era I mean there's American
sniper on the one hand but I could name
you take 10 anti-war films but can I
shift gears because you brought up
Foreign Affairs and I'd like to to plumb
your views on that may I ask you about
Foreign Affairs and and your thoughts on
the Obama administration there's a man I
would say of the left not just a liberal
but over the left do you generally
approve or disapprove of Obama's foreign
affairs conduct Obama is a man of the
center right he's not that's called the
left in the United States but that's an
indication of the narrowness of the
spectrum under Obama if you look at
global opinion which doesn't get
published here but it's real so Gallup
polls of international opinion you find
that the United State that one of the
questions is asked is which country in
the world is the greatest threat to
world peace the United States is in the
lead where no one else is even close
way behind in second places Pakistan
others who are regarded here as the
major threats are barely even mentioned
well surely the Islamic state and Boko
Haram and al Qaeda do you think that
Barack Obama in the United States are a
greater threat to peace than these
Muslim terrorist groups I've just listed
you didn't ask
I didn't say it didn't give you my
opinion okay I'm sorry go ahead I gave
you global opinion opinion as taken by
the Gallup Organization the main polling
organization as far as I'm aware that
wasn't even published here but it's a
significant fact and if you look at the
reasons there are reasons so for example
take President Obama's global
assassination campaign the drone
campaign it is a campaign which openly
not secretly targets the people who are
suspected of perhaps intending someday
to do harm to us can you imagine if say
Iran was carrying out a global cannot
pay
to assassinate people who it thought
might be of harm to them I mean we'd
probably nuke them but when we do it
it's fine and it's cold and you call it
left I take your point are there any
political leaders in the United States
that come close to expressing your views
on foreign policy or are all the major
parties bereft of such people although
they have them I mean they're and in
fact they range all over the spectrum so
there have been times when say Bernie
Sanders expressed views very close to
mine on foreign policy there are times
when Rand Paul didn't let me ask you
about the United States I know you're a
strong critic of the war on terror you
discussed your opposition to droning and
and I think that you have been a leading
critic of the United States as foreign
policy for many years but I want to
bring you back to this Muslim terrorism
I referred to earlier the Islamic state
Boko Haram al Qaeda Al Shabaab there's
too many to list at what point does your
criticism of the United States however
valid it may be seem disproportionate
given the threat of what I and some
others regard is the new Nazism of these
Islamic fascists theocracies we've all
seen the beheading videos and horrors
that are reminiscent of the Nazis at
what point does it seem to it
exquisitely you know that you're making
the perfect the enemy of the good that
you may have a criticism in the United
States
but it seems trivial to the threat that
posed by radical Islam do you feel out
of balance that you should criticize
perhaps America's enemies more known I
think the opposite it's first of all
it's always let's take say the let's
take Iran okay the the duty of an
Iranian dissident inside Iran is not to
join the huge chorus of condemnation of
the crimes of Israel in the United
States though the crimes are very real
the duty of a honest dissident and
honest honorable person in Iran would be
to criticize the crimes of Iran and we
understand that in the old Soviet Union
we respected the dissidents Sattar of
and others because of their criticism of
the crimes repression violence of their
own country
we didn't care what they said about the
US war in Vietnam that's none of their
they in fact if they've supported it who
cared that we honored them for doing
what they had to do within their own
countries same with cassava Ville we
honor him because we because of his
struggle as courageous struggle against
repression and violence where he was
whether the fact is that he did support
us crimes but that's marginal do you
regard your Sipho the dissonance is
quite different are you a dissident
professor do I disagree with what does a
dissident mean I don't you've been using
the term that's an interesting term we
use the term the term conventionally is
used in the United States only for
critics in enemy states we don't call
critics in the United States or its
allies dissidents that's part of a
propaganda system what would you call
yourself person who gives my opinion
about international domestic affairs
well but it'd have flavor to your
opinions to be a high it happens to be
the kind of criticism which we call
dissidents in enemy States so therefore
we should call that here to not accept
the propaganda device of restricting it
to enemies we should apply it to
ourselves as well no I want me to
continue
I'm not comparable to the dissidents in
the Soviet Union Iran for many reasons
for one thing they were under Thurmond
are much harsher repression in
comparably harsher secondly I do
extensively condemn the crimes of
enemies they didn't in fact what I do
so there
many differences I appreciate that and
I'm glad you you pointed those out I
want to ask you because you're such a
strong critic or dissident of the United
States is there a model Society is there
another country or jurisdiction that you
think America should be more like I we
all work towards a an ideal or a utopia
but is there a manifestation of these
ideals on earth that you think America
should be more like all right think
there's any particular society that I
would if I were like in any society that
I can think of if I were living there
I'd be criticizing what it's the aspects
of its policies that deserve harsh
criticism but you're more than just a
grouch you you you have a particular
philosophy of and I want to know if
there's a place on earth that is more
attuned to your flow I know you would
criticize everything and so perhaps I
call you a critic not a dissident so
there's a better society than America
Express first of all expressing
criticism of society is not a grouch
Vasudeva was not a grouch Sakharov was
not a grouch they were doing something
shereena body and iran is not a grouch
they're doing something very significant
and they are not and it's not just
negative you're not saying look stop
this crime it's also saying live up to
this ideal for the United States we
should say yes we should live up to
ideals that we profess we profess a
belief in democracy fine we should try
to live up to it to the extent that we
don't it should be criticized and not
just criticized but active efforts
should be made to overcome it that's the
role of I think any decent person
we call them dissidents in other
countries so let's go on that here
you're very patient with me I have two
last questions i you you mentioned the
ideals that all Americans are striving
to live up to and which will probably
never be met I didn't say which would
claim to be the claim to me thank you
you're you're very precise in your
language and I and I should be more
precise in my characterization of you
our America's ideals themselves Noble or
duuude
do you object to America's ideals as say
expressed in the Constitution do you
believe that the American Constitution
is is an idealistic document that we
should work towards and strive towards
the constant the US Constitution had
positive elements and quite negative
elements and so for example one part of
the Constitution authorized the capture
and return of slaves to their owners
well fortunately many years later that
was overcome there are other things in
the Constitution that I think are quite
admirable there are others that should
be changed document last question you've
been very generous with your time and my
questions certainly are prodding you
you're very kind to answer them I want
to talk about the Middle East we've
talked about it circuitous Lee but you
are a critic of Israel and and I want to
transpose your comments about being a
critic of America to being a critic of
Israel Israel has its ideals that it is
claims to want to live up to to use your
phrasing would you acknowledge that not
only Israel's ideals but the level it
has achieved those ideals it's its
reality is morally superior than then
its neighbors in the Arab world do you
believe that Israel is a morally
superior country then Iran or Syria or
even Egypt in some respects and other
respects not like what
well for example as compared with the
others that you mentioned Israel is a
very aggressive in the state for example
it's invaded Lebanon five times Iran
hasn't invaded anyone its
Israel is now in a gross violation of
international law the occupation is has
been the actions of Israel in the
occupied territories have been harshly
condemned by the Security Council of the
United Nations in fact Israel's
violating its directives the
International Court of Justice as in its
advisory opinion concluded that these
are in violation of fundamental
international law those are quite
negative facts on the other hand
internally if you ask is Israel
internally more open democratic less
repressive then say Egypt be sure
obviously so that's why I'm a very harsh
critic of the Egyptian dictatorship last
question professor the US State
Department defines anti-semitism as
holding Israel to a double standard that
is pointing out criticizing attacking
things only in Israel and not
criticizing them elsewhere
I'm not phrasing it exactly but that
that's the gist of it do you think that
by obsessing over Israel you mentioned
various UN hearings and investigations
do you think that the world's obsession
with Israel while ignoring similar
prosecution's or examinations or
condemnation of Bashar Assad or the
Islamic state do you think that's a sign
of anti-semitism and do you think
anti-semitism is on the rise in the
world that's like asking me do I agree
that the moon is made out of green
cheese first of all it's not a fact
there's an overwhelming opposition to
the Islamic state to us a bitterly
condemned how can you say that they're
not criticized I'm it's just
overwhelming including in the Islamic
world but in terms of formal UN
resolutions in terms of war crimes
inspections in terms of the
International Criminal Courts in terms
of the sheer number of resolutions in
terms of dealing with refugees if you
compare the inspection criticism and
condemnation and resolutions against
Israel for its occupation compared to
Syria its which is the patient of Syria
you're referring to well let us say it's
treatment of refugees it's treatment of
minority Syria has head has been amazing
in its treatment of refugees if we would
only live up to
standard who would be responding to my
astonishing I'm not talking about the
last couple of years during the Civil
War but before that the countries that
absorbed refugees at a huge level were
Syria Jordan Lebanon and Iran and these
incidentally are refugees often from our
crimes
we don't absorb the refugees from our
crimes they do so several million people
fled Iraq after the u.s. attack did they
come to the United States no they were
absorbed not beautifully I mean pretty
young in harsh ways sometimes but they
were absorbed in the neighboring
countries we don't do that it's
anti-semitism on the rise professor and
I'll let you go after this but I am
curious do you believe that
anti-semitism in Europe and in the
Middle East is on the rise
well you have to be very careful here
anti-semitism and criticism of the
policies of Israel are two very
different let's talk about Jew hatred
this is phrase it that way do you think
hatred of Jews Jewish things synagogues
Jewish schools Jewish people is on the
rise and in Europe and the Middle East
the Middle East it's a complicated
affair because remember that the the the
situation in the Middle East is that the
United States is the Israel with us
backing crucial u.s. backing is carrying
out what the Israeli sociologist Barkha
Marilyn called politicized destroying
the national rights of a national group
that's pretty serious so in the Middle
East there's all kind of reactions to
that in Europe there is a rise of
right-wing sometimes neo-nazi forces
which does sometimes take an
anti-semitic right wing but what about
the attacks in Paris in Copenhagen are
you calling Muslim extremist right-wing
professors at a code word will you
address the Muslim anti-semitism at the
rise of new I can just go into it in
detail feline those particular cases
which incidentally were massive
they condemned by the Muslim communities
both in Paris and in Denmark and in fact
just just the other day in Norway there
were a thousand Muslims surrounding a
synagogue in protecting it in
condemnation of the attack in Copenhagen
but if you look at these attacks just
take a look at who the people were you
can find out for example there's a
detailed discussion in the current issue
of France's leading international
affairs journal among diplomatique they
go through the background of the the
assailants in Paris they're Algerian
they come from the slums they are
products of the bitter Algerian
atrocities in the 1990s from which their
parents fled for which France had very
significant it played a very significant
role it was recording the military
regime and the groups that these young
men came from came out of the protest
against that those actions they live in
very marginalized repressed regions in
Paris they've been in and out of prisons
they've been involved in the kind of
crime that comes from repression and
marginalization it's a pretty ugly
situation but it sounds like you're
either yes I knew but they did but
avoiding it I mean I'm are you avoiding
or are you excusing it or are you
denying it do you do you deny that
there's a rise in Muslim anti-semitism
in Europe
neither denying it or avoiding it trying
to understand it so you acknowledge that
throw us it's very easy to scream at
people you don't like it's more serious
to try to understand what the doing and
take constructive actions to prevent it
if you want to scream that's fine you
can always scream at your enemies
professor I've enjoyed our conversation
today you've been very generous with
your time I think it's nice to meet you
via Skype and we call ourselves the
rebels over here - so we're dissidents
in our own way great to talk to you too
professor nice to talk you thank you bye
