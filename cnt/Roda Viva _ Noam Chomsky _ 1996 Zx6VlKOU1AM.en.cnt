non-political well actually my first
political article that I recall was when
I was 10 years old in the school
newspaper after the fall of Barcelona I
was very much interested in the Spanish
Civil War becoming involved at that time
with left libertarian groups concerned
about the spread of fascism in Europe at
whatever level a ten-year-old understand
such things and nothing much has changed
since so it's not first linguistics and
then politics that was long before I had
heard that there was such a thing as
linguistics or the study of language

days the Commish like a half year just a
big opinion certain is paid to Desa
concepts on I do not have a very high
opinion of most of the work of respected
intellectuals I have to admit that they
have a job to do which is to make things
seem complicated and to present a
picture of the world that will serve
their interests and serve power
interests the end of history has been
declared at least a half a dozen times
in the last hundred and thirty years
always wrongly with the I think the Cold
War was seriously misinterpreted in my
view it was a phase of the what's called
the north-south conflict sort of a
euphemism for the European conquest of
the world the Eastern Europe was the
original third world back as far as the
15th century when it began to move
towards independence in 1917 it evoked
essentially the same reaction that was a
vote when at the opposite extreme
Grenada began setting up fishing
cooperatives well the scale was
radically different and it took on a
life of its own but this basic structure
of it is within that framework and so
things continue what Professor
huntington calls the clash of
civilizations has been going on forever
it's going on in approximately the same
way today the idea that his idea that
the united states is somehow can the wet
the united states the leader of the west
is confronting an islamic civilization i
admission
no sense one of the closest allies of
the United States has perhaps the most
fundamentalist Islamic country in the
world Saudi Arabia that could change
tomorrow if there was a revolution in
Saudi Arabia the dynamics and the
processes are about as they have been
before in fact it's very striking in the
case of the United States since 1917
every US intervention particularly since
1945 has been justified on the grounds
of concern over you know the Soviet
danger but right what happened right
before the Cold War before which really
broke out in 1917 immediately before
Woodrow Wilson invaded Haiti and the
Dominican Republic that wasn't in
defense against the Soviet Union of
obviously it was in defense against the
Huns
you know before that it was in defense
against someone else in fact if you look
at the development of the US Navy a
hundred years ago it was in defense
against Chile believe it or not and US
you know warships were off the coast of
Chile immediately after the fall of the
Berlin Wall what happened a few weeks
later the United States invaded Panama
it was so conventional that it's hardly
a footnote in history in fact about the
only difference between that and
preceding interventions for many years
was that they had had a new pretext
couldn't be in defense against the
Soviet Union so it was in defense
against Hispanic narco traffickers next
time it'll be something else if you look
at the conflicts that are now raging
around the world most of them have been
there for a long time in fact about the
only ones that are new are those that
are within the collapsing Soviet empire
so Chechnya that's new but that's the
result of the breakdown of every
Imperial system when the Portuguese
Empire collapsed there were huge
conflicts still going on in fact in the
Portuguese colonial system Angola and
Mozambique team were in Southeast Asia
when the French and British colonial
systems collapsed there were huge
massacres and slaughters and conflicts
some still continuing the the ones in
central Africa
right now our residues of German and the
first Belgian and German later French
imperialism there's everything there are
always new things happening but the
fundamental dynamics I don't think have
changed substantially in fact for a long
long time addendum polka pretenders

[Music]
immigrants from Eastern Europe and very
deeply involved in the Jewish community
in fact lived in what was almost a kind
of cultural ghetto at the same time they
were New Deal liberals Roosevelt
liberals you know that was basically the
politics other parts of the family to
which I was drawn very early we're
working class mostly unemployed it was
the late nineteen thirty a very lively
intellectual culture there was a very
rich lively intellectual culture at the
time and I mean high culture so latest
debates about psychoanalysis and Marx
and the
Budapest string quartet and so on and so
forth many of them had almost no
education but there was a rich cultural
tradition and I was part of that so it's
a mixture of Jewish and very heavy
Jewish involvement through my whole life
and also that at the time I was what was
called a Zionist in fact most of my
activism in my in those years and my
teams was Zionist but opposed to a
Jewish state because that was part of
the Zionist movement at the time there
are many illusions about this the first
official commitment of the Zionist
movement to a Jewish state was actually
in 1942 in the United States before that
it was it included within it strong by
nationalist tendencies even including
the leadership like David ben-gurion and
others and it was a kind of a so I was
part of a radical socialist wing which
was committed to arab-jewish
working-class cooperation maybe it was
an illusion maybe it was real one could
debate that but anyway that was the
commitment and so it remained I lived in
a kibbutz for a while in fact in his
rule and might have stayed there and I
go up and back but as for the future of
Zionism well Zionism changed in 1948
political Zionism which became Zionism
so the former anti-state tendencies were
absorbed into the state from then on
it's just another state in the
international system behaving like every
other state particularly after 1967 with
the conquests it became an appendage of
the United States so it's now the 51st
state that's not quite accurate because
it gets far more federal subsidies than
any state of the first 50 so it's a an
outpost of us power and there's a
complicated arrangement Israel's become
part of the the United States took over
from Britain domination of the Middle
East in nineteen
45 as it took over domination of South
America and part of that part of the
system is that there's a there kind of
local Jean de armes what the Secretary
of Defense once called the local cops on
the beat you know the where's the police
headquarters are in Washington Israel's
one of them so it's part of the huge
system which extends from the Pacific to
the Azores that's aimed at the Middle
East and controlling the oil you know
the oil system futures of Judaism well
you know people's futures in their own
hands you can't predict tomorrow's
weather you can't predict things like
the course of civilization if you look
at Israel itself it's it's very sharply
split in many ways I mean there's a Arab
there's half roughly half the population
is from the Arab countries half from
Europe there's a very sharp split on
religious lines close to a civil war you
know in fact if you read the Israeli
press as I do regularly you read you can
read stories now in the major press the
leading press warning of the dangers of
a military coup with religious elements
in the officer corps they're concerned
about that they're very sharp the last
elections were very sharp cultures with
and it's hard to predict the outcome in
the Diaspora say in the United States
which I know best there's a very high
level of assimilation but at the very
same time there's a return to something
like slightly fictionalized version of
the 17th and 18th century in Eastern
Europe which is drawing in hundreds of
thousands of people and you find both

global de semana pasado
whereas a multi-modal is a dodgy
non-capitalist a humid an alternative
global is assume we are novel being job
well first of all globalization in
itself is neither good or bad it depends
what form of globalization it is the
kind of globalization that brings people
together around the world is wonderful
I'm all in favor of it the kind of
globalization that transfers power into
the hands of what the business press
sometimes calls the de facto world
government of international financial
institutions that represent
transnational corporations and there are
local affiliates that's bad that's
harmful to all the people in the world
so the question is what form
globalization takes incidentally about
globalization and its inevitability one
has to be rather cautious to distinguish
doctrine from reality
a few measure trade flows or investment
and so on the level of globalization of
the world is not dramatically different
than it's been in the past there are
differences but not dramatic and not in
scale and furthermore most of the
interactions are internal to the rich
developed countries so most of it is
about 75% is internal to Europe Japan
and the United States and it the form
that it takes depends on what people do
it you can have a very constructive form
of globalization in which there's
cultural interchange economic
interchange vital connections developing
among people but or you can have a kind
which is going to turn the world into a
kind of Brazil Brazil is kind of an
extreme case with two radically
different countries one small wealthy
country that's part of the international
elite and another huge country that's
you know somewhere in central Africa
that the world
could turn into that in fact that's
happening in the United States and
Britain and to a lesser extent elsewhere
right now but these are matters that are
under control there's nothing inevitable
about them there are no these are not
laws of nature there are decisions and
human institutions and they can be
changed like all others but what kind of
a world could there be there could be a
world of greater freedom and justice I
have my own views about what it should
be like I think I'm an old-fashioned
anarchist as I was when I was 10 years
old I think the world order ought to be
based on mutual and voluntary
association wherever people are together
that means workers control in the
workplace community control voluntary
associations federal Arrangements among
free freely interacting groups crossing
borders easily there's nothing special
about borders and I think a world like
that is entirely feasible but it means
for the eliminating concentrations of
power right now power is actually
concentrating democracy is declining and
that's something I think that we should
be struggling against but it's not
inevitable and it's not a law of history
and if you look over history it's gone
always there have been victories for
freedom there's been extensions of
democracy there have been contractions
we happen to be in a period of
contraction but that will change as it
has before
sorry my disappear so democracies much
this way that they a woman too with some
attacks they see pressure on all the
best as novices for my sister the
concept of Marxism is one that I find
troublesome in physics for example
there's nothing like Einstein ISM
because Einstein isn't God who you
worship rather he's a human being who
had important things to say and like
every other human being made mistakes no
so you learn from what he had to say and
you disregard his mistakes
now Marxism the concept in my view
belongs to the history of organized
religion
it's it's a kind of worship of an
individual that makes no sense
in if you look at Marx himself and other
people who've been working in that
tradition you learn what's valuable you
disregard what's wrong and then after
that we just go and look so for example
take say socialism Marx had almost
nothing to say about it I mean if you
read I'm not a great works specialist
but as far as I understand and I've read
a fair amount there are a few scattered
sentences and Marx's writings about
socialism
he's a theorist of capitalism he was a
theorist basically of 19th century
capitalism perfectly naturally and he
developed a sort of an abstract model of
the capitalist system and its properties
from which I think there's a lot to
learn how much it and any intelligent
person should read it and learn what you
can from it as you learn from others to
assume that it offers a doctrine for
today is makes no sense I can't imagine
that Marx would have believed that he
also wrote important things about the
contemporary affairs for example about
the British and India
certainly worth reading but if we were
still repeating those things now
civilization had been dead you know we
should have learned something in the
last hundred years so yes there's
contributions as there is from the rest
of our cultural tradition and you learn
from them what's important then you
disregard what's not useful machine i
Brazil Padma for mommy asada
well first of all I think we should be
careful too when we refer to a country
like say India or China or Brazil but we
should recognize that that's a very
high-level abstraction Brazil is not an
entity in the international order nor is
India so in India there's a section
that's developing and there's a huge
sector that's either stagnating or
probably declining actually I was there
not long ago and saw both sides of it
when when you talk about the growth in
India again be cautious when the
neoliberal reforms were instituted and
India there was as almost always a very
sharp decline and collapse that's pretty
regular then there's a recovery from the
collapse so if you read The Wall Street
Journal they'll talk about the wonderful
growth but they'll start from the period
of recovery go back ten years and you
find that the growth during this period
is actually lower than it was before but
it's highly concentrated and it's also
internet it's also a multinational so
India has opened itself to foreign
penetration meaning primarily US
corporations and it's interesting the
way they did it the first thing they did
was take over the advertising industry
so what you see advertised is foreign
goods which undercut purposes to
undercut domestic manufacture to get
people tied to foreign imports now
they're sectors of Indian society
they're benefiting from this living much
better than they did before there are
other sectors that are suffering the
same is true in China China is very
sharply split parts of China are
developing other parts are devastated
enough so that many China scholars fear
possibility of the return to the peasant
Wars of the past period even if you look
at things like just say mortality rates
you find that they that the general
health system improved quite sharply
until about 1979 and it started leveling
off and the most recent statistics I've
seen it's may even be declining that's
parallel to huge
growth you know the yuppies you see on
CNN television and so on and so forth to
different China's how will that affect
the New World Order well it depends what
the world order is if the world order is
run by transnational elites in their own
interest with most of the population
marginalized it will fit fine if it's a
world order based on popular democracy
and freedom and justice it'll break down
the structures of check that are
developing in China and India just as it
will break down the prices in Brazil my

what's NAFTA the North American Free
Trade Agreement it's a protection highly
protectionist agreement instituted by
the United States and associated they'll
eat in Mexico and Canada directed
against the populations of their own
countries all three and also against
Europe and Japan which the the law a
large part of if you look at the NAFTA
long treaty about ten percent of it
consists of where called rules of origin
requirements meaning that after a high
degree of a percentage of production
within the North American area to be
able to export that's just the wet
protectionist weapon against Europe and
Japan the United States would like to
incorporate parts of South America
within a protectionist trade bloc East
Asia has interests in doing the same
thing Europe is doing the same thing I
mean they're all kind on the other hand
these are not just at war I mean the
linkages among the international
corporations in Europe Japan the United
States now also
East Asian growth areas and some in
Brazil they're very tight linkages and
they're transnational so they're lots of
complicated things happening at all at
once but the major tendency right now is
towards transfer of power to private
tyrannies and away from the public
sphere and that's very dangerous it's
happening in particular countries at
different rates it's happening
internationally and I think that's going
to be very harmful to values that we

documents the United States is quite an
open society and one of the good things
about it is you have fairly good access
to the record of secret planning maybe
30 or 40 years ago but sometimes even
pretty reason incidentally I do not
think that u.s. foreign policy changed
dramatically after the Cold War if you
look at say pick any issue middle-east
Cuba
Panama is all the same nothing much
changed that some changes but the
policies were not guided by fear of the
Soviet Union that was a pretext and you
can see it very clearly by the fact that
the policies continued but with a
different pretext so in the case of Cuba
for 30 years the pretext was danger in
the Soviet Union right after the Cold
War what happened the policies get
harsher but now they're because all of a
sudden in the United States
loves democracy so next will be some
other pretext so I don't think the
policies changed with regard to Brazil
we know the record pretty well in the
late 1950s the Eisenhower administration
began to propose a strengthening of the
Latin American military and a shift in
their mission which is largely
determined in the United States it
proposed a shift which was finally it
couldn't be instituted time Congress
wouldn't accept it but it was instituted
under Kennedy in 1962 the Kennedy
administration shifted the mission of
the Latin American military from
hemispheric defense which is kind of a
holdover from World War two to what they
called internal security which is just a
technical term which means war against
their own populations and the Brazilian
military coup in fact shortly after was
one of the first examples of this very
warmly welcomed in the United States
even publicly you don't have to go to
secret documents for that publicly
welcomed by the but was by the Kennedy
people I mean Kennedy had been killed by
then but by his Lincoln Gordon Robert
McNamara the rest greatest victory for
freedom in the mid twentieth century and
so on Brazil is a big country and had a
domino effect it sort of spread through
the hemisphere right into Central
America in the 80s enormous plague of
repression unique in the history of this
very bloody continent and it devastated
many popular organizations it set the
basis for the kinds of policies that are
now being pursued and yes you can trace
it right back to the shift in the in the
mission of the military the Brazilian
military were called an island of sanity
in Brazil and their takeover was very
warmly welcomed the Brazil became what
the business press called the Latin
American darling of the business
community meanwhile and we know enough
to mention what happened to the
population but a sector
and so it remained until a late 1980s
very high growth rate splitting into two
completely separate countries all of
this warmly welcomed in international
financial circles and yes you can trace
it to we don't have the records for
recent years but we have them from the
early 60s and they're pretty clear the
the most important ones I suppose are
from about 1966 they've been available
for some years these are discussions
within the among the Kennedy
intellectuals McNamara was Secretary of
Defense McGeorge Bundy the national
security adviser and they discussed the
developments in Brazil this is two years
after the coup was a great success
they argue that within what they call
the Latin American cultural context it
is necessary for the military the
overthrow civilian governments when in
their judgment the civilian governments
are not acting in the interests of the
nation and the interests of the nation
are then described very explicitly in
terms that you would think come from a
Maoist tract referring quite openly to
the revolutionary struggle for power
among the conflicting classes in Central
America and the need to improve the
investment climate and so on very frank
this internal discussion and the
military takeover had indeed contributed
to that so was warmly welcomed shortly
after you have the overt US support for
the overthrow of the am big government
and then on through the atrocities in
Central America and so on other respect
and none of this had anything to do with
the Russians I mean how many Russians
were there in Brazil in 1964 in fact the
Russian influence in the actually the
Russians were supporting the Argentine
generals they were one of their leading
trading partners of course everything
was for the American population in the
u.s. population the Russian threat was
always wave that's the way control you
control people you frighten them but it
in the United States in reality it's a
joke there's no Russian threat in the
Western Hemisphere the Russians were
much more threatened in Western Europe
in the United States was in Western

car Amazonia knows his massage the when
we talk about intellectuals
it's like talking about countries we
have to distinguish there are those who
are called the responsible intellectuals
namely the ones who more or less serve
power and there are those who are the
dissident intellectuals who are outside
the framework of the power system and
don't serve it their intellectuals of
all kinds there there have been as far
as recorded history goes go back to the
Bible we find the same distinction the
those in recent years it's hard to say
there's been a big change in the United
States since the 1960s there was a
large-scale cultural change the ferment
of the 1960's led to subsist a change in
the general society freeing up of the
society so there's a lot it's a much
more open society than it was say 40
years ago there's much more concern for
issues of racial oppression of right the
rights of women became an issue
environmental issues solidarity with the
third world all of these things changed
and they've affected the whole country
in fact activism was greater in the
1980s and it was in the 1960s and much
more deeply rooted in American society
and among the people involved in this
are those who you call intellectuals
what does that mean that means people
who are privileged enough to be able to
devote a substantial part of their
effort
to the work of the mind and for some of
them that means to working with people
who are struggling for a better life for
freedom for human rights for others have
been serving power so it's always been
so but but the society is different and
in many ways much more healthy Co

I'm sorry a Tamika judge Cassius
podriamos a capitalist would you consume
for just a McClurg was pressed was the
last appeal for example Italian food
regime is more crotch because people
feel socially first of all there was
never anything remotely like socialism
in Eastern Europe in Eastern Europe the
countries called themselves socialist
and democratic remember these were
people's democracies the West ridiculed
the claim to democracy but it loved the
claim the socialism because that's a way
of defaming socialism but in fact they
were about as socialist as they were
democratic I don't think that the
driving factor in Eastern Europe was a
search for consumption in fact
consumption levels have reduced very
sharply in Eastern Europe since the end
of the Cold War the search was for
freedom which is fine they were
struggling for freedom and democracy
they got what they got was a return to
the third world and most parts of it but
and as for the first part of your
comment yes I think that what's called
neoliberalism it is an attack on
democracy and is an open attack of
democracy it's not secret the goal is to
minimize the state and if you minimize
the state you're maximizing something
else what is the thing that you're
maximizing well private tyranny the
state is the arena within which the
public has some role at least in
principle
determining policy in the private sector
has no role so the more that the public
arena is minimized and private power is
maximized the less you have democracy
now personally in my view the state is
an illegitimate institution should be
dismantled but not as long as private
power is there because that's much worse
that's a system which is unaccountable
to the public and the main thrust of
neoliberalism is precisely that it's to
restrict the arena within which the
public can make some difference another
cassotto point okay so for a point my
suggestion is to extend the public arena
and in in the classic fashion namely as
I said before working people should have
control of the places in which they work
not private tyrants the people of a
community should have control of their
community and they should interact with
one another that increases the public's
fear if the heavy concentration of
private power is eliminated then I think
moves towards dismantling the entire
state system are entirely legitimate
proper but you face what the world that
you're in right now incidentally these
neoliberal moves are not moves towards
establishing a market system a private
corporation is outside the market system
if you look at world trade you know
about take say the United States about
half of US trade is not trade at all
it's just transactions internal to a
corporation run by a very visible hand
and which just happened to cross borders
so half of US exports to Mexico don't
even enter the Mexican economy they're
just thing parts are being assembled in
the United States transferred to Mexico
through another branch of say the same
Ford Motor Company
it's called exports they come back to
the United States called import that's
not trade that's mercantilism and that's
huge part of world trade
corporate mercantilism in which that the
market is functioning only at the
margins and functioning mostly to
control people the the the ones who are
running the world economy have protected
themselves very strongly from market
discipline in fact if you look at the
top there are some good studies by good
economists of transnational corporations
and there's one major study by two
British Economist's of the top 100
transnational corporations every one of
them has benefited from the
interventionist policies of its own of
its home government and 20 of the
hundred have been saved from complete
collapse by state takeover and bailout
over and above that the corporation
itself is out of the market system its
internal transactions are central
centrally directed these are command
economies so you have a the neoliberal
system is an attack in my view both on
the market and on democracy so this kept
aside to do key submission on TaylorMade
opinion public amazing for madam I also
do da da da dee Alma deteriorate as no
democracy adduced also needs make a
possible the total immensity advanced in
its not of llamada tariffs on democratic
well world to complicated place there's
there's a very clear class struggle
those who control who own and direct the
society and manage it would like
naturally fear democracy and they'll use
what measures they can to restrict it
one measure is restricting the public
arena another measure is massive
propaganda the United States has a huge
public relations industry which for most
of this century has been dedicated to
what its own leaders call controlling
the public mind on the principle that
the mind of the public can be regimented
as much as an army regiments the bodies
of soldiers and the reason is as they
frankly say to one another quoting in
fact that the hazard facing in dust
realists is the growing political power
of the masses so that has to be
contained you can't contain it very much
by force in the United States it's
become a free society so you control it
by propaganda by narrowing the public
arena by treaty arrangements which like
NAFTA for example which take many
decisions out of the public arena on the
other hand there's public there's
popular forces struggling to increase
democracies so the usual conflicts been
going on for centuries going on right
now it goes up and back in in the 1950s
for example they were also declaring the
end of history then called the end of
ideology it's all over we've got
everything under control
everybody's a passive consumer nobody
thinks anymore well a few years later
the country was in an uproar you know
that's happened over and over again in
the past and I think it's now happening
right now so for example the labor
movement which was under very severe
attack actually criminal attack in the
1980s is now reviving it's recognizing
that the one-sided class war is going to
lead the destruction and we can't tell

good question Jana has paid to this
dispossessed oh well first to be clear I
think that the pub that the public arena
is now shrinking and I'd like to see it
develop so the the minimization of the
state is shrinking the public arena
because of the extension of private
power now as far as the media are
concerned the the major media in the
world say the United States or Brazil
are private corporations and they're
simply part of the private corporate
system they are very closely linked to
other their huge corporations they're
linked to even bigger ones in the United
States the take a look at the major
television channels they're parts of
huge mega-corporations closely linked
the state power the individuals who are
at the high levels the management levels
move very easily between the executive
suite and state management and the
editorial board room and their interests
are approximately the same and they
present a picture of the world that
reflects their interests they have
certain goals the goals are not hard to
determine from the structure of the
institution they want to protect the
Nexus of state private power that they
represent that requires different modes
for different audiences for a large part
of the audience that means simply
marginalizing them for the media the and
its managers I think the social ideal
the ideal they'd like to reach there's a
society in which the social unit
consists of a person and the television
sit no other associations because other
interactions among humans are dangerous
they might lead to democratic
participation but if you can the more
you can approach the ideal of a society
based on the person than the television
set the more you can do that the more
you're free to have formal political
democracy without the concern that it
might mean something because then the
people will become passive consumers and
obedient workers and separated from one
another and civil society will collapse
now for the educated elites the media
have a different function for them it's
basically indoctrination making sure
they have the right thoughts in their
mind these are people who make decisions
and have to make the right decisions for
those in power within that framework I
think you can explain a lot of what the
media do maybe you'll be able to join at
least a mm-hm
well I should say that I have quite a
number of personal friends in the media
some in free high places in the media
many of whom were much more cynical
about the media than I am as a result of
their own experiences and they see their
role as trying to work within the
institutional structures to do what they
can and there's a lot that you can do
these are not military dictatorships
you're not going to be tortured and
killed if you say the wrong thing you
may lose your job but that's a small
problem and people work within them to
press their openings to the limits often
doing very important things others are
subordinated to the system there are
many journalists well-known journalists
and privileged positions who consider
themselves to be perfectly free rightly
they'll tell you look nobody tells me
what to write and that's true because
they are so trustworthy that no one
needs to tell them what to write
they've already internalized the values
so completely that they can't even think
other thoughts so fine they are
completely free others who are more
independent are less free and are
continually struggling against the
limits that powerful systems impose the
for the independent journalists the goal
is that of any other decent human being
try to do what you can to help people
inform themselves work together for
human rights whatever your values happen
to be a proposed Odessa Keystone so
testability stuck in a media brazilian
service in chile is his be perfectly
happy to talk to anybody whether it's
the national television audience or
people in the in a shanty town you know
which i've done also it's my own
personal experience is not too
surprising i have much more exposure
outside the united states than inside
and part of the reason is views of the
kind that i express are not much of a
threat outside the United States
it's much more of a threat inside so as
soon as I cross the border I talked
television and on national television
and so on but not inside
in fact the commercial actually
commercial television in the United
States surprisingly there's a little bit
more free than public television that's
interesting even though public
television has the reputation of being
more liberal in the American sense of
the word meaning more progressive but
that just means that they're more
doctrinaire they are cultural
commissaries they understand better the
amounts of discussion and they see
themselves at the dissident extreme you
can go this far but no further actually
public television is on record in the
United States even in print as saying
they will not allow me personally to
appear on the major news and discussion
program it's unusual to make such
statements in print but it's
understandable in fact in my view the
this article that you mentioned about
the responsibilities of intellectuals
was primarily a critique against the
sort of progressive end of the spectrum
what's called liberal in the United
States I didn't talk much about the
right wing because in my view they are
the real cultural connoisseurs I mean
they are the ones who are setting the
limits they act with a certain kind of
dissidents but a dissidents that
presupposes the doctrines of power and
therefore helps instill them better and
the smarter ones understand that and
don't want to have anything that goes a
little bit the critical side so this is
the way institutions function it
shouldn't surprise me to media since a

the media should be involved popular
participation actually that exists the
model exists I actually saw a piece of
it interesting piece of it in the URI a
couple days ago when I went out to the
suburbs to Nova iguacu and watch popular
television there's a an NGO that
provides equipment mainly and some
technical support for popular groups
that do their own television they write
the scripts they show the programs they
act the people gather in a public square
and watch it they discuss it and so on
well that's form of public media in the
United States communities there's a
fairly substantial network of community
supported radio that means small usually
small radio stations though they can
extend over a whole fairly city which
are supported by the public they don't
have advertising and they integrate the
community you can tell the do I travel a
lot because I give many talks all over
and you can just feel the difference in
a community that has community radio and
one that doesn't there's a kind of
integration you know people know about
each other they know what's happening
they they they even participate and it
gives a kind of liveliness and vitality
and vision to the community that you
find lacking when people are separated
from one another
well that's democratic media and of
course it's on a rail at the moment it
happens to be in a relatively small
scale but we should bear in mind that
not too far back in the past it was not
a very large scale so even in the United
States which is a highly indoctrinated
society with a powerful propaganda
system it's a real business run society
very free but business run even in the
United States in the 1950s there were
about 800 labour newspapers independent
labor newspapers which reached about 30
million people a week you go back to the
early part of this century the popular
media
based in ethnic communities or
working-class papers or others
we're virtually on the scale of the
commercial press in England that
continued until the 1960s the major
newspaper in England The Daily Herald
was had more subscribers in the which
was kind of social-democratic had more
subscribers in the 1960s than the other
than that time as the Guardian you know
the other major newspapers combined it
was simply overwhelmed by concentration
of capital resources and incidentally
the tabloids in England that you know
the real mass media they were kind of
labor oriented I mean a lot of nonsense
you know but labor oriented all this
these media gave a picture of the world
that's quite different from the one
that's that's oriented to the interests
and concerns of ordinary people and it
was a different country then when this
collapsed under the print not under
force you know but under the pressure of
concentration of capital resources that
the tenor of the country changed you can
see the changes that's the sort of
background for Thatcherism well that's
not far in the past we're not talking
about some unimaginable utopia but
things that exist in part and have
existed in larger scale before and can
be created again in fact the new
telecommunications opportunities are
offering ways to are sometimes being
used to create them sometimes very
effectively take say the last Nobel
Peace Prize that was just announced a
few days ago Jersey aromas worked I was
here a couple days ago wanted this issue
the Timor issue has been a major human
human rights issue for 20 years but it's
only come into the public arena in the
last two or three years despite many
efforts in which I've been involved -
that's largely due to the internet it
offered ways of getting information to
people around the major corporate media
which
organize people and reach the point
where in the United States there was
enough pressure on Congress to impose
restrictions on military sales the
Clinton administration didn't observe
the restrictions it had to evade them in
some fashion but that's nevertheless
important and in the nation generals
take notice when things happen in the
United States well that's new technology
there and a democratic media can be
reconstructive and in fact like any
other system of private tyranny of
tyranny whether it's military
dictatorships or totalitarian rule or
private corporations it can be eroded
and eliminated these are not again laws
of nature just human institutions
professor Chomsky yo Pina also thinks so
maintain that it's the same the
technology itself is completely neutral
it doesn't care whether it's used to
dominate and control people or to
liberate people you could say the same
but the print me the print technology
radio television or the internet not the
question of what it becomes depends on
what people do with it actually
something very to be the internet itself
like all of the modern dynamic parts of
the economy was create was created by
the public at the public expense so it
should be owned by the people who built
it
that's taxpayers the major legislation
of the last year in the United States
Congress handed over this whole publicly
created system to private mega
corporations that's what happened with
radio back around 1930 when the the free
public spectrum was handed over to
private corporations happened with
television about 1950 there's an effort
now just passed in the legislation to
commercialize the telecommunication
system which was all created at public
expense that's who put up the satellites
that's who paid for the computers that's
who
you know developed a technology and so
on whether that'll succeed or not we
don't know there's a lot of resistance
to it there are lots of popular efforts
to maintain the Internet as a system
that is to which there's free public
access and to which the which the public
segments of the public can use for their
own interests and purposes the major
corporations are quite open about what
they would like to see they would like
it to be a kind of home shopping service
technique another technique of
marginalization and isolation and
atomization and control but they don't
have to succeed any more than they had
to succeed in the case of radio or
television or print for that matter so
the internet will become with people
make of it it has a lot of positive
aspects it has some negative aspects to
the communication through the internet
does establish contacts among people who
otherwise would be isolated but it also
isolates people we're human beings we're
not Martians and there's a big
difference between face-to-face contact
and you know punching Keys and somebody
else punches keys and that has psychic
effects which I personally am a little
bit skeptical about so like most
technology it has a lot of facets to it

intellectual in power should act to

and it doesn't happen very much but
people sometimes asked me what I would
do if I were elected president and what
I say is well the first thing I would do
is establish a war crimes tribunal to
try me for the were crimes I'm going to
commit and the next thing I ought to do
is get rid of my own power and put it in
public hands now that's not done very
much event commands criticisms of course
quite right like very old the first
expression of it that I'm familiar with
is by bakunin back in the mid 19th
century when he predicted that the
rising class of what he called
scientific intelligentsia you know the
intellectuals of the modern age would go
in two directions some he said would try
to use popular struggles say working
class struggles to gain power for
themselves they would become he says the
red bureaucracy which will create the
most brutal totalitarian regimes ever
known others he said will recognize that
power lies elsewhere and what we today
would call the state capitalist
institutions and they'll become the
managers for those with real power they
will as he put it they will beat the
people with the people's stick in the
state capitalist democracies yeah that's
a pretty good it was a pretty good
prediction then there's another group of
intellectuals who usually wanting to be
called intellectuals just people who are
thinking who are working with popular
organizations
who are struggling against power who are
trying to diffuse it who are interested
in human rights and democracy and social
justice and doing something about it
and that's another group of
intellectuals they need not have a high
education incidentally I mean I've known
people who work with their hands who do
much more creative intellectual work
than many people in university offices
whether you're an intellectual or not
doesn't correlate with your position and
I think as I mentioned before the mayor
and even from childhood one of the most
lively intellectual circles I've ever
been part of consisted of working people
some of whom had never gone through
primary education but were very had a
very live intellectual life same is true
of many others those of us who are you
know wear jackets and ties and look nice
you know we're wealthy basically we're
part of the wealthy classes we have
privileges and if you have more
privileges you have more
responsibilities and the question of how
you exercise those responsibilities is a
personal choice no Paco necesito mas que

at the Media Lab at MIT is no different
than the telecommunication system
generally there are people involved in
it who are genuine and genuinely
committed to making the new
telecommunications media accessible and
available to the general public as a
method of democratizing the media
increasing information flow allowing
people to express themselves to
communicate with one another and so on
there are others who are committed to
making it a system of control and
domination and it's this it's in
microcosm you have there the conflict
that's expanding the extending over the
whole society right now the Internet is
an elite phenomenon I mean the
overwhelming majority of the world's
population doesn't even have a telephone
the number who have internet
communication is very limited
they're usually part of wealthy powerful
institutions and if you try to do it on
your own it's quite expensive in
principle it could be democratized the
technology is there but I just mentioned
the Telecommunications Act of 1995
that's a major legislative instrument
instrument designed to prevent the
democratization of the Internet by
handing control over from the public
institutions to the private make it
corporations it was kind of interesting
that in the United States here's an
example of how the media function this
was not treated as a public affairs
issue it was treated as a business issue
so you're read about the
Telecommunications Act on the business
pages of course it's a major public
affairs issue but the framework of
thinking is supposed to be it's got to
be commercialized because that's the
only option the idea that it should be
under public control isn't even an
option so we don't write about it on the
front page we put it on the business
pages the only issue was how will it be
commercialized well those are some of
the ways in which the propaganda
institutions which is the doctrinal
institutions shape options shape
thinking so that the major problems
aren't even visible to people very few
people know
this happened or are aware that there
were other opportunities and the you
mentioned the Media Lab there are people
there who know there are people there
who were in favor of it you find both

comes to Brazil it'll be because you
have good golf courses he'll have a
welcoming committee which wants to
discuss with him the best ways to
establish control of the subordination
of the Brazilian economy to
transnational corporations that's why
I'll come to Brazil I may say some nice
words but he's a representative of the
business community he's not an extreme
right winger he's sort of a moderate
Republican roughly Eisenhower Republican
more or less in virtually
indistinguishable from his opponent in
the last election what should Brazilians
do well it's not their government that's
going to do it I don't have to tell you
that what Brazilians ought to do is
overcome the the scandal of Brazilian
society which goes way back and as part
of a major Latin American scandal
altogether a much more exaggerated form
of what we find all over the world the
state is subordinated to the rich who
have very limited social
responsibilities the country is
radically divided I'm not saying
anything that everyone doesn't know
better than I do most of the population
is simply out of the modern sector that
scandalous Brazil is a rich country as
an enormous resources throughout this
whole century it's been called the
Colossus of the south
which ought to be you know counterpart
to the Colossus of the north if it isn't
that way that's a problem that has
arisen from internal to Brazil of course
supported by external factors like us
backing for the military coup but the
fundamental roots of it are right here
and unless they are overcome internally
it'll just get worse and worse and
obviously the answers are not going to
come from the owners of the corporations
or the leaders of the pollute of you
know the people in the government are
certainly from President Clinton they're
going to come from people within Brazil
struggling to overcome these horrendous
situations I mean the fact that Brazil
after 20 years of some of the highest
growth rates in the world
roughly 1970 to 1990 much higher than
Chile the fact that after this it was
ranked in the UN Development Report next
to Albania that would scandalize
Brazilians and including what it
represents whatever it presents is a
disaster for most of the population
which is particularly dramatic because
this is not Central Africa the resources
are there the human resources are there
the material resources are there it's it
makes the failure to realize the
potential even more dramatic than it
would be in a country that suffering
real limitations as many are Sophie no
solution Luther in the heat condos
I read his work when he was a
sociologist and found it quite
interesting and enlightening that was
some years ago now he's plays a
different institutional role within the
framework of a system of power that
either doesn't feel free to challenge or
doesn't want a challenge you have to ask
him that I can't say but the system of
power itself is a very ugly one so just
to take one example the the policies of
Brazil are very sharply constrained by
debt payment
well the people of Brazil should not
tolerate this I mean if I borrow with
regard to the debt and all aspects of
pretty Brazilian policy are constrained
by this limit now with regard to the
debt there's two options either you pay
it or you don't pay it I think it's
perfectly reasonable not to pay it it's
been paid over and over again but
suppose that you decide to pay it well
if I borrow money and spend it gambling
is it your responsibility to pay it no
my responsibility to pay it
that means the Brazilian debt if it's
going to be paid should be paid by the
people who borrowed it
are they the people living in the
favelas around Rio
they didn't borrow the money they didn't
get anything from it the money was given
to the wealthy in Brazil most of whom
sent it abroad and enriched themselves
final attempt aid but the generals and
the wealthy faith it's not the problem
for the people of Brazil now if the
government of Brazil is unable to face
that issue or to put it more accurately
if the population doesn't compel it to
face that issue Brazil has very few
options and a person who sits in the
presidents chairs has very few options

president Cardozo's hands they're in the
hands of the people of Brazil he as a
person that can't do very much the
constraints are very narrow with regard
to multinational corporations or
corporations in general in my view our
attitude should be the same as it is to
other forms of tyranny in fact if you
look at the history of corporations it's
quite interesting there there's good
academic studies by legal historians and
others about the rise of corporations
and it's an interesting history worth
studying the the modern corporation I'm
speaking now of the United States
primarily
but it's not very different elsewhere
the in the United States the modern
corporation was created by courts and
lawyers not by legislations if you go
back to classical liberals like Thomas
Jefferson
they were strongly opposed to
corporations in fact early in history
corporations were public interest groups
so people would get together to form a
corporation to build a bridge let's say
at some point in the 19th century early
19th century they began to change
Jefferson for example the leading
classical liberal in US history back
around the 1820 warned that woody woody
the the the rise of financial
institutions and manufacturing
corporations would mean the end of
democracy de Tocqueville said the same
thing
the Tocqueville winning another great
figure of classical liberalism when he
described the United States in the 1830s
he warned that the manufacturing
aristocracy which is arising before our
eyes that's 170 years ago is the
harshest in the world and if they ever
get power that'll be the end of American
democracy as well through the century
through the century they got power they
didn't get it from legislation they got
it mostly from the courts they got the
Rights of Persons
they got the right of free speech you
know they got the individual rights by
the early 20th century they were huge
institutions and dominating the society
not by popular will quite the contrary
if you look at their intellectual roots
they're very similar to the intellectual
roots of Bolshevism and fascism they
come out of Hegelian ideas that
developed in the late 19th century about
the the rights of big institutions over
individuals very similar roots that's
why you often had progressives
supporting corporations same
progressives who are supporting what
became Bolshevism back in the early 20th
century and in fact that's not
inaccurate a corporation is a
totalitarian structure orders go from
the top to the bottom you insert
yourself in it and you take your orders
from above
you hand them down below at the very top
it's a integrated sector of owners and
investors banks financial institutions
and so on but really as close to the
totalitarian ideal as humans have
constructed if you're outside it you
have the only choice you have is to rate
yourself to it which is called getting a
job or to buy what it produces that's
information if it's media corporations
well and these are not small islands in
a free market see these are huge
tyrannies now very closely interlocked
with one another tied to the states that
they largely control integrated across
boundaries the attitude toward them
should be the same as to other forms of
tyranny fascism was overthrown
Bolshevism was overthrown corporate

well you know popular movements can take

social groups can struggle for freedom
or can create be a popular base for
fascism it be in the that's true of
lepen I mean take say Hitler Hitler was
a very popular leader maybe the most
popular leader in Germany's history the
popular base for Hitler was in part you
know so it wasn't just industrialists it
was social movements which could have
been struggling for in other
circumstances where
the most militant labor movement in
Europe taking the United States right
now the people who are in the right-wing
militias as they call them you take a
look at those people they are the same
people who are organizing the CIO 60
years ago they're coming from the same
socio-economic sector there they have
the same kinds of problems their lives
are collapsing their wages are
disappearing the world's falling apart
and not the 1930s they created the
American labor movement and won many
rights an advanced freedom in the 1990s
they are a right-wing populist movement
which is very dangerous it is under the
control of fanatical leaders many of
them religious fanatics same popular
groups and they have as in it's the same
story as in all human affairs how they
develop depends on what they do
themselves and what others do others who
like us were more privileged to interact
with them that's always been the case
it's still the case yes the popular
groups and could be a source of very

try to keep specialists oh well I'm
perfectly happy to recommend very
practical solutions and that's what I do
in the United States all the time but I
don't feel free to recommend actions to
you that's for you to decide I do it
where I live you know the brazils role
in this affair could be enormous in fact
you can see how enormous it can be by
just looking at the history to the
extent that people like josee have been
able to do things it's because that he
had support of governments which
government mozambique
you know santo may I mean governments of
that scale he didn't have the support of
Brazil within the Portuguese world
former Portuguese world the Brazil is
obviously vastly more powerful the kind
of support that Mozambique gave Brazil
could have given a hundred times that
much support that means creating
international forums helping put the
issue on the international agenda
gaining publicity and participating in
economic pressures he has his own ideas
about what's the right thing to do I
have mine in my feeling my feeling is
that the Indonesian generals are on the
brink of a decision about this they
could go either either way one of the
foreign minister two or three years ago
when public opinion was growing said
publicly that East Timor is a pebble in
our shoe maybe we ought to get rid of it
the implication is maybe we got to get
rid of it it's causing us too much
trouble The Wall Street Journal which is
not a very progressive newspaper had an
editorial called something like a pebble
in air in their shoe in the Indonesian
generals look it's not worth it get rid
of it it's just
causing in trouble just this last week
the Far Eastern Economic Review
you know the major Asian economic
journal had a interviews with top
executives I haven't seen it yet I was
away but sure they're almost worth that
told me about it so there's a second
hand he told me that overwhelmingly
they were recommending to Indonesia to
get rid of the pebble
well pressure makes a difference now the
kinds of pressure that come from Brazil
are different than those that come from
the United States the ones that come
from the United States are obviously
more important it's the world dominant
power so we do it in our way but those
that come from Brazil are not small
whether they're threats about economic
cooperation political threats public
demonstrations you really have to decide
judging by the Brazilian context
socialism acontecimientos nice long

susceptor puto Cubano segunda Mandar to
the Bill Clinton budget experienced
significant economic again the decision
is in the hands of the people of the
United States and other countries in the
world if the United States has it after
the fall of the Soviet Union when you
could no longer pretend that there was a
Soviet threat the sanctions against Cuba
got harsher and the effort to strangle
Cuba increased intensity just increased
again last year well at the moment most
of the world is at least rhetorically
objecting
so there are rhetorical objections to
this that is moves to break the the u.s.
boycott now if those moves succeed if
other countries begin to trade with Cuba
you'll see exactly what happened with
Vietnam in the case of Vietnam after the
Vietnam War the United States tried to
strangle Vietnam - it had already won
the war
my opinion in the China was more or less
destroyed but I wanted to make sure that
it didn't revive so there was an
economic stranglehold and it lasted
until other countries just started
disobeying so after most countries obey
what the United States says it's a
powerful dangerous country but after a
while Japan just stopped paying
attention and European companies stopped
paying attention they began to trade
with Vietnam to set up business offices
well at that point American business
started complaining they're being cut
out of important markets and all of a
sudden you know actually over a short
period of time at US government policy
changed it suddenly discovered that the
human rights situation is improving in
Vietnam so therefore we can deal with it
actually nothing had changed except that
economic rivals were beginning to move
in and American business was complaining
that's beginning to happen in Cuba in
Castro's last visit to New York he was I
mean the government wouldn't mean
through them the media denounced him you
know bitter attacks except for one thing
David Rockefeller organized a meeting of
leading industrialists to minute because
the American business world doesn't like
the fact that Mexico is starting to
become involved in the you know
telephone business and Europe is trading
and so on no there aren't Cuba and
Vietnam are not the same kind of thing
you know Vietnam most people in the
United States never heard of Cuba has
been the leading foreign policy issue
for a hundred and seventy years back in
the 1820s the United States was
committed itself to conquer Cuba and I
should say that was the nice people that
was Thomas Jefferson and so on who said
yes we've got to incorporate Cuba and
our empire so they couldn't do it then
because of the British fleet not the
Russians but the British by the end of
the century power had shifted and they
could do it and they did in the under
the pretext of liberating Cuba the
United States joined the Cuban
Liberation and conquered Cuba and sin
from then until 1959 I was basically a
u.s. plantation itself it's a
deep-seated issue in the United States
to reintegrate Cuba to subordinate Cuba
once again to the u.s. system on top of
that the United States elites are very
much concerned not about lack of
democracy in Cuba they don't care one
way or another about lack of democracy
what they care about is the social
standards that have been achieved has
very high health standards very high
wealth educational standards in fact
unique in the Americas it's roughly at
the level of Canada in the United States
which is pretty remarkable under the
circumstances it's a poorer country and
not only poor country but it's under
attack by the hemispheric superpower and
nevertheless it's maintained the
standards and that's dangerous because
it sends the wrong message tells people
look you can do something about your own
lives and that's very dangerous thing
for people to think about so there are
many reasons why the United States wants
to ensure that Cuba does not pursue an
independent path and it won't be easy to
overcome but the major question I think
is roughly the same as Vietnam if other
countries break the boycott and enough
popular protest develops inside the
United States policy oh nos
programa esta Segundo now every salvo
boostedgt Mose McCurry is that what can
occur is that so for donors which muscle
East North America and actually I did it
was the day before I left for South
America in my view it's a decision of
sort of tenth-rate importance but not of
no importance the two political parties
are more or less identical but they have
different constituencies for historical
reasons so the Demick the people who
vote democratic tend to be lower income
minorities women and so on the people
who vote Republican tend to be richer
religious fundamentalists
you know just the racists you know other
sectors of the population now any system
whether it's a tyranny or a democracy is
going to have to respect the rulers are
gonna have to respond to their
constituency so you know Brazilian
generals had to pay some attention to
what's going on in the society when you
have a political democracy like the
United States with basically one party
and two factions they throw crumbs to
their constituencies they follow the
basic policies the same way but they do
something for their constituents and
they do different things now that makes
a difference it doesn't change the world
you know but it makes a big difference
if a seven-year-old child has some
foodie so I think that's a reason for
voting one way or another into any way I
split my vote
so I'll sometimes vote for Republican
sometimes for Democrats but mainly on
the basis of considerations like that
