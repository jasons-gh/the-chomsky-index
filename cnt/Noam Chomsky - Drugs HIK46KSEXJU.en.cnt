so once I take that cocaine and silica
so grainy too but that's it's a habit
it's not a crime shouldn't be a crime in
a civilized haven't having a pack of
cigarette that's going to kill people
too in fact it kills our what more
people enjoy painting can of beer can of
beer is far more lethal behind a car
than cocaine so in fact the matter is
that having a having a substance should
not be considered a crime because so far
it's different if you want to talk about
distributing substances that are lethal
yeah that already been brought up but
then let's be serious tobacco is far
ahead of anything else
alcohol is second hard drugs are way
down the bottom and furthermore most
drug use though it's very harmful for
the person has very little social effect
the crime associated with hard drugs is
mostly the criminals it is mostly a
consequence criminalization if the but
if the principle is let's not so let's
not get lethal substances out to the
public the first one you go after is
tobacco the next one you do after is
alcohol way down the list you get the
cocaine and sort of invisibly low you
get the marijuana
it comes from purchasing coke and
selling coke but that's because it's
illegal that's because of the
criminalization of it that's because of
the criminalization not the effect if
there are good studies of this the
consequence of tobacco doesn't happen
because you know violence but alcohol
definitely does the deaths from out that
are alcohol-related all
way beyond the deaths that are hard
drug-related if you separate in the hard
drug case the less that are the result
of criminalization so yeah when you have
drug gangs and narco traffickers
fighting for turf and so I'm sure then
there's going to be plenty of killings
just like when you had the Al Capone
running Chicago but that's a consequence
of the criminalization not the drugs
what drugs tend to do is make people
passive alcohol on the other hand makes
them violent and there are extensive
studies in the in the criminology
literature and you can take a look at
the results the basic result is that
death tobacco related deaths are way
beyond anything else just an order of
magnitude greater furthermore those are
not just to the user they're to
everybody else so deaths from passive
smoking alone are much higher than
drug-related deaths from passive smoking
now furthermore they're transferred on
to the next generation alcohol is the
next biggest killer and it's a killer
ignore any because people use it which
is bad enough but also to others because
of its relation to violence then comes
next is things like hard drugs and they
are rarely harmful to others they're
harmful to the user when you get down to
marijuana last time I looked there had
been about 60 million users and not one
known type of overdose
I mean it's not good for you undoubtedly
but it's probably at the level of coffee
you know it and in fact notice that
there has never been a medical reason
for criminalizing marijuana I look
through the history of this if you're
interested I don't know if you want me
to run through it but it's an
interesting history marijuana marijuana
was criminalized to very commonly
substances are criminalized because they
were associated with what we're called
that which what are called the dangerous
classes you know for people or working
people so for example in England in the
nineteen
century there was a period when gin was
criminalized and whiskey wasn't because
gin is what poor people drink that's
kind of like the sentencing for crack
and powder when in the early stages of
prohibition in the United States one of
the targets was immigrant immigrant
workers you know these guys hanging
around the saloons in New York got to go
after them the rich guys in upstate New
York
they were going to drink no matter what
you know they want to come home after
work drink but go after those guys
what about marijuana and there are a lot
of running by Mexicans and the first
criminalization of marijuana was in the
southwest in the States it was in New
Mexico later Utah and so on and it was
specifically targeted against Mexicans
it didn't get criminalized in the United
States until shortly after prohibition
ended after prohibition ended we had
this huge Bureau of Narcotics and that
do something so they discovered you know
that marijuana is gonna do what kind of
horrible things to you the Senate
testimony about this is mind-boggling
there was the there was they did have a
representative the American Medical
Association who said we don't have any
medical evidence about him about this he
was shut up right away then they found
somebody else this is literally true
they found a pharmacologist the guy
teaching at Temple University who was
using Merrill who was doing experiments
with marijuana and dogs and they brought
this guy in to test the testimony so
Larry they brought this guy and he
testified that when he gave marijuana
the dogs they went insane and then the
son senator or somebody asked him disc
from memories is probably lost but
something like this as in the 30s they
asked the guy well have you ever tried
marijuana on humans so he said yeah I
tried it on himself and he said well
what happened he said I turned into a
vulture I started flying around the room
so they this stuff is terrible it makes
people insane and marijuana it was
declared by Congress that marijuana
makes people in the same but then
something happened it turned out that
lawyers defense lawyers got the idea
okay I can use this for an insanity
defense so if a guy was found you know
who killed three cops his lawyer would
say well you know he had a he had
marijuana before so he was insane so do
anything and people were getting off on
charges
you know like top killing for example
I've begun on the claim that they had
marijuana so all of a sudden was
discovered the marijuana doesn't make
you insane Congress decides sorry
doesn't make you insane because we want
to wipe that out the next idea was
marijuana is an entry drug it's the drug
you take and then you go on to something
else well there was never any evidence
for that but that was decided and then
in the early fifties something else
happened
marijuana is being brought in here by
Red Chinese to poison the American
population and destroy us you know so
therefore we got to stop marijuana and
it kind of goes on like this after the
peak of marijuana use was as I said in
the 70s but that was rich kids so you
don't throw them in jail and then it got
seriously criminalized you know you
really throw people in jail for it when
it was poor people and that's roughly
the history the detailed history is
quite interesting
