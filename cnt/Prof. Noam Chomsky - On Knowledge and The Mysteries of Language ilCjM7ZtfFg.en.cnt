knowledge is something we seek to attain
to we hope to gain understanding of the
things around us ourselves the the way
the world works societies the more we
succeed in gaining some level of
understanding the more we approach some
ideal which the ideal would be certainty
we know we're not going to attain that
at least in empirical domains but to the
extent that we think we're approaching
it we give it the honorific theorem
knowledge but there's no way of
answering what knowledge is it's what we
hope to attain and the weekend or near
perk
well take that gentleman up there who's
looking at you greatest philosopher of
the twentieth century in my view now he
pointed out that what we're most
confident of is our own experience not
so for example my seeing a person out
there of course that's fallible because
there are all kind of factors that might
enter into distorting our experience but
that's our highest level of confidence
the next level of confidence he said is
experience of others who we trust and
the lowest level is the most important
namely the constructions that our minds
develop to try to account for the
experiences that are available to us the
experiences might be say meter readings
or what I observe about the way my
children are growing up whatever it is
so what we know is the what we know to
an extent always is the explanations
that our minds can construct is usually
reflexively like in in a physics
department it's cooperative and explicit
but for the most part it's just a
reflexive interpretation that's what we
call what we know
well the is a classic answer to that
know thyself figure out who you are how
you can act appropriately what you can
do that's decent and honorable in the
world that's always a goal then no other
people no Society figure out how the
human beings function that leads all the
way to my own professional work which is
in a particular area of core area of
human mental capacities namely what you
and I are now doing using language
that's pretty much what makes us human
if anything does and there's last 67
years lots been learned about it but
there are incredible mysteries that are
still tirely over so I more we can do
the way at those the better all feel
we're approaching a real understanding
well one of the greatest mysteries is
discussed particularly by Descartes in
fact the core of Cartesian philosophy is
how you and I can do what we're now
doing humans have a kind of a creative
capacity every human being sort of
extreme pathology is capable of
constructing in their minds producing
interpreting understanding and an
infinite array of possible expressions
the production is apparently and can be
independent of external stimuli like I
could right now start talking to you
about why the Boston Red Sox don't win
games or something like that it's but
also it seems to be independent of any
detectable internal stimulation so it's
free in a critical sense it's creative
in that this production is not it's not
caused by circumstances but it's
appropriate through them which is a big
difference and it's intelligible to
others who recognize they could have
done the same thing they could have
expressed the same thoughts and this is
a kind of a core human capacity where it
comes from how it works nobody knows
