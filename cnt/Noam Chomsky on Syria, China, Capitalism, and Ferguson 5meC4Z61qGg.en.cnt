Hi I'm Laura Flanders - this week on the show, none other than professor, author, intellectual extraordinaire Noam Chomsky
on everything from Iraq, to Ferguson, to China and trade.
And a sneak peak at a documentary on a workers' struggle that won.
It's all coming up, right here, welcome to the show
[music playing]
It's hard to find anyone on the U.S. left who hasn't been influenced by our next guest -
he's an accomplished linguist who's work has transformed his field,
he's a political theorist and the author of more than 100 books, the subject of many movies,
and he's not just a committed public intellectual, he's an activist - he shows up on campuses where the action is
and draws a crowd. Noam Chomsky is our guest in this special interview recorded in New York
Noam - welcome to the program glad to have you
President Obama picked the 10th anniversary of the U.S. battle of Fallujah
to announce the doubling of the U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Some of those troops are
going back to Anbar Province where Fallujah is situated. People talk about the crisis
posed by ISIS, and [the West's] lack of good options. Is this how you see it?
Noam Chomsky: It's interesting to look at it carefully. Fallujah, first of all, was
one of the worst atrocities of the 21st century. The Iraq war itself was the worst crime of
the 21st century, easily. Fallujah was probably the worst war crime carried out during that
war.
Seven thousand Marines attacked Fallujah, probably killed everyone who was there. They
called them insurgents - whatever that means. On the first day of the invasion of Fallujah,
the New York Times had a front page photograph of Marines breaking into the general hospital,
which is a war crime, and throwing all the patients and doctors on the floor and shackling
them. It was hailed as a triumph.
When the High Command was asked why they broke into the hospital, they said it was a propaganda
center for the insurgents. [They said that the hospital] was releasing casualty figures,
and therefore it's legitimate to carry out a major war crime.
Apparently pretty exotic weapons were used there, and there's evidence, which international
agencies don't want to look at, of high levels of cancer and other effects of maybe
depleted uranium, maybe something else.
It's a major atrocity, but it's hailed here as a victory. The only way it is referred
to now is as a tragedy because the Marines fought so hard to liberate Fallujah, and now
ISIS is in control of it.
LF: So what would you do if you were president?
Noam Chomsky: First of all ISIS is a monstrosity. There isn't a conceivable way of dealing
with it. It's kind of hard to imagine following the law (I say that cautiously because it's
such an outrageous idea), but there are laws, and we're bound by them. The Constitution
requires that we adhere to them, of course we never do.
One of them is the U.N. Charter. A way of dealing with ISIS following the law would
be to approach the U.N. Security Council and request that they declare a threat to peace,
which of course they would do, and organize a way to respond to it. And then follow the
will of the international community. Out of that there might come a reasonable response.
The unilateral U.S. response -- mainly to hit everything with a sledgehammer -- makes
absolutely no sense. The correspondent who's followed this most closely and has been right
all along, Patrick Cockburn, simply describes it as an Alice in Wonderland strategy.
The major ground forces that are fighting ISIS are apparently the [Kurdistan Workers'
Party] PKK and its allies in Syria. They're barred because we call them a terrorist group,
so they're under attack. Our ally, Turkey, attacks them and we bar them support.
But they're apparently the ones who saved the Yazidis and blocked the ISIS attack on
Iraqi Kurdistan. They're out. The major regional state that could confront ISIS is
Iran. In fact they could probably wipe them out. And they're influential in Iraq. In
fact, [they're] the victors of the Iraq war. They're out for ideological reasons.
A more complex case, which Patrick Cockburn has actually talked about, is what to do with
Assad. That has all kinds of complexities, but anyway they're out.
And the sledgehammer has its usual effect. The U.S. bombings, are, in the usual and predictable
way, eliciting anger from the civilians that were under attack. They don't like ISIS.
They hate it, but they don't want to be attacked by American bombs.
There was very interesting insight into this in the New York Times, maybe a week ago. The
lead article should have had the headline: "The United States declares itself to be
the world's leading terrorist state and is proud of it." That was the content of
the article, but of course it didn't have that headline. But it was very revealing.
Also the lack of response to it.
The lead story was a report of a CIA study that had just come out of U.S. intervention
and the study was concerned with when they worked and when they didn't work and why.
They quoted Obama saying that he commissioned some such studies. He was kind of disappointed
they didn't work so much. Then you take a look at the examples, first paragraph of
the story, three examples: Cuba, Angola, Nicaragua. Each one a major terrorist war carried out
by the United States, not even ambiguous.
So here we take three major terrorist wars with horrible consequences, we investigate:
did they work? Didn't they work? We're disappointed that they didn't work. And
the president says we have better ways. Again, the headline should be: "Yes, we declare
ourselves to be the world's leading terrorist state. We're proud of it."
LF: It goes to a much bigger question. You talk often about the conventional wisdom being
reality on it's head. That goes back to the founding story of the United States.
Noam Chomsky: It sure does.
LF: Can you talk about the principles on which this country is supposedly founded versus
the ones you think it might actually be founded on. I've been reading Edward Baptist's
extraordinary book, The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism.
Noam Chomsky: Well, take Baptist's book and compare it with the New York Times this
morning. There's a description in the New York Times of the horrible treatment of the
Yazidi by ISIS. Now go back to Baptist's book. That's what he's describing. He's
describing the treatment of the slaves for half of American history, and in fact it continues.
And it's almost identical. That's the way they were treated.
It's not just kind of bad people in Georgia, Boston financiers were involved in it. They
didn't say they were in favor of slavery but they were happy to become wealthy by exporting
commodities that were produced by the leading resource of the 19th century, which was cotton.
Cotton was kind of like oil.
So, the oil--the cotton gets exported and they make a ton of money and the banks, they
have enough money to import. The country grows and becomes rich, and in fact as Baptist says,
the economy was built on the backs of African slaves.
LF: So is capitalism- RECD as you call it - real existing capitalist democracy - in
the United States. Is it redeemable, reformable?
Chomsky: Well, this is a good illustration of how remote our system is from capitalism.
It's hard to think of any greater violation of capitalist and market principles than slavery.
But the country was based on two basic commitments: one, slavery, which was as Baptist points
out was all the source, pretty much the source of the growing economy, including the industrial
economy. The other is the extermination of the indigenous population by state power.
What''s that got to do with capitalism?
In effect, it goes right to the present. If you have an iPhone and you take a look at
the components in it, practically all of them were developed through the state sector, government
funding, research and development, often for decades.
LF: Public sector. We paid for it.
Noam Chomsky: Yea, we paid for it. And notice there is a principle of capitalism. Say we
imagine we're in a capitalist society. And you invest money in something, and it's
a risky investment, and you keep investing in it for decades. And finally, something
comes out that makes a profit--well, in a capitalist society you're supposed to get
the profit. That's not what happens here.
LF: If I'm the U.S. taxpayer...
Noam Chomsky: You pay for decades, usually under the pretext that the Russians are coming
or something. You're paying for the kind of research and development and creative work
that yields the IT revolution, computers, the Internet, your iPhone, all the rest of
it. Do you get anything back?
LF: I haven't noticed it.
Noam Chomsky: It goes to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.
LF: But, we work a lot with people these days who are interested in trying to develop work
around co-ops and cooperative regions of solidarity economics. Is that hopeless?
Noam Chomsky: No, I think that makes sense. In fact, there are interesting things happening.
The person who's done the most writing about this is Gar Alperovitz, and it's interesting
work. Throughout the Northern middle west, like in Northern Ohio, there is a spread of
worker-owned enterprises -- not huge but not small either -- which could be the basis of
a different kind of society. And notice that these could be substantial if there was enough
popular support.
So, go back a couple of years--Obama virtually nationalized the auto industry. It was collapsing,
so it had to be kind of built up by the taxpayers. So he took over most of the auto industry.
There were a few possibilities. One possibility, of course, was the one that was followed.
Bail out the owners, bail out the banks, give it back to the same people, or other people
with different faces but essentially the same roles in society, and have it continue to
produce what it had always been producing--automobiles. There was another possibility.
Give it to the work force. Subsidize them to develop and have it produce what we need.
What do we need? I can give you a personal example.
My wife and I came to New York by train from Boston. The train took only an hour and a
half longer than when I took it in 1950 for the first time. Either it was standing still
or it was going slower than the trucks on the Connecticut Turnpike.
There isn't a country in the world where this happens. And that's just a symbol of
the country. This is the richest country in the world that has incomparable advantages
and it's just falling apart.
LF: Were you encouraged by the news that was hailed as a breakthrough of the U.S.-China
accord around emissions, for the first time China committing to cap emissions?
Noam Chomsky: Look, it's better than nothing, but it doesn't really amount to much. And
it had potential dangers that we'd better keep our eye on. Notice that this a U.S.-China
agreement. It could turn out that this is going to undercut the international agreements,
and it's not impossible that that was the purpose.
When we talk about Chinese emissions, remember they're our emissions. China manufactures,
say, your iPad, and there is pollution, but that's for the American markets. So, it's
a mixed story.
LF: Well, so that goes to the questions that we received from our Facebook friends. We
invited them to pose questions for Professor Chomsky and they posed very many. They fell
into several camps: How did we get into this mess? How would you describe this mess? And
how to we get out of this mess? I think at the "how do you describe this mess?" situation.
One quick question in particular, was "How do you assess the strengths and weaknesses
of the U.S. movements for social justice, and how would you advise we try to maximize
the strengths and minimize the weaknesses?"
Noam Chomsky: The labor movement has traditionally been in the forefront of progressive social
change, and for that reason and others it's under severe attack. Partly it's the fault
of labor bureaucrats, but partly it's just fierce attack from the business world, which
pretty much runs the country.
And by now the labor movement is a shadow of what it once was. It could come back. There
have been earlier periods of American history when the labor movement was destroyed--1920s,
it was partially wiped out, 1930s it rose again, so it could happen.
But with the labor movement seriously weakened and an independent political parties almost
gone, there's a lack of, a fundamental lack of, continuity in activist politics.
So everything starts from--as if nothing ever happened before. So, if you take Occupy, which
was important but it came out of nowhere, no institutional memory, no recollection of
the history. Not even remembering how to run a demonstration. You know, all of this kind
of institutional memory is gone. There's a lot of activism, but it's very separated.
One of the things that I spend a lot of time doing is just giving talks around the country.
And one of the major positive contributions is it just brings people together in the same
community. People may be doing the same thing in different neighborhoods and don't know
each other. And that extends across the country. What's happening here nobody knows about
there. That's a serious weakness.
LF: One of the other questions we had from our Facebook page was from people asking about
the prospects for a movement growing out of the conflict in Ferguson and the role of police
and the militarization of police in our society. Do you see any prospects for a broad anti-racist
social justice movement coming out of that mobilization?
Chomsky: There are prospects, but it's going to be very hard. This is a very racist society.
I mean it's pretty shocking. What has happened in the last, roughly 30 years, with regard
to African Americans, actually is very similar to what Baptist describes in the late 19th
century. Remember what happened--the Constitutional amendments during and after the Civil War
were supposed to free African American slaves.
It did something for about 10 years then there was a North-South compact, which essentially
granted the former slave-owning states the right to do whatever they wanted. And what
they did was criminalize black life in all kinds of ways. That created a kind of a slave
force.
In fact, one of the most interesting books on it, Douglas Blackmon's Slavery by Another
Name. It threw mostly black males, but also women, into jail where they become a perfect
labor force, much better than slaves. If you're a slave owner you have keep your capital alive.
If the state does it for you, it's terrific. No strikes, no disobedience, the perfect labor
force.
A lot of the American Industrial Revolution in the late 19th, early 20th century, is based
on that. And that actually pretty much lasted until the World War II when there was a need
for what's called free labor in the war industry. After that come about two decades
in which African Americans had kind of a shot at entering this society. A black worker could
get a job at an auto plant, the unions were still functioning, maybe he could buy a small
house and send his kid to college or something.
By the 1970s or 80s, it's going back to criminalization of black life. It's called
the Drug War, which is a racist war. Ronald Reagan was an extreme racist and denied it.
And the whole Drug War is designed, from policing up to eventual release from prison to make
it impossible, for the black male community, and more and more women and more and more
Hispanics, to be part of the society.
If you look at American history, the first slaves came in 1619, and that's half a millennium.
There have been about three or four decades in which African Americans had a limited degree
of freedom, not entirely, but at least some.
And of course, for black elites there are some privileges, but I'm talking about the
mass of the population, which has been re-criminalized and also turned into a slave labor force (prison
labor for example). This is American history. To break out of that is no small trick.
If you take a look
at the elections, say the last election, in many ways it's a civil war. The red states
are the confederacy. That extent
is little bit beyond, but that's pretty much what it is. This is a real battle. These
two founding crimes, slavery and extermination of the  indigenous population, are very much with
us. Take a look at Indian reservations today. It's not a pretty sight.
