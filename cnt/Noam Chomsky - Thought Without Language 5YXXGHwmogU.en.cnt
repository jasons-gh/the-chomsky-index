language happened fall short for many of
us and we sometimes refer to a foreign
language to try to explain something why
is it that my thinking process where my
experiential process cannot be
articulated with language well where is
that disconnect well you know each
language first of all I think altogether
I think all of us know that language
does not give us the full capacity maybe
every near the capacity to express what
we're thinking feeling hoping for you
know whatever there's an awful lot of
thought that goes on that just isn't it
doesn't come out the mouth you know and
probably can't I mean when you
introspect you can see this so for
example as a topic that hasn't been
studied but should people are talking to
themselves all the time you can't
prevent yourself from talking to
yourself actually I don't know if that's
true of signers designers sign to
themselves all the time
but you've seen it well you just can't
prevent yourself from doing it takes a
tremendous act of will now if you pay
attention at least when I pay attention
to what I think I'm doing it is
externalized language like I can tell
whether two words rhyme but I think it's
fragments I'm at least what I think I'm
doing is sort of fragments come to mind
you know a word you know another word
and all of a sudden I know exactly what
the thought is then I can express it
well if that's true that means that the
thinking is going on the bits of
externalized language are kind of you
know spurring you to express it and then
you can express whatever it is you're
thinking but even with all of that
there's a lot of stuff you just can't
express that's why we you know people
write poems and that's why we have
literature and art and music and all
sorts of other things and that tells us
something but not enough as for looking
at other languages it's sometime there
are sometimes concepts that do have a is
it kind of like the Moses you know the
right word it happens it's like that
happens to be in another language it
doesn't have an expression of English
and there are things like that you know
schadenfreude you know angst and stuff
like then so there are cases where some
other language just happens to have the
concept that you're looking for but
there are plenty of cases where at least
my feeling is where no language does and
we just can't begin to exhaust the
content of error thoughts feelings
emotions and so on I think everybody
knows this from their own experience
it's not study much that one of the
reasons it's not studied is because of
the pervasiveness of certain dogmas like
the kinds I mentioned
nothing can be going on unless you're
conscious of it or at least you can
become conscious of it that's a very
deep-seated conviction in philosophy and
psychology and I look maybe some of you
know better but I can find almost
nothing in the history of thought that
raised the question that there are
unconscious thoughts and incidentally
that includes Freud as far as debate
about this but if you far as I read
Freud he I think when he talks about the
unconscious I don't think he means by it
inaccessible to consciousness in fact
all technique of psychoanalysis would
make sense on that assumption so it's as
if it's done it's there somehow and you
can bring it to consciousness but the
idea that there's something that the
stuff going on that is completely
unconscious that's rarely discussed on
the summit young women picot about much
and I suspect that this bears on current
work that's being done like that there
was some very interesting work that came
out recently some of you remind me I
forgot the name of the experimenter
which was all publicized all over the
place someone found that before you make
a decision let's say to lift your hand
there's something going on in the motor
cortex that would be connected with
lifting your hand I forget who the guy
wasn't did this this was interpreted all
over the place as being an argument
against the freedom of will it isn't
that at all all it's saying is that
decisions are unconscious you know so
you make a decision before it becomes
conscious you already something's going
on so the problem all the problems
remain exactly as they were but you
learned something you should have
guessed anyhow that things are happening
that just aren't accessible to
consciousness why why should they be any
wouldn't the rigidity principle is
