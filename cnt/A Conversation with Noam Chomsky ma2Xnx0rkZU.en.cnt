we said it today alive in the November
of 74 you know didya and we said yeah we
want to do a live so that's the name
Daniel I
get our live expansion mind Louis my
mind
my name is Steven SEF Carson this is
dead our live presented by the
Somerville producers group tonight we
have as our guest dr. professor Noam
Chomsky professor of linguistics and for
30 years very prominent and influential
critic of American policy and of
injustice around the world tonight we'll
be discussing the role and the power of
media in this country and the influences
that it has in our lives that we may not
realize and my first question professor
is about the title of your book
necessary illusions that control and
democratic societies when people hear
those terms of sub thought control and
propaganda most often they think of they
associate those with more totalitarian
societies and certainly not democratic
societies you explain those terms and
what that means
well actually the yeah the basic idea is
given by the title which is actually not
mine I borrowed it from Reinhold Niebuhr
who's a very distinguished moralist and
foreign affairs analyst he was known as
the theologian of the establishment it
was the grew of the Kennedys and the
converge intellectuals
George Kennan and so on and he he
expressed the view that it's the task of
the intellectuals people that we call
the cool observers to create necessary
illusions and emotionally potent
oversimplifications for the general
public the reason is that the general
public are in are naive and naive
simpletons and they you've got to ensure
that they don't get involved in managing
their own affairs or participating in
the political system or
making decisions and so on it would be
immoral to do that as the immoral to let
a three-year-old run across the street
you have to take care of them and the
way you take care of them is by creating
these said illusions these necessary
illusions that kind of keep the silly
people on course and that's very
standard a standard idea actually it's a
kind of a leading idea of a good deal of
liberal democratic theory so actually
the previous book that friend and I
wrote right before this was which is
called manufacturing consent and we
borrowed that term from walter Lippmann
who's the Dean of American journalists
and his conception was that the general
population are what he called the
bewildered herd and we have to he said
we have to protect ourselves we smart
guys have to protect ourselves from the
rage and trampling of the bewildered
herd
it reminds me of another term by Aldous
Huxley which was downward transcendence
by means of herd intoxication regarding
fascists and they're not just ideas
they're talking about the necrotic
societies yes and the idea is that in a
totalitarian society you really don't
need that much propaganda or the
propaganda can be relatively crude and
the reason is because you can control
the population by force and in a
military run society or a feudal society
or a modern totalitarian society you can
have a Ministry of Truth which you know
produces obvious propaganda and
everybody knows that it's breath again
but they can choose to believe it or not
choose to believe it as they wish but
they can't do much about it because
there they can be you've got the
bludgeon to beat them with but as a
society becomes more free and we're
democratic you have to keep the bewilder
to hurt under control in other ways and
the way to do it is through propaganda
and through manufacturing consent and
construction of illusions and
oversimplifications and a or simply
marginalization a large part of the task
of the media is simply to direct people
away from issues so keep them focused on
sitcoms and you know spectator sports or
something anything as long as they don't
get involved in something that might be
serious
and this goes if from every level from
kind of imposing the values of a highly
individualistic consumer culture where
the only value this individual greed and
people never do anything for one another
and so on that's one aspect all the way
up to concocting a framework of a
delusionary framework for the
interpretation of domestic and
international affairs and different
parts of the media have a different role
to play in this respect it's only these
idea they're not modern they go back to
the earliest modern democratic
revolutions the first real modern
democratic revolution was in the 17th
century in England when there were for
the first time you know radical
ministers and tradesmen were producing
pamphlet literature and organizing
people and reaching out to the general
public for the first time and they had
real highly democratical democratic
ideas and I mean they were talking about
the rights of ordinary people to control
their own lives in universal education
and access to health and all sorts and a
lot of which is still not still far on
the agenda and that had to be suppressed
because the people as they put it in
those days are getting so arrogant that
they are refusing to submit to a civil
rule and have to be repressed and that
same idea reappears over and over again
in the American Revolution for example
the general public after the Revolution
had won the general public had to be
taught that the ideas that appeared in
the revolutionary pamphlets about
freedom and equality were not to be
taken seriously and popular uprisings
like say Shaye's
in New England of rebellious farmers had
to be crushed by force those guys were
taking the this libertarian rhetoric
seriously and they had to be taught that
the way it works is different now the
this country was founded on the idea
that the people who own the country
ought to govern that phrase is John Jay
is the president of the Constitutional
Convention and modalities had to be
worked out to ensure that the people who
owned the place also govern and that the
rise of modern corporations it sort of
new forms you know the the ideas keep
being remodeled and reshaped in the 20th
century it became a just a major
industry in the early part of the 20th
century the public relations industry
was created and it's growing through a
huge industry and it's very frank about
what it does in fact it's leading figure
Edward Bernays lives right here in
Cambridge he wrote back in nineteen
twenty suppose about what he called the
engineering of consent which he said is
the essence of democracy and we're a
book called propaganda in fact in which
he described the way you have to control
people's thinking controlling the public
mind is the concern of the advertising
industry and has been from its origins
puts lots of money and thought into
their main concern actually is to create
a public climate of support for business
and business profitability to great
labor unions to break the working class
culture that at one time existed and so
on well how would they informed public
jeopardize that or threatened the
highway 50 percent well yes bill so it's
questions like why do we need bosses for
example why can't we run things
ourselves i watch it there be rich
people
living in mansions while other people
our home was in the streets now why
should some people have access to health
care and others starve and not have
access to it why should we pour money
into creating stealth bombers instead of
using it for schools and houses all
kinds of questions immediately come to
mind and the bewildered heard are likely
to ask them if they're permitted to have
a honest look at the world
and it takes a that lasts just the last
10 years the general public was strongly
opposed to the Reagan programs on
virtually every issue but very large
margin I mean right through the Reagan
years if you take a look at this very
heavily polled Society the reason is
that business wants to keep its finger
on the public pulse so it knows how to
adjust the problem under in fact and
there's extensive polling that it shows
that right through the Reagan years the
public was if went when people are asked
would you prefer spending for military
purposes or for or social spending like
health and education welfare and so on
by huge margins the public preferred
social spending four to one or seven to
one depending on how you ask fact most
of the popularity the population was in
favor of higher taxes if it was used for
those purposes which is quite unusual
people rarely are in favor of higher
taxes but the policies nevertheless were
quite the opposite the policies were to
dismantle and destroy the limited
support system that there was and to
transfer resources from the poor to the
rich the 1980s were a decade of outright
robbery in which the poorer part of the
population was robbed which is the great
majority were robbed out right to enrich
a small sector now that's why Tom Wolfe
than the Boston Globe the other today
described the 80s as one of the golden
moments of human history for people like
him it was a golden moment of human
history they were robbing
we wait in line and if you don't care
about you know homeless people and the
mutilated bodies in Central America and
so on well it's just a golden moment
look how rich I'm getting now the point
is that you know if if any of this was
presented to the general public in a
regular intelligible fashion they would
want to do something about it and in the
United States which is a relatively free
society you can't control them by force
so they better not know about it think
about well many people know that this
problems exist I think that they just
don't most people don't really know how
to respond to them are there and maybe
they're gone on to this but it was a
very distorted way to look at it at
least and it's very hard to know exactly
what people you know people ask
themselves what they don't understand
what we can see what's presented so for
example there was a canonical front-page
story about the economic crisis it was
about a man whose name I forgot who was
telling about how impossible their life
is no I can't exist he only makes fifty
six thousand dollars a year he's having
a tough time keeping it's two cars up
and you know they didn't have time to
spend in a swimming pool
his wife even had to work you know to
sort of and she didn't want to and this
was really terrible and then he went on
to and then he went on to say how awful
everything else is you know there's
roads you know good and schools are
collapsing and so on and so forth what
was the problem well the problem is big
government well you know I mean put
aside the question of what the problem
is for a man who's making fifty six
thousand dollars a year I mean that's
grantee as a problem but why is the
problem big government well doubtless
there's corruption in government but
there's a thousand times as much
corruption in business and for every you
know a bit of excessive spending in
government there's a thousand times that
much it goes of the super inflated
salaries and idiotic managerial
practices that have led to the decline
of the productive system and in order to
maximize rapid gain and so on but he
didn't say the problems in the business
system and in fact nobody would say you
would never see that in the newspapers
there's lots of attack on the corruption
of government
doubtless real you know but so marginal
as to be insignificant on the other hand
the the fact that that we have a
business community that you know
extracts huge profits and leads and has
you know a sector of the population
living an extraordinary luxury well
making you know well control well in
fact owning the country and also
governing it and directing policy in a
way which maximizes their profit but
happens to be extremely destructive for
the general population and future
generations that's not that's not what
this man complained about think it's not
presented to you every day and it's not
the world isn't shaped in those terms
that's one of the things you don't look
at even when people thought about the
media they talk about him and his
criticism in the media for something
occasionally they'll be criticizing the
media for being too soft on the
government you know not being
adversarial enough how about the
criticism of the meat
for being patches for business for the
corporate system I've never see a true
this isn't like that that's just one of
the things you know it's best I think
the most dominant criticism of the media
would tend to be that it's too liberal
I'm a new usual criticism is it's too
adversarial but when you see it
criticism from the other side you know
says no it's not too adversarial it's
that it's too subordinated the
government will occasionally hear that
but it's too subordinated to corporate
interests that's unspeakable remember
those work doesn't like that's not an
English sentence save it because
corporate interests don't exist
they're part of the they're behind some
curtain and you don't talk about this
you can talk about the government being
bad occasionally and you can criticize
the government but the government is
just it's just one segment of the
business class that's all it is and the
real problem is in it's basically in
John J's dictum that dictum on which the
country was founded if those who own the
country are going to govern it which in
fact is essentially what happens you
want to look at who owns it not just
that particular set of manager who
happens to be running it today if you
have written that resources come from
the real source of power in this country
from ownership those who owned
productive assets of their country
ultimately have the capacity to
determine what else functions now how
and in terms of again getting back to
the media how would those systems be
maintained or be reinforced in you know
in a daily way and and television excuse
me you mean what how does it work out
there how does it well how is it
reinforced if you say that that's
something that is promoted or that's
well I mean there are two levels at
which you can discuss this which one you
mean I mean no one we can talk about how
they you know how do the institutions
work out so that in fact the picture of
the world is shaped in corporate
interests that's one and secondly how
our particular stories dealt with the
particular issues but I think I'm
interested in both
well the first one is pretty
straightforward and in fact you know
it's not very mysterious just simply ask
one just simply has to ask oneself what
are the media okay so what are the major
media you know let's take say the
television channels or the cable
channels or the big newspapers and so on
what are they answer very simple they're
big corporations in fact for the major
media huge corporations what's more
they're integrated into even bigger
conglomerates you know like General
Electric and Westinghouse and so on huge
among real huge conglomerate now like
any other corporations they have a
product which they sell to a market the
market is what keeps them going well
what's the market markets advertisers
that's what funds the media they're not
funded by people who read them or look
at them like when you turn on the tube
you know CBS doesn't get a cent out of
it they're financed by the advertisers
in fact same with newspapers you may pay
50 Cent's but usually they lose money
for every issue that they sell its the
advertisers that keep them going so what
you have is big corporations selling a
product to other corporations well
what's the product product is audiences
if you sell upscale audiences you get
more profit because you know there's no
point advertising a Mercedes and you
know in the slump so if you want to have
if you want you know you want to sell a
good product it's going to make a lot of
money so rich audiences privileged
audiences and in fact that's what the
one sector of the media like the New
York to the national media basically the
New York Times The Washington Post those
things that any Boston Globe for that
matter they they're basically are
selling privileged audiences so and and
they're the ones who set the agenda you
know I'd like they're like if you're
running a small newspaper and say you
know a big newspaper for that matter in
Des Moines IO or something you don't
have the resources to cover the world
scene or even the national scene what
you do
you see what the New York Times has you
do the same thing well see it's actually
interesting if you watch the wire
services I don't know you've got a if
you got an AP wire here let it run and
around four o'clock in the afternoon
every day something comes across which
says the New York Times is following for
their front page tomorrow every editor
in the country sees that he said okay
here's the notice for tomorrow you know
X Y Z because that's what the New York
Times it's doing in fact even the
television channels do that they see
what's on the New York Times in the
Washington Post that morning and that's
true conceiving any evening a little
more independent than a small newspaper
but that's the way the thing works so
there is a sort of a core of kind of
agenda setting newspapers there is also
a kind of a local quality press like say
the globe or the Philadelphia Enquirer
or the LA Times and they have a degree
of in the they have enough resources so
that they have a degree of Independence
although they don't break far out of
that framework either and then you sort
of go on down to people who just pick up
the structure and they then use the New
York Times like to say if you have a
Boston Herald you run the New York Times
News Service this year the world I knew
they I doubt if they have their own
correspondents anyway you know so so on
the one hand you've got these kind of
agenda-setting media which are selling
privileged audiences and then you have
the mass media which are selling huge
audiences and just sort of pick up the
structure from above well we expect to
come out of that let's take the
agenda-setting media huge corporations
selling privileged audiences to other
businesses what kind of picture of the
world they expect to come out of that
system
well you expect a picture that's going
to reflect the interests of the sellers
and the buyers and the product namely to
reflect the to give a view of the world
that serves the interests and the needs
of the sectors of the population that in
fact control the resources and make the
decisions and
they're the economic managers and the
political managers and the cultural
managers and the people in the culture
business schools universities media and
so on reflects their interests that's a
top sector of the population at an
extreme level it's the kind of people
who Tom Wolfe was talking for it's it's
the privilege now let's take the other
sectors of the media and they have a job
I mean their job is to those media have
it their job is first of all set the
agenda in a way which will serve those
interests put the stories frame them
suppress them modify them in such a way
that it will serve the interests of
privilege which they do but also to
indoctrinate their own audience they go
to indoctrinate them because those
people the people in decision-making
positions if they have to accept the
values and interests and the
understanding of the real bosses the
people who actually are the corporate
management and ownership it seemed to me
that class that just say that this
sooner this is being directed to is
small and it's probably in fact it's
becoming smaller that that very wealthy
class whereas the you know the larger
and expanding part of the population
would be you know a lower class or you
know the real mass media directed to the
what I've been talking about so far is
maybe 20% of the population which is
subordinated to the interests of a few
percent who really don't the resources
what about the other 80% well they're
the ones who are fed the rest of the
media and the tasks of the media as far
as they are concerned is in part - just
inculcate the right patriotic slogans
and make sure they don't look at the
wrong things like people enriching
themselves and their that their interest
and so on you put that away but besides
I just direct them director bewildered
heard and make sure that they don't get
involved in anything that might be
unfortunate like running their own
affairs so that's so so so basically a
large part of the media's diversion and
it's also isolation now make sure that
everybody's alone
you know each person is sitting alone in
front of the - you don't support one
another you don't have any organizations
where you get together and try to work
things out for different unions for
example and the one of the major
propaganda a very conscious propaganda
efforts of the public relations industry
was to destroy the unions I mean did
that again that began well you know it's
actually the United States has a very
violent labor history so it began way
back in fact I mean and we also had a
highly class conscious business class
very in fact if you read the business
literature it's kind of its kind of like
the Marxist literature that's all about
class warfare and the masses and so on
except they're on the other side just
win the class war by suppressing the
massive ISM and they're worried about
the power of the masses and so on it's
the only place in American you know
reading material where it reads like
kind of gold era Marxism upside down
back in the 1970s century there's been a
real battle now and American Labor's
lost it I mean there was a long war in
labor struggle for a long time to gain
things like say the 40-hour a week
finally gained it but no longer in fact
the the unionization has declined very
far and what's more the working class
culture is declined
the extent to which this is other here's
it just takes a for example made a if
you ask people I mean I ask my classes
every year April thirtieth what's
tomorrow and it's the day when you had
dance around the Maypole or something
the United States is I think probably
the only country in the world where May
Day is not a working-class holiday
everywhere else in the world may days a
working-class holiday well what's it
celebrating what May Day is celebrating
is a solid it's it's it's a holiday
established by the International
working-class movement in solidarity
with the struggles of American workers
you know they were it was in solidarity
of the struggles of American workers for
an eight-hour day over 100 years ago now
the United States the only country where
it's not celebrated
in fact that we have a working class
holiday it's Labor Day today when you go
back to work that's when summers
overnight now you know forget fishing
you go back to work
no see those things are very are not
just since mother symbolic in a way but
they reflect the enormous victory of the
business class is over any conception of
popular organization or popular
solidarity now just the idea that people
have a right to the fruits of their own
labor or to struggle together to achieve
something that's got to be completely
destroyed and all that's left is the
right of the rich to enrich themselves
while nobody's looking and that's in
fact what the public relations industry
and advertising is dedicated to and what
a large part of the mass media are
dedicated to I think back to like for
example looking at life magazines of the
40s and the during the war when there
was very intensive propaganda and very
blatant propaganda and looking at any of
the you know mass might and magazine ask
magazines of that time for example as I
said Life magazine there's very
intensive propaganda about you know
characters of Hitler and so on and I
think immediately after that and there
in the 30s there was a bit of an
experiment with socialism in this
country and at least on one level but
then that immediately after the war
again to look at some of these magazines
and see see the intensity of the
propaganda effort to shift people's
values and to move a much more of a
consumer orientation and and so I
associated was only with a big attack on
unions starting and right after the war
and an effort to roll back what had been
gained
by other working-class and the
specialties vari
I was very self-conscious I mean the
business literature is full of
discussion of how to do it they had
begun in the late 30s working out one
thing is go to Johnstown formula which
was a technique that was used to break a
major strike in 1937 by enlisting public
opinion and using the media in fact to
undermine popular support for the
strikers and what they were fighting for
which was in fact the interests of most
of the population I was considered a big
success and during the war of course
this was all put on hold because yet
another job but immediately after the
war there was a major attack by business
government the intellectual classes and
so on
to destroy the union's the working class
culture solidarity popular organization
and to restore to restore centralized
power and at the hands of the privileged
that led to the quiet period of the 50s
when popular movements began again in
the 60s the same thing happened in fact
there was there's a very interesting
book that everybody ought a read called
the crisis of democracy put together by
a group called the trilateral commission
which is basically the international
liberal establishment that this was 1975
and it was it's the people around Carter
in fact Jimmy Carter and virtually his
entire administration came out of that
so it's the kind of liberal wing of the
international ruling class trilateral
meant United States Europe and Japan and
they were all concerned with the same
question they were concerned with the
ferment of the 60s when out of crisis of
democracy arose well what was the crisis
if you read it it's very very
enlightened ever talking to each other
so you know everybody's very frank
nobody was expected to read this book
the the crisis was that people were
organized sectors of the population that
are usually passive and apathetic we're
beginning to enter the political arena
ethnic minorities women young people
poor people I mean that you know people
were just getting together and trying to
organize and get into things within the
Democratic Party as well after the
crisis and the 1968 election and
everything that happened Chicago by the
1972 election there was that at least
temporarily the party had been
restructured and that was called the
crisis the crisis was that democracy was
beginning to work and in fact the the
spokesman for the United States happens
to be a big professor at Harvard Samuel
Huntington he he said that he described
sort of the good old days when you
didn't have a crisis he said Truman had
been able to run the country with the
assistance of a small group of Wall
Street lawyers and bankers then there
was no crisis everything that's the way
it was supposed to be but now you
couldn't just get a bunch of bankers and
and Wall Street lawyers together and do
everything because he had all these
annoying people yeah the wielders herd
getting involved and that's a crisis and
how do you solve the crisis well you
restore the population to apathy and
obedience then you don't have a crisis
of democracy anymore then democracy is
working just fine working in the
interest of the privileged you know it's
by the privileged for the privileged and
in their interests that's democracy and
when that gets out of hand you have a
problem well you know that's the same
idea the thought that we've been hearing
since the 17th century
and every time you get popular
involvement and action and organization
you get an attempt to crush it in the
United States it's been quite successful
the people really are marginalized and
isolated the United States I mean with
what I mentioned about Maeda is a case
in point but the United States has one
of the weakest labor movements in the
world it's the only industrial society
virtually the only industrial society
that doesn't have a labor based party we
really have a one-party system if we
were honest we have a business party one
of the populist mayor's in the Midwest
America leveland recently called it the
bene publicans you know business party
that's two factions and kind of shift
around a little bit but it's what would
be called the Conservatives of the
Tories and almost any other industrial
country there's no working class party
there's no I doubt if there's a you'd
have to really look hard in the United
States to find any writer in a journal
identify himself or herself as a
socialist virtually no one every other
industrial societies joke it's normal
Canada England anyway in terms of that
and and in terms of that in the press
and people who are within the press as
you say a journalist mentioned about
socialist journalists as an example how
is it that the perspective in the news
that that we see is as narrow as it is
is it how does that reinforced we're
just saying is that they I've recently
read a study about the the people who
are presented as experts and in the the
media of having a very narrow spectrum
that's true but that's and there was a
study in Mother Jones this month and uh
the media and at Palace analysis group
also do a study of people in Nightline
or something that is true yeah of course
picked from a pretty narrow spectrum but
I think that kind of his misleading in a
way although it's correct the point is
that the entire spectrum is narrow yes
so for example I'm gonna take I've done
a lot of it well for example in this
book I do some analysis on various
issues so you know the big foreign
policy issue of the 1980s was Nicaragua
well you do bet Nicaragua so I took the
two periods of pink concentration which
if you look at number of news stories
and so on it sort of peaked in early
1986 and in early 1987 that was in
connection with Contra aid bills so I
took all the opinion columns from the
newspapers main newspapers Washington
Post New York Times all the op-eds in
the editor and the you know they're
colonists and so on that's supposed to
give the range of opinion and there were
lots of them they were about plus 250
columns so how did they divide up on the
issue well on the major issue what do
you what's your attitude there the
Sandinistas it was totalitarian 100
percent 100 percent of the cocaine the
first sample a hundred percent of the
columns were anti sandanista in the
second sample 1987 there were two
exceptions one of them was the
ambassador of Nicaragua was allowed to
write a column and the other was a the
only person who had had first-hand
experience in Central America a doctor
in New York
Kevin Cahill who's a specialist in
Tropical Medicine and works has worked
in Haiti and the Caribbean and the
Central American he actually he was that
he was the one person who said look it's
the only place where they've carried out
health programs directed to the war
population they've had an enormous
increase in
life span huge decline in infant
mortality because they're actually
trying to do something for people that
was those were the two columns in the
whole Snapple that were not Andes and
Aniston now you know that's the kind of
unanimity you get in a totalitarian
state now they're furthermore they're
it's kind of interesting to see the
topics that were never the weren't
mentioned like you know whatever your
attitude may be third the Sandinistas
there's one rather striking property
that differentiates them from say the
government of El Salvador and Guatemala
or even Honduras namely they don't
slaughter their own population in in El
Salvador and Guatemala they and even it
to a lesser extent Honduras the
government's essentially run by the Army
and the army to gang murders you know
having us trained and us supported
murderers who've killed tens tens of
thousands of people think huge massive
slaughter they're well you can whatever
you think about the Sandinistas they
haven't done that so how might affect
their record is much better than even
Honduras in this respect well how much
coverage did that get answer not one
phrase not one phrase in all of the
columns that shows how important mass
slaughter and terror and torture are for
elite values another a factor which is
not in question is that the Sandinistas
again whatever you think about them did
carry out social reforms and they had
quite a significant impact until they
were cut back by the by us terrorism how
much did that get well you know
scattered phrases may be in the first
sample two phrases in very negative
context in the second the two columns I
mentioned indicated that shows how
important social reform are the third
point that is interesting is is law
international law I mean the the
international the World Court ruled that
US actions in Nicaragua were criminal
that we were engaged in the unlawful use
of force and that the embargo was
illegal and that what we're calling
humanitarian aid is military aid now
that's the highest world tribunal you
know the International Court of Justice
how much attention was paid to that
virtually zero I put all of this
together and you get a picture I won't
go on you get a picture of a society
which is virtually totalitarian in its
conformity to the needs of power which
cares nothing about terror and violence
as long as it's carried out for a
constructive perfect to mention in your
book about and a lecture that there was
accusations of aiding the guerrillas
from Colombia that were just completely
fabricated I mean there was a big story
in this New York Times we ran the ran a
big series on Nicaraguan support for
guerrillas in Colombia Colombian
government denied it there's nothing
like that ever happened that was never
reported and they continued to publish
the accusations it got to the point
where they they might be it they had an
editorial a couple of months after this
event with it which denounced the
Sandinistas for support for the
guerrillas and it said in fact they had
a mass they carried out a mass in
Nicaragua for the guerrillas some of
them who had been killed in an army
operation a reader in Arizona was
curious about that and he wrote the New
York Times a letter asking them if they
could tell him give him some information
about this mass and he kept that it you
know they never published his letter but
he kept at it and finally they conceded
the foreign editor conceded privately
that they would never publish it that
what actually happened was that there
was a mass for something else and in the
mask somebody got up in the back of the
room with a with a poster about the
guerrillas and taken out that's what
happened
so that becomes Nicaraguan support for
the guerrillas and running a mass for
them well they conceded it in private
but they never commit a correction and
it just goes on and on like this I mean
I'm picking one issue you pick any issue
in the world and you'll get the same
story these are the operations of a well
organized propaganda system with
perfectly obvious objective its interest
a very interesting case the United
States because it's
without force the nobody's forcing them
to do it you know nobody got a gun at
their heads this is done out of interest
you know it's done out of interest and
out of institutional need so it's not
totalitarian it's done under conditions
of freedom it's what I mean by flood
control in a democratic society let's
say well we're planning to take of some
questions from the people that are here
in our studio to discuss some of the
topics we've been discussing tonight and
some other questions and perhaps we can
take the first question now hi dr.
Chomsky hi um I'd just like to ask what
you think the necessary illusions are
that are supported by the media's any
sin Denise Tobias in Nicaragua well
that's very clear actually there's if we
had something that you could call
newspapers in the United States they
would tell you what drives American
policy towards the third world in third
Central America and that's very explicit
this is a free country you can the the
major document finding documents have
been Declassified find out what they say
and here's what they say they say that
the major threat they say that the roots
of American policy in Latin America are
the primary root is the economic group
the trade and investment there they say
that the major threat to US interests is
what are called nationalistic regimes
which are responsive to the needs of the
masses of the population for improvement
in living standards and diversification
of production for domestic needs why is
that a threat because we have to impose
a climate favourable to private business
including guarantees for a repatriation
of profits for foreign investment it
says we have to protect our resources
and the documents say right back all
including the Dubs people like George
Kennan we have to support police States
if necessary because liberal regimes
will be too indulgent to people carrying
out these
negative actions well it goes on and on
like that this is repeated over and over
again in the highest level planning
documents it's applied repeatedly
throughout the world that's why I've
continually had to overthrow democratic
governments capitalist governments in
fact when they became too devoted to
their own to the needs of their own
populations well you know that's what
the Sandinistas were the sandinistas
were directing resources to the general
population and the way from the elites
and they weren't protecting the
interests of the business community so
they have to go on that there's
unanimity the only question is how they
go so you have a tactical debate between
the people who say let's do it by terror
and violence let's support the Contras
and then the doves who say let's do it
by economic strangulation and
ideological warfare but that they must
go that's certain how often have you
read an editorial or an opinion column
in the United States saying this an
ministers are doing good no I mean you
certainly find people who say it for
example Oxfam you know independent the
major development and aid organization
has described the policies of this end
inist is as unique in the 76 developing
countries in which they work in their
concern for the needs of the population
and the efficiency with which they
address them but they don't write an
op-ed because that's not a permissible
position I'm wondering you say this
Gallup poll they said that a majority of
Americans are in favor of funding social
programs and are willing to raise taxes
to pay for them I'm wondering why in
your mind Democratic candidates who
stand for those things keep losing
particularly presidential candidates
there aren't any
there's no presidential candidate who
stands for those things for example
right at the at the time when that's
what the polls were saying the Democrats
were saying let's do the opposite mondo
freaks and L didn't say that
Mondale didn't in fact Mondale did not
Mondale's position was he was he was in
favor of cutting back military spending
but also cutting back social spending
and the reason was because in 1984 the
Democrats were basically the party of
fiscal conservatism they were the party
that was representing the interests of
the banks and the investment firms and
so on who were concerned with the big
deficits the Republicans were the party
of what's called Keynesian growth you
know big government lots of government
spending that's what the military means
big subsidies to high-tech industry
that's what the Pentagon basically is
let's forget the deficits in fact the
two parties that switched their unusual
positions 180 degrees but none of them
were talking about dropping military
spending in favor of social spending you
can't do that military spending is the
way we keep high-tech industry going in
fact Reagan's military spending programs
were just basically the carter programs
they were proposed in the last year
through the carter administration and
they were implemented under reagan and
the reasons were because the business
community all fundamentally had the same
opinion that you have to figure out a
way to increase profitability of
corporations cut back social spending
and force the public to subsidize
advanced industry i mean there's one
sector of American industry that's
basically competitive high-tech industry
you know computers and all that sort of
thing
electronics and you've got to get the
public to pay for it the public has to
pay for research and development then
has to you know provide it has to
subsidize the costly parts then if
there's any profit to be made that goes
back to private enterprise well we call
free enterprise is actually publicly
subsidized private profit has to be done
through the Pentagon system here on that
there was unanimity everyone was agreed
you know virtually across the board that
you had to cut back social programs and
increase military spending that is
high-tech subsidies didn't matter what
the public for do you feel that there
were any issues raised in Jackson
campaign that lawyer sure there were
issues raised in the Jackson campaign
but
they were not presented under the
presentation of Jackson in the media
didn't present those issues they did
that boy did them in favor of other
things marketing submit agree more did
he say this did he say that but not what
the populist content of the programs was
doesn't it appear that the working class
is in fact not being pacified anymore
and being squeezed right out of the
arena and whose aims were that serve is
it not being squeezed it's yeah it's I
mean the working class are being pushed
further and further rather than being
pacified to the point where they're
hardly earning a living wage many people
oh that's pacification I mean I I'm not
sure I understand yes you're right
they're being very much suppressed but
they're also being pacified there
there's I mean labour militancy is at a
pretty low level even though they're the
working class has been suffering like
for example real wages the amount you
actually can buy for what an hour's work
it gives you that's been declining since
about 1973 that's unprecedented in
American history it's never happened
before
meanwhile others say the richer sectors
of the population especially in the 80s
have their incomes of them with their
incomes have been going way up their
economic value has been going way up
nevertheless there's the reaction the
labor Clinton the working class the
reaction to this on the part of the
working class and the poor is pretty
limited beautiful something to happen
eventually Gordon I would think that is
fuel for something to eventually grow I
mean the point of the the the goal of
the cultural system is to prevent it
from happening by preventing people from
even seen I don't think people are in
general aware of the fact that living
standards for the mass of the population
are regularly going down and that it's
going to be even worse in the future
because the enrichment of the rich is
taking place at the expense of future
generations
that's what the deficits amount to but
you know that's not present I mean you
know if you if you if you look at the
figures you can see it in fact if you
look at your lives most people can see
it but they are not presented with
this characterization of the world on a
daily basis you may find an article on
page 78 some day that you know says
something about it but what is not
presented is this this part of me the
mate this ought to be upfront this ought
to be the headlines or be presented
daily so you see what's happening to
your world and that's not being done if
that were happening probably would get
the labor in the agency next well I
suppose my question follows from that
I'd like you described in a
modernization of the criticism it's not
merely lack of access this whole host of
things that are happening in order for
these things not to be brought to
everyone's attention how does it work
yeah the marginalization you know there
are plenty of critics around but they
occasionally took them to TV or on the
community supported radio stations for
example around the country where there
are community where there are listener
supported radio stations I don't mean
like WGBH where you send them your 10
bucks and they do whatever they feel
like but I mean really community
supported radio stations where you send
in your 10 bucks and then you play a
role in deciding what they do and
there's interaction in the towns and
cities that have that are rather
different I spend a lot of time
traveling around the country when you go
to a place like say Boulder Colorado or
you know Madison Wisconsin or someplace
that has a lively listener-supported
radio station you feel the difference in
the popular culture because people do
have a way of participating and
presented to them on a regular daily
basis an alternative picture of the
world which reflects their interests and
their concerns and in fact reality that
doesn't happen in places like Boston and
where there are individual critics they
will of course be very much marginalized
well if just I mean it takes a that book
that was mentioned that book was
actually based on lectures that were
given over the the national radio in
Canada the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation series of you know big
series of lectures every year that was
given there then
the book was published in Canada and
it's on the bestseller list in Canada in
the United States and Boston was also
published in Boston but the Boston Globe
wouldn't even list it under the listing
of books by local authors no local boy
makes good type list that they have
every Sunday where you know if you write
a chapter and cookbook they have you
listed there but that and of course
there could be a review in the United
States it's inconceivable nobody would
have heard of it well that's the
difference and that that happens across
the board I mean that my colleague had
returned and I who wrote the
manufacturing consent book our first
book was published by a publisher that
was owned by Warner Communications who
also owns this outfit they didn't like
that book they wanted didn't want the
publisher to distribute it 20,000 copies
had been printed the publisher which was
a successful publisher insisted on
printing it they cooked the publisher
out of business they literally put them
out of business and destroy their whole
stock to prevent them from distributing
that one book that was that's yeah
that's Warner Communications now that's
extreme things usually don't get that
for I don't want to suggest that that's
typical but there's a whole range of
ways to ensure that unless you conform
to the basic doctrines of the system
you're not going to be heard that this
there's a mechanism that begins in
kindergarten that starts filtering
people out for obedience and conformity
and that goes for the schools and the
colleges and the professions and if you
pass through those filters you can take
part and if you start deviating you'll
be put off let's take our next question
please
yeah I just like you to comment on well
this is an observation I think probably
the people who most buy the necessary
illusions are probably the ones who'd be
most surprised to be considered in the
bill wildered herds like people who feel
that they're educated probably make
fifty six thousand a year etc my take on
things is that marginalized groups don't
buy the necessary illusions and their
jargon and everything else reflects that
could you comment on how you think their
role could be you know the role of
marginalized groups the United States
remember the marginalized groups is the
large majority of the population
fragmented yeah I'm fragmented but put
them together that's the overwhelming
majority I think your point is right
well it's hard it's kind of hard to
prove because the poles don't ask the
right questions but my impression was
exactly like yours that the educated
part of the population is the most
indoctrinated and the most deluded and I
think there are good reasons for that I
mean they're the ones who are subjected
to the indoctrination regularly on a
daily basis to be educated means to be
bombarded with propaganda distortion the
illusions is all the time for most of
the population you see what's in your
lives and you can't be deluded about the
things I've just been talking about
because it's right in front of your nose
you know you and and you're not
bombarded by the regular propaganda
because we consider too unimportant
you're just pushed to the side so what
can these people do well they can create
exactly the crisis of democracy that
elites are worried about they can become
organized they can enter the political
arena they can begin to they could take
over of the political system by their
numbers as they should and in fact they
can take over the system of production
as well after all wide yeah why do you
need bosses and managers what role do
they serve other than to enrich
themselves and to distort the process of
production for the interests of the of
the wealthy that's it
let's face it and there's no other need
for them and as long as you have as long
as there's no law of nature that says
that the people in a factory can't run
the factory I can do it better than the
manager they know better what's going on
and so on and so forth alright now you
know if when those issues become on the
agenda you'll have a real crisis of
see and in fact you'll complete the
revolutions that began in the 18th
century and then what cut off
professor chance we have time for one
more question
I just wonder if the opening of the
so-called Iron Curtain threatens any of
our necessary illusions and if you
foresee any changes as a result of that
what's happening behind the iron curtain
a very exciting development too much to
talk about but the way the West is
looking at it they want to they want to
convert Eastern Europe into a kind of a
third world so the idea is to convert
Eastern Europe into Mexico and you know
Dominican Republic and so on make them
easy to rob that's the basic idea so
they too can provide markets and
resources and cheap labor and so on and
so forth it's causing a problem for
propaganda at home because the main way
in which the general population here has
been kept under control for the last 50
years is the Russian threat you can't
wave it anymore
in fact the invasion of Panama was very
interesting in this respect it's so
typical an operation of US violence that
it barely you know merits a footnote but
it was different in one respect it's the
first act of u.s. international violence
in 50 or 60 years that hasn't been
justified on the pretext that we're
defending ourselves from the Russians so
when we invaded Grenada the Dominican
Republic or whatever we're defending
ourselves in the Russians or any
Russians but at least they were over
there we can say we're defending
ourselves from this time you know that
was beyond the imagination even of the
editorial writers in the State
Department so they had to set up a whole
new propaganda framework and in fact
it's interesting the way at work this
problem was foreseen a couple of years
ago and as soon as the United States
decided that Noriega who had been there
there aren't they're thug for decades
they decided that he was getting to
independence and he had to go the media
took the cue and they began a process of
demonization you know they took that
he's a minor criminal by the hutt
standards of the people the United
States support is you know it looks like
a choirboy but they turned him into the
the the major monster since Attila the
Hun
the the drug war which is a complete
hoax in my opinion its drugs is a
serious problem but the drug war is not
directed to it the drug war is largely
designed as a way of controlling the
American population can't terrify them
by the Russians terrify them by you know
narco something-or-other and this was
this was used so Noriega is a minor
is a minor figure in the drug system
less significant than George Bush for
that matter and certainly less
significant than the bankers who are
being put back into power in Panama he's
but he became you know this this
assistant he was somehow turned into the
center of the international drug cartel
well this huge propaganda operation has
been going on for a couple of years and
by the time they've tried various ways
to get rid of Noriega because he was too
independent and you know Panama has to
be under a dossal pliable government so
that we control the canal and so on that
by the time they decided to invade you
know Ted Koppel could get up and say
he's a member of the fraternity of
international villains who Americans
love to hate sure after several years of
demonization why did they love to hate
him in 1989 in 1985 when he was our boy
just as much of a thug then as he is now
Ted Koppel didn't ask that question
because to ask that question would be
immediately to see the necessary
illusions crumble well that's the kind
of problem that the US propaganda system
is facing and will continue to face with
the inability to conjure up the Russian
threat whenever it's needed to justify
more military spending at home or
professor Chomsky I'm afraid we're out
of time I very much appreciate your
comments and their questions from our
audience and it's our hope that this
evening will give people perspective on
the news and where it originates and
also an opportunity to look at the news
and
information we all receive every day and
in enormous quantities from that from a
jaded perspective but from an informed
perspective and we're those that
information may originate and the impact
that it has on our lives thank you very
much for joining us this evening my name
is Seth Carson and goodnight
you
you
