they're working for the interest that
they represent narrow sectors of power
and privilege corporate sector basically
and that's their constituency so yeah
for them control over oil is it's a
lever of world control apart from a
source of enormous profits I mean they
have to be blind not to see this with
the US have invaded Iraq if its main
exports were pickles and lettuce after
an imbecile to think that but that's
what we're supposed to think is it
economic reasons mainly strategic
reasons I mean economic and strategic
which are impossible to distinguish but
since the second world war
I'm on quote the State Department the
Middle East sentient oil producing
regions have been regarded as quote the
words a stupendous source of strategic
power George Kennan State Department
head of the planning section said
control not access control over the
Middle East oil that gives us veto power
over what our rivals might do other
industrial powers you control the
spicket every hand on the spigot you
have a lot of world control
that's not even access to oil I mean
first the roughly thirty years after the
Second World War the US was North
America's major oil producer wasn't
using Middle East oil nonetheless we had
to keep an iron hand of control on
Middle East oil and if the US were to go
to solar energy it's still my control
Billy store because that's a lever of
world control everyone understands it
but we're not allowed to think about it
people in the Middle East and actually
specifically ramzi yousef in Osama bin
Laden I guess they look at us and
they're afraid of our military might I
wasn't sold specifically about when we
dropped two bombs and fire bombing of
Japan the two nuclear bombs and then
even after Hiroshima
I remember when one of your books you
mentioned that we continued there was
one more bombing raid even after
Nagasaki the final raid you could read
about in the official Air Force history
it's not just
the final raid was on the day of Japan's
surrender they wanted to have kind of a
grand finale so HAP Arnold the commander
managed to put together a thousand
planes so be a big big managerial job so
they could have a thousand plane raid
undefeated Japan the raid was carried
out after the surrender but before it
was officially received so technically
war was on carried out a thousand plane
raid granted well-known Japanese
novelist Coco who was a child at the
time in Osaka he said that he reported
later and I was agreed that with the
bombs that were coming leaflets saying
Japan surrendered that was the grand
finale
that's five days after Nagasaki
