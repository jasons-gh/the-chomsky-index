constitute an axis of evil arming to
threaten the Peace of the world given
the impotence of the media it's the duty
of intellectuals to speak out and they
don't come much more intellectual than
Chomsky he's credited with the central
theory in the field of linguistics that
humans have an innate capacity for
language that is hardwired into the
brain his very name has become a byword
for the study of communication
this is nim chimpsky NIM jokingly named
after the great linguist Noam Chomsky
with the great hope of animal
communication in the 1970s but his
politics inspire rather less affection
his comments post 9/11 when he described
the u.s. as a leading terrorist State
through hostile fire even from allies on
the left but at 74 Chomsky shows no sign
of relenting in his speeches in writing
he has the gloves back on denouncing
Western greed and hypocrisy we need not
rehearse the reasons why Britain and
later the United States have been
determined to control the Gulf region
it's enough to recall the observation of
the State Department in 1945 that the
resources of the region are a stupendous
source of strategic power and one of the
greatest material prizes in world
history
his most recent work is entitled pirates
and emperors I asked him first about the
title
that's plagiarized from Saint Augustine
who in the City of God as a story about
Alexander his forces capture a pirate
and there's an audience between the
pirate and the Emperor and he asks the
pirate how dare you molest the seas and
the pirate asks him tell tells him I'm a
small man with a tiny boat so they call
me a pirate now you're an emperor with a
vast Navy and you molest the world but
they call you an emperor and that's a
good allegory for the world and in
particular the contemporary world the
Pirates are the ones who were condemned
and not the Emperor's of course the
general population is attacked by both
the Emperor's and the Pirates so it's
not that the pirate st. Augustine is not
saying that the pirate is a nice fellow
he's just saying he's a small criminal
that's compared with a major criminal so
who does control the world who are the
Empress overwhelmingly the United States
since the Second World War Britain
before then and concentrations of
private power which are enormous and a
tyrannical corporation is closely linked
to the powerful States it's a network of
a concentrated power with interested
international institutions like the IMF
and so on which are called they
sometimes call themselves the masters of
the world that's a phrase that was in
the Financial Times a little ironically
but not not wrong actually they call
themselves the Masters of the Universe
Adam Smith called themselves the masters
of the world now they're called the
Masters to the universe didn't have
Space Age and Smith's time but don't you
sometimes need big government to deal
with big business that in a sense there
is a kind of balance between these large
forces yes it's like saying there's that
ones between two members of the board of
directors of General
Motors yes there's there's some kind of
a balance but they're so closely
interlinked and connected that they're
the first approximation of the same
thing now did September the 11th do you
think market change in world politics
historic event that's the first time in
hundreds of years that the West Europe
and its offshoots have suffered the kind
of criminal atrocity that they
constantly carry out against others
which is quite a change it's why they
said shock in the West this kind of
thing we do to you you don't do it to us
and it's like the reaction in England
when at the time of the so-called Indian
Mutiny rebellion in India tremendous
shock that's what we do to them use it
as a opportunity to intensify repressive
and some violent actions and that's just
what's happened so the Russians took it
as an opportunity to step up their
atrocities in Chechnya assuming
correctly that they would be authorized
by Washington at least tacitly China did
the same in western China Indonesia and
watch a Israel and the occupied
territories and run through the list in
the I mean countries ranging from the
Central Asian dictatorships to
democratic societies like the United
States and others I have used it as an
opportunity to clamp down on their own
citizens now looking at the the current
situation when do you think is it right
to intervene in the affairs of another
nation I think there are conditions
under which that would be possible I
mean one basic condition is that other
that nonviolent you mean violent
intervention that nonviolent means have
been exhausted it's one condition a
second condition is that the people of
the country in which you're intervening
support the intervention
under those conditions and you can think
of others intervention would be
justified however we don't ever apply
this conditions XA South Africa under
apartheid there's no doubt that the
overwhelming majority of the population
would have favored intervention probably
military intervention the other means
had been tried for decades did anybody
think of a forceful intervention of
course not
nor did I or take a recent case East
Timor during the 1999 there were very
large-scale atrocities going on the
population undoubtedly would have been
delighted in military intervention
well Britain in the United States did
intervene namely by supporting Indonesia
but the name I think of moving to do
something else of course not in fact
Britain was sending jets to Indonesia
even after the Australian led
peacekeeping forces entered
that's the way the great powers
intervene now you make quite a lot in
the book of the fact that there is
freedom of expression in America but
what you do point to is there something
more insidious because you suggest that
there is actually though there may be
freedom of expression there's a control
of freedom of thought now how does that
happen it was understood back kind of
the First World War that it's becoming
much more difficult to control people by
force
the popular struggles have led to the
development of unions a parliamentary
Labour Party franchise is extended and
so on and coercion is just not going to
work by force so therefore we have to
control thought it's very striking that
the contemporary systems of thought
control which are highly developed very
self-conscious so you know leaders talk
all about it they come from England in
the United States so the British
Ministry of Information which any reader
of or will knows what it was that's from
the first world war it was aimed
primarily
to convert a pacifist population into
raving Andy German fanatics and it
worked and it impressed people it
impressed the business world that's the
origins of the modern public relations
industry impressed American
intellectuals who developed the
conception of what they called
manufacture of consent control of
thought impressed Hitler who blamed the
German defeat on superior angle of
American propaganda and vowed that next
time Germany would be prepared and it is
latent in England in the United the
United States primarily England
secondarily two huge industries devoted
to control of thought and attitudes
because you cannot control people by
force but dissent has been growing since
the 1960s in the Western world and
people are far more sophisticated now
even popular culture reflects the fact
that anything from the x-files to the
film The Insider that the idea of people
discussing things of trying to
manipulate public opinion I mean that's
highly developed not sure but when
people were under the lash they knew
about it too yeah people are so aware of
it that it has led to tremendous
cynicism about almost anything I mean
nobody really believes what government
officials say nobody believes what they
read in the press people don't believe
professions it's a that's led to
enormous cynicism and tremendous
opposition in fact I didn't in my view
the more crucial things than the ones
you mentioned or opposition to
aggression I mean I could just take a
look at the current war in Iraq and
compare it with say the Vietnam War it's
a comparison which is often made the
protest but the the comparison is
completely false the opposition to the
war in Iraq is far greater than it ever
was in the to the war in Vietnam at any
remotely comparable stage this is the
first war and I think in European
history Europe in the United States the
first one I can think of where there was
massive protest before the war that's
never happened I mean in the case of the
Vietnam where wasn't no there was no
protest until years after the
I mean just in the last 30 or 40 years
some say the United States the level of
civilization among the general public
not intellectuals in separate category
but among the general public it's an
advanced enormous Li so do you think
that intellectuals are not sufficiently
engaged do you think they have become
cynical intellectuals are a separate
category intellectuals are mostly
servants of power I'm talking about the
general public not the intellectual
world they remain pretty constant I
don't think there's a subject to these
changes and except marginally and of
course to some extent but they're quite
different and quite generally it goes
right through history intellectuals have
been servants of power take say the
first world war on all sides of Germany
England the United States and France
intellectuals were extremely
enthusiastic about the war that there
were a few dissenters and the best-known
of them ended up in jail I'd like
Bertrand Russell for example or Eugene
Debs in the United States or Rosa
Luxemburg in Germany very small group of
critics some of them best-known in
prison but most intellectuals were
enthusiastic ountry and that's common it
remains common
I mean intellectuals write history so
you have to be a little cautious about
what they say about themselves and it
looks prettier when it's written in
books so do you then think it's a
failure of the left then in the United
States that if there is this feeling
that that a war is not right that there
isn't more actual political action about
it depends what you mean by the left I
mean the left what I mean by the left is
out in the meeting with the public all
the time down the street so their
meetings of thousands of people the
biggest university in the country in the
University of Texas came out with a
strong Gandy war declaration that's
never happened
past go-to working-class towns and
thousands of people show up for
demonstrations and meetings that's what
I'd call the left it's not the
articulate left but then the articulate
left is never permitted expression so
during the Vietnam War
you didn't hear them either I'm in The
New York Times for example the would
never permit a comment by someone on the
left committed to the involved in the
peace movement maybe a sentence either
than they did but that standard as far
as your attitude is to government is
concerned I mean you are have been known
for many decades as being an agitator
against what you see is bad government I
mean some people have wondered sometimes
whether perhaps you could have alongside
the criticizing criticism offered a
little more in the way of solutions as
well it's plenty of solutions in fact
that's all all I and other people offer
the solutions often the solutions are
don't carry out crimes that's the
simplest solution so if you want to
reduce terrorism in the world let's say
there's one very simple solution stop
participating in it now that would does
n't end everything but it cuts back the
amount of terror by quite a notable
amount so that's a simple solution if
you want to look at other more complex
cases they say the israel-palestine
problem I think there's a solution
namely the one that the large majority
of the American population support which
happens to be the international
consensus on a two-state settlement that
the US government rejects okay so the
there's a solution for you let's just
follow the will of the American
population and go through the list for
example on the Sun and say environmental
issues it was plenty of solution it's
claimed that what you say is correct
that's what's claimed by the
intellectual world that no solutions are
offered by the critics that's just
nonsense it's just they don't like the
solutions since you first started in
political activism in the 60s do you
feel that you have made a great deal of
headway I think the country has made a
great
and happy to participate in it but it's
not traceable to individuals these are
mass popular movements and big changes
in culture it's across the board if you
go back to the 60s for example there was
no feminist movement there was no
environmental movement there were no
third world solidarity movements there
was no substantial
and nuclear movement no global justice
movements I mean these are all
developments in the last 20 or 30 years
and they come from all over the place
for example they saw party which are
quite unique there's never been a time
when people from the aggressor country
went to the victims and lived with them
to try to protect them that happened in
the eighties tens of thousands of
Americans did it and they came from
conservative circles a lot of it was
church base and it came from Main Street
in the United States and now it's all
over the world so you have people saying
the occupant Israeli occupied
territories in Colombia and all over are
trying to help the victims and yet you
say there's this groundswell of support
on Main Street and yet you have a
right-wing government there in
Washington at the moment and you have a
great discrepancy between the way that
the rest of the world increasingly views
the United States and the way that the
people of the United States view
themselves I'm take say you have the
international economic arrangement of
what are called the free trade
agreements so they don't know what to do
with free trade there's overwhelming
public opposition to them that's why
these issues never arise in elections if
you take a look at the it exclude issue
that a certain category of issues namely
those on which the public is opposed to
the elites those just don't arise and
that's because that's part of the
technique of marginalizing the public
and as you mentioned before that's not
that people are unaware of it they know
it so before the year 2000 election
about 75% of the population
regarded as a complete force but in
which case I mean what happens to
transfer that kind of feeling into any
kind of action because at the moment you
have people who actually although they
may be in favor of the idea of more
self-government having more control over
their destinies they're pushed to the
limits just trying to you know keep
their families together keep their jobs
don't one thing there isn't going to be
that that's the heart of the technique
of control whatever sounds good breath
and then is that well why isn't it gonna
be broken I mean slavery was broken you
look over history one after another form
of coercion and control has been broken
as the Soviet system was collapsed from
inside every system of tyranny we know
about an oppression has been people chip
away at it and it ultimately collapses
there's nothing special about the time
of the ones the petrol systems of power
that exists now are quite fragile and
they know it so the World Economic Forum
for example is well aware that's what
the Financial Times called the Masters
of the Universe
they're well aware of how fragile their
control is and concerned about it and
rightly what I wonder though is how you
square your fundamental optimism about
human nature with what seems to be a
pretty pessimistic analysis of what's
happening in the world famous phrase
that was borrowed by Graham XI and that
we should have pessimism of the
intellect and optimism of the will
professor Chomsky thank you very much
my next stop is Vietnam
and it's five six seven when I heard of
gates well
