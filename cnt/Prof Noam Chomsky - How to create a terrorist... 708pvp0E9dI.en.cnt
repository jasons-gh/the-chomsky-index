well we don't want to impose any brand
of democracy abroad the best allies of
the United States and England and the
Arab and Muslim worlds have been brutal
dictatorships and still are and both
Britain and the United States have a
long history of supporting extremist
radical Islam as a barrier against
secular nationalism which is what
they're really afraid of it's a very
good good study coming out on British
policy more curtis's latest value among
British foreign policy but the same is
true of the United States I mean the
most extreme radical Islamist state is
Saudi Arabia and it's in fact the center
of creating the culture of jihadism snow
it's not an accident that the 9/11 the
bomber said mostly came from Saudi
Arabia or that Osama bin Laden did yeah
that's the culture that they've been
district distributing the addresses in
Pakistan and so on with strong US and
Israel and British support Pakistan as
well Pakistan and you know Saudi Arabia
became this sate state centers of jihadi
style terrorism main allies and there's
a long record of this this is just a
small part of it in fact US and British
support for Israel that comes largely
from the fact that Israel destroyed
secular Arab nationalism and defended
Saudi Arabia that's just that was the
background for the 1967 war when US
policy towards Israel shifted radically
to its present form and everyone knows
that in the 1980s the United States
Britain that helped tried to organize
radical the most extreme radical
islamists it could find all over the
world to send him to Afghanistan and to
train them and not to liberate
Afghanistan that would have been a
legitimate objective order but to kill
Russians in fact that was made explicit
CIA station chief in Pakistan who was
running it said look we're not gonna
liberate Afghanistan's not our interest
we're gonna kill Russians okay that's
what you want to do yeah meanwhile
Reagan and Thatcher were happily
watching madrasas Saudi Arabian funded
madrasahs spread over Pakistan at
creating the culture of jihadism funded
by Saudi Arabia under the most brutal
dictator Pakistan has ever had therefore
the greatest friend of Thatcher and
Reagan zeal fuck also watching him
develop nuclear weapons and pretending
they didn't knows so that he could keep
aiding him and so on so terrorism is
about suppressing terrorism is just not
a high priority of States it's easy to
demonstrate this I think the invasion of
Iraq is another example I mean when the
US and Britain invaded Iraq they were
aware I mean that is very likely to
increase terrorism in fact that was the
analysis by the intelligence agencies
and experts and so on and it happened
terrorism increased by a factor of seven
in the year following the invasion
according to US government data well
yeah that's just not a high priority so
terrorism is a real thing that if you
want to deal with it there's a couple of
ways of doing it one way is to stop your
own terrorism that makes a big dent in
it the other is to stop supporting the
sources that encourage it another is to
pace it just to do what the British
finally did in Ireland pay a little bit
of attention to the grievances that lead
people to give at least sympathetic ear
sometimes direct support for terrorism
and in those and the terrorists of
course criminals so
the criminals apprehend them given fair
trials and so on that's the way to do it
none of this is being done let me just
take fair trials there are people
kidnapped actually they claim captured
and all over the place Afghanistan and
wherever they were and they're sent to
we know where they're sent to the sent
to Guantanamo I look grave Bagram and so
on where they're tortured brutally and
that creates terrorists in fact the you
know the people on the ground who work
there the interrogators and others the
intelligence people they say that I've a
great have a grave in Guantanamo
probably created more terrorists and
then that's not even Laden ever did yeah
sure that's way to do it if you want but
to say that they're trying to combat
terrorism was just a joke
