we are fortunate to have with us
professor Noam Chomsky laureate
professor of linguistics at the
University of Arizona norm ski is the
founder of the modern science of
linguistics and of cognitive sir of
cognitive science
he is also perhaps the world's most
avidly read and followed social and
political commentator today and indeed
has been so for five decades
welcome norm it's wonderful to see you
know what has Kovan 19 taught us about
inequality in the modern world it has
brought out very sharply the
extraordinary inequality that has been
of course always there but greatly
exaggerated through the neoliberal
period and it's also brought out it in
the United States particularly its
racial character so if you look at the
growth statistics in the United States
after 40 years of neoliberalism 0.1% not
1% 0.1% of the population have
accumulated 20% of the wealth
half the population has negative net
worth about 70 percent go from paycheck
to paycheck now that's if they have a
paycheck many live in the precarious
economy where soul up to the boss
whether to call you today and then if
you look further it's highly
disproportionately racially divided so
among blacks it's far worse this is of
course the residue of 400 years of
vicious repression now coming the light
when you see something like the Floyd
murder all of this is in the background
and the president who
malice has new limits is trying right in
the middle of this to make it worse
quietly so for example wool everyone's
concerned with the pandemic he managed
to eliminate regulations on polluting
plants they are now allowed to pour
mercury into drinking water to increase
air pollution kovat 19 is a respiratory
disease what happens when you pollute
the atmosphere more you kill people who
do you kill the people living near the
polluting plants because they can't
afford to live anywhere else who are
they blacks and Hispanics
so Floyd is one murder Trump is
murdering many bored Lex same thing when
he orders the workers back to the
meatpacking plants because rich
Americans need sirloin steak who are
they
blacks and Hispanics they work under
miserable conditions and no labor rights
have almost disappeared right through
the new liberal period worse no so
forced them back to where they're gonna
be killed by coronavirus because we want
our meat goes beyond the factories in
Mexico on the border or producing the
leather seats for us cars so Trump wants
to force them to go back to work even
though the government says that
conditions are too horrible right now
the Republican Party is trying to ram
through legislation which will grant
immunity to employers who force their
employees back to work
under conditions which will leave them
to die of the disease
again disproportionately black and
hispanic we could go on I mean all of
this is I can't honestly say coming to
light because most of it is under the
radar that it's happening and the people
who suffer from it know it obviously
they may not know the details of it
what's happening but they can see it in
their lives do you see a possibility of
fundamental change in the role of the
public authority or public intervention
by the state in capitalist societies as
a consequence of the pandemic there's a
possibility but it's going to be a lot
of work I mean there is for example in
the United States a huge stimulus
program that's supposed to it does help
some people but the money doesn't go to
the pockets of working people goes to
banks our little goes to people most of
it goes to banks to administer okay if
you're a CEO of a big bank and you have
a pile of money come in for the
government for you to administer what
are you gonna do with it well we can
guess so
I won't even have to spell it out
because it's too obvious
then of course there is a supervisor to
make sure that it's all honest steve
minuchin secretary of the treasury who
so deep in Trump's pocket you can't find
it so he's taking care to make sure it's
all honest so yes there are
possibilities but the amount of work to
be done in a deeply corrupt society like
the United States is enormous I mean it
was bad enough before Trump but his
wrecking ball is really devastating the
society harming the United States
enormous Lee of course I know it's a
laughingstock in the world but he
doesn't care his
constituency of extreme wealth and
corporate power are doing fine enriching
themselves more the rest of the world
may dislike or even hate the United
States but who cares they're afraid of
it and rightly they have every reason to
be afraid so Europe may make miles
objections that something the Trump does
but they're not going to step on his
toes so much too dangerous the United
States has withdrawn from w-h-o take the
WH o I mean it has its flaws it's big
bureaucratic institution it's gone
because it's held back by the
participating states it's going to be
slow it's gonna make mistakes I mean
that's inevitable overall its
performance is very good it's keeping
people alive unknown numbers of people
in Africa Yemen other places who just
rely on WH o of medical services for
survival from all kinds of diseases now
of course it's going to get worse with
thee the coronavirus coming in and
devastating the poor countries so what
does Trump do try to kill it
withdrawal from it defund it I think the
US had provided maybe 40 percent of the
funds so let's pull out and try to
destroy the organization why of course
this kills slaughters huge numbers of
people why because it might improve his
electoral prospects he's flailing around
desperately to try to find some
scapegoat to cover up his crimes against
Americans I'm he's directly responsible
for killing tens of thousands of
Americans can't let that be on the books
we have to blame it on someone else
so let's blame it on the WHI oh man if
that happens to slaughter huge numbers
of people who cares
and in fact does anyone say anything
about this do you read it in the
European press they don't say so you
know it's just poor black people
okay so we'll kill more of them that's
the world we're living in is it correct
to talk in terms of a post kovat 19:00
world does the pandemic represent a
transformative point well what's gonna
be a post pandemic world depends on what
people are doing right now I mean there
are people the ones with the power the
ones who created the neoliberal disaster
the ones were benefiting from Trump's
malice they're working they're working
very hard relentlessly to try to ensure
that the world that comes out from the
pandemic will be structurally much like
the one that caused it even harsher more
authoritarian more controls more
surveillance they're working on right
now things like I mentioned the
deregulation many other ways there are
counter forces all over the world very
significant ones if they can be brought
together and form a powerful force they
can change the way things will turn out
and there are steps in that direction
about two weeks ago the that was the
first announcement of progressive
international that's based on the
Sanders movement in the United States
Yanis varoufakis is the m25 in Europe
transnational organization in Europe
seeking to preserve what makes sense in
the European Union and overcome the
deeply flawed parts of it they're
forming a progressive international
voices from
all over the world from India Africa
global South the United States Europe
the prime minister of Iceland as a
member in the first meeting will be in
Iceland in September now they're trying
to create a different world how will
this conflict emerge you can never
predict but it's going on right now
it'll intensify as there are the
beginnings of decline of the pandemic
there will be recovery we should bear in
mind what we're talking about this
though the fact virtual fact we are
ultimately going to recover from the
pandemic that terrible cost we will
never recover from the melting of the
polar ice sheets and other grim
consequences of global warming which are
going to have a hideous effect on the
world South Asia will become
uninhabitable in an over several more
decades if we continue on our present
course that's just the beginning we're
not going to recover from that and what
are the governments of the world doing
let's take a look
some of them are doing something
including India not enough but something
the country that's doing most is the
most powerful country in the world it's
racing to Russia tough towards the abyss
Trump is pulling out all the stops to
try to maximize use the fossil fuels and
to eliminate any regulatory apparatus
that might mitigate them and for a good
reason that enriches his rich friends
and increases corporate power and if it
leads to the destruction of the
organized human life
it's not an issue even small that takes
a trumps tearing up the agreement with
Iran
[Music]
why because Obama made the agreement so
he has to tear it up for his own ego the
effects are pretty serious now that's I
mean quite apart from the horrible
effects on Iran
it's a highly sharply increasing the
threat of major war in the region Europe
doesn't like it are they doing anything
no they don't want you when the u.s.
imposes sanctions the only country in
the world that can do this everyone in
the world has to obey the sanctions
their third party sanctions so Europe
doesn't want to be thrown out of the
international financial system and it
doesn't want to anger the Mafia done in
Washington so they make timid protests
and then they observe the sanctions and
go along Trump came out with what's
called the greatest deal in history for
for the Middle East if any other country
had put that out people wouldn't if
they'd even noticed they'd be collapsing
and ridicule when the Trump comes out
with it it's the law now we ask how we
can implement it does it go too far and
so on this is awesome power no one else
comes close and no one else is going to
come close all the talk about you know
China becoming in a competing superpower
I think is built on sand in this
situation
what are the rays of light from what do
we gain hope in the present time for
example the reaction to the Floyd
killing all over the country protests
have masses of people for testing
compare it with the closest analogue
1992 Rodney King the black man and Los
Angeles correctly beaten to death by
police now they came to trial they were
acquitted well there were enormous
protests and riots afterwards in Los
Angeles 60 people were killed though
they had to call in federal troops to
control them it was very little protest
any worlds
I mean people said things but not a lot
well compared to today two big change
well I think that's a sign that at least
parts of the population are becoming
more civilized parts becoming more aware
more understanding now that's a big step
forward not enough but a step forward
and it's points to the method that has
to be used to try to overcome the poison
of 400 years of vicious racist
repression attitudes have to be changed
understanding has to be changed and
changing laws is okay as some effect but
unless the basic recognition of the
world changes the laws will not diminish
and it is happening slowly but it's
happening
and it can escalate so that's a sign of
hope you can find things
no you have been to care-a-lot twice and
I know you keep in touch with the
situation here what comments do you have
on Kerala in the present situation
and the development prospects ahead of
us well the last time I spent time in
Kerala with you mostly it was quite
remarkable to see the differences
between Kerala poor State and the rest
of India tell another nextdoor other
parts of India curves also travelled I
mean it's pretty remarkable to drive
down the streets in Kerala instead of
seeing the people banging on your window
pleading for the rupee seeing people
sitting then boards reading a newspaper
and the things like that it's just
different and now of course it's I mean
I'm not there but reading about it the
differences between Kerala and the rest
of India and the rest of most of the
world and reacting to the crisis are
quite startling the minutes it's quite
amazing to see the reactions around the
world not just Kerala that take Vietnam
let me know smashed to pieces by us
violent they haven't had a single death
they're right on the blue 14-under
kilometer border with China no single
recorded death no take myself Korea very
heart hit very hard by the virus right
away
they haven't had a lockdown everyone's
tested they use the optimal trades
contact quarantine methods he's pretty
much controlled Taiwan pretty much
controlled Hong Kong same New Zealand
quickly wiped it out Australia almost
gone
the United States over a hundred
thousand deaths and mounting one of the
most astonishing cases
is the European Union it's called a
union there's a rich country Germany the
dynamic center of the European Union
they've done reasonably will they had
exit they didn't use the US system of
business run models for hospitals and
the US hospitals are businesses a
business has no spare capacity
you don't waste money to have an extra
bed there to have diagnostic facilities
you just it's like an assembly line
you know waste money so of course if
anything happens it's a catastrophe that
Germany had extra hospital facilities
extra diagnostic facilities they adhere
to the neoliberal plague but not with
that fanaticism of the United States so
they were able to deal with it and have
a pretty low death rate therein not
terrible shape
now there's another country to the south
of Germany not very far it's called
Italy the north of Italy they had a
severe pandemic slowly getting over it
but it's bed do you see German doctors
in northern Italy the European Union
remember to see help coming from rich
Germany to suffering Italy while you
actually do see help from Cuba the
country that's been under the US heal
for 60 years the Terrorism economic
warfare poor country sending thousands
of doctors to help people in Italy and
other countries you do we see occasional
mention of this in the United States the
mansion is look how terrible
totalitarian Cuba is they're forcing
doctors to go abroad the
terrible to tell at Aryan State okay
that's the liberal press incidentally
well that's the were over living it so a
lot of work to do quite a lot everywhere
right here
thank you very much norm for your time
it was as always excellent to speak to
you
