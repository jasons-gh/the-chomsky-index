well that's a lot of things have
happened since the last decade but my
own view is that nothing that's happened
makes that outcome impossible they make
it harder but I don't think it makes it
impossible so in my view at least this
possibility is still an open it's
possible to implement the position of
the entire world mine aside from the
rejection estates and international law
maybe with some modification because of
what's happened since well that's about
where we stand now the question is what
are the options that what can we do
about it and we means people here this
is ultimately a decision for citizens of
the United States we have the decisive
vote on this it's not something that
people are you know recalcitrant
opponents are arguing about out there
it's right here there are several
options one option is the overwhelming
international consensus accepted by
essentially everyone and explicitly an
accord with the international law World
Court Security Council resolutions and
so on so for example when you read in
the papers that much of the world
doesn't accept the legitimacy of the
Israeli occupation is kind of an
understatement that means the entire
world outside of the United States and
Israel that's the way you have to read
that
maybe find somebody in costa rica who
doesn't agree but essentially that's
what i said is correct but so one
possibility is that the rejection
estates will change the position Israel
is not going to change its position as
long as the United States supports it
that countries don't give things up they
don't need it for security in fact it
harms their security is pretty much
recognized but as the head of the
Israeli Air Force says their rights none
later President as he explained back in
nineteen seventy we don't want the
occupied to the occupied territories
don't contribute their security fact
they probably harm but without them we
can't live at the scale and quality and
power that we desire works approximately
to that effect and that's essentially
the point as long as the United States
backs it up it'll continue and the
United States is backing it up so for
example right now there's supposed to be
a conflict between Obama and Netanyahu
over settlement expansion there's not
much of a conflict if you look at
Obama's wording or Clinton's wording
it's extremely mild Netanyahu and the
other hand
very raison arrogant and has every right
to be he says what we're going to go
ahead and do it wouldn't care what you
think her with the world thinks he's
right Obama has already made it clear to
him that the United States is going to
continue to support the expansion of the
settlements so why shouldn't he said
he's been criticized see any faces
criticism maybe shouldn't be that brazen
maybe should you know fault his
arrogance in this Obama's face or
something bad tactics but basically it's
correct Obama when he came into office
it was asked if he made a big a lot of
talk about how he's going to settle the
israel-palestine problem and he said at
the time well we were opposed to
expansion of the settlements we want to
keep to what's called the road map the
road map was an agreement of fort for
the partners in the United States Europe
Russia the United Nations quartet they
agreed a couple of years ago on a what
they called a roadmap for settlement of
the issue and the first step was no
expansion of sevens no natural growth no
nothing so Obama was simply saying okay
I endorse what the four participants
laid down as the roadmap one of the
charges against Hamas is that they don't
accept the road man
whether they do or not the debate but
it's an interesting charge because the
US and Israel immediately rejected
Israel technically except that it this
is Prime Minister Sharon but they
immediately added 14 reservations which
completely undermined it now the media
here were polite enough not to report
this activists knew it you could do you
written talks but it broke through to
the public or almost did in President
Carter's former President Carter's book
Israel one was called peace or apartheid
in that book for the first time in the
mainstream the reservations were
articulated and in fact is to make it
should make sure to know whom is it
there's an appendix which listen if you
read them you see that they simply
undermine the roadmap the United States
essentially accepted them it's kind of
intriguing that Carter's book elicited a
huge surer than much discussion right
here as well but I've never seen a
reference to the one new fact that was
brought up in his book not new to people
who've been following closely but new to
the public sieving fine one but it's a
was so Israel and the United States have
me dicted the roadmap and when Obama
came in and said well I'd like to keep
to the roadmap he was immediately asked
in a press conference
spokes people were asked what are you
going to do about it if Israel continues
to expand the settlements and the answer
was nothing he was then asked well this
is only symbolic they said he was asked
are you going to do what President
George Bush number one did you may
remember in 1991 George Bush number one
and James Baker or Secretary of State
who are kind of patricians they don't
like to be insulted they were pretty
upset by the fact that Israel was
purposely insulting them so when James
Baker would go to Israel you know as
soon as he'd land the Prime Minister
shamir would publicly announce we're
starting in her settlement just saying I
won't repeat the words but you know what
they are and the Baker in life I'd like
to insult that to his face and Bush
didn't like it so they imposed a penalty
free mild penalty but they said they
would withhold loan guarantees to the
extent of in scale that Israel was using
to expand settlements was a mild penalty
but real and Israel immediately back
down as the oldest nuke they'll confront
us power that crazy so they changed from
show me ur to Paris Paris's more
westernized he understands the norms of
Western hypocrisy that's why it's
considered a wonderful diplomat he
didn't
when Baker showed up he didn't announce
a settlement that day he said yes mr.
Baker we agreed on our settlements and
two weeks later they started the
settlement which is fine for Bush and
Baker than in here just didn't want to
be insulted they didn't oppose the
policies when this continued during lead
which one years when Clinton came in he
essentially backed off from he didn't
drop the policy but he permitted he gave
Israel the authority to determine the
expenses that were being devoted to so
an expansion you can imagine what the
results of that were elicited
considerable ridicule and the Israeli
press properly though that essentially
ended when Obama was asked whether he
would do anything like that he said no
his spokesperson said no this is we're
just what we're doing is only symbolic
which is telling Prime Minister
Netanyahu go ahead and do it like
essentially what it amounts to so when
he insults Obama to his face as they
just did a couple of days ago he has
some justice on his side that's what
Obama essentially told them to do and
he's doing the but this and we should
bear in mind that settlement expansion
is a footnote anyway the issues not
settlement expansion it's the settlement
that's the issue it's
expansion of course is illegal too but
the settlements themselves early for the
