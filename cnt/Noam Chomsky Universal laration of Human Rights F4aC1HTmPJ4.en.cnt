the second annual social action lecture
series here at the Unitarian
Universalist Church of Marblehead my
name is Tony Toledo buff were a liberal
religious group we've got this idea that
has sprouted to have different people
come over here and speak as a community
service now to me it's very amazing that
this woman standing here is able to call
different folks last year we had
inaugurated our series with Howard Zinn
and our delightful speaker tonight
Jackie had contacted wrote letters and
he's agreed to come over so to introduce
our speaker
Jackie Wattenberg
this is going to be a night to remember
we've been waiting for this for so long
professor Chomsky has spoken
all around the world there's currently a
country that he has missed in his
speaking tours all right if they can not
invited him to speak there and if books
have been translated all around the
world
he's an eminent professor of linguistics
at MIT as Bentley and all this books are
used in colleges as textbooks all around
the world
matter of fact my daughter uses textbook
book in the University of Illinois in
Chicago it looks hard our numerous humor
prolific writer who stylistics he writes
about cars political philosophy
International Affairs public policy
politics of oppression anywhere in the
world a snap English books by the way
are great up here in the table
afterwards if you'd like to look at them
and buy some he'll be willing to assign
them for you this evening after the
lecture when his books are published
they are usually reviewed all around the
world make countries such as Canada
England Ireland even Japan there are two
countries though that have been a little
bit neglectful reviewing his books
through the years the Soviet Union and
the United States his honors are ready
to make a site about television a few
the honorary degrees from the University
of Chicago University
rania University of London the
distinguished plants awarded by candy
store
he received the appealed whole award and
Japan and 1988 the George Orwell award
and he has been in Bertrand Russell's
memorial lecturer at Cambridge in
England the Nehru Memorial Lecture at
New Delhi the John Locke lecture at
Oxford and a research fellow at high
risk and cognitive space down there
right here like me you may have been for
term and certain things occurring in our
country through the recent years or so
many years is getting on the Lord animal
or the Gulf War NAFTA these things you
are concerned about you think well it's
sort of a beret suit it won't happen
again with us try to stop this
but since I've been acquainted with the
running an old Chomsky and hear him on
tape and in the lectures I realized that
he has seen through his brilliant
insights a sort of large glowing honor
that type all the incidents together and
redefines and glue some purpose so I'm
very happy that he's going to speak to
us tonight
unexplained topic never know exactly
what I mean until he gets delved into it
bringing the third world home democracy
and human rights in the New World Order
No Child
[Applause]
the only nothing was gonna tip over when
I stepped on it okay yeah I made it
well that title was picked to be broad
enough to include just about anything
and maybe a good starting point is human
rights they are at least there's a well
accepted standard so it codified in fact
universally accepted the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights passed by
the General Assembly of the United
Nations unanimously in December 1948 has
the force of recognized as having the
force of law in the United States
furthermore the United States has been
very prominent in defending the
principle of the universality of the of
the Universal Declaration you'll recall
last year there was big conference in
Vienna with a lot of publicity and very
impassioned rhetoric the US was taking
the lead in defending the principle of
universality against various backward
third-world countries that were claiming
that this was a these were Western
standards which didn't apply to them on
the US was denouncing this cultural
relativism and finally won a grand
victory and the Universal Declaration
was again endorsed that rhetoric is
rarely besmirched by any look at what
the what the text says and it's an
interesting text there's a lot to say
about it
for example there are articles of the
Declaration and have quite direct
bearing on things happening right now
for example in the Caribbean and then
the Middle East there's time later I
couldn't talk about that but I'm short
so I'll just keep to some of the
articles parts of the Declaration that
have a much broader significance and
that tie in with the larger topics that
I want to review a bit so let's have a
look first that article 25 for example
article 25 says that everyone has the
right to a standard of living adequate
for the health and well-being of himself
and his family including food
housing and medical care and necessary
social services and the right to
security obscurity in the event of
unemployment sickness disability
widowhood old age or other lack of
livelihood in circumstances beyond his
control
well that's article 25 and I won't waste
any time discussing how that principle
is upheld in the richest country in the
world with absolutely unparalleled
advantages so it's certainly no reason
why it cannot be adhered to in full
country that has poverty level twice as
high as any other in the industrial
world that has millions of children
suffering malnutrition under third world
conditions and other phenomena that are
familiar to you or that you can easily
see by taking a walk in the nearest city
well that's article 25 so we plainly are
defending the validity of that one so
let's have a look at article 23 says
everyone has the right to work to free
choice of employment to justin
favourable conditions of work and to
protection against unemployment with
equal pay for equal work and just in
favorable remuneration ensuring for
himself and his family in existence
worthy of human dignity and supplemented
if necessary by other means of social
protection furthermore everyone has a
right to form and to join trade unions
for the protection of his interests and
so you remember this is 1948 so the
reference to himself and his family
reflects the consciousness of that day
not this day in some improvements well
again that's that's part of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
which we uphold against all comers
against third world countries with their
cultural relativism has the force of law
in the United States just take a look at
the last part everyone has a right to
form and join trade unions technically
there is such a right in the United
States but that's just a technical right
there's an array of legal and other
administrative conditions which have
essentially eroded that right and it
doesn't in fact exist in fact the United
States was brought before the
International Labor Organization about
two years ago and condemned for its
violation of the right to form unions
that's very rare for the ILO to condemn
an industrial country almost never
happens the United States the United
States was the only country at that time
outside of South Africa in the
industrial world that allowed the use of
strike breakers to undermine the
permanent replacement workers we call
them here scabs in other words to
undermine the right of workers to to the
rights guaranteed by article 23 the that
the destruction of unions in the United
States which has preceded quite
significantly since the since the 1930s
that since since workers finally run one
in the 1930s the rights that they had in
most of the rest of the world and then
had for a long time but that was very
quickly eroded and by now
unions are reduced to fairly marginal
phenomenon and that's had a very
significant effect one effect that it's
had is on lowering wages so Lawrence
Katz who's the chief economist of the US
Labor Department recently suggested that
that's the main fact that the
instruction of unions is probably the
main factor in the very sharp reduction
of wages that's taken place in the
United States now to the lowest level in
the industrial world return to that the
another effect of the elimination of
unions is in violation of article 23 is
just undermining of democratic processes
generally unions are after all one of
the few mechanisms by which poor people
ordinary people can get together to
their own concerns and interests in the
political arena when they do so
incidentally that arouses considerable
antagonism even Hysterium that just
happened a couple of months ago I'll
come back to that it was an interesting
incident aside from reducing wages and
undermining democratic processes the
elimination or marginalization of unions
has a kind of a psychological effect
it's part of a much more general and
quite significant process of privatizing
aspirations that is of undermining the
idea that you should have concern for
others undermining a sense of solidarity
and sympathy and an idea that sort you
were all in together we have to work
together it's very important to atomize
people and separate them from one
another and privatize their their goals
and aspirations for as a technique of
social control that of great
significance and undermining unions is
one of many many elements of that
ideological offensive of which everyone
should be is or should be familiar well
coming back to the matter of Article 23
everyone has the right to work and free
choice of employment and so on the
International Labour Organization just
came out with a analysis of the world
employment situation they estimate that
thirty percent of the world's labor
force is now unemployed as of January
1994 unemployed means and like maybe
they can sell you know postcards at a
street corner or something but that
means not enough not enough work to
sustain a minimal standard of living
that's what unemployed means so that's
thirty percent of the world's labor
force well that's worse than the 1930s
they compared it to the great crisis the
crisis of the Great Depression in fact
it's worse it's one part of a huge human
rights catastrophe which shows up in all
sorts of ways
UNESCO estimated that about half a
million children die every year simply
from debt service alone repaying the
debts are the loans are from US and
other commercial banks to their favorite
dictators when the debts go sour that to
be paid for by the poor people of those
countries and incidentally by US
taxpayers because remember that the
banks don't believe in the free market
they believe in it for others but for
themselves they believe in socialism so
when the bed when debts are bad they're
socialized in various ways and the costs
are distributed over the general
population but in say sub-saharan Africa
they pay and they pay for it badly for
example with half a million children
dying every year 11 World Health
Organization estimates 11 million
children dying every year simply from
very easily trench a treatable diseases
things like childhood diarrhea which you
get treat for a couple of cents and
they're dying because the rich folk
don't want to pay for it or don't even
want to know about it
the head of the World Health
Organization described that as a silent
genocide and indeed we would have
absolutely no hesitation in describing
those practices as genocide Alif we
could blame them on someone else when we
blame them on ourselves we don't talk
about them in Eastern Europe since 1989
since that we returned to the free world
and the one thing is free at least
there's been a freefall of the economy
into deep third world conditions UNESCO
again came out with a report just
recently estimating the human effects of
what are called the reforms in Eastern
Europe and they estimate that in Russia
alone there's half a million extra
deaths a year simply as a result of the
reforms comparable numbers elsewhere the
term Reform is an interesting one reform
is of course a good thing if something's
are reformed that's really everyone is
in favor of it and so those who might
advocate a different way for these
societies to be taking drawn out of
these Oviatt Turney
they are reactionaries or maybe
communists or against reforms and
obviously bad people so that that issue
is as settled by your choice of
terminology and if half million people
die a year from it in Russia well you
know it's the way the cookie crumbles
there is something called a recovery
going on in the United States although
it was announced by the government today
that they're worried that it's going too
fast so they're going to terminate it
this is the Clinton recovery it's about
half the rate of normal recoveries
post-war recoveries and it's at about a
third the rate of job growth after the
previous six recessions among those jobs
the jobs are also overwhelmingly
low-income jobs so incomes of wages of
opinion to drop further more that a huge
number of temporary employees in 1992
about 27% of the new jobs were attempts
the figures for this April were just
released you sure saw them there were
front-page stories but you had to go
down to the by about how wonderful the
job creation was though in fact much
lower than after other post-war
recessions but in fact the number of
temporary jobs with still one out of six
and furthermore they expect it to
continue that way temporary jobs means
that's it does that's another good thing
that improves what's called the
flexibility of the labor market the
technical term for it flexibility means
is a fancy word for insecurity it means
you don't know if you're gonna have a
job tomorrow morning when you go to
sleep at night and that's a good thing
as any economist then explain it
improves what's called economic health
economic health is a technical term that
means things are good for profits not
necessarily for people and in fact for
people they're pretty rotten but for
profits that great the last fortune
review of the welfare of corporations
was just glowing with praise for the
enormous increase in profits last year
again
even above the preceding year so
something's doing well there's not only
our have wages been stagnating and in
fact declining but in fact but the
workload is also increasing American
workers did finally win a 40-hour week
in the 1930s but they lost it very fast
that's a thing of the past by now
Julie sure who's written to the most
recent economist at Harvard he's done
most of the work on this estimates that
workers have to work about six weeks
extra a year to maintain their 1970
salaries and if you look at yesterday's
figures you'll again notice that the
average workload has reached new postwar
heights
well it's claimed that all of this has
to do with market forces it's just
inexorable kind of laws of nature and
then people are economists argue about
whether the main effect is due to
international trade or to automation
those are the two those are the two
favorite candidates for the market
forces that are causing all of this
well that discussion is at best
misleading and at worst maybe verging on
fraud in my opinion if you look at the
these factors trade and automation let's
say both of them are only in very small
and in part you could argue about what
part but in part at least market
phenomena a trade for example is
supposed to be efficient everybody
learns that but the efficiency of trade
is achieved by overlooking the fact that
trade is highly subsidized there's
enormous state expenditures that go into
making trade look efficient with many
market distorting factors so simply to
mention the most just one of many trade
the efficiency of trade depends on Trent
honey on the cheapness of transport of
course of course the transport goes up
trade becomes less efficient transport
is kept cheap by vast government
subsidies
highway systems airports Merritt
Maritime Merchant Marines and so on are
all subsidized furthermore the cost of
oil has subsidized the cost of oil for
example is subsidized by the Pentagon
one of the main functions of the
Pentagon has been to aim intervention
forces at the Middle East as fact its
main target for intervention part of the
general program of ensuring that the
price of oil stays about where US based
corporations and the US government
wanted not too low because then profits
aren't good enough but not too high
because that would interfere with the
alleged efficiencies of trade well you
know if you figure in the pentagon cost
of the pentagon through the costs of
international trade things changed a
little bit and they would change even
more if you looked at what are called
externalities like the effects of
pollution depletion and so on in fact if
anyone really doing analysis the cost of
trade it would be can't actually guess
the figures but it would be anything but
the efficient alleged efficiency of
trade would not be the result of market
forces that's for sure what about
automation what's driving people out of
work today
well automation is so grossly
inefficient that it had to be developed
through the state sector the economy
well secret that people don't say but
for about thirty years
the automation which is the the
automatic automated procedures which are
now being used to undermine workers they
were simply developed through the state
sector that means the Pentagon based
sector which is just the state sector of
the economy huge sector in the United
States because nobody here believes them
capitalism any more than they do
anywhere else the huge public subsidies
were given to develop automation to get
it to the point where it could finally
enter the market
for decades and furthermore the form of
automation that was developed was
designed for purposes that had nothing
to do with economic efficiency
automation was designed to be a so as 2d
skill workers and to enhance managerial
power there's nothing in automation that
requires that that's just a particular
form of automation fulfilling certain
class interests certain power interests
which have nothing to do with any
economic factor they have a lot to do
with who rules and who gives orders and
so on and there certainly are
alternatives but they were not pursued
through the subsidized state sector that
you and I pay for without being told
about it
well again if factors like that were
worked in automation would look anything
but efficient and the idea that people
are losing their jobs or becoming be
skilled because of the because of
processes that have the validity of you
know laws of nature would very quickly
deteriorate in fact invocation of market
forces should always be looked at with a
very skeptical eye if you look carefully
you'll notice the large extent it's a
kind of ideological warfare for pre
obvious class interests and putting that
aside there are some fact the fact is
that people's lives are being destroyed
by the billions in fact through through
unemployment alone putting aside many
other factors meanwhile everywhere you
look you see plenty of work that ought
to be done and that these people would
be delighted to do if they had a chance
you know if that much imagination to
look around you and find work that ought
to be done so here we have a situation
in which we have an economic system in
which there are huge numbers of idle
hands maybe a third of the world's
population an enormous amount of work to
be done plenty of people who want to do
the work but the economic system is
quite incapable of putting together the
idle hands of suffering people with the
needs
of work to be done that's a brief way of
saying that the economic system is a
catastrophic failure catastrophic when
you look at the numbers it is incapable
of achieving elementary goals that any
economic system ought to aim for
well that catastrophic failures of
course hailed as an enormous success and
indeed it is an enormous success for a
very small sector of the world's
population sector of very privileged
people and that sector happens to
include the people who write the
articles and give the speeches so
naturally they are hailing the enormous
successes but for the general population
of the world and that's increasingly
true here too the economic system is
indeed an incredible and indeed category
catastrophic failure well market forces
are only one aspect of this and
certainly people are well aware so if
you look at polls even in the I'll
forget the third world where the
disaster is indescribable
but in text of the United States the
richest country in the world polls here
show that one of the questions regularly
asked in polls has to do with assessment
of the of the economic system in the
most recent about a year ago the Harris
polling results in the gave the figures
of 83% of the population saying that the
economic system was inherently unfair
similar figures in Britain last on the
continent also very low expectations for
the future in the industrial countries
remarkably so in fact well market forces
are only part of this story though
there's some part of it at least but
there are some major tendencies in the
last 20 years that underlie these
development
that are gonna continue unless something
is done about them and you can see
pretty well where they're leading and
where they're likely to proceed
one major tendency is the shift that's
going that's been going on in the past
20 years from basically national
economies to a much more global economy
a lot of talk about that and as there
should be it's an important phenomenon
and it has its consequences one
consequence that it has is an increasing
polarization worldwide that is an
increasing gap between rich and poor
that gap goes across countries so the
poor countries are getting falling way
behind the rich countries but even more
dramatically it's happening within
countries the across the world in fact
the gap and every within every
particular country the gap between the
rich and the poor is is increasing and
that's in fact a consequence ik whence
of the shift to a more global economy
another shift another consequence of
this shift is the deterioration of
democratic processes throughout the
world now this is not uniform there's
some places like say South Africa where
there was actually a an improvement in a
step forward in democracy but in most of
the world it's downwards including the
industrial countries and even even
though forms continue to exist they're
substances deteriorating and that too is
a consequence of the globalization of
the economic system the mechanisms for
all these are pretty straightforward
they're not very hard to understand the
striking features of the present period
are the capital has become very mobile
it's very easy to shift from one place
to another on the other hand labor has
become almost totally immobile
immigration barriers are barring the
movement of people from one place to
another incidentally and radical
violation of free trade doctrine this
combination of mobile highly mobile
capital and immobile labour notice first
of all that's exactly contrary
to the assumptions of classical
economics all the stuff all the nice
theorems about comparative advantage and
all that pretty business is based on the
principle that capital is relatively
immobile and that labor is highly mobile
if you change those assumptions
everything collapses and that those
assumptions were fairly realistic at the
time when classical economics was
developed so you go back to the days of
say Ricardo and it was true that capital
was indeed relatively immobile capital
that mostly land and you can't move it
and one there when there was any
possibility of investment somewhere else
it was quite limited so Ricardo's
crucial assumption that capitalism
Mobile was more or less true furthermore
labour was highly mobile the right here
in fact after the native population here
was exterminated or expelled it was
possible to bring in huge numbers of
excess people from Europe my father for
example and that's the mobility of
labour which indeed was a reality up
until fairly recently not a very pretty
reality but a reality nevertheless so
those assumptions were sort of accurate
and therefore the theories had at least
some relation to reality by now the
assumptions have been totally reversed
and the relation of the theories the
reality has reduced quite considerably
but the consequences are very plain with
capital mobile and labour immobile it's
possible to shift production very easily
to low wage high repression areas with
typically with low environmental
standards it's probably profitable and
can much very easily be done and it's
also possible to play one national
labour force against another you can
threaten to do to move production and
that suffices to lower wages to increase
job flexibility by removing people from
the permanent job market and so on
during the NAFTA debate there was a lot
of talk about job loss and job flow and
so on most most of which was meaningless
because the economic models are nowhere
near good enough
any meaningful answers on those
questions and they were also beside the
point
because it doesn't take job flow to
reduce labor to reduce wages the threat
of moving elsewhere suffice is the
threat that you'll move your factory
somewhere else is enough to terminate
the demands of labor force a of these
wage or for benefits or for job security
and so on so even if not one job moves
the NAFTA has its intended effect of
serving as a weapon against working
people and against poor people and
increasing the domestic polarization and
of course this is worldwide every
capital in every country can do this the
effects on reduction of democracy are
equally obvious the internationalization
of production just increases the power
of transnational corporations which by
now have an enormous degree of can
couple 100 of them have a tremendous
degree of control over the International
economy making government's look small
by comparison and what's happening is
what happened in the days of a national
economy the days of more national
economies national nation-states
developed with their own governing
authorities coalescing around domestic
power which in the last couple of
centuries has meant mostly economic
power and now that's happening
internationally so power the power to
make decisions over the economy is
shifting to the transnationals anyway
but around them there's they're sort of
spawning what the Financial Times of
London leading world's leading business
newspaper what it called the de facto
world government an array of quasi
governmental institutions which are
coalescing around the transnationals and
serving their interests kind of an image
of what happens in the days
national economies in the nation state
but now on an international scale this
includes the IMF the World Bank the New
World Trade Organization and so on and
this array of this de facto world
government is drawing power away from
parliamentary institutions again it's
very straightforward there's nothing
secret about it so it's a take the US
and Canada which had a so-called free
trade agreement the province of Ontario
Canada's largest province couple of
years ago tried to institute a an auto
intial auto insurance program and
modeled on the health insurance program
so a single-payer auto insurance program
in effect which would have of course
been highly efficient and would have
lowered auto insurance prices but would
have driven the u.s. insurance companies
out of the market so they threatened a
suit under the free trade agreement
claiming that this was a amount of -
expropriation it was an illegal
interference with free trade well if the
province had agreed to litigate that it
would have gone would have been
extremely expensive of course and it
would have gone to some secret panel
made up of mostly corporate
representatives which would have
adjudicated it and guess how it would
have come out in any event the province
of Ontario which is not a small entity
just withdrew the plan and that's the
end of the the single-payer auto
insurance program well that's one of the
ways in which Parliament in which people
are losing their ability to make
decisions the people of Ontario can't
have that because that's an interference
with what's called free trade that is
the rights of private power absolute
unaccountable private power these are
the ways in which the shift to a
transnational economy in its own
governing institutions are intended to
eliminate and narrow
and restrict democratic processes the
same thing happened in Canada in the
pharmaceutical industry one of the
elements of these so-called free trade
agreements is increased protectionism
they're highly protectionist agreements
the protectionism is one part of it is
called intellectual property rights that
is increasing guaranteeing that big
transnationals will monopolize the
technology of the future spending
patents not only in time but also in
character come back to that if there's
time one of the main aims is to try to
ensure that the pharmaceutical
corporations which of course are
publicly subsidized there's plenty of
subsidy for their research and
development and so on but these publicly
subsidized private profit corporations
want to make sure that they monopolize
the drugs of the future Canada one of
the ways in which Canada was keeping its
health costs down was by producing
generic drugs not a fraction of the cost
and they came under threat again under
the Free Trade Agreement even before the
agreement was enacted just the threat of
enacting it was enough to get Canada to
determine to reduce and finally
terminate it so it's its production of
generic drugs at a fraction of the cost
which healthcare up reduces health but
increases profits when that happens in a
place like Canada it's our sustainable -
rich country but when it happens in
India as is happening now then it's
devastating India has a fairly advanced
pharmaceutical industry which is managed
to keep drug costs quite low but they're
losing it under the so called under
because of the protectionist features of
the free trade agreement and they may
lose it completely in which case drugs
drug costs will shoot way out and the
effect of that in a country like India
you can really imagine in fact it's bad
enough so that the new GATT agreement
it's gonna probably have to be ratified
virtually gunpoint in the Indian
Parliament does tremendous protest over
this well all of these things are
understood with particular clarity in
the
third-world where the loss of power to
transnational the transnational
bureaucracy under the transnational
corporations where that loss of power is
extremely obvious and very immediate in
people's lives a little more masked in
the rich countries but in the poor
countries it's just too sharp to miss
and it's discussed a lot in fact so for
example in El Salvador in January there
was this January there was an important
conference organized by the Jesuits
which had a lot of things to say about
all kinds of topics one of them in fact
was about problems that are local
they're not here they're the problem of
the effect of long term terror on the
society the effect of what they call the
culture of terror in in their words
domesticating the expectations of the
population who come to internalize and
submit to the visions of the powerful
and consider that the entire framework
of thinking that's the real effect of
long term terror and a major achievement
of the United States not only in El
Salvador but in much of the third world
in this terrorist campaigns of the past
years which have simply domesticated
people's aspirations essentially lost
hope these are familiar features of
slave societies as well aspirations are
domesticated you just internalize the
assumptions of the master at some point
that all happened in Haiti sooner or
later we can manage to keep the terror
going long enough this is one of the
reasons incidentally why the US is now
willing to tolerate a formal electoral
procedures in our backyard with
aspirations domesticated there's much
less fear that you might have things
like popular organizations with broader
aspirations well apart from matters of
quite great but really third world type
concern they also dealt with the same
conference dealt with the issues that
we're now discussing the Jesuits made
some points of
durable importance orders quote them
their summary document said that Central
America today is experiencing
globalization as a more devastating
pillage than what its people underwent
500 years ago with the conquest and the
colonization and in fact that
generalizes to most of the third world
and indeed to the growing third world
population at home and secondly they
pointed out that Central America Central
American states are being displaced by a
strong new transnational state that
dictates economic policy and plans
resource allocation that state consists
of the IMF in the World Bank in the
inter-american Development Bank in US
aid and so on institutions of a
transnational state that has far greater
influence than the market and diminishes
whatever democratic parliamentary
structures exist that shift is another
reason why the United States is now
willing to tolerate formal democratic
procedures not only are people's
aspirations domesticated by the
efficiency of terror but the options
available are also restricted in small
countries like El Salvador again the
effect is overwhelming but it affects
the rich countries too in fact we just
saw it this morning the reason why the
Clinton administration decided to
terminate the slow and very sluggish
growth is that it scares bondholders and
they have such power over even powerful
states like the United States that a
mild stimulation of the economy is
enough to cause a threat of a huge
flight of capital which even a rich
country like this can't sustain well
that's the way in which power in in of
parliamentary institutions which are
somewhat under popular influence is
declining in favor of unaccountable
private power these are very significant
phenomenon worldwide even affecting rich
countries like the US as we have just
seen and this move towards a more global
economy has a
advantages the new governing
institutions that are arising
first of all operate in secret nobody
has this slightest idea what's going on
inside the IMF for the World Trade
Organization maybe a few specialists
know something about it but as far as
most of the population is concerned it
might as well be happening in complete
secret nobody knows and that's useful
because that under undermines democratic
institutions people don't know what's
going on obviously they can't do
anything about it
so that's a big step forward in
eliminating the threat of popular
control over a lee power which is of
course a major major battle for many
years the power in fact is shifting into
the hands of what we thought if it was
in the political realm we would simply
call totalitarian institutions
corporation is essentially a
totalitarian institution that's there's
a few if any human creations that are
that have such strict hierarchical
structures such strict authoritarian
structure structure orders strictly from
top down you can insert yourself in them
sometimes and take orders from above and
give them the below but that's it
there's very little else people on the
outside have essentially nothing to say
about it these institutions are
unaccountable and absolutist in
character and hierarchical which is of
course why they were very strongly
opposed by classical liberals Adam Smith
was pre-capitalist he barely saw them
though he didn't like little bits that
he saw but Thomas Jefferson for example
lived long enough to see the early
stages of what we call corporations and
he warned that they would form what he
called a splendid aristocracy that would
simply destroy the achievements of the
American Revolution and he warned
against allowing what he called banking
institutions and moneyed in corporations
to achieve power the kind of power he
was thinking about was minuscule as
compared with what has happened which
goes beyond his worst nightmares but the
reasoning of classical liberal
was very clear and in fact their power
was achieved not through parliamentary
institutions like Congress didn't give
them those powers it was done through
judicial arrangements through courts
judges lawyers and so on which
essentially turned these totalitarian
structures into immortal persons in
effect by now with extraordinary power
over the world economy and as I say
spawning their own governmental
bureaucracies a second effect a second
advantage of these developments is that
they undermine markets and that's
important too because the rich want to
be protected not only from popular
pressures but also from market
discipline now the the what's called
trade now an enormous amount of it is
actually not trade at all by any in a
meaningful sense it's just interactions
internal the big corporations so if a
corporation happens in the course of
production happens to shift something
from one plant to another and cross an
international border that's called trade
and that's not a small amount so for
example more than half of US exports to
Mexico are trade in that sense they
don't enter the Nexen market they're
just transfers from one branch of a big
corporation to another to take advantage
of extremely low labor costs higher and
oppressed labor low environmental
standards and so on with all kind of
price distortions and so on all of them
enormous market distortions but any
event not trade in any seriousness and
that's estimated to be something like
40% of world trade now it's not small so
that's not trade at all and as power
shifts more into the hands of big
transnationals which gain an even
greater smaller and smaller number of
them gain an even greater control over
the world economy that actually reduces
trade in a meaningful sense in any sense
that has anything to do with market
forces it creates more and more
commercial interactions centrally
controlled by a very visible hand
you know there's nothing no nothing to
do with market forces these are managed
interactions in a kind of what sometimes
been called corporate corporate
mercantilism and a third advantage of
these processes as I mentioned is they
increase polarization and that's very
dramatic in the last several decades so
if you take the UN Development Programme
figures comparing 1960 and 1990 so
that's a period in which these
developments have been taking place the
poorest 20% of countries had the wealth
had one thirtieth of the wealth of the
richest 20% in 1960 that 30 to one ratio
changed to sixty to one in I was 30 to
one in 1960 it's the ratio is now sixty
to one the change is internal countries
however are much more dramatic so if you
take the top 20 percent of population in
wealth
worldwide and the lowest 20 percent
worldwide the ratio of wealth held is
140 to one in 1990 and increasing as
it's striking in the rich countries too
particularly in the United States which
is leading the way in this in the United
States in the United States wages have
been sort of stagnating since about 1970
and actually declining during the Reagan
years that decline reached
college-educated workers in 1987 since
1987 college-educated workers have been
declining that in part has to do with
the maybe in large part has to do with
the slight decline in the state sector
of the economy the Pentagon in other
words as pentagon funding reduces that
reduces the state sector we have an
enormous state sector in the economy
that we don't call it that and say gee
the big employer around here is
basically state subsidized and as that
declines that tends to mean that the
wages of skilled workers and
professionals and so on also declines
and that shifted in 1987 going down
since I already
the recovery wages in the United States
are now the lowest in the industrial
world
well actually England got even lower we
were the lowest at the end of the Reagan
years but then England went even lower
after under the impact of Thatcher so
now we're the second lowest in the
industrial world in 1985 we were the
highest in the industrial world as you'd
expect we're by far the richest country
we ought to have the highest wages wages
technically means labour costs per unit
output but essentially wages this is the
result of social policy not market
forces that's why the United States and
England are leading the way there are
very specific social policies and
they're considered also very good for
economic health so when these latest
figures were announced showing that we
were now 20% below Italy and 60% below
Germany in wages The Wall Street Journal
was euphoric they described it as a
welcome development of transcendent
importance and indeed it is for for the
rich I mean that's related that profits
zooming and to the society Polaroids of
taking on a third world aspect and this
is worldwide
I mean continental Europe can't escape
this because they're industrialists can
do exactly the same thing that American
industrialists are doing in fact Danelaw
bents the biggest conglomerate in
germany recently made a deal with
alabama to shift mercedes-benz
production there and they got third
world terms the state of alabama is
going to the taxpayers of ala personally
got the land essentially free the
taxpayers of alabama are going to build
the infrastructure and given the
training programs and so on and so forth
and they can get very cheap labor as
compared with germany so that's a weapon
against german workers that's a way in
which they can harmonize everything
downwards you know lower wages world
what the end of the Cold War had a big
effect on this the end of the cold war
essentially returned most of Eastern
Europe to what it had always been namely
the third
remember this is the original
third-world goes back to pre-columbian
times and it remained that way until the
Bolshevik Revolution and then the
Russian takeover in fact in my opinion
that's basically what the Cold War was
about anyway they're now back in the
third world with third world standards
and one of the effects of that is that
they now have a very cheap labor force
available and that's understood so if
you read say the business press
Financial Times they talk about an
article about a year ago called green
shoots and communism ruins you know
whole things are wrecked but there's
some good things green shoots the green
shoots are that there's a trained
educated labor force also white you know
blue eyes I mean none of that's problems
and they're very cheap you get them for
nothing because they're desperate
they said the effect of the leak the
reforms has been the pauperization of
the East European workforce which means
that you can now get workers at a
fraction the cost of what they call the
pampered Western European workers so you
can beat back down there
you know these pampered workers in the
West by simply moving to the east just
the way we go to Mexico and El Salvador
and so on Businessweek chimed in with
good deal of euphoria about how this was
a way to reduce the luxurious lifestyles
of Western workers by threatening to
just move over to the east now of course
when corporations so when a corporation
elects a GM or VW or Audi and so on when
they move to Eastern Europe they expect
protection they don't believe in the
market remember it's the markets for the
poor not for the rich so when GM goes to
Poland or VW goes to the Czech Republic
they insist on and get high tariff
protection and other sorts of agreements
which ensure that the costs are
socialized and the profits are
privatized that's what states are for
this in fact as I say it's kind of the
meaning in the Cold War it was in my
view mainly it like a north-south
conflict
overgrown north-south conflict and which
some part of the third-world tried to
strike an independent course and was
beaten back to where it belongs into its
service status Grenada is not the Soviet
Union you know one you're doing a
weekend and the other take seventy years
but the logic is very similar when you
look at it and good deal falls into
place when you when you look at it that
way in fact you can learn a lot about
the Cold War just by looking at who's
cheering and who's complaining and
that's a good way to tell who won and
who lost
so who's cheering effect well very
special sectors one group that's
cheering is the former communist party
hierarchy they're doing fine
they are the new capitalist nomenklatura
they're sometimes called what wealthy
beyond their wildest dreams no but now
associated with western international
capital and as the these countries move
to a third-world status the relative
egalitarianism wasn't all that
egalitarian but by comparative standards
was relatively egalitarian that's
shifting and they're getting the same
structures in the other third world
country varies you know super rich
sector which you find in every third
world country very privileged no
indescribably wealthy usually connected
with they're serving international
capital they've got it too and by and
large it's the old communist party
apparatus so they're the victors of the
Cold War they didn't lose they want
their populations lost I mean half
million people are dying every year in
Russia they lost but the hierarchy they
they want rulers one what about the West
same story you know the Western European
workers who are getting their luxurious
lifestyles beaten down by the methods I
just described they didn't win the Cold
were they lost it on the other hand the
corporations whose profits are going up
they want and if you think that through
you find out pretty quickly what the
Cold War was about very different than
what it's described as but pretty clear
we are now seeing very dramatically the
continuation of a law
long tradition the tradition being that
markets are for the poor state power and
protectionist for the rich the rich have
never been willing to subject themselves
to market forces the idea that you know
modern industrial society has developed
through market forces complete myth you
go back to England and the United States
and Blake developing societies every
single case was based on extensive and
radical state intervention and
protectionism but for the rich the poor
were indeed subjected to market forces
that's the effeminate long whole story
is more complicated than that but that's
the primary one and we see it today so
for example when sometimes it's it's
dramatic after the NAFTA victory you
recall that Clinton went off to the Asia
Pacific summit meeting where there was
another triumph in Seattle and he
elaborated what was called his grand
vision of the free market future and he
picked as the model for his grand vision
of the Boeing Corporation that which is
the major US exporter so that's the
model for the free market future and the
grand vision indeed was given in a
speech was given a hanger of the Boeing
Corporation well that's a perfect choice
I mean the Boeing Corporation is a is a
prototypical example of a state
subsidized publicly protected
corporation where the profits are
privatized in fact that's true the whole
aeronautical industry transparently in
fact the aeronautical industry never was
certainly it was not it could barely
survive before the Second World War
during the Second World War the Boeing
Corporation did enrich itself through
wartime profiteering by using the
opportunity of war they were able to
enormous ly increase their profits and
they ended up right wealthy corporation
thanks to American taxpayers and
after the war however it was recognized
that they could not survive in a
commercial market neither they nor the
rest of the industry
Fortune magazine for example pointed out
in 1948 that the aeronautical industry
cannot survive in the commercial market
therefore the public is called upon once
again to subsidize it and that's the way
it developed
aranaut the mr. plane sale of airplanes
is primarily to the state market public
market through the Pentagon but the same
is true of of the fundamental research
and development the avionics and
metallurgy and so on that all comes from
public funding and then if there's any
profit that we may hand it over to
profit in private enterprise so true and
it goes on right till today I mean the
choice of Boeing as the vision of the
free market future tells you exactly
what the free market is about and the
willingness of the commentators to
suppress these truisms tells you
something about what the ideological
system is about well that story actually
goes back to the origins of the
Industrial Revolution and continues
without change and runs through these
reasons the so-called trade agreements
NAFTA and GATT are not free trade
agreements these are investor rights
agreements with a kind of a mixture of
protectionism and liberalisation
carefully crafted to meet the needs of
the powerful so for example GATS a
excludes military expenditures it cuts
down it eliminates it rules against
subsidies not allowed to subsidize
industry but military expenditures are
excluded well that's our main technique
of subsidy the main industrial policy in
the United States the main technique for
maintaining high technology industry is
subsidizing it through the military
system so naturally that's excluded from
gas remains legitimate the miry
dimension things like the inefficiencies
of trade intellectual property rights
extend protection and so instantly they
extend it in very interesting ways it's
not only the length of a patent that's
extended but also its nature so patents
you
to the process patents it was a
particularly process of manufacturing
something that was patented GATT changes
that to product patents it's the product
that's patented which means that say if
you know if say merck pharmaceutical
develops a new drug which mostly you pay
for but they develop it and they now get
patent rights for it it means that india
can't work out a cheaper way to produce
the same drug because it's the product
that's patented not the process and that
goes on for twenty or forty years
well that's very important again it has
nothing to do with efficiency in fact
what it does is cut down on
technological innovation obviously if
you can't it makes it useless to work
out cheaper ways to produce things that
are already patented so therefore
nobody's going to do it so it cuts back
on efficiency cuts back on economic
development but increases profit and
increases polarization because it's
going to keep drug prices high in india
well that's that's what's called free
trade and yet as soon lee there's a
history on this which people couldn't
figure it out they would look at so in
the nineteenth century there were a few
countries that did have patent product
patents france for example and part of
the reason why france lost its its
chemical industry was the fact that they
had product patents so therefore the
industry shifted over to switzerland
which didn't have it that's why
switzerland has a big chemical and
pharmaceutical industry and france
doesn't well known parts of economic
history but the logic is obvious and the
idea is to perpetuate it but now on an
international scale so there's no
shifting anymore because it's now global
not national it's only the rich
countries never accepted these laws when
they were developing the united states
for example but we do impose them on the
poor this is not markets remember this
is protection an old business is some
kind of mixture which is designed to
transfer more and more power over to the
transnationals and their quasi
governmental institutions and to
increase the polarization and
incidentally that is recognized so it
takes a NAFTA you know huge debate about
NAFTA a lot of irrelevant discussion
about job flow which as I say nobody
knew anything about but it was
interesting that there was an
undercurrent of agreement on both sides
namely that whatever the effect on job
flow it was gone a polarized meaning for
the majority of the population in all
three countries it would lower their
wages and for the rich it would improve
their incomes so whether it split more
the new york times which is varied from
a NAFTA did run an article on this the
day after the nafta vote when it was all
safe they ran their first article on the
expected effects of nafta in the new
york region and it was a very upbeat
article about how great it was going to
be and they went through all the people
who would gain from it primarily
financial services like you know bankers
and corporate lawyers and PR firms and
that sector they do fine you know in
fact they were all just salivating with
joy and the an some industry would do
well particularly capital intensive
industry like say chemicals they do well
and the publishing industry the new york
times which is helped by the
protectionist elements of nafta they do
fine then they have a sentence in which
they talk about the losers they say well
you know everything isn't perfect some
people have to lose in the free market
and the losers they said would be of
women blacks hispanics
and semi-skilled workers which happens
to be about three-quarters of the
workforce so they're the losers but
meanwhile the corporate lawyers and the
bankers and sewing they would be doing
just fine this is remember a city where
40% of children live below the poverty
line meaning they are cut out of any
future just through malnutrition and a
lack of education and so on and now that
that will be increased that was part of
the great achievement of nafta you can
understand he enormous euphoria about it
and the
tremendous excitement and the circles
that do the writing and the talking and
the preaching and so on and so forth
yeah they'll do great most of us will in
fact will I presume but most of the
population will do very badly and they
know it's and the population knew it too
there was it was an ass that was
expected the sail right through in
secret but there was a quite unexpected
popular reaction to it led particularly
by the labor unions and I was very
interesting to see the reaction to that
that led to that you remember this is
now last November there was real
hysteria about that Clinton was giving
speeches featured on the front page
about what he called The Naked pressure
and the raw muscle of the labor unions
pleading based on friendship and
threatening based on money and work in
the campaign when they approached their
elected representatives absolute outrage
for working people to go to their
elected representatives and say look
here's what we'd like you to do months
later the times are still running
articles be wailing what they call the
bullying from the labor organizations to
try to to try to get their
representatives to do what they wanted
Anthony Lewis no way out on the
dissident Left was denounced what he
called the backward unenlightened labor
movement with its crude threatening
tactics as it approached you know its
elected representatives the day of the
vote House vote there were editorials in
the major papers including the times and
the post the Times editorial listed the
Congress people people from Congress in
the New York area who had who were
planning to vote against NAFTA and it
had a little box in there in which they
listed the contributions to them from
labor tax and they said this is ominous
signs you know it looks like they're not
really voting honestly they're being
pressured by their
bye-bye this bullying some of these
aggrieved representatives later wrote in
letter saying well what about the
corporate contributions we got a lot
more from corporations how come you
didn't listen to them and how come for
nobody asked but they could have asked
how come that The Times didn't list the
say advertisers in the New York Times
and what they thought about NAFTA maybe
recognize some ominous signals there but
the point is and of course in fact the
day after the NAFTA vote the times did
have an article comparing corporate
lobbying and labor lobbying after always
screaming about Labor's power they said
what was obvious that labor lobbying was
trivial and insignificant as compared
with corporate lobbying which is of
course obvious again that was the day
after the vote but in a sense you can't
really criticize them for this corporate
lobbying isn't worth reporting and
that's like reporting the fact that we
breathe air no that's the way this it's
not news it's the labor lobbying that
had to be reported the fact that the
wealthy are twisting the arms of their
representatives that's just the norm
that's the way the system is supposed to
work it's after all supposed to work for
the rich it's when poor people try to
get involved in the public arena they
have complete hysteria and that reaction
in fact was very revealing about the
elite attitudes towards democracy all
the way over to the liberal left the
public is supposed to be watching they
aren't supposed to be participating none
of these crude threatening tactics like
calling a representative and saying I'd
like you to do this and that that's to
be left to the business representatives
who owned the place and are supposed to
run the political system
well let me just mention a last factor
that in the in the global economy which
actually got a little publicity at when
Richard Nixon died a couple of days ago
Nixon's major achievement in terms of
its long-term impact was to dismantle
the post-war economic system the Bretton
Woods system which regulated currencies
the after the Second World War the
United States
essentially he said I was kind of an
international banker the dollar was the
international currency dollar was fixed
against gold and other currencies
against the dollar and that was
extremely advantageous to American
business for a long period in fact I was
the basis for the development of the
post-war multinational corporations gave
him an enormous capacity to spread
through the world but by around 1970
when Nixon came in that was not
sustainable any longer the other
industrial countries had developed after
the war Germany and Japan had developed
if not kind of a tri-polar economy the
Vietnam War had been very costly to the
US economy and quite beneficial to its
rivals who made a lot of money on it and
in any event the u.s. Nixon felt
probably rightly that the US could not
play this role any longer and since
we're the biggest guy on the block and
to what we feel like he simply
dismantled called the game off dismantle
the post-war economic system and that
opened the period of unregulated capital
which just had enormous of things
acted as a front page article about it
in the Wall Street Journal today which
is accurate the it describes a
commission run by Paul Volcker the
former head of the Federal Reserve which
is trying to reconstruct this system
describing some of the effects that it's
have that the dismantling of it has had
over the twenty last twenty five years
and one effect they point out which
plenty of other economists have too is
that it shifted the composition of
capital to speculative rather than
productive uses and that too that they
attribute the fact that the growth rate
has been about half since 1970 about
half of what it was before 1970 in fact
if you look at what happened in this
period what Nixon did is only one
element but there were several others
but the effect has been to vastly
increase the amount of unregulated
international capital it's now as
estimated by the World Bank at about 14
trillion dollars totally overwhelms
national governments and it can be moved
very fast because of modern
telecommunications so maybe it
in dollars or so moves from one market
to another every day the national
governments can't resist that that's
part of the reason for the you know the
cutting back of this the Clinton
decision to cut back the the minor
growth rate the but not only has the
hasn't been a huge explosion in the
amount of capital but it's also
completely changed in composition so in
1970 before Nixon did this it was about
ninety percent of the capital in
international transactions was for
long-term investment trade and over it
something more or less productive ten
percent for speculation and by 1990
those figures had reversed it was 90
percent for speculation and 10 percent
for trade and investment with an obvious
effect on things like growth rates or on
national economic plan which simply
becomes impossible because the
unregulated financial capital is looking
for stable money meaning no growth okay
and all of this has been driving the
world into low growth low wage high
profit equilibrium of some kind and that
is this all combines with the
internationalization for production and
simply accelerates it well all this
stuff just to end has a resemblance
often URI resemblance at some time in
some ways to what was happening in the
early 19th century now the early 19th
century the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution it was basically England
wasn't global you know you can see it
right in the British Isles and what was
happening was quite interesting it very
similar to what's happening around the
whole world today and if you look at the
outcome of that it's suggested that's
the time when the ideologies that are
rampant today were developed they you
know neoliberal ideologies and so on
that's classical economics it was
developed in the early 19th century
barely changed since and the idea of it
was to you it was developed basically as
a weapon of class
war the idea was to try to destroy the
pre-capitalist mentality and economy and
to create the basis of a wage labor
system
now the pre-capitalist since a feudal
system everyone had some kind of a place
it might have been a miserable place but
it was some kind of place and you know
the system was arranged so you had your
place and the play along with that place
went a right to live like she was called
that say you had a right to live and
your perhaps utterly miserable and
degraded status
well that's incompatible with capitalism
capitalism requires elimination of the
right to live your rights should be
exactly those that you get on the labor
market nothing more nothing less
that's the ideal of course not for the
rich remember they have powerful States
working for them but for the general
population you get the rights you you
have no human rights human rights is
zero except what you can gain on the
labor market and it was extremely
important to eliminate what was called
the deception of the poor Ricardo called
it deceiving the poor he's the great you
know creator of this system he deceives
the poor by letting them believe that
they have some right to live over and
above what they get on the labor market
Malthus it was another major figure
argued in very influential work that if
you if you don't have independent wealth
and you can't earn enough on the labor
market to sustain yourself then go
somewhere else you have no right to
anything and go somewhere else meant at
that time well you know go to the place
where we have exterminated the native
population so it was a lot of free land
that's that was that's classical
economics you want to drive the
population into the labor market or the
workhouse prison it was recognized that
some people wouldn't be able to sustain
themselves so to die in the streets
smells too bad and so on so put them in
a workhouse prison so they either go
into the labor market where their rights
are whatever they can gain or they go
into the workhouse prison all of this
was demonstrated
as Ricardo put it with the certainty of
the principles of gravitation these were
just laws of nature and you don't want
to deceive the poor into thinking that
they have any other rights and then
comes all the familiar stuff about the
capital accumulation and trickle down
and so on that you know you hear every
time you open your look at the newspaper
every time the New York Times presents
what they call a primer for the an
economic primer for the population it's
just recapitulating all of this stuff
well by the 1830s the rising industrial
classes had gained enough political
power so they could ran these laws
through they eliminated what we're
called the poor Louis you know the
welfare system and in fact the arguments
are very similar to the kind of
arguments that are going on today about
eliminating welfare people have no right
to sustenance contrary to what it says
in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights they don't have those rights
maybe they're on paper but we don't
believe any of that we believe that they
have no right to live none of those
rights that are listed there and
therefore the system of the system by
which the community saves you know gives
people the right to survive say children
that has to be dismantled have only the
right to get on the labor market or the
workhouse prison and we are now reliving
then the poor laws were dismantled in
1830s and what happened well what
happened it was interesting the general
population didn't accept the conclusion
that they had no right to live for
several decades the British Army was
mostly involved in putting down right
then came the beginnings of organizing
you know the beginnings of the Chartist
movement and then the early socialist
movement and at that point the rulers
got scared well you know they recognized
that pretty soon the rabble might also
question their right to rule okay they
don't have a right to live why
right the rule you know question that
and then you're really in trouble
also the wealthy recognized for
themselves that they needed to appeal to
powerful state intervention to protect
themselves from market disaster well you
know by the middle of the nineteenth
century
the science of economics change and now
the with a certainty the principle of
gravitation everyone was opposed to
laissez-faire and lays a affair in fact
became a bad word for about a century
and code was revived in the nineteen
seventies in the 1980s the you get John
Stuart Mill principles of political
economy which is basically social social
democratic you know it's kind of the you
know the fundamentals of what later
became the European welfare states well
that's what happens at that time what's
happening now what's happening now is I
think we're in a similar situation
except its global there's a kind of an
experiment going on to see whether you
can eliminate human rights for the
overwhelming majority of the population
of the world and drive them into either
the labor market where they'll get
whatever rights they can get no and if
they can't get any employment and now
there's nowhere for them to go
you know maybe Mars or something but
there's nowhere for them to go unlike
the 1830s and for the rich you'll have
powerful states all sorts of
protectionist measures and so on
production will be by the super poor and
the most exploited you move it around
from one place to another and the
markets will now be the wealthy sectors
throughout the world nobody knows that
can work or whether the population will
accept it
we're sort of spearheading it here
that's why you find the sharp reduction
of wages this develop trend a welcome
development of transcendent and
importance and you also find the double
you know the doubling of the poverty
level is
paired with any other country and also
crucially the sharp increase in prisons
the United States now has by far the
largest prison population and is
increasing prisons the couple of days
after the NAFTA vote the Senate passed
the most onerous crime bill in history
then made even worse by the house which
calls for huge new federal expenditures
simply to throw more and more of the
population into prison and those will
sooner or later be prison work houses in
fact US prisons already are exporting
overseas the so I think you have this
natural move towards the labor market
and if you can't survive the prison work
house for much of the population they
just become superfluous like most of the
third-world populations
meanwhile in a country like this their
example sectors of privilege to which
people like us belong and the question
is the experiment is can this survive or
will it lead to exactly the result that
it led to in the 1820s riots organizing
challenging of the right to rule moves
towards a more humane social order which
was fine like to some extent achieved
and has now is now being dismantled as
the whole thing is recapitulated on an
international scale in my opinion that's
the moment that we're now in and there
are conflicting tendencies as there
always have been and the question of
which one which one's dominate will very
much determine you know whether there's
any kind of a livable future
[Applause]
we're not running if our free will
offerings but before anyone who walks
out please give your contribution we are
going to be sending money that is badly
needed for medical aid with Nicaragua we
cannot answer
well well you're collec just come one
brief coming on this I do have a
daughter and I in fact the grandson who
live in Nicaragua and we go down there
you know every couple of months and the
situation is in fact you know really
amazing I mean through the early 1980s
the nickk nickk Nicaragua had developed
quite a success was just to keep the
health since this was under discussion
developed quite a successful healthcare
system there were rural clinics the
child infant mortality rate was going
down and so on since 1990 since the
elections of all of that is dismantled
all collapsing the hospitals are closing
down actually they're separating it's
becoming a third world country meaning
if you're rich you can get anything and
for most of the population there's
nothing my daughter that was riding a
bicycle and hadn't it was hit by
actually bumped into a bus or something
fell down and broke her collarbone so
she was taken to a public hospital and
that you know the the medical care was
okay I mean these are trained doc the
fact they've had a lot of experience
thanks to us the Contra war gave them
plenty of experience and heading to put
together broken bodies so technically
the medical care was okay but for
example she she wanted a glass of water
and the nurse asked her did she bring a
cup because they don't have cups you
know you want to go ice with water in
the hospital you bring your own cup if
you stay overnight you bring your own
sheet you know if you get lucky if you
can get a bed if by now they you know
he's not even washing the floors I mean
if the whole system is utterly
collapsing and this is extending all
over the country so you'll recall those
of you who are around old enough ten
years ago that there was nothing more
inspiring and
years ago than the laments over the fate
of the Mosquito Indians when a couple of
dozen of them were killed in the course
of sanest operations during the
terrorist war that we were waging
against them this was condemned all over
as genocide literally the worst human
rights violation in the hemisphere I
mean this is a time when we were
supporting the slaughter of tens of
thousands of Indians right next door but
this was you know the human crime of the
century
Ronald Reagan and Jean Kirkpatrick and
editorial writers and so on well that
was ten years ago last time I was down
there the there's an evangelical church
group was one of the last remaining
groups that doesn't he Human Rights
worked and medical work down there
Evangelical Protestant group that works
in the mosquito areas and they were
reporting last time I was down there
that a hundred thousand mosquitoes are
starved 100,000 people mostly mosquitoes
are starving starving you know well sure
that's the effect of the onerous
conditions that we've imposed on the
country I don't hear anybody complaining
about it that's okay that's not a human
rights violation and it reveals again
the purely instrumental character of
human rights in the official culture you
can use them as a weapon to beat
somebody over the head fine if it's just
human rights we don't care especially if
we're responsible for it as we are in
this case then we plainly don't want to
hear about it
Nicaragua is declining about it's still
above the level of Haiti but not much
it's now the second poorest country in
the hemisphere the World Bank and the
IMF which are basically US instruments
are imposing extremely onerous
conditions on them in fact forcing them
to cut back what little remains of say
public health care and so on in my view
this is all just pure torture
I don't think there's any purpose
whatsoever except to teach other people
and other people understand that even if
Americans don't that you don't step on
the toes of the big mafia none in fact
any Matthew Dunn would understand this
very well I mean if somebody in your
neighborhood doesn't pay protection you
don't just break his bones
you know you really do a job so that the
other people understand and that's the
way we treat the third world
we're the Mafia Don Nicaragua tried to
follow an independent course and now
they're going to suffer like Cuba or
anybody else who stands up and they're
going to suffer for a long time and that
will happen as long as we let it happen
nobody knows about it here to get that
in the newspapers but they know about it
there and they know about it elsewhere
in the third world and that's part of
the reason there is such despair that's
part of this culture of terror that the
Salvadoran Jesuits we're talking about
now carried out through economic
measures and you know no less
destructive for that reason if the
American solidarity organizations which
were very impressive in the 80s if they
can get their act together
they're very badly needed now I think
more needed than they were in the 80s
because the tortures throughout the
region is more subtle perhaps than it
was then but very real and there are
popular organizations that somehow
survive and can fight back but they need
outside support and that can only come
from here and hwe failed you a little
bit ago and won the Zeeman you can bring
money or sent it to the church here made
out to the church for Nicaragua also but
it's been a few
I mean you know a business corporation
is not a humanitarian institution it
can't be it's not because they're bad
people running it in a mile you know we
don't have a real competitive system but
a partially competitive system anyone
who wants to stay in the game has to try
to maximize short-term benefit otherwise
you don't stay in the game and one of
the ways you maximize short-term benefit
is by disregarding what the economists
call externalities things like resource
depletion somebody else will worry about
that it's kind like pollution you know
somebody else will worry about that
resource depletion somebody also worry
about we're trying to maximize profit
for tomorrow you see it in the fishing
industry but it takes place all the time
in the most incredible ways I mean take
say oil you know the major commodity in
in modern world you know in the modern
industrial world the u.s. used to be a
major oil producer in fact
[Music]
how much time do we have nobody knows
let me just mention what happened with
the oil industry wouldn't see it in the
last 20 years us was a big oil producer
back in the 1950s everybody all the oil
industry knew perfectly well at the time
that the major oil resources were in the
Middle East and that by comparison the
US resources were rather limited however
it was more profitable in the short term
to sell us oil and to keep Middle East
oil as a reserve
so they depleted American oil I mean
that's why there's no oil in Louisiana
anymore and we're now in fact importing
oil from the Middle East to pour down
holes here to build up reserve there's
no surprise about this everybody knew
all this in the 1950s it's just the
short-term profit required that you
deplete US oil and save Middle East oil
owned by the same corporations as a
reserve and you know that's the way you
build profits but make any sense for the
population here for anybody but does
make sense for profits and the same is
true of fishing so now the area around
here which used to be the richest
fishing grounds in the world has been
you know no better than I largely
depleted and we're now doing the same
thing elsewhere so one of the Chile for
example is described for the moment as
an economic miracle part of the reason
is they're just ripping off their
resources there's it's mostly a resource
produced primary product producing
region including fishing so there's
extensive overfishing of the waters off
Chile and it'll last as long as it lasts
and when that's gone so you know do
something else
if you're part of the system of if the
if the entire economic system is
designed around the principle of
maximizing short-term profit for the
rich this is exactly what's going to
happen how much longer do we have nobody
knows it's I mean agricultural a US
agribusiness is what's called efficient
but again efficient because nobody
counts the externalities for example
there's been a huge reduction in
productivity of the soil now it's being
destroyed by pesticides and over farming
and so on but that's somebody else's
problem you know well don't worry about
that next year
raishin well you know if we let that
happen the next generation is going to
have insoluble problem nothing
conspiratorial about it this is just
like trying to maximize it's just like
your corporation trying to maximize
profit that's not a conspiracy
yes
anything positive that you do in this
scenario factor on my guess
yeah that's exactly absolutely
sure I mean we are much freer like we
have a lot more freedom than anybody had
in the 1820s I mean for example in 1820s
there was a very limited franchise
remember I mean now you know the
franchise has been won the right of
freedom of speech has been won it didn't
exist then there's all there was no
slavery anymore there used to be at that
time I mean there are all sorts of
freedoms that are available and
opportunities that are available that
weren't available then furthermore
there's just a lot more resources
available to all of us which means that
the possibilities of reacting are far
greater than they were for impoverished
farmers and slaves back in the 1820s
we're not in a situation of English
workers being driven off their land into
the Kenzi and factories that's not us
you know and that gives us all sorts of
opportunities and in fact you know these
have been realized to a significant
extent I mean they the u.s. is very
different from what it was 30 years ago
it concerns like over say resource
depletion those are very widely felt now
they're big issues not 30 years ago
nobody was talking about them that's a
big change now whether it's a big enough
change to make any difference well you
know nobody knows but in anyway it's a
big change and in the right direction
take say raising money for to try to
compensate in some pathetic fashion for
the destruction we carried out in
Nicaragua well it's very important and
you know you think about the comparative
destruction it's kind of a pathetic move
but it's important but there was nothing
like that 30 years ago nothing we just
destroyed meaning care about the
development of the Solidarity movements
in the 80 in the 1980s was a remarkable
phenomena had no historical precedent
and that's a big move forward take say
NAFTA the the one of the right after
NAFTA immediately after the NAFTA vote
several US corporations including GE I
think GE and honey will fired union
organizers and Mexico
immediately after NAFTA workers trying
to organize into unions and their
factories well usually the u.s. labor
movement just been paying attention or
even supported corporations this time
was different for the first time they
used their own clout which is not
insignificant to protect mexican union
organizers this time by now they
understand that their lives depend on it
well that's important you know that's a
Moo it's small but it's a move toward
the kind of international solidarity
that's going to be necessary to combat
international you know international
capital basically so these are all
positive moves the only question is
timing and scale and you know those are
some things you don't speculate about
there are things you try to do something
about
through someone over here in the hallway
you can't see them you mentioned that
world of unemployment is 30% is a u.s.
reality of said 20 to 30% fall so far as
is 66 to 7% of the government claimed
well the official unemployment level
here is 6.4 percent the great enthusiasm
and the newspapers in the last month is
that went down from six point five
percent to six point four percent this
is like you know three times the amount
that was considered tolerable about 20
years ago those figures are not
falsified but you have to realize what
they mean I mean for example they don't
include people have just given up hope
they're not on the labor market anymore
actual unemployment if you really did a
realistic measure would probably be
something like double that or maybe more
and we're one of the countries that has
higher employment so if it averages out
to 30% over the world you can imagine
what it means elsewhere like take say
Nicaragua I mean their unemployment is
more like 60 like two-thirds what should
it do
that's two different things
unfortunately what they should do
they've always known if they wanted to
restore our speed which they don't there
are very I think very simple measures do
that one measure has to do with the
embargo there's supposed to be an
embargo on Haiti but that embargo is a
fraud
and as a fraud for very simple reasons
the embargo was instituted in October by
the OAS Organization rank States in
October 1991 so it's a couple weeks
after the military coup the u.s.
technically joined it but in February
that is three months later bush called
it off he introduced what was called an
exemption meaning American owned
factories are exempt from the embargo
okay that was called fine-tuning the
embargo they called out so quite apart
from all the things that people talk
about you know like oil or getting in
over the dominican republic
US trade with Haiti just continues and
in fact if you look at US Commerce
figures which I did us I think I'm the
only person publish them as far as I
know just get on my calling the Commerce
Department's not a secret the US trade
with Haiti last year was you know a
little below the normal level all right
what happened when Clinton came in US
trade with Haiti increased by 50%
furthermore the trade expanded in a new
direction to food exports Haiti is a
starving Island everybody's talking
about how they're starving they're
exporting food to the United States
under Clinton they're exporting fruit
and nuts to the United States maybe you
buy in supermarkets for all I know
well another thing they export is
baseball's big exporter baseball's in
fact one of the major ones and if you
look at the big American companies they
advertise they're specially made
baseballs you know hand dipped because
they're so perfect yeah they're hand
dipped by women in toxic materials to
make them extra good these women who
we'll die after a couple of years from
poisoning anyway so maybe it doesn't
matter but they're there working at an
official wage of ten cents an hour
that's if they meet the quota which
nobody can do so they get like five
cents an hour you know that's that's
what we're doing and they are exporting
you know they're like these corporations
I forget what it's called something like
you know something of Champions one of
the big baseball importers they're
importing softballs and you know and so
on from there in fact the US government
is buying them you know the US
government's one of the big purchasers
of baseballs for the army or some such
thing and they're getting them from
Haiti and in fact trade went up 50%
under Clinton now I don't know nobody
ever reports any of this stuff so I'm
not certain what the new embargo has
that they talk about has to do with it
but my guess is it'll continue so one
thing they could do for example is
Institute embargo I mean we don't import
fruit and nuts from Haiti produced by
the super-rich agribusiness and their
local associates living in there you
know driving around in their cold
Cadillacs there we don't do that and we
don't import baseball's for women the
women aren't getting anything like I say
five cents an hour maybe they would be
delighted if we imposed an embargo that
aside what about the oil coming across
the Dominican border I mean that doesn't
to stop that it does not require bombing
Santa Domingo it requires a phone call
you know the Dominican Army is under
very tight US control if we tell them
you know stop they close the border
they'll close the border if you have to
threat and you say okay we'll cut off
the aid that keeps you alive but I don't
even think they have to threaten they
certainly don't have to invade the
Haitian military is everyone knows
living largely off narco trafficking now
if you look you'll notice that every
fishing boat you know that has some
Haitian refugees on it gets picked up by
the post Coast Guard but somehow they're
never able to stop an ARCA trafficking
book actually that question has been
raised by the Black Caucus John Conyers
raised that question so how come you
know and he got an answer from the State
Department or the Pentagon and so it was
printed in The Washington Post with
straight-faced nobody seemed to crack a
smile as far as I could tell the
official government answer was well you
know yeah we know all this stuff that's
coming through but Haiti doesn't have
efficient radar and therefore they can't
stop it and you know naturally the US
Navy and Air Force doesn't have the
facilities to you know I mean you know
Pentagon cutbacks and so on we certainly
don't have the radar that would enable
us to stop but you know a little
motorboat coming through or a small
commercial plane bringing in narcotics
to keep the Haitian military lives so
what can we do well you know pursue it a
couple of steps further and if the
United States wanted rst that there are
very simple measures that they could
have taken and can take now to achieve
that in and they don't want it back
actually there's an interesting article
in The New York Times this morning if
you haven't looked at it look at it now
on the bottom of some page by Elaine
Cellino it reports a leak from the
somebody leaked some human rights group
in fact somehow got hold of a cable
which up must have been leaked by the
somebody in the state - there plenty of
people in the State Department who don't
like this policy and in fact they're
very upset about it and they leak things
and one of the things they leaked was a
cable actually a 10-page cable from the
American Embassy in Haiti it was printed
in the Miami Herald yesterday and the
Times reported today big 10 page cable
which says that our state and the human
rights groups and the UN are all lying
about the human rights violations and
they give two examples it's not
mentioned at times but they give two
examples of things that they claim
they're suspicious of they don't say
they're false they just say they're
suspicious about them that's the proof
that the human rights groups in our
state are lying
well that's a 10-page cable and what it
says is you know don't believe any of
this stuff from the US Embassy in Haiti
to Washington and Elaine cellino's
political reporter she comments today
well you know this reflects the internal
discussion in the White House they won't
say it publicly but internally they
dislike and distrust our state that's
true they don't like it and they don't
like them for a very simple reason he
came to power on the on the basis of a
popular
move that was popular you know as a very
there was it's now largely been
destroyed by violence but there was a
lively civil society with grassroots
organizations and church groups and
unions and all sorts of other things
love Alice and that just swept them to
power and that is not the kind of thing
the u.s. tolerates you don't want a
populist priest who you know talks about
reform and in fact he committed even
worse crime he was he was during seven
months in office he was very successful
so successful that he even impressed the
international lending organizations
which were starting to put in
international money into there and
that's a US assembly plant remember
nobody else supposed to have fingers in
it so there the only question was how
are they going to get rid of him
but if the US wanted him to get back
there would be easy ways to do it you
know it's not a matter that calls for
Marines but you know the Haitians know
perfectly well that the u.s. doesn't
want it back they'd have to read it the
New York Times they know and the
Dominicans know and so on
is what
you mean can this experiment work this
experiment in which the poorest people
around the world world do the production
and the market is the richest people
around the world nobody knows
oh yeah
[Music]
who needs to know the problems
small
the general public as far as anybody
knows oh sure
first of all remember that most of us
are part of it and we may not feel that
we're psychologically part of it but I
mean I don't know you personally but I
can guess that's certainly me you know
we're part of the group that's that's
gaining from this and let's not kid
ourselves about it the I mean that gives
us a lot of opportunities but where
people don't have you know I don't think
they're very many people here are coming
from the Boston slums let's say and I'm
certainly not the witch gives us plenty
of opportunities that really oppressed
people don't have and and there's no
shortage of things we can do about it as
far as activism is concerned you just
pick your topic and there are groups
working on it and they can use support
and help and there's plenty plenty of
them are there enough resources for the
world as far as anyone knows for example
food production is not you know there's
plenty of people starving but they're
not starving because there isn't enough
food in the world they're starving
because the food isn't getting to them
foods there in fact a lot of these
countries that have huge famines are
exporting food yeah often well like I
mean Haiti is a small case you know it's
a tiny case admittedly but they're huge
cases I mean right through these African
famines that you know everybody was
wailing about the same countries we're
exporting food and in fact there's
plenty food in the world as far as other
resources are concerned well you know
suppose it turned out I don't think it's
true but supposed to tell you that there
was a there were real resource
constraints well you know one way to
deal with that is for the rich to cut
back on their idiotic consumption levels
I'm an enormous amount of our
consumption is just forced consumption
it's not because people wanted you know
you have a drip the advertising industry
spends you know billions of dollars a
year trying to convince people that you
want to buy things which you don't want
that's their main goal you know you
everyone so everybody's life would be
better if you didn't have most of these
things that's why they have to put so
much effort into trying to get you to
buy them and
so one simple thing that would increase
resources is just stop wasting them plus
the fact that there's just an enormous
wastage I mean let's take take take the
Pentagon Pentagon spending is barely
declining Clinton's military budget is
higher than Nixon's you know the peak of
the Cold War and the projections are
that it's going to go up in a couple of
years well you know this is basically
waste production which is designed for
two things one to maintain the profits
of high technology industry through
public funding and the other to you know
to set up intervention forces which will
maintain control over the world I don't
think that either of those are
worthwhile goals so there's just you
know that's mostly ways we happen to
have I think US military spending is now
higher than the rest of the world
combined something I think it is I'm
saying meanwhile we're pouring arms into
the third world with by far the biggest
arms exporter that's increasing the
Clinton administration is out drumming
up business and those arms are being
used you know you look in the television
set take a look at Rwanda and so on yeah
the arms are being used they happen to
be French arms in that case but it's the
same story and the and they'll be used
elsewhere I mean is this useful
production I mean when you talk about
wasting resources I mean you can talk
about these things there's there's so
much vast waste going on so there's no
reason to doubt that resources are
available as far as overpopulation is
concerned everyone knows the answer to
that one there's plenty of history as as
the economic situation improves
population goes down Europe now has a
large part of Europe as negative
population growth the population of
Italy for example is actually declining
know that not long ago every family had
eight children okay well these are the
effects of improvement in the economic
situation that's the way to cut back
population growth when you begin to have
choices well you use them you know and
the evidence on this is overwhelming so
I don't think the problems are objective
just like the problem of a third
the population unemployed and a huge
amount of work to be done it's not a law
of nature that prevents those two things
from getting together its particular
kinds of economic and social
arrangements which prevent them and they
can be changed their human creations
that can be changed but people don't
have to work to change
[Music]
well first before we talk about Colombia
let's mint notice something else which
is much more important than their
legalization of drugs Colombia has now
taken first place in the race for
leading human rights violator in the
hemisphere it's it's it's just monstrous
and not surprisingly it's also now the
leading recipient of US military under
Clinton that's going up you know that's
again not surprising that's the way it
works if you took the there was the
International Labour Organization again
just a couple of weeks ago published a
list of murdered union leaders around
the world around the world
half of them were from Colombia around
the world the Committee to Protect
Journalists just listed the journalists
killed around the world I forget the
proportion but by far the largest number
were from Colombia of course the main
victims are peasants as always many are
getting slaughtered about 20,000 people
have been killed in the last couple of
years and it's going up
so that's Colombia worst human rights
violator in the hemisphere getting worse
leading recipient of US military aid I
mean speak of resources and this is
mostly a criminalized protest that's
basically what it's going for you know
death squads and torture the whole usual
story about the drug thing Colombia's
move in legalizing drugs makes perfect
sense I mean the problem the drug trade
is not Colombian you know it's the
market and the markets mostly here and
the actually here too probably the right
move is some form of decriminalization I
mean you know you can argue about the
details but a lot of the criminalization
of drugs here has nothing to do with the
drug with drugs has to do with
controlling people I mean in fact if you
look at the way the prison rate is going
up a very large part of that is for
victimless crimes you know some teenage
kid is caught with a joint in his pocket
or something okay
jail for a couple years that keeps them
off the street that's the I think I
forget the numbers with like 25% or some
huge amount of the prison population is
that and that it's interesting that the
the substances you know the harmful
substances that are criminalized are
those that are used by the poor not by
the rich so alcohol is much more harmful
than cocaine but alcohols not
criminalized because that's for the rich
cocaine is criminalized that's the poor
most of these things have a class basis
they're not much to do with drugs well
father Roy bourgeois who's running that
program yeah I was arrested there now
for it I mean actually Joe Kennedy here
is one of the senators who have been
trying to close that thing down they
have a terrible record you know for
example the military leadership in
Colombia comes from there or in Haiti
the military leadership in Haiti comes
from there every single one of them was
trained there actually according to
father bourgeois I spoke to about this a
little while ago
he claimed Eastmont they're monitoring
the School of the Americas there he said
that according to church sources there
there are they saw Haitian officers
there as recently as last October I
can't vouch for that but that's actually
been reported in the church brassey's
know me some coming from church sources
monitoring so yeah I mean that place
already closed now it should have been a
long time ago but but you know low
intensity warfare incidentally is just
another name for international terrorism
that's not a joke if you look at I've
actually I've published some things on
this if you're interested in which I
simply took the US legal code you know
the official Criminal Code in which they
define international terrorism and then
I compared it with the army manuals in
which they define low intensity warfare
and they're identical you know it's the
same thing it's just when we do it we
call it low intensity warfare when
somebody else does that we call
international terrorists
yeah yeah there are two
there are socially responsible
corporations we can encourage the growth
and making it more than think of to as
well let's take rebug okay let me take
[Music]
[Music]
capital close to where the labor is
going to be cheaper than why is it
flowing into countries like before
because the US will not let it the US
would see an order of capital is going
to flow to places where there's
infrastructure and and you know foreign
aid coming in and people you know build
roads and so on the US won't let that
happen
we're strangling them I mean when
they've been tortured enough then
capital start flowing in there but they
haven't been tortured enough that's a
political purpose in my opinion same
with Cuba they gotta be tortured because
people have to be taught a lesson there
are more important to plenty of poor
places where you can send you know even
send factories in fact one of them to
get back to Reebok is Indonesia
Indonesia has some of the worst labor
conditions in the world its wages in
Indonesia are half the level of China
and way below Thailand and that's where
Reebok sends its work to they're using
one of the reasons why Reebok has these
human rights groups is to try to cover
up what they're doing which is in fact
exploiting extremely exploiting labor
under horrifying conditions not only
does Indonesia have it one of the
reasons why Indonesia has such cheap
labor is they don't have any unions
actually they have a union it's a state
union now you can be a member of the
state union if you like you know it's
like Russia but there's no independent
unions that's not allowed and in fact
people try to form them they just get
killed well same with Nike you know a
lot of the sneakers and things are made
in Indonesia in today so you know when
you talk about socially responsible
corporation thank you but the concept of
a socially responsible corporation is
almost a self-contradiction
now I don't want to push it too hard you
know like you don't have to be involved
in torture and murder but the fact is
that if you are in the corporate world
now you can be the nicest person in the
world you know but if you're the CEO of
a corporation your job is
to maximize profit and market share and
if you don't do that you are not going
to be the CEO of the corporation
tomorrow because nobody else will be and
the investment funds will go somewhere
else and when that's your job to
maximize profit and market share there's
a very limited range in which you can be
socially responsible I mean I admit
there's some range you know but not a
lot they look at the case it's like
ladies I haven't looked at this one yet
but ladies Strauss claims I haven't
checked it that in that under pressure
you know under pressure from
shareholders and so on they did work to
reduce in child labor in Bangladesh
which is one place they were producing
this things that could be true I mean
you know you want to check it out and
see if it's true but if these things are
true they and that they're worth
pressing you know it is worth pressing
corporations that shareholder meetings
and so on to do something on the other
hand we shouldn't delude ourselves about
it there's a very limited range not
because they're bad people you know but
because that's the way the institutions
are like if you or I were CEO we
couldn't do anything very different or
we wouldn't remain you know there are
the requirement that I mean here I agree
with Milton Friedman you know any
corporations cannot be humanitarian
institutions they must be what I would
call terrorist institutions designed to
maximize profit for their shareholders
independent of what happens to human
beings and if they don't do that they're
not in the game any longer now it's a
system that there's there's this system
is designed that way it works that way
it was set up that way and that leaves
very little
just like other just like other
third-world industrializing societies so
Eastern Europe under communism was very
much like Mexico City in Santiago now
that's what industrializing societies
are like that's what we were like when
we were in early industrializing society
now that's what Britain was like you
know you
I mean look as recently as the 1960s no
not very long ago and I remember very
well going to London and not being able
to breathe no I mean now they sort of
cleaned up their act but as early as the
early 60s as late as the early 60s
that's after like you know 150 years of
the Industrial Revolution you still
couldn't breathe in London okay when
countries get rich enough you know they
start externalizing the pollution but
when they're just developing they
pollute like man I mean Aaron you know
this was such a big rich country that it
didn't show very much
we had unusual advantages once the
native population was exterminated
you know I needn't pay attention to
slaves and so on if you look at the rest
there's this huge country with enormous
resources you know kind like a paradise
and people coming in okay it pollute
like mad and didn't notice it that's you
don't have that you don't you know
you're the only one of those options in
countries that are industrializing today
so you see it but in a place like
Santiago Chile or Mexico City is you
know these are some of the most polluted
places in the world Eastern Europe was
you know hell-bent on rapid
industrialization under a tyrannical
system actually nothing that with
socialism or anything else and yeah you
get some other worse consequences anyway
there I mean that went along with very
high level of industrialization they
pulled themselves out of the third world
but at a huge environmental cost and
human causes if human dignity and
supplemented if necessary by other means
of social protection furthermore
everyone has a right to form and to join
trade unions for the protection of his
interests as I remember this is 1948 so
the reference to himself and his family
reflects the consciousness of
that day not this day there's been some
improvements well again that's that's
part of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights which we uphold against all
comers against third world countries
with their cultural relativism as the
force of law in the United States just
take a look at the last part everyone
has a right to form and join trade
unions technically there is such a right
in the United States but that's just a
technical right there's an array of
legal and other administrative
conditions which have essentially eroded
that right and it doesn't in fact exist
in fact the United States was brought
before the International Labor
Organization about two years ago and
condemned for its violation of the right
to form unions
that's very rare for the ILO to condemn
an industrial country almost never
happens the United States the United
States was the only country at that time
outside of South Africa in the
industrial world that allowed the use of
strike breakers to undermine the
permanent replacement workers we call
them here scabs in other words to
undermine the right of workers to to the
rights guaranteed by article 23 the that
the destruction of unions in the United
States which has proceeded quite
significantly since the since the 1930s
that since since workers finally run won
in the 1930s the rights that they had in
most of the rest of the world and then
had for a long time but that was very
quickly eroded and by now
unions are reduced to fairly marginal
phenomenon and that's had a very
significant effect one effect that it's
had is on lowering wages so Lawrence
Katz who's the chief economist of the US
Labor Department recently suggested that
that's the main fact that the
destruction of unions is probably the
main factor in the very sharp reduction
of wages that's taken place in the
United States now to the lowest level in
the industrial
I'll return to that the another effect
of the elimination of unions is in
violation of article 23 is just
undermining of democratic processes
generally unions are after all one of
the few mechanisms by which poor people
ordinary people can get together to
advance their own concerns and interests
in the political arena when they do so
incidentally that arouses considerable
antagonism even Hysterium that just
happened a couple of months ago I'll
come back to that it was an interesting
incident aside from reducing wages and
undermining democratic processes but the
elimination or marginalization of unions
has a kind of a psychological effect
it's part of a much more general and
quite significant process of privatizing
aspirations that is of undermining the
idea that you should have concern for
others undermining a sense of solidarity
and sympathy and an idea that sort of
you were all in together we have to work
together it's very important to atomize
people and separate them
[Applause]
the only that thing was gonna tip over
when I stepped on it okay yeah I made it
well that title was picked to be broad
enough to include just about anything
and maybe a good starting point is human
rights they are at least there's a well
accepted standard so codified in fact
universally accepted the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights passed by
the General Assembly of the United
Nations unanimously in December 1948 has
the force of recognized as having the
force of law in the United States
furthermore the United States has been
very prominent in defending the
principle of the universality of the of
the Universal Declaration you'll recall
last year there was big conference in
Vienna with a lot of publicity and very
impassioned rhetoric the US was taking
the lead in defending the principle of
universality against various backward
third-world countries that were claiming
that this was a these were Western
standards which didn't apply to them on
the US was denouncing this cultural
relativism and finally won a grand
victory and the Universal Declaration
was again endorsed that rhetoric is
rarely besmirched by any look at what
the what the text says and it's an
interesting text there's a lot to say
about it
for example there are articles of the
Declaration that have quite direct
bearing on things happening right now
for example in the Caribbean and then in
the Middle East there's time later I
couldn't talk about that but I'm short
so I'll just keep - some of the articles
parts of the Declaration that have a
much broader significance and that tie
in with the larger topics that I want to
review a bit so let's have a look first
that article 25 for example article 25
says that everyone has the right to a
standard of living adequate for the
health and well-being of himself and his
family including food
housing and medical care and necessary
social services and the right to
security obscurity in the event of
unemployment sickness disability
widowhood old age or other lack of
livelihood in circumstances beyond his
control
well that's article 25 and I won't waste
any time discussing how that principle
is upheld in the richest country in the
world with absolutely unparalleled
advantages so certainly no reason why it
cannot be adhered to in full a country
that has a poverty level twice as high
as any other in the industrial world
that has millions of children suffering
malnutrition under third world
conditions and other phenomena that are
familiar to you or that you can easily
see by taking a walk in the nearest city
well that's article 25 so we plainly are
defending the validity of that one so
let's have a look at article 23 so as
everyone has the right to work to free
choice of employment to justin
favourable conditions of work and to
protection against unemployment with
equal pay for equal work and just in
favorable remuneration ensuring for
himself and his family in existence
worthy the second annual social action
lecture series here at the Unitarian
Universalist Church of Marblehead my
name is Tony Toledo buff were a liberal
religious group we've got this idea that
has sprouted to have different people
come over here and speak as a community
service now to me it's very amazing that
this woman standing here is able to call
different folks last year we had
inaugurated our series with Howard Zinn
and our delightful speaker tonight
Jackie had contacted wrote letters and
he's agreed to come over so to introduce
our speaker
Jackie wattenberg
this is going to be a life to remember
even waiting for this for so long
professor Chomsky has spoken all around
the world there's hardly a country that
he has missed in his speaking tours or I
could stay and not invite him it just
speaks there and if books have been
translated all around the world
he's an eminent professor of linguistics
at MIT as many or not this books are
using collagen as textbooks all around
the world may affect my daughter uses
textbook book in the University of
Illinois in Chicago it looks hard our
numerous humor prolific writer beside
linguistics he writes about cars
political philosophy International
Affairs public policy politics of
oppression anywhere your work a sampling
of us books by the way are great up here
in the table backwards if you'd like to
look at them and buy some he'll be
willing to assign them for you this
evening after the lecture when his books
are published
they're usually we reviewed all around
the world make country such as
England Ireland even Japan there are two
countries though there have been a
little bit neglect when reviewing the
books for the years the Soviet Union and
the United States his honors are ready
to make a site without television few
the honorary degrees from the University
of Chicago University of Pennsylvania
University of London and the
distinguished plants awarded 1984 he
received the in Kyoto award and Japan
and 1988 the George Orwell award and he
has been in Bertrand Russell memorial
lecture at Cambridge in England the
neighborhood memorial lecture at New
Delhi the John Locke lecture at Oxford
and a research fellow at high risk and
cognitive space center right here like
me you may have been for term and
certain things occurring in our country
through the recent years or so many
years getting on the Lord an imam or the
Gulf War NAFTA these things you are
concerned about you think well it's sort
of on a beret suit it won't happen again
with us try to stop this class since
I've been acquainted with the writing of
Noam Chomsky and hear him on tape and in
the lectures I realized that he has seen
through his brilliant insights a sort of
large glowing eyes that hide all the
incidents together
and redefines and glues the purpose so
I'm very happy that he's going to speak
to us tonight an exciting topic never
know exactly what I mean until he gets
delves into it bringing the third world
home democracy and human rights in the
New World Order no childhood one another
and privatize their their goals and
aspirations for as a technique of social
control that of great significance and
undermining unions is one of many many
elements of that ideological offensive
of which everyone as it should be is or
should be familiar well coming back to
the matter of Article 23 everyone has
the right to work and free choice of
employment and so on the International
Labour Organization just came out with a
an analysis of the world employment
situation they estimate that 30 percent
of the world's labor force is now
unemployed as of January 1994 unemployed
means and like maybe they can sell you
know postcards at a street corner or
something but that means not enough not
enough work to sustain a minimal
standard of living
that's what unemployed means so that's
30 percent of the world's labor force
well that's worse than the 1930s they
compared it to the great crisis the
crisis of the Great Depression in fact
it's worse it's one part of a huge human
rights catastrophe which shows up in all
sorts of ways
UNESCO estimated that about half a
million children die every year simply
from debt service alone repaying the
debts are the loans are from US and
other commercial banks to their favored
dictators when the debts go sour
will have to be paid for by the poor
people of those countries and
incidentally by US taxpayers because
remember that the banks don't believe in
the free market they believe in
for others but for themselves they
believe in socialism so when the bed
when debts are bad they're socialized in
various ways and the costs are
distributed over the general population
but in say sub-saharan Africa they pay
and they pay for it badly for example
with half a million children dying every
year 11 World Health Organization
estimates 11 million children dying
every year simply from very easily
treatable diseases things like childhood
diarrhoea which you get treat for a
couple of cents and they're dying
because the rich folk don't want to pay
for it or don't even want to know about
it the head of the World Health
Organization described that as a silent
genocide and indeed we would have
absolutely no hesitation in describing
those practices as genocide Alif we
could blame them on someone else when we
blame them on ourselves we don't talk
about them in Eastern Europe since 1989
since we returned to the free world and
the one thing is free at least there's
been a freefall of the economy
into deep third world conditions UNESCO
again came out with a report just
recently estimating the human effects of
what are called the reforms in Eastern
Europe and they estimate that in Russia
alone there's half a million extra
deaths a year simply as a result of the
reforms comparable numbers elsewhere the
term Reform is an interesting one reform
is of course a good thing if something's
are reformed that's really everyone is
in favor of it and so those who might
advocate a different way for these
societies to be taking drawn out of
these Oviatt turning they are
reactionaries or maybe communists or
against reforms and obviously bad people
so that that issue is as settled by your
choice of terminology and if 1/2 million
people die a year from it in russia well
you know
the way the cookie crumbles there is
something called a recovery going on in
the United States although it was
announced by the government today that
they're worried that it's going too fast
so they're going to terminate it this is
the Clinton recovery it's about half the
rate of normal recoveries post-war
recoveries and it's had about a third
the rate of job growth after the
previous six recessions among those jobs
the jobs are also overwhelmingly
low-income jobs so incomes of wages of
continued to drop furthermore that a
huge number of temporary employees in
1992 about 27% of the new jobs were
attempts the figures for this April were
just released and you sure saw them
there were front-page stories but you
had to go down to the by about how
wonderful the job creation was though in
fact much lower than after other
post-war recessions but in fact the
number of temporary jobs with still one
out of six and furthermore they expect
it to continue that way temporary jobs
means that's it does that's another good
thing that improves what's called the
flexibility of the labor market the
technical term for it flexibility means
is a fancy word for insecurity means you
don't know if you're gonna have a job
tomorrow morning when you go to sleep at
night and that's a good thing as any
economist can explain
it improves what's called economic
health economic health is a technical
term that means things are good for
profits not necessarily for people and
in fact for people they're pretty rotten
but for profits that great the last
fortune review of the welfare of
corporations was just glowing with
praise for the enormous increase in in
profits last year again you
of the preceding year so something's
doing well there's not only our have
wages been stagnating and in fact
declining but in fact but what the
workload is also increasing American
workers did finally win a 40-hour week
in the 1930s but they lost it very fast
that's a thing of the past by now
Julie sure who's written the most recent
economist at Harvard is none most of the
work on this estimates that workers have
to work about six weeks extra a year to
maintain their 1970 salaries and if you
look at yesterday's figures you'll again
notice that the average workload has
reached new postwar heights
well it's claimed that all of this has
to do with market forces
it's just inexorable kind of laws of
nature and then people are economists
argue about whether the main effect is
due to international trade or to
automation those are the two those are
the two favorite candidates for the
market forces that are causing all of
this well that discussion is at best
misleading and at worst maybe verging on
fraud in my opinion if you look at the
these factors trade and automation let's
say both of them are only in very small
in in part you could argue about what
part but in part at least market
phenomena a trade for example is
supposed to be efficient everybody
learns that but the efficiency of trade
is achieved by overlooking the
