I wouldn't let me then excuse me did I
interrupt you let me ask you this if in
fact your concern is to communicate are
your moral concern to what extent if you
spent a time thinking about your
techniques now I say this seriously
because it is probably true that under
certain circumstances the communication
of one's own indignation and fury and
strain is best communicated emotionally
either one don't that cycle by by
screaming and yelling
but if fright it becomes observable that
this doesn't bring people around then
you've got to consider the problem it
becomes a moral problem just as you
consent to argue a schvitz of youth
enthralled with somebody if there was a
chance of dissipating something that's
what now when if you have given that
problem any thought to do well how come
that you you end up saying as you during
your book that Senator Mike Mansfield is
course the kind of man who is the terror
of our age well let me put that in its
context as well what I say is I believe
that and what I say is that Senator
Mansfield is an American intellectual in
the best sense they saying reasonable
scholarly man the kind of man who is the
terror of our age and that's essentially
what I was saying before i think that
the terror of our age is the lesson the
same responsible serious quiet man who
watches these things unfold and doesn't
react to them I include my cell phone in
that as I tried to make clear in the
earlier statements well if from but this
way your counsel is surely a house of
despair if on the one hand you are
cautious with your own relative moral
superiority and yet end up despising
yourself appealing to scrupulous attain
for your own shortcomings I mean this
makes this province prettiest not really
for one thing I don't know I don't feel
any relative moral superiority and I
tried maybe fail but I tried very hard
to express that in the book that I said
somewhere in the beginning that if there
is any tone of self-righteousness or
anything like that it's intended and
certainly under
serve and I mean that very much you see
I mean after all given the feelings that
I have which I've just expressed you
know and which you perceive I should be
doing really strong things which I don't
think I am doing so there's no there's
no sense of moral superiority and I'm
not interested in simply you know
throwing blame or doing people marks I
think that the beginning of wisdom in
this case is to recognize something
about what we stand for in the world
what we're doing in the world and I
think when we do recognize that we will
feel an enormous sense of guilt and I
say somewhere in there that one should
be very careful not to let confessions
of guilt overcome the possibility of
action I didn't confessions of guilt can
be very good therapy as they can as well
known they they're also very good
preventative to action and I think one
should be very wary of that I think we I
think we should have some I think that's
your elimination of it is at least
saintly but it still is a dislocating at
least two people who fancy themselves as
spending an equal amount of time
attempting to refine their whole
apparatus of moral discrimination and
who come up with conclusions directly at
variance with your own now the reason I
haven't asked you at this moment to say
you know why we in Vietnam in search of
others because we've been all arguing
about this for four five six years and
the chances of our coming up with
anything especially in you are a small
there's one of the respect in which I
think it is sort of an unarmed volition
yeah you know the issues of just one has
been over them over and over and over
yeah yeah but there are perhaps certain
aspects of the quarrel in Vietnam that
touch especially on your thesis and your
concern in the whole nature of it and
that is the suspicion that some people
have of a double standard of selective
indignation for instance you refer to
the heroic heroic Vietnamese resistance
to American power I think it's
absolutely her sure there's nothing III
understand if I understand left by
language to understand the use of
heroism in that way if you notice there
are a few lines below I say or above I
say something that quite apart from any
question
politics right now suppose I were to
write about the heroic resistance of the
Nazis to the Liberation Army for
instance they used to torture the use of
mass reprisals I don't mean that means
that because I don't think that heroism
doesn't well then I think we do disagree
on the use of the language I don't rise
against we doesn't activate have used I
have used a fire weapons to destroy
whole villages children that they have
disemboweled may and so and hung them up
well let's now this is heroic I know
that is not
oh that's depraved that's not grave in
my opinion so that's very very marginal
well why is it marginal in fact it's
marginal that's question of fact in fact
you know this it's quite you know I
think there's perfect unanimity about
this in the people who've studied it for
example if you look at someone like say
Douglas Pike you know the American
foreign service agent is the chief
expert on the Vietnam I'm on the
Vietcong and you read his book carefully
you discover that he points out that it
was in response to the American military
effort that the Vietcong turned from
their attempt to build mass popular
support by through or through the
organizational methods that involve
giving people actual role in organizing
and controlling their own society and
institutions they turn from that to
physical force in reaction to the
American intervention and if you read if
you have many examples of this quote in
the book from a documents let's say or
from pacification manuals were people I
by the same token you can say that the
Nazis turned to torture in France are in
reaction to Eisenhower's landing in
Normandy the answer is the people so
disposed to act or certain kinds of
people and I yearned for a recognition
of this in your writings when Douglas
Pike's as a matter of fact Douglass Pike
as you know how certain difficulty with
the fact that it is acknowledged that up
twenty-five thirty thousand people were
individually killed by terrorists before
and when America's Rd it was between
1958 1962 I think I'll turn nine
thousand is the figure that's given
usually well right and these are and
it's interesting to see what it was I
mean what if one really wants to talk
about the account error during the
period prior to the American
then again I think just about all
commentators denis werner bernhard fall
where we like has agreed that by and
large this was terror directed extremely
selectively against oppressive and
external village officials and what was
elected ardent the burning of don't
evoke was elected to you but i think one
is it was intended to establish a
universal point it was it so attended
region of Eichmann selectively well but
you see there's a very big difference I
think you see if you want to personally
I'm against all kinds of terror than the
question but if you want to understand
the vietcong situation then let's
recognize a very great distinction at
least directly let's see what the
political point of the terror was after
all their work during that period there
were about nine or ten thousand
according to american sources there were
maybe nine or ten thousand village
officials one sort or another
killed by the Vietcong largely with the
support of the villages that's what but
at the same time recall that there were
perhaps 160,000 Vietnamese if we accept
foreign polls figures again killed by
the Saigon government and the Americans
is prior to 1965 there was a very
different kind of terror both in
quantity and also in its political yeah
but if it seems to me that you are
attempting here to match things which
are not which are not equal sixty
thousand ohm answer my point is that one
presumably distinguishes between an act
of terror to terrorism which you call
depraved a moment ago and a witness
drybeck turning a village is to promote
our action with equals even more
different for example he said well let
me give you some examples of what I
considered to create the object Malcolm
Brown back in nineteen sixty two or
three do not remember
report it was a I think eighty or you
think correspond reported that Saigon
officials were sending American Skyhawks
you know airplanes over to over
Vietnamese Vietnamese villages to wipe
them out with napalm raids in order to
cover instances of graft for example
well that's I think depraved and
certainly I don't condemn that because
you see just to mention this matter of
double standard they're really three
kinds of terror in Viet
there's Vietcong terror there's the
Saigon government terror and there's an
American terror and if you read what
I've written I say practically nothing
about either Viet Cong terror or terror
carried out by the Saigon government now
if one wanted to talk about that one
would have to point out that the terror
carried out by the Saigon government is
incredibly greater in extent and has a
very different political purpose which
one to discuss but I restrict myself in
America when we could you know that does
become a matter of fact which one could
discuss yeah but I as a matter of
principle almost restrict myself to the
discussion of American terror neither
not the terror carried out by the
various sides in Vietnam for many
reasons for one thing because it's just
qualitatively different in scale and for
another thing because I feel that we
have some responsibility for it
see I don't in the same sense I don't
talk about that you know I've never
written about the terror carried out by
both sides in Nigeria love see I don't
like it obviously but I don't see any
point in my giving them good or bad
marks for it on the other hand if we
were carrying out the terror I would
very definitely write about it I think
so there's no double standard as far as
I can see at least let's say I have a
standard in mind one thing I may not
accept we will explore that
