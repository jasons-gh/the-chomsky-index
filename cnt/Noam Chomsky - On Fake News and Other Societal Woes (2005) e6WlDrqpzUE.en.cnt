hi mr. Chomsky yes this is Irene from no
one's listening okay but in honor of
your appearance on our show we're
calling it gnomes listening surveys
about video news releases videos video
news releases and fake news well I
imagine you probably don't have much
time to watch a lot of TV since you've
got 90 bucks but I think actually the
reason I think you are good for this
show is because you can sort of give a
historical analysis for what's going on
in the print media there was a period
the mid 19th century that's the period
of the freest press in both England in
the US and it's quite interesting to
look back over the history but over the
years that's declined it declined for
two basic reasons one reason is the
increased capital that was required to
run a competitive press with a lot of
glitz and the popular appeal and so on
and as capital requirements increased
that of course led to a more
corporatized media the other effect is
advertising in the 19th century
something kind of approximating a market
market system now we have like a market
but they make teaching economics courses
that's not the way it works and one of
the signs of the decline of the market
is advertising right so if you have a
real market you don't advertise you just
give information so for example there
are corners of the economy that do run
like markets for example the stock
market is a market if you have ten
shares of General Motors you want to
sell you don't put up an ad on
television with
you know a sexy model holding up the 10
shares saying you know ask your broker
this is good for you it's good for me or
something like that what you do is you
sell them at the market price right if
we had a market for say cars or
toothpaste or whatever lifestyle drugs
you do the same thing
I mean GM would put up the brief notice
saying here's the information about our
models well you've seen television so I
don't think they work one or two yeah
the idea is to delusion and deceive
people with imagery that's where I
learned about you right I'm kidding look
it's true we all know so and the same
has happened to the print media I mean
by now there's taken New York Times for
example they have something called the
news hole when the editors laya
tomorrow's newspaper first thing they do
is the important things they've put the
ads around and then they have a little
bit left that's called the news hole and
you sort of give them things there and
quite apart from that the media
themselves are just big corporations of
course rights represent the interests of
their owners their market which is
advertisers and the for the elite
newspapers that are less than ideal
class educated population they deal with
and the end result is you get a very
narrow perspective on what what's neat
bold is life but then what would be the
alternative I mean I guess that's where
I'm searching
would be a free press it's not hard to
imagine there actually was one and they
did so that would mean a dress that is
not reliant on corporate on massive
capital concentrations corporate
ownership that is not reliant on
advertising for its revenue and that
would involve engaged people
you're interested in understanding the
world and participating and reasoned
discussion about what did you be like
right right I mean it's actually crazy I
don't know if you know how these video
news releases work there's actually PR
agencies that I mean they don't even try
to be covert about it they'll be called
vnr PR agency it's very open
anybody who's looked takes a television
in the industry when they have a an hour
program whatever it is is a comedy cop
show or whatever is in the industry
there's what's called content and fill
right the content is the advertising the
fill is the car chase or the now
supposed to keep you going between ads
and if you look at a television program
actually do it sometimes because I'm
intrigued the creativity and the
imagination and the expenses and so on
are for the ads the car chase you can
pull off the show I'm going and in fact
this has led to a very serious
deterioration of the political system I
mean we don't have anything even
resembling a democracy anymore
take a look the last campaign the
campaign is run by the same people who
sell toothpaste and exactly the same PR
agencies and when they sell a candidate
they do it the same way as when they
sell you know a lifestyle drug you don't
put up information about the candidate
what you do is create diluting imageries
images to dilute and deceive right what
the population knows so a very small
number of the pocket about 10 percent of
the voters literally knew the stands of
the candidates on issues and it's not
things they're stupid or uninterested
it's just like you don't know the
characteristics of this base well it's a
one-way mediated relationship and
hopefully that's what this show is about
we talk about media and media ethics and
it's not always related to politics I
mean it's related to
ten men and everything because awfully
we can change that and people can start
questioning their relationship there's
really two separate questions about the
media which are usually muddled one is
what they're trying to do and a second
one is what's the effect on the public
that's a different thing but the extent
that it has been it seems that among the
more educated sectors the indoctrination
works more effectively among the less
educated sectors people are just more
skeptical and cynical right so what can
we do because now I'm depressed a lot of
I think it's a very optimistic future
frankly oh really yes you have 90 bucks
look very much so I mean just take that
this is there's something we know about
the country this country more than any
other we know a lot about public opinion
study very intensively very rarely
reported great you can find them it's an
open society to find them what they show
is remarkable what they show first of
all is that both political parties and
the media are far to the right of the
general population on a whole host of
issues and the population is just you
know disorganized atomized and so as
this country ought to be and organizers
paradise and the that's why the media
and the campaign's keep away from issues
they know that on issues they're going
to lose people so therefore you have to
have portray George Bush is look it's a
pampered kid who came from a rich family
went to prep school elite University and
you have to present him as an ordinary
guy you know who makes grammatical
errors which I'm sure he's trained to
make he didn't talk their way at Yale
and the fake Texas twang in soft it was
real
cut brush or something right that's
that's like a toothpaste day that's I
think a lot of people know it and what
we and given the facts about public
opinion it means what's needed is
something not very radical let's become
as Democratic as say the second largest
country in the hemisphere Brazil I mean
their last election was not between two
rich kids who went to the same elite
University and joined the same secret
society where they're trained to be
members of the upper class and can get
into politics because they have rich
families with a lot of connections I
mean people were actually able to vote
elect the president from earn ranks
man who was a union leader never had a
higher education and come from the
population they could do it because it's
a functioning democratic society it
tremendous obstacle
you know repressive state huge
concentration wealth much worse
obstacles we have but they have mass
popular movements they have actual
political parties which mean there's
nothing to stop us from doing that I
mean we have a legacy of freedom which
is unparalleled it's been won by
struggle over centuries never give it
right you can use it or you can abandon
it
but don't you think to some extent maybe
people don't even realize their own
discontent because of the media I think
people are very discontented and the
attitudes towards the media are very
cynical one skeptic
well the attitudes towards the media but
because we're not banding together they
must feel that sort of detachment they
don't know where to get angry or to band
less true yeah but that's again the lack
of democratic structures right I mean
it's like if you have popular movements
and that's what you why our Union so
detested by elites because unions are
a few ways in which you know on people
without great privilege working people
can actually get together for a workers
education for interaction for
participation in the political arena and
so on so therefore they have to be
destroyed no you know and there's many
others we can it's true it's a very
atomized Society and there are a lot of
reasons for that I'm in the United
States has gone through the last 25
years when it's gotten much worse the US
has gone through a unique period of
economic history real wages for the
majority of the population have
stagnated or declined yeah working hours
have gone way up way they are now the
highest and the industrial world wages
are about the lowest Justin or and
people are yeah from infancy you know I
watch children's television with my
grandchildren sometimes you know from
early infancy you were a huge was
propaganda about how your life depends
your value as a human being depends on
how many useless commodities use their
product so you know and so you have a
working family you know husband wife
we're going to keep food on the table
there kids want to buy everything there
is oh so you even though they don't need
it or want it then you go deeply into
debt you know then you and you're
trapped and then you don't have time to
talk to people you don't know what your
neighbors think popular attitudes are
just not reported
sometimes it's fantastic so after the
federal budget came out last February
the major public opinion ensued the
country did a careful poll of people's
attitudes toward the budget well it was
just like about a mirror image of what
the budget was we're expensive it we're
federal spending is going up no military
Afghanistan people wanted the good town
large majorities where it's going down
same large majorities people wanted to
go up social spending education
renewable energy is sport for the United
Nations and so on a huge majority wants
to rescind ambitious tax cuts for the
rich people over $200,000 income and so
on but well how was that reported well
actually somebody friend did a database
search on it zero are they scared are
these I mean I've interviewed some
journalists for the show and they're not
they'll tell you and they're correct
that nobody is ordering them to do
anything that's right
that's the basic doctrine ation is so
deep right that educated people think
they're being objective actually this is
a point that or well made I mean you and
everybody else has read Animal Farm I'm
sure mm-hmm
but you and everybody else hasn't read
the introduction to Animal Farm there's
a good reason for that it was suppressed
the introduction for it was found 30
years later and Orwell's unpublished
papers the introduction to Animal Farm
says basically look this book is a
satire a none totalitarian state but he
talked about England
