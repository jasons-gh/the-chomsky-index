I Arabia was crushed instantly there was
such an intimidating military force no
even showed up and that was considered
fine so out on the wrist so they keep
the population under control but they
also have most of the oil and they make
sure that it works the way the West want
so they're the ones making support
jihadism they can set up madrasas
throughout the arab world to train and
in fact even elsewhere like pakistan to
Train jihad ease the US and Britain
don't mind as long as they serve their
main function it's quite consistent in
these to get in the internal records in
both the US Britain who's talking of
spillover effect into having the
population of Gaza up residence
Eliminator Hamas is a pretty brutal
outfit and they run the place they run a
very tight ship in fact you can see
developing a sort of a tacit agreement
between Israel Hamas and the Palestinian
Authority to keep things the way they
are that allows us to run Gaza that
allows the Palestinian Authority you
know for the subsidiary to Israel in the
u.s. to run gaza strip of course Israel
likes it but there's there was an effort
there were you move about a year ago I
guess there was a very brave statement
of a number of young group of young
people in Gaza who came out through some
electronic medium I forgot
now with a strong statement calling for
freedom for justice for an end to
oppressive rule and so on they were
nobody knows what happened to them they
were crushed pretty quickly the West
Bank it's kind of the same there's an
army which was originally trained and
run by a US general Keith Dayton not
some other general I forget who which it
works with the Palestinian Authority and
it's a task is essentially to keep the
population quiet in fact when when the
time of the invasion of Gaza there were
no there was concern that there might be
protests in the West Bank but there
weren't any because the Dayton army
simply crushed them and they were pretty
proud of general Dayton himself gave a
speech you can pick it up on the
Internet to the Washington Institute of
Near East policy was cold it's basically
an offshoot of a pact they call it an
independent policy agency in which he
praised the achievement he said we did a
really great job we kept any protest
from developing in fact we did such a
good job that the Israeli army which of
course we work in close connection with
was able to take forces out of the West
Bank and use them for the attack on Gaza
thanks to the US Palestinian Authority
cooperation through the Dayton army
which kept them quiet Senator John Kerry
and our senator was the so he sort of
Obama's point man on the Middle East
he's the one who goes out doshi eights
and so on he made a speech at the
Brookings Institution this would have
been february2014
10 i guess in a year ago in which he he
said that things are kind of improving
in the region for the first time ever he
said israel has a legitimate negotiating
partner you know they've been pleading
for years for somebody negotiated with
them and now finally they have a
negotiating partner of Palestinian
Authority and he had one bit of evidence
the Dayton army his evidence was that
the Dayton army was so effective that it
was even able it was able to ensure that
there would be not even a protest when
Israel invaded jezik so that shows
things are improving but I don't get
back to your question I think at least
as things now stand the chances of any
uprising in Gaza seem very slim but
they're just under way too much pressure
both internally and from Israel and up
till now from Egypt if there is a real
democracy opening in Egypt Egyptian
policy might change in Israel's quite
worried about it a West Bank it's
conceivable that there could be some
kind of resonance to the general purpose
throughout the region but it hasn't
happened yet professor hi could he named
in the back on the first floor you
mentioned that a lot of the news too
doesn't reach the United States and a
lot of the messages that we do find in
the mainstream media are biased can you
make some recommendations on some
websites that we can read or newspapers
and periodicals that would allow us to
gain more balanced view of what's going
on in that region by now there are
plenty of sources available if you
willing do a little work like for direct
coverage regular coverage daily coverage
there's nothing that compares with al
Jazeera it's it's highly professional
coverage it has its limits like Al
Jazeera's based in Qatar and they don't
say anything about qatar and they don't
you know for example when suit when the
uprising was crushed in Bahrain didn't
say anything about barely said anything
about it because Katherine government
supported it but with such limits they
do very good reporting and in fact
they're the only you know really expert
hour almost hour by hour or reporting of
the main things that are happening like
during the Gaza invasion they were
giving 24-hour coverage on the ground
comes nothing else there during these
uprisings like say Egypt dr square they
were the ones who were right on top of
it they have arab-speaking journalists
very high quality and so on they're kept
out of the United States I think there
are two towns in the US where you can
even get it on cable television the most
of the world pick it up
the way but you can't get it on the
internet and there are other websites
the first week and yet other journal you
can get other newspapers so if you read
say the British press I don't want to
say it's magnificent but on this issue
it's a little more open you can get
pretty good reporting and the Guardian
the independent so on mixed with other
stuff and there are if you take a look
at some of the main web you know popular
with you know general of websites AZ net
is a ton of material coming up
constantly I mean you go to evaluate it
not all of it makes any sense you know
it's like everything else you have to
use your judgment but it's certainly
much broader variety you better go to
where the mic is
I'm sorry Gaddafi funding hot baffan
yeah Oh in the secure your support for
Qaddafi is surreal and that's it's
amazing the way it's being suppressed
like you know right now the couple of
two weeks ago that there's a trial
underway in The Hague no international
tribunal the international tribunal on
Sierra Leone atrocities in Sierra Leone
which were horrible the person on trial
is Charles Taylor the chief prosecutor
is an American law professor from
Syracuse University he was very bitter
about that the trial just ended he was
very bitter about it because he wanted
to try Qaddafi he said they have
evidence that Qaddafi was the main
person responsible as he put it for the
killing over a million people in Sierra
Leone but written in the United States
blocked it and when he was asked why he
said welcome to the world of oil period
right in Cambridge Massachusetts there's
a group based in harvard business school
it's cold was it cold they forget the
name of it but they were just exposed by
a Boston Globe reporter they have been
providing services to Qaddafi including
the writing
p our material for him appraising his
magnificent thoughts about the society
and democracy and so on big shots at the
harvard business school in England it's
you know in England actly would hit
headlines so the head of the dictators
of the Saudi Arabia is not over to
revile son of a loose cannon so when
they have a would if I have an
opportunity to get rid of them they'll
be happy to do it but whereas a king
abdullah or something they can do what
he likes but its but yes there's been
flying of support come these are be
headlines all these things well you
better find the mic cuz who's got the
mic where oh okay
and in Europe in if the United States is
able to switch entirely to domestically
produced renewable energy resources and
we no longer these rely on any oil from
the Arab world how it was sort of an
impact this hat on US air fallacious
approximately two euro in my opinion
there's a lot of Mythology about this I
mean the US doesn't get most of its oil
from the Middle East in fact if you look
at us energy policy so for example year
2000 last Clinton yearly came out with a
big study of energy and the conclusion
was the u.s. of course has to control
the Middle East but that goes way back
but it should that's a matter of world
control but the US itself it said should
rely on more secure Atlantic Basin
supplies the meaning Western Hemisphere
and West Africa so the rest of the world
can rely on in secure supplies but we
got to make sure we rely on secure ones
in fact if you look back at the history
it really is surreal so back in the
1950s for example the US was the main by
far the main producer in fact the main
export the Eisenhower administration
made a decision to to essentially
eliminate us domestic resources to take
us oil only from Texas which was much
more expensive than from Saudi Arabia
but this was for the benefit of Texas
oil producers so there was a decision to
exhaust US domestic resource of course
it couldn't exhausted with the deplete
US domestic resources for the benefit of
Texas oil producers and a couple of
corrupt cabinet members who pretty soon
you know big shots in the Texas oil
system and and to pay a lot more for us
I mean Americans pay a lot more for oil
you know that's what they were doing and
if and that went on for I think 14 years
right through the Democratic
administrations of the 60s what they are
essentially doing was depleting us oil
resources leaving big holes in the
ground which we now call the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve and we fill it up from
imported oil from Saudi Arabia you know
I mean these systems are run in order to
make money for the right kind of people
not for reasons of security and today to
get back your question if the US were
running a hundred percent on solar power
we have exactly the same policy stores
the middle east you go back towards to
the global planning at the end of the
Second World War it was recognized
pretty clearly in fact said quote one of
the leading advisers one of Roosevelt
Truman's leading advisers that if we can
control Middle East oil but we will have
substantial control of the world because
it is such a powerful instrument of
control and that remained true right
through the 50s when the u.s. wasn't
using correctly not using the oil at all
and it would continue today these are
instruments of world control
hello oh this entire conversation
appears to be revolving around a
relationship with Israel after Israel
United States donates more money to
Egypt than any other country and we're
also talking about Egypt when talking
about Israel's decisions about how to
relate to its neighbors you're talking
about the demographic problem and you
were talking about the blockade of the
wall and also our blockade of the Gaza
Strip however the blockade of the Gaza
Strip is impossible without Egypt's help
and I believe that's why we give money
to Egypt and that's why we back embark
to protect Israel and to allow them to
defend it ever got a demographic
situation what my question is what is it
that's compelling us to do such acts for
Israel what is it that we're so
interested in is it about the oil yeah
what's the source of us perfectly right
I made me one of the reasons the US and
Israel were upset about the threat to
Mubarak it was that he was cooperating
in the strangulation of the Gaza Strip
that's only one part of it his agreement
there was a peace treaty between Egypt
and Israel in 1979 the long history of
that but the effect of the treaty was
understood right away it freed Israel up
to carry out aggressive actions
elsewhere so you read Israeli strategic
analysts say I've Mary on Eve right in
nineteen you know 80 he said okay now
Israel's free we're not going to have
any threat from Egypt you know so
therefore we're free to attack Lebanon
say which they did right after that was
there big invasion of Lebanon and it's
sort of been kept that way so for if if
Egypt did have a democratic opera you
know succeeded almost certainly that
arrangement wouldn't remain or at least
you know
reducing character and then Israel would
be forced to deploy forces in the
southern region and so on so why is the
US supporting Israel well that's a very
interesting question and if you look
closely you can find reasons so just ask
yourself for a minute where is the
strongest support coming from so take
say the press I mean the most rabid
pro-israel newspaper is the wall street
journal now the wall street journal is
not part of the lobby it's the profits
the newspaper the business world the
Republicans are far more extreme in
support of Israeli expansion and
atrocities that the Democrats Jewish
votes and Jewish money tend to go to the
Democrats but again the Republicans of
the business party and they're so deep
in the pockets of corporate America need
a telescope to find them you know that's
there that's a good that's what they are
you know and so they are strongly
supportive of Israel if you look at the
business community at large you see
pretty much the same thing other day
think good Israel's fine so in US
investment in high-tech industry and
Israel keeps going up Intel major chip
producer in the world has a new
generation of chips coming out that they
say is going to they think will take
over the world market the main factory
they're building right now as it is
rayul they have a military industry for
them Israel's a bonanza so say tape
Lockheed Martin when the United States
essentially gives Israel f-35s that's a
huge boost for Lockheed Martin but
remember it's a double boost because
when the u.s. gives arms to Israel
that's what's called in retail marketing
a teaser it
what it means is that Saudi Arabia which
has all the money they're going to come
along and say we want something like
that too then the u.s. can send
second-rate arms which they can't use
any way to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf
states and in fact Obama just made it no
he's three million dollars to Israel but
he just made a 60 billion dollar deal
with Saudi Arabia well you know that
that's for a long time been the way in
which the u.s. unto a lesser degree
Britain recycle petrodollars keep
military industry functioning and so on
so they love it and there are big lobby
you know the very powerful US military
intelligence military and intelligence
have had pretty close relations with
israel since the 50s and maintain them a
part of all these kind of concrete bases
of support there are kind of cultural
issues which i don't think should be
dismissed so the us enough to tell you
is a an unusually religious country it's
kind of off the spectrum international
spectrum and religious belief and it's
not just evangelicals that's a leads
it's a leads to and in fact christian
zionism the growth of britain in the
United States goes back way before
Jewish Zionism you know it goes back to
the 19th century before the Jewish
Zionist movement even took off and it's
quite real so for example during the
First World War when British general
Allenby talker jerusalem from the Turks
you just take a look at the headlines in
the mainstream US and British press
there Richard that general Allenby was
Richard the lion-hearted literally
rescuing the holy land from the infidels
in other words he was winning the war
the Crusades finally huge cheers you
know well the next thing after we get
the Holy Land back from the infidels is
you have to follow the words in the
Bible well you know the Lord to be
is the war god that's who the Lord of
the Old Testament is the war god
promised the Land of Israel to the Jews
so we got to bring the juice bag that's
fulfilling God's will you go on to say
the Roosevelt administration not secular
administration but one of her assaults
main advisors Harold Ickes was secular
of course said that the return of Jews
to Palestine then is the I think the
greatest achievement in human history he
said something like that and this goes
all the way to the present you know that
it's extremely religious country it
extends over much of the population now
people like Woodrow Wilson and Harry
Truman and they're reading the Bible
every day and the Bible tells you things
like it tells you Tara holy land doesn't
belong to the infidels they don't belong
there and the Jews have to go back and
then if you go away off to the Christian
Right and you get into the revivalists
movement okay then there's more things
happening like that movement actually
really took off in 1948 the Jews were
back in how I thought I'd you go to now
Israeli go to the Book of Revelations it
goes on until we have you know
Armageddon and everybody slaughters each
other which is wonderful because those
are the souls that are saved for eyes to
heaven including incidentally 144,000
Jews for some reason but the rest are
eternal damnation so we've gotta put
press this and you know this again is
not you know strange preachers in Texas
this is right in the White House so for
example type say george w bush no it
hasn't been discussed much but when bush
was trying to get international support
for the invasion of Iraq we're now
talking about january 2003 he met with
the president of France Sherratt and we
sort of have the documents from the
fridge but that Bush apparently started
ranting about some extremely obscure
passage in the book of ezekiel it's
about go and Magog and nobody knows what
it means I mean by they people are they
places whatever it is but according to
this passage gobind magalie that come
down and you know destroy Israel and
then comes Armageddon and all kind of
things Sharik had no idea what he was
talking about so here he asked the
French Foreign Office the Elysee if they
could explain to him what this maniac is
raving about and they didn't know so
they contacted a built-in theologian yes
that's how i found out of it the Belgian
theologian sent me a copy of a
disquisition that he wrote to the French
Foreign Office explaining the
interpretations of this obscure passage
and its role and you know Christian
right you know fantasies well you know
this is annoyed house I mean what that
stuff is not insignificant and there are
other things too that the United States
remember is a settler colonial society
the whole so-called anglosphere the
expansion of England is settler colonial
imperialism United States Canada and
Australia that's the most vicious form
of imperialism because it means wiping
out the indigenous population the French
sort of was the same in Algeria but most
imperialism wasn't that way it's the
Anglosphere which is typically settler
colonial and that's deep in our history
I mean I know about you
when I was a little kid that we were
playing cowboys and Indians and we were
too cowboy is killing the Indians no I
think it's a little better these days
but this is really deep in the culture
it's a settler colonial society we
belong here they don't they were all
kinds of stories about I don't they
didn't really have any right to the land
and should be from this oil it's right
through the the most you know elite
literature you know it's not my crazy
stuff and that that's just part of
general consciousness and they take a
look at Israel that's what it is Blair
colonial society its advanced the
culture of Europeans coming into this
land and eliminating the barbarians they
don't belong there in the first place
and this is kind of a natural sympathy
that develops and I think all of these
are factors that shouldn't be ignored
how deep they are is another question
but that you could have said the same
with South Africa in fact it was true in
South Africa there was a very natural
associate in South Africa's another
settler colonial society that and
there's a natural kind of sympathy in
white America with the white nationalist
racism it was real you know and
nevertheless the US did change policy
you kind of start talking about Kirsty
South Africa beginning of your speech
you said that the comparisons are also
questionable if you could explain I
really don't think it's a very good
comparison the first one in the case of
Israel there's two questions one is
Israel itself and secondly the occupied
territories Israel itself has is a
discriminatory society and there's
plenty of discriminatory little ism have
been writing about three years but it's
nothing like apartheid I think it's more
like the United States has been through
much of its history and still the some
extent is so it's bad and it should be
overcome and their things to say about
it but it's not a partly on the other
one you get to the occupied territory
it's much worse than a court hood much
worse just remember white South Africa
needed the black population they are its
workforce just like the slave states in
the South needed the black population
that's the workforce get rid of them and
if you if you need in fact if you go
back to the Civil War it's worth reading
the debates they're not I mean the slave
owners had arguments they thought they
were right you know and I justified
their position and they had arguments
some of which were never really answered
so for example to be anachronistic if I
owned a car and you rent the same car
and we come back in year later which
one's going to be in better shape well
mine will since I own it I'll take care
of it you don't own it so you know it
gets dead it or something happens you
won't do anything well that's the slave
owners argument we own our workforce
you've read them so we take care of our
workforce you know you can just toss
them out in a few it's called wage labor
you rent them you know what I'm anymore
you toss about you know responsibility
for them so we're the ones who are moral
and you're mr what you might think about
with
answer that anyhow that's the that was
essentially the South African white
stand that we take care of the Baptist
and because we need them and in fact
that some extent they did there was some
development in the bathroom stands at
partly for this reason partly because
they were trying to make them enough of
the showcase so that the world would
recognize them perfectly happy to get
rid of them all there's the nuisance you
know so they don't take care of them
they don't support them I mean they're
just a nuisance give it and they used to
use them as workforce years ago but that
ended quite a while ago partly because
it ended because of the success of
what's called neoliberalism the
neoliberalism is the set of policies
that the US and its allies imposed on
much of the world through the World Bank
in the IMF and the World Trade
Organization and so on very highly
regarded if you taking economics versus
though tell you how wonderful it is but
in fact it practically devastated the
societies and it left a huge number of
people called misery one of the reasons
why there's so much immigration from
Mexico there are others but that's one
well as this plague spread spread around
the world Israel was able to get very
cheap labor from Thailand you know Latin
America Romania you know actually their
favorites were from China I wasn't the
old liberalism there but the favorites I
was
maybe they're in called slave labor what
is virtually what they were contract
labor the take away their passports you
know they're under the control of the
contractor brings them in the beauty of
China was that Chinese labor was that if
they ever protested so like maybe they
wanted their wages paid or something you
could just call it in the Chinese
embassy and the Chinese embassy would
lay down the law you see you shut up or
we're going to send you back to China
and you know it's going to have you
there so that was a nice arrangement but
as long as they have that cheap semi
slave workforce they don't need
Palestinians anymore fifth Palestinians
they were less have to take care in any
event and in the occupied territories a
lot worse than a fortnight there was
nothing in the bathurst ends that's
treated say like has or even the West
Bank so in two respects I don't think
it's a valid analogy but there is a
valid analogy I think maybe the one I
mentioned that's almost never discussed
because there's one taboo topic in the
United States and in the West generally
namely actual power the actual power of
the United States and its allies and the
way they run the world it's kind of
taboo you're not supposed to talk about
that so that's sort of excluded although
it's the core issue for maybe because
it's the collision
thank you in the last 30 years that I've
been involved in this issue I've seen an
enormous increase in public awareness on
this question more op-eds printed were
led us to the editor even a growth of
awareness within the American Jewish
community just incredibly different 30
years ago norman finkelstein or not
Finkelstein and I spoke here we were
shouted that and it's just an incredible
difference between you know this evening
but nonetheless even though that has
happened many many people here have been
to the west bank and gaza and so on
Congress no matter what Israel does
invade Lebanon invade gaza build
settlements which and humiliate our you
know our diplomats and so on and
statements like this whenever israel to
something outrageous they have a
resolution that comes forward and
everyone votes for it including our own
representative who is a great guy in all
kinds of social issues and i've met with
in and brought him information whatever
what can we do to reverse this so that
somebody like deval patrick for instance
would even have a clue that making a
business arrangement which he just did
with israel has some moral overtones and
political overtones nobody would have
done that in the eighties with south
africa they would have known that there
was a political cost or they might have
known there was a political cost what
can we do to help that because despite
the public opinion members of Congress
are overwhelmingly voting you know
unquestionably for always here well you
were to say is a little right i mean
i've been doing this since the 60s I
mean not very long ago I'd have to have
police protection I was giving a talk
and yes meetings were broken up and just
even a couple of years ago so yeah
that's changed normally but the
comparison to South Africa in the 80s
not quite accurate because you know by
the 80s even US business was opposed to
apartheid okay that Congress was passing
resolutions and so on you compare it to
the 60s of the 50s it's more like the
case of Israel that there's a lot of
public opposition
two races races but nothing nothing in
in public policy it took a lot of work
there was a lot of organizing activism
education and it made a breakthrough so
they first I think the first sanctions
proposal at a university at least as i
recall i think was as late as 1977 that
hampshire you know kind of a university
that's kind of on the outside and that
was after a long time I'm by then even
American corporations were starting to
boil so and in fact what you described
here with regard to the get the first of
all we don't forget we're not a majority
I mean you're right that there's a big
change but that's a long way from saying
you know we speak for the people you
know that's so the Maoists slogans a
long way to go but it's a big change but
even but you just think about American
politics I mean even where the public is
overwhelmingly in favor of something it
always never affects policy if it harms
business interests okay so take say
that's my Tech's a healthcare big issue
I mean right now we're all supposed to
you know be worried about how to cut the
deficit I pretty straightforward way to
get rid of deficit and in any economist
to look at this a fully aware of it you
want to get rid of deficit establish a
health care system like other industrial
countries that's not exactly a utopian
goal they take you know every other
industrial country has national health
care systems which have about half the
per capita cost of the United States I
generally have better outcomes and you
know don't have
tens of thousands of people without
insurance so in fact you know you can
refer you to the sources if you want but
it's been worked out if we had the same
kind of health care system as other
industrial countries that we would not
only not have a deficit we'd have
surplus is anybody suggesting that I
mean sounds insane you know how can you
oppose the insurance companies and the
financial corporations however they're
the guys who fund elections they're the
ones who put OBO mendel office you know
that's so you know maybe a third of
corporate profits you can't offend them
than what the public wants I mean when
Obama gave away the public option and
remember he gave it away without even a
an effort I was over the opposition of
about close to two-thirds of the
population doesn't make any difference
when he made his deal with the
pharmaceutical corporations drug prices
in the United States are you know two or
three times as high as anywhere else the
reason is that the u.s. is I think alone
in the world in having a legislative
framework which prevents the government
from negotiating drug prices so of
course they're sky-high every other
country does that actually the US
doesn't to for the Veterans
Administration and they're the correct
price
more or less under control well Obama
gave that one away too there was not one
call about it that there was eighty-five
percent opposition did it make any
difference no I mean if you have a
country that's run by concentrations of
capital the moment it happens to be
heavily the financial institutions as
long as the public's you can keep the
public quiet it doesn't matter what they
think and that's true an issue after
issue and furthermore the public knows
it you could you take a look at for
years ever since the Reagan years there
have been regular polls good holding
agencies on where people are asked who
do you think the government works were
and get figures like about eighty
percent often saying that the government
works for the few and the special
interests not for the people they don't
ask who you mean by special interests
but that would be the next question but
whatever people mean basically correct
and it's one of them one of the reasons
I'm sure whether such anger frustration
you know hatred of all institutions I
mean the attitudes towards just about
every institution are in like often
single digits double digits well because
people hate everything that's going on
but they don't think they can do
anything about it and what does get done
is is extremely destructive but so so
yeah you're right about Israel but a
generalized we've got a big problem
about the democracy deficit in the
country
you
can hear me along issues you talked
about then confirming the Palestine
papers to come out recently he talked
about how those papers have not been
covered in the American media sorry
didn't get the questioner ok discussed
by the Palestine papers have been
published in other countries have not
been covered by American media sources
other countries have not been covered
the Palestine papers the WikiLeaks like
documents the way lyric Palestine papers
well Paul Stine yeah do you speak about
why those haven't been covered by
American media sources when they have
been covered by other sources such as
Britain I don't read the British presses
carefully as I do here but I didn't see
a lot of coverage of them in the British
press the some but not a lot but my
feeling on the case of the Palestine
papers the first time I read them and
they were interesting but you know I
thought they were mostly just
embarrassing I mean what they reflected
was the complete desperation on the part
of the Palestinians no matter what they
give away they just left it and it s
perd that reflected extreme arrogance on
the part of Israel and the United States
if you read the statements of you know
Condoleezza Rice and others is full of
contempt for the Palestinians integrally
give you or shut up basically yah we
sort of know that and the Palestine
papers brought it out kind of
graphically but I didn't see any maybe i
missed it but I didn't see any real
major leaks now there were some of the
WikiLeaks documents that did have
revealing information
much of that really didn't get covered
but I just didn't see it in the
Palestine favors actually some of what
came out in WikiLeaks bears on the
question that somebody asked you did I
think about us support for Israel so
some of the WikiLeaks documents from
with forget where they came from listed
actually this report ins for I found
only appeared in Israel listed strategic
locations throughout the world locations
that are of very high security concern
to the United States so we must be
careful to preserve them however maybe a
dozen or so that one of them was right
near Haifa the Raphael the military
production center which produces cluster
bombs and other events the materials
well ok US government considers that one
of the main strategic sites to that we
have to protect in the world and if you
look more closely raffaella which is
Israel is the biggest military producer
is their military production Israel's
closely linked to the US you know all
integrated they actually moved a lot of
their management facilities to the
United States because they have a closer
easier contact with the funders and so
on when they're here than when they're
in Israel it's kind of an offshoot of
the United States the military
intelligence high-tech offshoot so that
was interesting and there are others
there are other important leaks but at
least I didn't see a lot in
lost my papers other than it was kind of
embarrassing and embarrassment for the
Palestinians and it should have been an
embarrassment for us to see the way
American leaders are talking to
