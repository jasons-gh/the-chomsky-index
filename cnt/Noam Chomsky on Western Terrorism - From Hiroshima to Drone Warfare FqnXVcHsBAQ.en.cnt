this is ongoing discussions for many
years with Andre we've had common
interests concerns and has of crossed
many times this gave us an opportunity
to provide a series of parallel
responses to a series of queries and
comments about matters of common
interest and a common commitment over
many years
his part is mostly direct involvement
he's very intrepid correspondent has
been all over has explored many of the
most difficult conflicts in the world
right at the peak moments of
confrontation and violence I've done a
little of that nowhere near to the
extent that he as my own research is
mostly a secondary using sources that
are available to write and comment about
it with occasional the direct
interactions with people's struggling
around the world
well we have recognized for many years
that the major sources of terrorism in
the world are the Western powers
primarily the the greatest of them the
United States and its immediate allies
and in our inquiries simply deepened
that recognition and we tried to provide
significant evidence for it from many
corners of the world and many domains of
research and inquiry
well there's
concern in the West and elsewhere about
the rise of terrorism and it and what we
can do to limit this scourge and that's
quite appropriate and there are some
simple answers so one way to sharply
reduce global terrorism is to stop
carrying it out that's the easiest way
and that would already have a big effect
we don't have to keep this abstract the
most extreme global terrorism campaign
now underway is President Obama's global
assassination campaign that's sheer
terror drone attacks terrorized
populations they murder suspects not
people shown to be guilty but suspects
others who may be unfortunate enough to
be nearby
they traumatize communities terrorized
tribal societies they also engender
terrorism which is well understood at
the highest sources you carry out a
drone attack on a village in southern
Yemen killing somebody you don't like
and maybe lots of others and you create
a desire for revenge and reaction that's
engendering terrorism probably faster
than they're killing people they don't
like that's one example hardly the only
one the if you take a look at major acts
of terror probably the the single
greatest terrorist act was the 9/11
destruction ask yourself who did it it
was mostly tribesman from Yemen who had
been subjected to bitter persecution and
were dedicated to revenge that's the way
you engender terrorism and carrying it
out consistently just expands it of
course that's only a small
part of it Western terror as a as I just
say out just under Ronald Reagan that
was extensive in Central America
Southern Africa
he was the last supporter of apartheid
and the atrocities of the apartheid
regime at home that abroad at least
these these are massive operations of
violence and aggression and often terror
and there's a very good reason for the
world to be deeply concerned about them
