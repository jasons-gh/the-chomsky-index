and it has a second effect when they
sell Israel advanced weaponry but the
rulers of the Gulf states say we want
some tube like a teaser importance story
they say look we want some agrees to
watching Martin immersed them can send
huge amounts of the second great
military equipment to Saudi Arabia they
can't do anything with itself is ruling
but it's a lot of money coming back to
them so that's great calling on an arms
embargo against Israel and Egypt for
that matter second largest recipient of
American aid mix Watterson's I think
those are realistic prospect we'll be
able to eat
with sanctions it's done properly some
properly it's there are other options
and this was very concerned about those
deals
that's one of the reasons were
apparently that they feel there's a
movement attempting to be legitimized
both something legit rising dampness t
legitimizing their criminal actions
how resistant is the is the u.s. to a
nuclear weapons-free zone that's a very
good question and it's right on their
national agenda the non-proliferation
treaty conference that was held of the
weeks ago but one of the main things
that came out of it was an international
call for a nuclear weapons-free zone at
least now if the US had any interest in
ending nuclear proliferation ama
believed where he was saying that he
would be calling for the clear weapons
free zones all over the world it's not a
complete solution to proliferation but
it's a pretty significant instead the US
and when the exact opposite that in this
case the administration's high court
because it couldn't come out openly and
say
so what they did was they said well yes
we agree with
their weapons free zone but it has to
wait until there's a comprehensive peace
treaty okay needs until the side of
those block the comprehensive peace
treaty exactly
five years so yes we're on camera with
this wonderful idea but it's gotta wait
until we get a comprehensive peace
treaty which we can continue to block
just a little button and the United
States further stated that is not accept
anything that interest rates Israeli
nuclear activities or the calls upon
major powers meaning the United States
to reveal what they know about the
Israeli nuclear so similar except any
treaty that forces us to do what we know
the Security Council what this dirty
asian security group CICS
they were iterated that again in fact
the world has been strongly calling for
a nuclear weapons-free zone region and
it's never recorded but it's worth
bearing in mind that the US and Britain
have a unique condition to that commit
the reasons that can't be reported for a
very straight when the US Britain
invaded Iraq they tried to construct the
kind of a thin legal cover for it and
the way they did it was by appealing to
a Security Council resolution from the
1991 resolution 687 if you want to look
at with that resolution in 1991 call on
Saddam Hussein toilet
mass destruction programs that was in
pretext with English recall where he
left the natural treatments that was a
pretty well exploded but that resolution
is interesting go to article 14 that
resolution and read it it commits the
signers to establishing a nuclear
weapons resembling the least okay that
means the US and Britain over all other
countries are formally committed now
they get waived because the media and
educated classes too quiet now that
doesn't lift what because they have
and therefore your efforts to evade it
and tolerated a quite apart from the
fact it was its did it would mitigate
p-perhaps eliminate that a possible
threat that Iran might both not much of
a threat essentially getting whatever it
is so that would eliminate that so you
know it's a very positive step of the
Orson blocking but remember that the
Obama administration is blocking every
other nuclear weapons-free zone at the
same time also don't get recorded that's
quite improved like Africa at just after
a light years of negotiation finally
reached agreement on a nuclear
weapons-free zone is only one hang out
the u.s. one
includes an island in the Indian Ocean
university there was a British territory
and at US borders the British expelled
the population and turned it into an
American military base what main
military bases as function it's the
military base that the u.s. uses to bomb
at least missin too late
so as a navy base and the u.s. stories
nuclear weapons there and that's going
up into the Obama administration effect
in December it's been nearly announced
that it's sending a submarine tender to
the University to accommodate the
nuclear submarines miss Wilson
he said sending to you ever see the were
called bunker busters the most lethal
weapon in the arsenal shirt nuclear
weapon
ran this is going to go up there the US
will not allow the African nucleus
resume to proceed question what's the
use of four nuclear weapons same things
happening in South Pacific South Pacific
countries that had also reached an
agreement on a nuclear weapons-free zone
first that was blocked by France because
France one of these its trench Island
positions for testing nuclear weapons
okay that's done carried out the tests
and so now the u.s. is blocking because
the u.s. comment positions possessions
are used for storing nuclear weapons for
the passage terms of summaries so that
but the most important one is the police
that's for the critical one was a major
issue there is a mr. proliferation
treaty conference that review conference
couple weeks ago ended up newest kind of
logical decision there but it ended up
with a call for a conference in 2012 to
consider this issue focus on this issue
and the US has want to be in a kind of a
bind because that's going to be the
world weapons free zone in the u.s.
having to drive sugar heavily debated
nuclear weapons-free zone but not only
include israel would include US forces
and US vs the Board deployed
did you bastard
through careful as since okay we won't
use with their weapons guess non-nuclear
weapons states with an exception anybody
else is in a way there Candy's nuclear
weapons even against the state
probably
so these dissipate your issues and if
anybody really cared
good question about BDS the video
strategy aside from the military and
security and telecommunication sectors
which are heavily subsidized by the
Defense Department at what other sectors
of the US economy are heavily invested
in israeli-occupied territories the
caterpillar caterpillar is somebody
mentioned a great record for Rachel
Corrie the skill that caterpillar huge
caterpillar
I mean the caterpillar is supplying the
wetlands returning the right there
there's an pitchers that's in violation
of international law and what got in
caterpillar misrata sins in fact
boycotting any American company is
involved in the occupied territories is
not only dropper but even legal just the
same is true we got in the products come
from West Bank and the second part to
that do you also support cultural and
academic boycotts and divestments so
like what cutting dance groups and
things like or academically actually the
frankly even the case yourself Africa in
the case of Israel I don't agree with
the first one principle but also just
tactically I'm asking if you want to
think is going to be serious that any
action with their men
maybe you first have to ask yourself am
i carrying this out because I want to
feel good or am i carrying it out
because they care about the victims and
that leads to different decisions so
maybe the weatherman felt that they felt
the breaking windows but that wasn't
helping Vietnamese Vietnamese didn't
like it in fact what the Vietnamese
wanted with peaceful demonstrations but
it sort of felt good windows and the
same is true of this if you forgetting
old questions the principle if you
inside the boycott Tel Aviv University
mit was guilty of far worse crimes
and then Apocrypha is so late that it
just turns into a giving a clinical
weapon in the hands of the most part
line elements they can say look you guys
are total hypocrites why are you
attacking Israel Darfur Jumblies talk
now that
this is all kind of course of interests
have to look at every one of them and
see exactly what its consequences are
and if you're serious about activism
suit seriously about tactics tactics are
important and you can't just follow them
because it makes us feel you have to
follow them because what I hope that it
goes that point and in some cases like
these I think it harms and I think their
examples they want example rated
changers a couple years ago there was a
Burberry MIT petition that is for good
purpose it was protesting the
desperation Janine but it was formulated
in a language allowed the hardline
elements to emphasize the Apocrypha
which was there for these reasons so
what happened is that Cambridge was then
consumed for a couple of months by the
crucial the important issue with
anti-semitism apartment Larry Summers
the president every speech but
anti-semitism quarter if it's one of I
talked about fourth of the months the
Palestinians have to think about what
you're doing the consequences are that's
quite apart from questions of principle
I think the BDS we
that seriously
at the Australian academic Clive
Hamilton has recently written a book
requiem for a species which i think i
saw you actually commanded a couple of
times tonight all this today you've
touched on environmental catastrophe
biblical end times these sorts of things
I mean yeah for a lot of people I think
we may be freezing up or we're looking
for a profit or well people are you know
wondering what the hell to do is there
actually a technical problem that we
need to solve or is it a social problem
I mean climate change to do the details
you can argue about boo but there's
hardly any serious down boot
anthropogenic climate changes taking
place Luke with a very serious of that
food that leads to social problems and
technical problems
technical problems for example most
far-reaching one is the find ways to use
solar energy root of one ultimate loser
resource not for energy on earth and
their ideas about who I'm not
technically competent to judge the group
two guys in engineering or 19 scientists
think it's feasible
Martin's about system puts to settle to
put the dishes in receptors and space
outside dear said sir
so they get solar energy without any
disruption
his microwave
earth possible
whatever it is and that's going to have
to be that or something like it's gonna
have to be parted solution on the other
hand there are social boot I mean in the
United States particularly worth
remembering that there have been a
massive social engineering projects in
the United States since the Second World
War to drive the economy towards
in efficient use of fossil fuels
exactly you know it's conspiracies in
fact some of them went to court refine
conspiracy the u.s. used to have three
efficient electric rail systems the
Israeli around New England with electric
rail Los Angeles is now a monstrosity
had a very efficient electric rail
system while all of these things were
destroyed by state corporate programs or
very conscious programs to try to drive
the economy towards massive wasteful use
of fossil fuels some of them were
actually at the court good progression
fine for conspiracy
other massive social engineering
projects that drove the population out
of the cities into the suburbs
inducements to go to the suburbs scoop
destroy the city experient typical
indian so previous in fact they do
from the point of view of anything it's
just crazy wouldn't come you can't live
them sober
Weston would have had to bars and family
like the nearest public transportation
of couple miles away
it comes there's also the racist issues
so for example where
the western suburbs and blessing it was
a proposal back in the seventies to
extend the subway system out of the
western suburbs which interestingly
would have saved people arrive in a
couple hours of community time every day
but people wealthy as a progressive
summer
but people living there preferred to
spend two hours fighting Boston traffic
that rather than facing the threat that
something like it in Dorchester might
walk around Lexington center so no
subway so their fight graphical you know
those are major social from their
olimpica boot and the Mississippi
bubbles you cannot have a society geared
to maximal waste of fossil fuels and
expected to survive in food so there's
both significant social problems
straight technological problem
going back I know this is a little while
ago but going back to this gentleman's
question right here about our currency
system it seems that our economy and our
currency is it has certain properties
that manifest certain behaviors and it
seems that our currency is designed in
such a way that with interest and with
it being lenten through through debt
that you know you can accrue wealth by
virtue of just having wealth and do you
think that there's any value as a sort
of strategy for dealing with that do you
think there's any value in working class
people and in citizens using alternative
local or sort of you know differently
valued currencies to directly exchange
and create value amongst themselves as
opposed to capitulating to an economy
that's not designed to serve their needs
in the first place which some people are
doing around the nation with various
degrees of success and failure we live
in a complex society
and how you get along without my
currency system roughly the kind we have
understand yes you could have a book
returns this is superb awesome its
budget take a trip to New York we can do
plus the fact that you could never
accumulate the reserves that allow you
to borrow enough money to finance a car
it's not good because they're not I
don't think that there is a lot of talk
about the currency system i think is
misguided there's a lot of things wrong
I'm sure what the Fed for example is
owned by banks the Fed does not meet its
legal requirements but that is by law is
supposed to be geared towards full
employment
they're geared towards the needs of
banks pretty much on too much inflation
so yes there are things wrong with the
currency system but replacing afraid
kind of local currencies of the kind
that the country had back in the 19th
century
since a few years back Venezuela has
made efforts to export the Bolivarian
revolution we export the Bolivarian
revolution said I think it was about
nine different countries including Cuba
Bolivia and other Caribbean South
American countries and they have they
proposed even to implement a new
currency the supra which what their
works or not is neither here nor there
but I'm wondering whether that aligns
could new your pinion do you thinking it
could culminate into you know a
significant enough power eventually to
the degree of moving beyond an oil-based
economy
maybe it's a good idea was about sharing
sense but can't imagine how do i present
that doesn't include the major economy
in South America the Dynamo settler it
includes a some really exploring
it's going for writers institutions that
would be independent from the US
but it can't even begin to the bridge
the scale
there are good things with different
career is getting most oriole to say
katie places like that that make sense
the porter exchange with Cuba makes
sense to the venezuelan each pursuing
their comparative advantage i think
condoms of like Cuba's providing train
personal documents teachers and someone
is there compared commended
people say I'm sort of cheer but it's
nothing that's just conventional
and this computer is not a position
free
I mean there are no it's good Latin
America is moving towards independence
solutions like Messer
organization of american states that was
just one that viewers for those lose our
own moves in the right direction unless
they include major Latin American
countries at least
policy and I'm just wondering if it
seems like like the Mafia principles
would always with me know any economic
policies that have fallen model does not
fall asleep is going to work whether
whether it's short term long term maybe
to my long term
there is a consultation mentioned a
couple of cases where it conflicts with
the atmosphere is the obvious principle
that the people on the country from
causes well I'm just saying so they can
flicks but it seemed like the mantra for
would always win out over that cases
we're pursuing the narrow parochial
interests of major sectors of the
economy without ever efforts criminal
but that would be short term if you like
in the long term the market of all get
without the gun control like you can
really say much these these things
depend on marginal factor is a decision
making
even individuals involved like for
example should use continuing policy of
punishing Cubans there have been moments
in recent American history where
especially on the Carter Administration
where moves were made towards improving
relations there are a lot of factors
some of the personal influence these
things that people make good you can
find principles that are operative and
they usually coincide with dark cases
with you
instrument and in a real international
relations theory that's what people say
but just completely fine
the principles determining this
two-dimensional close
there's a lot of talk everywhere except
in the u.s. press set up the apartheid
regime in the occupied territories I'm
wondering if you could speak a little
bit about the racist laws inside because
sergeant and what impact they might have
on a potential two-state solution given
demographic of shape is it i don't think
the demographic issues ever going to
arise let me put some illusion of
posting on some supporters of Palestine
Israel's policies and visit us back what
the convergence programs they don't
leave it
pro disra's taking over areas of
crackling around that the Arabs can be
off somewhere and so there won't be a
demographic problem the Palestinians the
people total one standard is pursuing
illusions the following pretty reasons
of policy which really prevent any
demographic problem I think we might be
even worse than that there is a proposal
what it was supposed I think they're
Lieberman both the right-wing
nationalist ministry to take the areas
in Israel of heavy our population
density
huge
and just for
Israel unfortunately the West Bank well
that when that was proposed is called a
neo-nazi of course the people there
strongly oppose study that they don't
want to move from a rich first world
country it do it a non-existent
character that may not be able to
survive but appears that there but so
what she is properly called a neo-nazi
program I house that's been taken over
by Kadima the centrist party
New York Times advocates if your
opponent's described it is a very
positive proposal which would satisfy
aditya the dull left because it's
University cinema and in fact if you
look at the history of it it goes back
to a highly respected us scholar who's
considering the volcanoes in Switzerland
for democratic socialism
that's routine state for advanced
studies
pratik social irritation and he supposed
that mean really celebes that he put it
brother polight that he said he said
kreative nation is a difficult process
and sometimes those who were marginal
for the nation many tourists Indians
have to be helped to move just out of
humanity so it's as the Palestinians are
a marginal termination in the compare
country that they have to help to move
ok that's the monastic policies I think
they're lieberman goes back to respected
American democratic socialists but that
might be done nothing resistance
so I don't think this conflict is going
to be his mother demographic problem
inside Israel and that's the high birth
religious sect that's the effect
you can say that that what about the
races was inside Israel was very
interesting topic the most extreme of
them is what's the land was there had
been land was inside Israel that should
there is Jesus ways place it up ninety
percent of the country in the hands of
an organization which is by law but its
contract with the state of israel is
required to act solely in the interests
of inputting people Jewish race religion
and argent that's the Jewish National
Fund that's a tax-free institutional in
the United States which means the
hedgewitch America is funding the
institution committed to act to the
interests of people to which various
religion and origin which the various
arrangements controlled ninety percent
country that's pretty serious nobody
talked about that
well actually that's there is a civil
libertarian movement and finally in year
two thousand its facts will acquiesce
it's nice for association
they managed to get the high court to
consider this and the high court
concluded that it's
books nine ten percent of the land from
erickson hundred citizens so they struck
it down it was in a particular case
that's your middle class arapaima is
trying to move him on the town rejected
the application
so the purchase that down six years
later they were fined allowed as far as
i know this the only case where it was
implied there other cases since then
were very devious things were advised to
keep compatible with the natural
community on people in America perfectly
familiar with their whole history when
I've been through I remember my wife and
I were pay the ransom cambridge anymore
trying to move into suburbs and we
looked around it's once every kind of
lights so we asked the real estate agent
that was written to proceed out there
looked at us and said you wouldn't raise
an illusion their various ways against
entirely
yeah that's going on that is respected
mr problems but these crumbs identity
I'm a bit of a to say about the weather
horrible history
but it's a real problem than the other
boss but there's a kind of internal
problem series
it's not a matter for
the question of apartheid raised in the
occupied territories and I don't think
it's the right term because what's going
on there is much worse than away so it's
a gift Israel Department
right
one contestants a bunch of people out
what's our booking is my appraiser
empirical let's plan in here is settler
condoms let's get rid of the indigenous
population it's error history we're the
crime separate royal society is number
one day so exterminating the indigenous
population most imperialism leaves the
images population there and press the
ruler
what that settler colonialism which is
the worst kind exterminate well Israel
can experiment center and get away with
it so just like the handset make the
situation so about to leave
I want to see a mostafa good thought
last week last one I went to see Mustafa
I would be taught last month and he gave
his position on why red drum Biden's
resistance is the way to go do you think
it is work actually what I was puck from
going to pass it was personal issues
into patient person and he's right I
things been right all along they should
the Palestinians made it serious have my
opinion
so I
accepting the arena of military comfort
just detective getting any ethical
principle it makes it absolutely no
sense to enter into the confrontation
where the enemy has all the power for
Israel military confrontations great in
our smashing strength of the
Palestinians ribbon
business and there's some and it was
limited enough so that is really
pressure nonviolent resistance can't
work unless it has some sport somewhere
aggressive society of the outside world
so what was done was pretty much brush
but if it got to enough scale to succeed
anything else in certain balance that's
interesting
yeah Toronto is going to be hosting
at the end of this month
also the g8 the week before and I
understand that this is going to be the
last time the g8 leads and so I'm
wondering what you think about actually
three parts to this so that's the first
question the second question is today
the g20 was created to undermine social
movements opposition how effective has
that been so what do you think and free
there's i think in movements but a lot
of debate about the value of you know
anti summit convergences there's been
within movements over the past decade
since like the height event of
globalization stuff on this continent
debates about the value of convergence
opposition so like focusing on summits
and these meetings as opportunities that
build social effects on walks
by the shift from g8 the g20 and
eventually prior shift from gene 13 338
analogy 8 to play and it's a reflection
to say increasing diversity of broad
power you just can't exclude any longer
countries like Brazil South Africa is
too important so and they're forming
their own organizations which are back
they don't prepare with the US but there
are doing things but this asian were
being that I mentioned that's
independent of the United States this is
not part of it they meet I mean they're
kind of not permitted into the Western
this works but they're they're a very
important one is that the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization says
china-based it includes Russia India in
his observateur that includes such
Central Asian states and potential its
Pakistan
radisson it blocks block the United
States is rejected it's already passed
resolutions opposing any US military
bases
it's based on China and Russia little
countries plenty resources and so on
doing it kind of quietly but it's a
growing power system which could become
a web neighbor but just based in
the world is just getting to rehearse so
it's going on as you pointed what about
protesting it or 0.4 kissing g20 I think
what can use the opportunity to educate
about what's called globalization the
globalization is so it's an ideological
promotion scripted Carmen the term
globalization just means their national
immigration but the strongest proponents
of globalization the people deep throat
social for me and then those are people
from all over
search people who are interested in
international information therefore any
globalization the reason is that the
terminology is appropriated by the
powerful work so for them globalization
means investor rights agreements that's
localization so globalization that it
works or less direct but didn't accept
them we should say yeah we have a bunch
of favorite globalization where I think
international integration great thing
which is really sweet I think the g20
their demonstrations can press that
message it means that attacking the
propaganda system
