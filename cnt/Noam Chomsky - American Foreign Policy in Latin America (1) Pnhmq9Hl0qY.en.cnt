welcome to a special edition of the
Minority Report on the global current
I'm Boyd Alonzo today I will be
interviewing professor Noam Chomsky on
American foreign policy in Latin America
Noam Chomsky is a professor of
linguistics
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology the New York Times calls him
arguably the most important intellectual
alive today he has revolutionized the
field of linguistics and is also known
throughout the world for his many books
on American foreign policy and
international affairs the latest being
hegemony or survival and failed States
professor Chomsky welcome to the global
current with you the first question I'd
like to ask you is what has been the
traditional historical relationship
between the United States and Latin
America beginning with the Monroe
Doctrine in 1823
well the Monroe Doctrine was more hope
for the future than a present reality at
the time it basically declared that this
hemisphere was to be dominated by the
United States I didn't say it in those
words but that was the import however
the Monroe Doctrine could not be
realized at that time because the United
States simply wasn't powerful enough so
if we go back to that 8th day the 1820s
when the Monroe Doctrine was enunciated
the first major foreign policy issue for
the United States was arising namely
Cuba the the government John Quincy
Adams Monroe and others the recce they
regarded Cuba as taking over Cuba they
regarded as essential to the sovereignty
and economic prosperity of the United
States however they recognized that they
couldn't do it because it was a
deterrent namely the British fleet which
was just too powerful
so John Quincy Adams who was the main
grand strategist pointed out that they
should just wait sooner or later Cuba
will
fall into our hands the way a ripe fruit
falls from the tree by what I call the
laws of political gravitation meaning
will get stronger Britain will get
weaker and we'll be able to pluck it at
which indeed happened in 1898 the United
States intervened here it's called to
liberate Cuba from Spain in fact it was
to prevent the liberation of Cuba from
Spain turned it into a virtual colony
and the same extended throughout the
hemisphere so Woodrow Wilson was able to
basically kick the British out of
Venezuela right through the 19th century
major American fortunes were being made
by extracting resources and their
economic relations with Latin America
and after the Second World War the
United States was in fact so powerful
that it could implement the Monroe
Doctrine and it became dominant in
hemisphere sort of edged out competitors
like Britain Germany and so on in the
last three decades new liberal trade
policies and institutions such as the
World Bank and International Monetary
Fund have come to dominate today's
economic system professor Chomsky what
has been the effect after the
implementation of these neoliberal
policies in Latin America it's been very
dramatic for Latin America it has been
the worst economic period in their
history if you compare the say the 25
years before the neoliberal policies
with 25 years that followed so you break
up the post-war period miss who has
there's a very sharp decline and just
about every macro economic and social
indicator during the neoliberal period
so sharp decline in the rate of growth
rate of productivity almost everything
and that's been characteristic around
the world during this neoliberal period
roughly mid 70s till today there has
in substantial sometimes spectacular
economic growth in the and what we call
the south know the third-world but it's
been in the countries that disregarded
the rules so East Asia did have very
sharp spectacular in fact economic
growth but they largely ignored the
neoliberal rules the regions that that
followed the rules of the what's called
the Washington Consensus the IMF in the
World Bank
when they followed them strictly it has
been almost invariably disastrous Latin
America is a case sub-saharan Africa's
another now you know anything as
complicated as this there gonna be some
rough edges and slight exceptions but
the generalization is very strong many
Americans are unaware of the many
American sponsored military cues that
have taken place in South and Central
America the most recent being the failed
coup attempt against venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez in 2002 professor
Chomsky why are so many Americans
unaware of American actions and policies
around the world especially regarding
our Latin American neighbors to the
south well that's a serious problem
about American intellectual culture and
in fact moral culture so for example
happens that right in front of me I have
a illustrate this I have a painting
given to me by a Jesuit priest about 15
years ago it's a depiction of an
artistic depiction of El Salvador in the
1980s not ancient history the figure
dominating the painting is the angel of
death on one side is a portrayal of
Archbishop Romero who was assassinated
well reading Mass in 1980 by state
terrorist forces linked to the United
States then over the rest of the
painting are the
portrayals of the six Latin American
intellectuals Jesuit priests who had
their brains blown out in 1989 by a u.s.
trained the US Armed they'll eat Italian
and their housekeeper and daughter who
also were murdered and that frames the
this decade of state terror and El
Salvador maybe seventy thousand people
slaughtered roughly the same as Bosley
and Bosnian Muslims every kind of terror
you can think of the torture and so on
well that's that paintings been there
for maybe fifteen years almost everybody
from south of the Rio Grande knows what
it is almost nobody from north of the
Rio Grande knows what it is that tells
you something about the level our
cultural level both intellectual and
moral because we're responsible for that
not just the killing of the
intellectuals of the priests but also
the usual victims peasants working
people human rights activists and so on
many experts say that the Bush
administration's preoccupation with the
war on terror and the war in Iraq has
made the administration take his eye off
the ball in Latin America and this in
turn is partially responsible for the
recent elections of leftist political
leaders in countries like Venezuela
Bolivia Ecuador and Nicaragua professor
Chomsky do you see Latin America's
turned to the left becoming a permanent
trend the turn to the left is quite
significant and the idea that it has to
do with the United States taking his
eyes off of Latin America is a bad joke
as the United States keeps its eyes
focused on Latin America it has been
almost a total tragedy neo-nazi National
Security States military cooze economic
disaster there's just a long record of
bloodshed and destruction that's why
there's a famous saying in Mexico that
poor Mexico it's so far from God and so
close to the United States that
that's true all through the continent it
you know again there's little variation
here and there but it's overwhelmingly
true the trend what they call it was
called the train to the left is a very
significant development
I mean Latin America has been has had
been sort of disintegrated in two
respects since the Spanish colonization
if 500 years ago the countries have been
separated from one another so there each
of them this kind of link has been
linked to you know some European power
or the United States but not to each
other
furthermore internally there is
aggregated there's a small elite mostly
white which is extremely wealthy and
there's a huge mass of very impoverished
people largely black Indian so and so on
it's a very striking at some of the
worst inequality of the world
