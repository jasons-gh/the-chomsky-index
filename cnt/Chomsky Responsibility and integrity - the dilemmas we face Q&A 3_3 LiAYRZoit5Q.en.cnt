preparation in the United States your
task is to maximize short-term profit
and market share period if you don't do
that you're out and somebody else is in
in fact in angle of American law it's a
legal requirement but quite apart from
that you just have to do it or you're
just not in that position anymore it's a
crime of the position not of the
individual that means you've got to
ignore extra nality in this case the
externality is the fate of the species
it means you have to try to convince
people you have to run big propaganda
campaigns to convince people that global
warming is a liberal hoax and so on
which is exactly what's being done it's
quite effective and I don't know what it
is here but in the United States maybe
about a third of the population thinks
it's a serious problem at this point and
you take a look at the new Republican
Congress just about every one who came
in as a climate denier it's all a
liberal hoax we don't do anything
they're already cutting down funding not
only for us programs but even for the
you know international scientists
organization been defunded they don't do
anything about it because the fate of
the species is an externality and if
you're working in a market system you
know you don't pay attention to it well
in this case there's no taxpayer to bail
you out at once you destroy the
possibilities of decent human survival
kiss each other goodbye and that's where
we are right now this is not an abstract
consideration it's happening right
before our eyes you know right before
those are serious problems and it is to
make sense to ask is that person good or
bad there's an institutional structure
which is lethal harmful in the case of
say financial institutions but not
Lethal lethal and in this case and
that's not the only one
can there be a society without organized
violence for instance war Civil War
dictatorship what do you think the ideal
world would look like well that was
actually a question raised by two great
20th century figures Bertrand Russell
and the Alfred Einstein Albert Einstein
in they came out in nineteen fifty-five
with a memorandum kind of a statement to
the people of the world declaration of
the people of the world it was about
nuclear war that's another case like
global warming it's it could be and
probably will be the destruction of the
species that their declaration asks
exact old forget the exact words but it
was exactly this they said to the people
of the world you're facing a choice that
is stark and unavoidable either mankind
will abandon war or the species is
finished that's their their conclusion
and I think it's plausible it just can't
be any more major Wars and it takes a
Europe Europe for centuries was the most
savage brutal place in the world the
European spent most of their time and
creative energy and activity and
figuring out ways to slaughter each
other that went on for centuries the
Europe in fact created a technology and
a culture of savagery and barbarism
which so extreme that they could conquer
the rest of the world I mean if you look
at the conflicts between Europe and you
know India Mexico and so on Europe
always conquered the enemy but by
savagery in fact you look at read
military historians what they say is
that for most of the world the war was a
kind of a sport for Europe who was a
science
and they want you know so small groups
of Europeans could Massacre huge numbers
of what the called barbarians people who
didn't think that war was a science well
that's the core part of European history
up to nineteen forty-five not since that
did genes change no no change in the
genes what happened is that Europeans
finally realized that the next time they
play their favorite game of slaughtering
each other it's all going to be over you
can't do it anymore the level of
savagery and violence has reached the
point where we just can't make users so
something has to be done to cut it back
so yeah that's an answer is it's not
necessary in human nature I mean unless
these forces are constrained they'll
blow up but they can be constrained so
the chances of a major war inside Europe
are very slight which is a huge change
from centuries of history mr. Chomsky
says that we should address the right
audience but he also says that people in
power try to make dissidents be ignored
in the least in the light of this what
will be the most practical or efficient
way to go about addressing the audience
and trying to be heard by them that
depends where you are if you're if you
were saying El Salvador there wasn't
really an answer to that because you're
you're going to get your brains blown
out which is what happened if you're in
say Turkey which is a moderately
repressive society you know pretty free
but not entirely probably what they're
doing is the best way that constant
protest civil disobedience and so on I
know I've been in Turkey number of times
over the past
10 years and have actually participated
in some of these civil disobedience
actions I was there a couple months ago
and I'm a major conference on freedom of
speech and the participants are mostly
Turkish were journalists artists
academics and others describing the
activities that they're involved in
which are very courageous a lot of them
are working on Armenian rights and
trying to bring about the recognition of
the Armenian Genocide and the repression
of Armenian since most of them are
working on Kurdish rights that's the big
issue and extremely brutal in the 1990s
it's improving some sense but still
going on well you know that's the best
method for them facing real problems the
best method for people like us is much
easier we have very limited constraints
I mean enough freedom has been won in
societies like ours so that it's not
perfect and you're not going to get
lauded but there's a wide range of
opportunity to do all kinds of things
and without suffering the kinds of
severe penalties that only Saints are
willing to endure
is it possible to be well-intentioned
while committing atrocities if so should
these good intentions change our
assessment of these atrocities I think
it's not only possible to be
well-intentioned at least by self
perception while committing atrocities
but it's all almost universal you just
take a look at the record of major
criminals you know I mean talking about
people like Hitler and Stalin the rest
of them not just sort of garden-variety
atrocities but I mean world-shaking ones
you take a look at the record it's being
done with the utmost ability I mean
Hitler invaded Poland to protect Germany
from what he called the wild terror of
the poles the Germans had no choice the
poles were terrorizing they had to
defend themselves slaughtering the Jews
was saving the purity of the of
civilization Hitler didn't talk about it
much but people like Martin Heidegger
did I remember you know I was kind of
surprised when in recent years it was
kind of discussion of discovery that
heidegger had been in Nazi and I started
reading him in the 1950s you read take a
look at introduction to metaphysics you
know you get in 20 pages he's talking
about how it's the role it's the task of
Germany to save civilization which comes
from the Greeks to the teutons Germans
are the inheritors and they have to
protect it from the barbarians of the
east and west and corrupt elements have
to be eliminated and so on so we can
what can be more noble than preserving
the civilization a handed to us to the
Greeks ok that's the Nazis
you read the Russian art a lot of
Russian archives have come out in the
light unit in the last since 1990 and
they're pretty interesting reading I
mean you take a look at the internal
discussions you know Gromyko to talk
Molotov and all this business talking to
each other not trying to impress anyone
they're talking about the need to defend
democracy people's democracies from
Western fascists that's why you had to
control prove anything from happening in
Eastern Europe again perfectly Noble and
in fact it's it's very rare to find
anyone who says I'm carrying out
terrible crimes because I want to you
know maybe there are people like that
but I think almost always you find a way
to justify it and I suspect if you look
at your own experiences you'll find
plenty of things like that like maybe
when you were six years old and your
mother wasn't looking and took a toy
from your younger brothers nothing and
he went and ran and complained the your
mother and she came to see what's going
on and you said I didn't do anything he
gave it to him he didn't what was mine
anyway until it's over you find a way to
justify what you're doing and you
believe it you really believe it
convince yourself of it and I think
that's probably true quite generally I
think not nice maybe but I think it's
probably true I'm going to commit a well
justified abominable atrocity and we've
conclude this discussion
I would like to thank you know'm Chomsky
for coming here for giving your lecture
for telling us about your intellectual
life for giving as an example of how an
academic our an intellectual could act
in this strange but nevertheless very
beautiful society let me remind you of
one fact before i close now me go to gov
coffee the building we are in is an
Armenian Church not an Armenian but an
Armenian Church which means it is the
church for the poor a branch of Dutch
Reformed people who are tolerant in
every way and I think that's very
appropriate place to have you at your
speech here I wish you were very good
stay here in Italy and hope to meet you
soon
you
