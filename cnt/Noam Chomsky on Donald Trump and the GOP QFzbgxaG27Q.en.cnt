but what do you think about the antics
of Donald Trump and hasn't your earlier
idea about American exceptionalism well
action I think we should recognize that
the other candidates are not that
different I mean if you take a look at
and just take a look at their views
they've tell you their views and their
astonishing so just to keep their rent a
couple of weeks ago the two frontrunners
they're not the frontrunners any longer
we're Jeb Bush and Scott Walker and they
differed on Iran Walker said we have to
bomb Iran when he gets elected they're
going to bomb Iran immediately the day
he's elected Bush was little you know
he's more serious he said it's going to
wait to the first cabinet meeting and
then they'll bomb Iran I mean this is
just off the spectrum of not only
international opinion but even relative
sanity this is I think orange town and
man are correct it's a radical
insurgency it's not a political party
you can tell that even by the votes I
mean any issue of any complexity is
going to have some diversity of opinion
but when you get a unanimous vote to
kill the Iranian deal or the Affordable
Care Act or whatever the next thing may
be you know you're not dealing with a
political party it's an interesting
question why that's true
I think what's actually happened is that
during the whole so-called neoliberal
period last generation both political
parties have drifted to the right
today's Democrats are what used to be
called moderate Republicans the
Republicans have just drifted off the
spectrum there so
committed to extreme wealth and power
that they cannot get votes can't get
votes by presenting those positions so
what has happened is that they've
mobilized sectors of the population that
have been around for a long time it is a
pretty exceptional country in many ways
one is its extremely religious it's one
of the most extreme fundamentalist
countries in the world and by now I
suspect the majority of the base of the
Republican Party is evangelical
Christians extremists not they're a
mixture but these are the extremist ones
nativists who are afraid that you know
they are taking our white anglo-saxon
country away from us people who have to
have guns when they go into Starbucks
because who knows they might be killed
by an Islamic terrorist and so on I mean
all of that is part of the country and
it goes back to colonial days their real
roots to it but these have not been an
organized political force in the past
they are now that's the base of the
Republican Party and you see it in the
primary so yeah Trump is maybe comic
relief but it's just a it's it's not
that different from the mainstream which
i think is more important
