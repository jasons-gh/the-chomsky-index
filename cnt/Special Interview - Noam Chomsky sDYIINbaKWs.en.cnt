Noam Chomsky who might be the most
important linguist in the world and one
of the most influential intellectuals
over the last decades wall comes tells
her in his small office at tuckson
University where he just moved in his
reflections are heard carefully by the
international political community today
he speaks about humanitarian
interventions the challenges we must
face as a globalized society and the
role of the newest American president
Donald Trump from the point of view of
us power he's harming it but from the
point of view of u.s. elites he's given
him everything they want I mean in fact
what's going on in the United States if
you think about it is kind of a
two-level wrecking ball if you want to
call it that
Trump his role whether this is conscious
or not I don't know so you can see what
what's happening trump's role is to
ensure that the media and public
attention are always concentrated on him
so every time you turn on a television
to trump they open the front page of the
newspaper
Trump and in order to maintain he's a
con man basically a showman and in order
to maintain public attention you have to
do something crazy otherwise nobody's
going to pay attention to you if you do
normal things you'll be you know way
back somewhere so every day there's one
insane thing after another and then you
know the media makes them crazy why the
biggest crowd in history
but meanwhile he's on to something else
and then you go to that one and while
this show is going on in public the what
in the background the wrecking crew is
working Paul Ryan executive orders and
what they're doing is system matters my
morning
government that works for the benefit of
the population this goes from workers
rights to pollution and pollution
pollution of the environment the rules
for protecting consumers I mean anything
you can think of is being dismantled and
all efforts are being devoted kind of
almost with fanaticism to enrich and
empower their actual constituency which
is super wealth and corporate power who
are delighted that's why the stock
market goes up stock market us and not
much to do with the economy but keep
coming because that's the rich people
and they love being granted now the
worst policies that he's carried out the
most dangerous are barely discussed
those are the two existential threats
that we face have to face the fact that
humans are now in a situation which has
never written in human history this
generation has to decide whether
organized human existence is going to
continue and it's not a joke it's global
warming and nuclear war those are the
major issues they ought to be big
headlines every day and Trump's actions
are making both of them much more
dangerous in the case of nuclear war the
policies are significantly increasing
the threat of nuclear war in a case of
global warming it's almost indescribable
but not only has the u.s. pulled out
uniquely alone in the world
it's pulled out from the international
efforts do at least something about it
but beyond that it's the Trump
administration is going out of its way
to increase the threat look listen to
his State of the Union address the only
phrase about global climate was to talk
about our beautiful clean coal the worst
polluter there is which we have we have
a thousand years of it you know and look
at the new budget that's coming on
sharply cuts research and support for
any kind of renewable energy more
subsidies and support for the most
polluting destructive things and it's
not just Trump it's the entire
Republican leadership so if you look at
the 2016 election at the primaries every
single candidate not a single exception
either denied the global warming is
taking place or said maybe it is we
shouldn't do anything about it which I
think it's worse they were called the
moderates like Kasich so then and if you
look at Trump himself or say Rex
Tillerson Secretary of State and they
know perfectly well that humans are
causing global warming in fact that
Trump has golf courses all over them
he's he hasn't built a wall in Mexico
yet he's building walls around his golf
courses to make sure that the sea level
doesn't destroy them that Rex Tillerson
was CEO of Exxon Mobil since the 1970s
scientists at Exxon Mobil have been we
now know they've been made public forced
to be making public they've been
producing severe ones the leadership
about the effect of the use of petroleum
on destroying the environment so they
won't know about it but they're not
doing anything about it which is a level
of criminality that is almost hard to
find words to describe I'm here
you know educated we'll all rich people
a very lead who know that what they're
doing is destroying the prospects for a
human resident organized human life and
do it anyway because they make more
profit tomorrow can you think of an
analogue to that in human history I
really can't I mean I've said sometimes
what's considered an overly outrageous
comment that the today's Republican
Party is the most dangerous organisation
in human history sounds outrageous but
think about it for a moment
I mean Hitler didn't intend to destroy
the prospects for human existence the
Atilla the Hun didn't intend that nobody
finish but that's what these guys intend
and it's not ignorant uneducated you
know religious fundamentalists whatever
you want to blame people these are the
most educated best supported people in
the world and they're doing this eyes
opened coaching make more profit
tomorrow it's hard to imagine anything
like that's it's not just my opinion who
takes a the bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists a clock famous Doomsday Clock
that's set up by The Bulletin of Atomic
Scientists since 1947 the each year they
gather distinguished physicists
political analysts others to look at the
state of the world and make a judgment
of how far we are from terminal disaster
midnight is terminal disaster in 1947
the clock was at 7 minutes to midnight
after the outer mom moved up and back
since now it's at the closest it's been
the mid night ever as they just moved it
to two minutes to midnight that's where
it was in 1953 when the US and later the
USSR exploded thermonuclear weapons
which were
would totally destroy the world went to
two minutes now it's back to two minutes
and that's the Republican Party that's
the ones who were running the country
and dominating the world there's never
been a situation like this does not have
the economic power that it once did
echo us control of the world actually
peaked in 1945 it's been declining ever
since there's a lot of talk about
America's decline but quite misleading
the peak was 1945 the US had power that
had absolutely no counterpart in all
history the u.s. probably had close to
half the world's wealth and an
incredible security controlled the
Western Hemisphere controlled both
others oceans controlled the opposite
size of both oceans just about
everything but it started to collapse
pretty quickly in 1949 China became
independent which is described in an
interesting way like I can lose my
computer but I can't lose your computer
right but the loss of China implies the
tacit understanding we own the world and
if something gets out of control we lost
it and that was not a small thing became
a huge issue in American life who was
responsible for the loss of China then
you get McCarthyism the repression the
destruction of Union the enormous thing
it goes on and on Kennedy when he was
trying to decide whether to escalate in
Vietnam and told his advisors I don't
worry responsible for the loss of
Indochina you know and right up to the
president you know and that that's that
was a serious decline it changed
American policy and since then Europe
reconstructed the industrial societies
reconstructed they had been devastated
by the war you know decolonization took
place the world just became more diverse
by about 1970 the u.s. owner of control
of the world economy was down to maybe
twenty five percent
which is enormous but not 50% and the
world was economically what was called
tri-polar there was a German based
Europe a us-based North America at that
time Japan based East Asia which was
most rapidly developing region now China
based and it's continued since I'm in
the US by now has maybe 20% of the world
economy and but by far in military terms
just nobody nearby you know u.s. spends
practically as much as the rest of the
world combined
technologically way more advanced and so
on but in economic terms it's somewhat
declines however that's very misleading
because these investigations by
political scientists diplomats and so on
talk about national power but in the
modern world especially since the 90s
since neoliberal globalization took
place that's not really a measure of
control the real measure of control is
which corporations own things and it
turns out if you do a study that
us-based multinationals owned about half
the world which is enormous there are
very closely integrated with the state
state supports them they pretty much run
the state and they have about 50 and
frankly every sector manufacturing
retail commerce finance US corporations
are first that's the real and that's
combined with national power so you
really have to rethink what it what
power means means lots of things in a
diverse world but the u.s. you know
still remains supreme by far you don't
know what that means
protection of the nation from foreign
terrorists entry to the big stuff first
the boy I think one should be cautious
about talking about the CIA CIA does not
act on its own
the CIA is an agency of the executive
branch and they there's almost no
exception to this they just do what
they're told they're one of their jobs
is to allow kind of denial
I like the executive can say I didn't
know this was happening so it says you
can blame thing if something goes wrong
or the summit rustiness
and say the CIA's responsible executive
branch which is giving the orders as the
possibility of denials you know so when
we talk about the CIA we're really
talking about the executive support
automation
and yes they behave differently so for
example Latin America during the last 20
years it's pretty much throwing them out
the last one you may remember with in
Ecuador the monta and Correa Rafael
Correa told the United States that they
could keep the base if he could put one
at Miami which is an indication of the
shift in relations u.s. powers
extensive undoubtedly but it's not what
it once we the IMF basically an agency
of the Treasury Department has been
pretty much thrown out of lot America so
there is a there are prospect well the
concept of humanitarian intervention is
a very interesting one
almost every act by any great power is
aggressive act is justified on
humanitarian grounds so from the point
of view of the aggressor the
humanitarian intervention not from the
point of view of the victims and it's
extremely if we had records from
my killer the hon we might find the same
thing that what is counted the one the
one one that's counted is the bombing of
Serbia in 1999 Kosovo bombing so let's
take a look at that it was a kind of an
ugly place not a pleasant place but we
know in detail what was going on
guerrilla forces albanian forces based
in albania were entering serbia carrying
out terrorist attacks in order to elicit
harsh serbian response which could be
used as a justification for nato in
meaning US intervention and they said
the casualties are kind of separated on
both sides they estimated about 2000
when the invasion was undertaken the
Wesley Clark the general in charge he
informed Washington that the result of
the u.s. attack would be to sharply
escalate atrocities because when you
Serbia was not going to be able to
respond by bombing the United States so
they'd respond on the ground as the
invasion began he informed the press
which wouldn't report it that the
predictable his word effect of the
bombing would be to sharply
escalate Serbian atrocities which is
what happened u.s. started bombing
Serbia Serbia started driving out
Albanians from Kosovo carrying out
atrocities a huge reporting and
denunciation of Serbian atrocities
Milosevic was brought to the criminal
court with an indictment for his massive
crimes all with one minor exception were
after the bombing if you look back at
the discussion the way it's framed is it
was a humanitarian intervention because
we had to stop Serbian atrocities and
that's the way it's presented in the
West you have to keep quiet about the
fact
with the Serbian atrocities were the
consequence the predicted and expected
consequence of the invasion and whenever
that's so for example as a major report
like distinguished international lawyers
headed by judge Goldstone a
distinguished South African boy who
studied the invasion concluded its
phrase was illegal but legitimate
illegal because an obvious violation of
international law but legitimate because
he had to stop these horrible atrocities
which followed the invasion so they
simply inverted the chronology which is
what is usually done occasionally it's
recognized that yeah was afterwards but
they said it doesn't matter because you
had to stop it before they happen so we
invaded in order to prevent atrocities
which were caused by the invasion so
that's the major humanitarian
intervention and shortly after the
invasion the issue of humanitarian
intervention was placed on the
international agenda because there have
been this marvelous example of it and
and there are two different conclusions
drawn one was by the United Nations
United Nations General Assembly had a
strong resolution about what's called a
responsibility to protect it basically
reiterates international law it says
explicitly that no military act can be
taken unless authorized by the Security
Council
anything else is illegal and
unacceptable
and it goes on to urge that pressures be
used to ensure that governments don't
repress their own population so use
whatever the cannot other pressures you
can do that that's the formal
responsibility to protect there's
another one a commission was set up
edited by
Gareth Evans the former Australian Prime
Minister's the Evans Commission and that
gives a long discussion of
responsibility to protect it's about the
same as the UN version with one
difference it has a paragraph saying in
case the Security Council doesn't agree
to authorize intervention regional
groupings can intervene on their own by
force subject to subsequent approval by
the Security Council well which regional
grouping is capable of intervening
there's one it's called NATO so what
this was saying is even though Security
Council doesn't authorize it NATO is
justified in intervening and when you
look at the discussion of this always
they say a responsible intervention
responsibility to protect is legal
because the University the UN Assembly
authorized it but then the version
that's adopted is the Evans version it's
a beautiful example of the way
propaganda operates in a
well-functioning powerful system you
take a look at the scholarly literature
media coverage everything else so the
bombing of Libya was humanitarian
intervention actually it was invited it
was there was all kind of stories about
Qaddafi's doing this and that he's not a
nice guy doing ugly things but that had
nothing to do with it there was a
resolution UN resolution which called
for establishing a no-fly zone and
moving towards diplomatic moves to
settle the problem Qadhafi accepted it
the resolution was initiated by Britain
France and the United States who
instantly violated instantly becoming
the air force of the opposition and went
on to a big bombing attack finally end
up murdering Qadhafi ended up killing
probably 10,000 or more people much more
than anything that has happened
before left Libya total wreck as it is
today with in the hands of warring
militias there was a huge flow of
jihadis and arms into the Levant you
know West Asia but also mainly into West
Africa which has now become the major
source of radical terrorism in the world
largely a consequence of the so-called
humanitarian intervention of Libya and
you look at case after case and that's
what they're like occasionally you can
find an example that maybe you could
argue is humanitarian intervention but
those are but those are not permitted
because the u.s. bitterly opposed them
fought against them and it's the wrong
people anyway even the wrong color no so
that's a humanitarian intervention this
in the case of Afghanistan Afghanistan
and Iraq are different in the case of
Afghanistan I suspect it was just
revenge
it's just probably pretty much like what
Abdul Haq said they want to show their
muscle you know somebody attacked us
we're gonna show the world that we can
attack somebody even more harshly and so
it's like when Trump says to Korea you
know we've got a bigger button than you
do that kind of thing so we'll show it
to you and because there was really no
strategic or other purpose behind it
Iraq was quite different Iraq is the
country they wanted to invade but it has
huge resources right in the midst of the
major oil-producing region and the in
the world as a major strategic goal is
to gain control of Iraq be able to
exploit its oil set of military bases
there which was in fact by the end by
the end of the Bush years 2007 it was
conceded publicly to have been the
primary goal but so that you can
understand on traditional imperial
grounds but I suspect Afghanistan really
was pretty much
whatever locks in
