good evening when I welcome you all to
tonight's forum on Iran and American
foreign policy with our distinguished
speakers Flynt Leverett hillary man
Leverett and Noam Chomsky my name is
Thea Keith Lucas I am the coordinator of
the technology and culture forum here at
MIT and I hope you will check out some
of our other events I'm very pleased to
be part of this event because it really
goes to the heart of the technology and
culture forum strengths in our history
the forum began in the 1950s when the
Episcopal chaplain at the time Myron
Blois created a space for faculty
members who were concerned about nuclear
technology which many of them had had a
part in developing and we're concerned
about how that technology was being used
and how the world was teetering on the
brink of war so since the 1950s the
Episcopal Church and MIT have had this
partnership to create a space where
different views can come together to
discuss moral issues we work together as
we share a dream of a better world and
we're willing to look for new and
unexpected ways to make that dream a
reality I'd like to introduce to you our
moderator for tonight's discussion
Fetzer Ali Bono Azizi
is professor of political science at
Boston College and director of the
program in Islamic civilization and
societies after receiving his PhD from
Yale University in 1968 he taught at
Yale and the University of Southern
California before joining the Boston
College faculty since then he's held
visiting a point
at the University of Tehran Princeton
Harvard and Oxford University and MIT he
served as founding editor of the Journal
of Iranian studies from 1968 to 1982 and
he is a past president of the
International Society for Iranian
studies and the Middle East Studies
Association professor Bono is easy it's
the author of numerous articles on
society culture and politics in Iran and
the Middle East as well as the co-author
of social classes the state and
revolution in Iran as an affiliate at
the Center for International Studies
here at MIT he is a frequent contributor
to discussions of Middle East policy and
history here on campus and we are so
grateful for his leadership tonight
professor Bono is easy
thank you very much here for your very
kind introduction I'm delighted to have
been assigned this role and indeed
honored we have a wonderfully timely
programme tonight and a very
distinguished panel for informing us and
enlightening us before introducing
members of the panel I would like to
perhaps say a few words to put tonight's
discussion in some sort of historical
context the relationship between the
United States and Iran which is the
topic of our panel is indeed a
long-standing a very complex relation
over the past two centuries since the
two nations have had dealings with one
another we have seen in this
relationship practically every aspect of
international affairs problems
contestations
near Wars that have been part and parcel
of this relationship it began in the
beginning of the 19th century in 1829 or
so when American missionaries
Presbyterian missionaries for the first
time went to Iran
they established hospitals schools quite
a number of schools that lasted
throughout the 19th century and into the
20th century when we come
to the beginnings of the 20th century
there was as many of you know a major
revolution a constitutional revolution
that ultimately gave the Constitution
and constitutional form of government to
Iran in the first decade of the 20th
century and in that struggle for the
Constitution for democracy if you will
an American teacher a missionary and a
teacher a young man in his mid-20s
Howard Baskerville actually fought on
the side of the revolutionaries
constitutional revolutionaries and gave
his life he is considered by Iranians to
be a martyr of that revolution and his
gravesite is a very revered place even
today in the city of Tabriz after the
Constitution became triumphant then we
have a very major man of enormous
goodwill Morgan Schuster who served as
advisor to the Parliament of Iran in
effect he became the Secretary of
Treasury of the country and for a short
time or within a short period of time he
was able to put the finances of the
country in good working order he was
forced to withdraw to resign by
pressures that came from the Russians
and the British who were the two major
imperial powers at the time competing
with another the relationship continued
for the next several decades and in the
minds of Iranians the United States was
always the distant non colonial non
imperialist power an innocent power if
you will until we come to the Second
World War
when the country was actually occupied
by the Allies and during the war the
United States Great Britain and Russia
held a major conference and Iran was
viewed as the bridge of victory to take
supplies from the southern shores from
the Persian Gulf area to the Russians
around the the axis power blockades
after the war the relationship between
Iran and the United States continued on
a relatively normal basis the u.s. sent
various missions to help your own
economically and some military missions
one important episode which many people
forget is that at the end of the war in
1946 45 46 the Russians or the Soviets
at the time refused to honor their
pledge to leave the country and it was
the United States at that time President
Truman who pressed the Soviets to make
good on their promise and to leave he
took the matter to the United Nations
and by most historical accounts this was
the first salvo of the cold war between
the United States and Soviet Union and
the Soviets ultimately withdrew their
intention had been to set up a Socialist
Republic in the northern part of Iran
then we have a major bitter episode in
1953 that most people are cognizant of
and that was the CIA a British
intelligence sponsored who they thought
that occurred in 1953 that brought down
the popular government of Mohammad
Mosaddegh the nationalist figure who had
just nationalized the Iranian oil
industry
for the next 25 years or so the United
States and Iran enjoyed a very special a
very close relationship that those were
the years of the last Pandava monarch
the Shah of Iran and it was during that
period that the USS image began to
change
well it had already changed because of
the intervention that the u.s. had made
back in 1953 and many people in Iran
particularly the Nationalists the
pro-democracy forces blamed the u.s. for
its support of the Shah then the
revolution of course now the u.s. came
to actually live with the Iranian
Revolution it began to seek ways of
reestablishing relations but the hostage
crisis prevented all of that and then
for as you know for 440 days the image
of Iran in the u.s. among the American
public was as negative an image as one
can imagine and the rest of course is
well known to most of you and the
subject of the panel tonight an
exploration of us-iran relations during
the Islamic republican rule in the
country starting with the Revolution of
1979 to the present I won't get into
that at all let me then try to give you
an idea about how the panel is going to
to present the ideas this evening we
will have three distinguished speakers
they will each speak for about 15
minutes or so that should leave us with
about an hour of I hope what would be a
very lively and vigorous Q&A and debate
if you will and we will stop at 9
o'clock and now let me say a few words
about our distinguished speakers
the first speaker will be Hillary man
Leverett MS Leverett received her law
degree from Harvard University and her
BA from Brandeis she also studied at the
American University in Cairo and at Tel
Aviv University she served in American
embassies across the Middle East at the
US mission at the United Nations on the
State Department's policy planning staff
and as director for Iran Afghanistan the
Persian Gulf affairs at the National
Security Council in that last capacity
she was one of a very small number of US
diplomats authorized to negotiate with
Iranian officials over Afghanistan and
al-qaeda during the 2001 2003 period
most other American officials were
barred from having any contact
whatsoever with their Iranian
counterparts since leaving government
miss Leverett has taught at Yale and is
currently a senior professional lecturer
at the American University's School of
International Service and a visiting
scholar at Peking University's School of
International Studies she will be
followed by Professor Flynt Leverett who
served as a CI a senior analyst on and
then on the State Department's policy
planning staff and as a National
Security Council senior director for
Middle Eastern affairs he left the
George W Bush White House and government
service altogether in 2003 because of
disagreements about the Middle East
policy and the conduct of the war war of
terror or war on terror I should say
since then
professor Leavitt has been a visiting
professor at MIT at Yale and is
currently professor of international
affairs and law at Penn State and a
visiting scholar at the Peking
University's School of International
Studies the levels have individually and
jointly published extensively on
international relations politics
political economy of the Middle East and
the Persian Gulf and of course on US
policy towards these critical regions
their articles have appeared in both
academic mainstream turn and mainstream
journals and various other alternative
media outlets they have been featured in
documentaries on Iran by PBS BBC and
they have appeared on public affairs
programs not only in the United States
but across the world our third speaker
is Professor Noam Chomsky it would be
presumptuous for me or anyone for that
matter to attempt to introduce professor
Chomsky I am deeply aware of that and
very humbled by the task well let me
simply say a few words professor Chomsky
received his here I go
he is PhD in linguistics from the
University of Pennsylvania and he joins
the MIT faculty back in 1955 in 1976 he
was appointed the Institute professor in
the Department of linguistics and
philosophy professor Chomsky I was going
to say footprints but that's not the
right word his impact has been felt in a
number of different fields in all of
them he is regarded as one of the most
distinguished scholar
of the 20th century and now into the
21st century those fields as I think
everyone knows and deeply appreciates
include linguistics philosophy
intellectual history contemporary issues
International Affairs and needless to
say US foreign policy over the past five
decades professor Chomsky has offered
critical indictments of u.s. foreign
policy and military interventions I
might say that as and as an observer as
a witness to Professor Chomsky's career
over the past several decades I have
personally been inspired by his work in
the civil rights movement in the
anti-war movement in the 1960s in the
opposition to the show the dissidents of
which I myself was a member at the time
and in many many other contexts it's an
honor for me to introduce professor
Chomsky and the leverets Flynt and
Hillary this evening and I will now ask
Hilary Leverett to kick off our panel
discussion for tonight thank you
good evening I just want to make sure
everyone can hear me good evening before
beginning tonight I want to offer some
thanks thanks to to Reverend the Keith
Lucas of the technology and culture
forum here at MIT and to her colleagues
for organizing this event for us Flint
and I are are literally thrilled to take
part here tonight we also want to offer
special thanks to our moderator and of
course to Professor Noam Chomsky we are
grateful to Professor Chomsky not just
for appearing with us today though we do
thank him for that we are deeply
grateful for it to him for prodding us
for prodding us every step of the way
through our intellectual journey in his
famous essay the responsibilities of
intellectuals published 46 years ago
professor Chomsky pointed out when we
consider the responsibilities of
intellectuals our basic concern must be
their role in the creation and analysis
of ideology
since then professor Chomsky has been
both fearless and it would seem tireless
in rigorously scrutinizing the claims of
intellectuals who in the service of
power ascribe Universal validity to what
are in fact very particular interests
above all he has been unrelenting in his
critique of what he sees as the
fundamental political axiom of u.s.
foreign policy namely that the United
States has the right to extend its power
and control without limit insofar as it
is feasible it is in this critical
spirit that Flint and I come here
tonight now most of the liberal
establishment I would wager would take
issue with the basic premise
of this evenings event that the United
States has gone wrong in its policy
toward the Islamic Republic of Iran for
example Vice President Biden told over
10,000 pro-israel activists in
Washington recently that the Obama
administration has left Iran has quote
left Iran more isolated than ever and by
pres President Biden said this matters
because quote god forbid if we have to
act it is important that the rest of the
world is with us of course many non
libertarian Republicans are critical of
President Obama's Iran policy but not
because they think trying to isolate
Iran in anticipation of an attacking it
as bad but because their view President
Obama has been insufficiently zealous in
doing this we start tonight from a
different premise that the United States
has in fact gone badly wrong in its
policies toward the Islamic Republic of
Iran and the Middle East more generally
that this is so becomes clear if you
compare the relative positions of the
United States and Iran in the Middle
East today with where they were on the
eve of 9/11 just over a decade ago on
the eve of 9/11 every government in the
Middle East every single one was either
reflexively pro-american like the
government's in Egypt and Turkey in
negotiations to effectively become
pro-american like Gaddafi's government
in Libya and Assad's in Syria or
staunchly anti
- Ann's government in Iraq or the
Taliban in Afghanistan but today because
of elections because of elections
governments in Egypt Tunisia Libya
Lebanon Palestine Turkey and Iraq are
all no longer reflexively pro-american
and anti-iranian they are all now
pursuing at least at least
independent foreign policies which means
they're much less enthusiastic about
strategic collaboration with the United
States and we're open to the Islamic
Republic of Iran so how did this happen
it would be a serious mistake to see
America's problems in the Middle East
today as just idiosyncratic products of
the George W Bush administration rather
Americans problems in the Middle East
grow out of a much deeper source that
precedes the George W Bush
administration that cuts across
Democratic and Republican party lines
and today warps President Obama's
policies every bit as much as those of
his predecessors in our new book going
to Tehran Flint and I described this as
a US determination to act as an imperial
power in the Middle East this
determination is well rooted in the
logic of a merit of modern American
foreign policy since World War two
American political elites have seen
dispositive strategic influence over the
Middle East hydrocarbons its hoyle and
gas as essential to American ambitions
for global primacy but contrary to
conventional wisdom this has never had
much to do with America's own energy
demand the United States came out of
World War two self-sufficient in oil
indeed the United States had provided
most of the oil that its allies had used
and the United States would not become a
net oil importer for nearly another
thirty years until the 1970s the coming
out of World War two American political
elites deemed the relatively cheap
reliable flow of Persian Gulf oil as
critical to the economic recovery of
Europe and Japan which in turn was
deemed essential to America's own
long-term economic prospects and to bind
Europe to bind Japan to the United
States for their very
and overall security though the United
States became an oil importer net oil
importer in the 1970s and its own energy
security it became more tied to the
Persian Gulf the United States has never
has never used middle-eastern supply to
meet the bulk of its own oil demand
instead American political elites have
found it vital vital to quote unquote
secure Middle Eastern oil not really for
America's own need but to control the
flow of oil to the global economy which
depends so heavily on it in order to
reinforce America's strategic influence
in important parts of the world so no
matter how significant today's shale
revolution turns out to be it will not
attenuate America's determination for
dispositive strategic influence over the
Middle East's hide requirements to have
dispositive influence over the Middle
East hydrocarbons its oil and gas the
United States has deemed it necessary to
dominate the Middle East to subordinate
the strategic and political orientation
of Middle East states to American
preferences in order to consolidate a
pro-american regional security order but
the major obstacle to realizing
America's hegemonic ambitions has been
the prospective emergence of truly
independent independent power centers in
the Middle East which is why for more
than 60 years America has worked
assiduously to suppress the emergence of
independent power centers in the Middle
East and throughout Iran has been
central to this effort in one of the
first episodes of the Cold War the
United States pushed hard in 1946 for
the Soviets to withdraw their forces
from Iran and though the United States
succeeded in pushing the Soviets to
withdraw their forces from Iran and Iran
elected a government under the staunchly
anti-socialist Mohammad Masada
the United States could not accept
Iran's determination for independence
especially as embodied in Masada its
commitment to reclaim Iranian oil for
Iranians so the CIA in 1953 launched a
coup to reinstall a Shah who would be
beholden to the United States and for
decades Iran became a crucial American
collaborator in the Persian Gulf
effectively policing the Persian Gulf in
accordance and American preferences
likewise the United States has been
sharply antagonistic to the emergence of
strong independent Arab governments that
might challenge the legitimacy of Saudi
Arabia and other American proxies over
Middle Eastern oil which is why though
the United States was initially open in
the 1950s to Egypt common abdomen who
had banned the communist party and stood
up to America's rival the British the
United States turned against Nasser when
he challenged Saudi Arabia over what he
called Arab oil he said it wasn't Saudi
oil
it was Arab oil and then he had the ball
to recognize the People's Republic of
China and to work with India to
establish the non-aligned movement the
United States remained hostile to Egypt
even after Nasser died in 1970 and his
successor Anwar Sadat expelled Soviet
advisors from Egypt in 1972 the United
States would not embrace Egypt until
Sadat fully capitulated to Washington's
vision of regional order in 1978 with
the Camp David Accords the so-called
special relationship itself between the
United States and Israel should be
understood and examined through this
prism of America's hegemonic ambitions
in the Middle East for it was only after
after the 1967 arab-israeli war when
Israel demonstrated that
could unilaterally attack seize and hold
territory in Soviet lined Arab states
Egypt in Syria and beat back the Soviet
Union's other Middle Eastern Ally Iraq
that the United States began providing
top-of-the-line weapon systems and
substantial military and economic aid to
Israel American administrations didn't
do this because Israel became more
democratic after 1967 it was just the
opposite as millions of Palestinians
fell under Israeli occupation with no
rights or because somehow memories of
the Holocaust became more vivid decades
after the fact they also did not do it
because of the Israel lobby which was
much weaker than than it is today US
policy makers did it because they came
to believe that a militarily strong
Israel which which could keep Arab
states strategically subordinated was
useful for America's own hegemonic
ambitions in the Middle East it is the
ability of Israeli governments and the
Israel lobby to attach Israel's drive
for military dominance over its
neighbors to America's own quest for
regional hegemony that has made the
Israel lobby the powerful force in
American domestic politics that it is
today but during the Cold War the United
States was still constrained in its duct
in its drive for all-out hegemony in the
Middle East by the Soviet Union and its
allies in the region for example after
the United States strategically lost
Iran in 1979 and was subjected to the
humiliating seizure of its diplomats the
most the United States did in response
during the 1980s while the Cold War was
still there was to collaborate with
Israel to prosecute a proxy war against
Iran in Lebanon and to support Saddam
Hussein in his war of aggression against
the Islamic Republic but by the end in
the 1980's the Soviet Union's impending
collapse left the United States
effectively unconstrained in
consolidating a highly militarized
pro-american political and security
order in the Middle East an order in
which regional powers would be contained
if not overthrown with overwhelming US
military force if they could not be
readily co-opted like Egypt under cidade
M Abarth in 1980 concern by Iraq's
emerging independence the United States
was able to take advantage of Soviet
weakness and Saddam Hussein's invasion
of Kuwait to deploy more than half a
million US troops to the Middle East
not just to expel Iraqi forces from
Kuwait but to lay the ground for a
highly militarized pro-american regional
order this is why after after the United
States expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait
and destroyed Iraq's ability to project
power beyond its borders the United
States did three interconnected things
that it could not do during the Cold War
to pursue all-out hegemony in the Middle
East
first it maintained it kept tens of
thousands of American troops in the
Persian Gulf on an open-ended basis and
it then reactivated the Fifth Fleet
after that war they we reactivated the
Fifth Fleet which had been deactivated
following World War two and we based him
in Bahrain as a dedicated naval force
for the Persian Gulf second second we
impose crippling sanctions on Iraq
killing a million people half of them
children
third we convened the so quad Middle
East peace process to bring weakened
Arab states in to strategically
subordinated settlements with Israel to
align with the United States in its
quote-unquote New World Order against
any would-be challenger the strongest of
which was the Islamic Republic of Iran
this determination to dominate the
broader Middle East became even more
acute following 9/11 with the u.s.
invasions and prolonged occupations of
Afghanistan and Iraq that have killed
hundreds of thousands of civilians
and by helping Israel consolidate a
nearly absolute freedom of unilateral
military initiative in its neighborhood
throughout the most sustained challenge
to America's highly militarized pursuit
of dominance in the Middle East has been
the Islamic Republic of Iran the
uniquely Islamist and fiercely
independent political order created out
of the 1979 revolution but the Islamic
Republic has not been implacably
anti-american it has tried to work with
the United States in the post Cold War
era while adopting helpful neutrality to
the United States during the 1991 war
with Iraq by helping the United States
get his hostages out of Lebanon helping
the United States get weapons to Muslims
in Bosnia offering an American energy
company the first contract to come back
into Iran after the Revolution and
helping the United States overthrow the
Taliban and expel al-qaeda from
Afghanistan but at each point the US has
refused to countenance a middlee
security order that would have an
independent an independent Iran and
instead designated Iran as part of the
axis of evil launched economic and cyber
warfare against it and dramatically
increase its militarization of Persian
Gulf States and Israel all ostensibly to
disarm Iran of weapons of mass
destruction it does not have this
intense intensification of America's
imperial ambitions in the Middle East
pursued with little regard for on the
ground reality has proven not just
quixotic but deeply damaging to
America's strategic position America's
failures in Afghanistan and Iraq
how proven not to just be costly drains
of human and material resources they've
underscored for the world and especially
Middle Eastern public's the limits of
what American military might can
accomplish even more importantly the
Imperial thrust of American policy has
decimated the perceived legitimacy of a
mirror
purposes for the vast majority of Middle
Eastern public's twenty years ago maybe
even ten years ago that might not have
seemed so significant but today with
Middle Eastern public's becoming more
politically engaged and their opinions
matter a more than ever this is
strategically devastating for the United
States it is also a real opportunity for
the Islamic Republic of Iran Flint and I
argue that America's posture of
unremitting hostility to the Islamic
Republic has been the most self damaging
aspect of America's imperial turn in the
Middle East
so rather than succumbing to sustained
American hostility the Islamic Republic
has not just survived but it has emerged
over the past decade as the biggest
beneficiary of America's ongoing decline
in the Middle East Flint will now tell
us why this is the case and I'm happy to
turn it to him at this point
Salam alaikum the Islamic Republic has
emerged as the biggest beneficiary of
the United States ongoing decline in the
Middle East because by pursuing a
foreign policy that actually appeals to
regional public's Tehran has positioned
itself to take advantage of America's
Imperial hubris and policy mistakes to
improve its own position in going to
take on we draw on at this point
literally years of opportunities to sit
and listen to Iranian diplomats national
security officials and politicians
explain that strategy on a map one sees
that Iran today shares land and maritime
boundaries with 15 states none is a
natural ally of the Islamic Republic in
fact nearly all have been hostile to the
idea of an Islamic Republic in Iran
several have been more than just hostile
the Islamic Republic's eastern neighbor
Afghanistan under the Taliban stormed
the Iranian consulate in mazar-e-sharif
killing Iranian diplomats there while
the Islamic Republic's Western neighbor
Iraq under Saddam Hussein with help from
Iran's other Arab neighbors and from the
United States invaded it killing 300,000
of its citizens during an eight-year war
of aggression today many of those same
Arab neighbors host thousands of US
troops and billions of dollars of the
deadliest US weapons systems all poised
and threatening to attack the Islamic
Republic to deal with these security
challenges the Islamic Republic has
developed conventional and asymmetric
defensive capabilities but it has
virtually no capacity to project
military power offensively beyond its
borders the real key to Iran's foreign
policy gains has been what Hillary and I
call its soft power strategy soft power
is political science speak for the
ability to get others to want
what you want rather than coercing them
to do what you want
through hard military or economic power
one of the remarkable things about the
shift in the Middle East balance of
power over the last decade or so is that
it has virtually nothing to do with
Tehran's use of military force or
economic coercion unlike the United
States the Islamic Republic hasn't
invaded anybody or sanctioned anybody
it's much more about the Islamic
Republic's soft power
remember what Hillary said about the
intensifying mobilization of Middle
Eastern public's and the growing
importance of public opinion in
determining on-the-ground political
outcomes in this setting Iran is
pursuing a strategy that galvanizes
regional public's most intensely felt
grievances including grievances against
the United States and Israel and against
their own unrepresentative regimes that
cooperate in various ways with the
United States and Israel Iran in effect
aligns itself with these publics and
with public opinion itself to constrain
hostile unrepresentative pro-western
neighboring governments from working
with the United States to attack it over
the years Iran has reinforced its soft
power strategy by picking political
winners as its allies in key regional
arenas think of Hamas Hezbollah Iraqis
Shia groups today even egypt's Muslim
Brotherhood Tehran's bet on these
movements has paid off big-time as they
have become the most influential players
political players in the Middle East
today
now Washington dismisses much of this as
Iranian quote-unquote support for
terrorism but with all due respect for
the paramilitary capabilities of Iranian
supported groups resisting Israeli
occupation or resisting violent jihadi
elements like Al Qaeda and the Taliban
the most interesting thing about these
groups is that when given the chance
they win elections and they win for the
right reasons because they authentic
we represent unavoidable constituencies
with real and legitimate grievances when
the United States refuses to deal with
these groups by calling them terrorist
organizations it reduces even further
its own chances of constructively
influencing regional developments and
opens up even more political space for
Iran this is just one of many ways in
which America is unwillingness to deal
with the Islamic Republic as an
independent power center undermines the
legitimacy and efficacy of US policy
such obtuseness is also evident in
Washington's approach to the Iranian
nuclear issue the United States and a
handful of Western countries which share
its position on the issue Britain France
Israel that's it they aren't asking Iran
not to build nuclear weapons because the
Islamic Republic isn't building nuclear
weapons as even US and Israeli
intelligence agencies acknowledge rather
the United States and these three other
countries are trying to force Iran to
surrender something it is perfectly
entitled to do as a sovereign state and
as a signatory to the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty that is to
enrich uranium under international
safeguards they are demanding with no
basis in international law or legitimacy
that Iran's surrender the right to an
indigenous nuclear fuel cycle and Tehran
won't do it that's what the nuclear
issue is really all about if the United
States accepted the principle and
reality of safeguard and enrichment in
Iran it could have a nuclear deal within
weeks
Iran would ratify and implement the
Additional Protocol to the NPT which
provides for expanded and more proactive
monitoring of signatories nuclear
activities and accept other more
intrusive verification and notification
instruments but the United States won't
do this because it would mean accepting
the Islamic Republic as an independent
power center in the Middle East and so
the controversy
drags on this puts the Islamic Republic
in the position of pursuing its nuclear
rights in defiance of the United States
and Israel something that has powerful
resonance with Publix across the Middle
East indeed throughout the global South
some Arab leaders may not like the
Iranian nuclear program but polls of
predominantly Sunni Arab populations
show large majorities strongly
supportive of Iran's nuclear efforts
some even show large majorities of Arabs
thinking it would be a good thing if
Iran acquired nuclear weapons and that
brings us back to Iran soft power
strategy getting people to want what you
want in strategic terms the Islamic
Republic is using through its narrative
not it's drones or its tanks or even its
centrifuges but through its narrative
the political awakening of Middle
Eastern public's to alter the very
nature of power politics in the Middle
East the Middle East balance of power is
becoming in effect a balance of
influence progressively less defined by
hard military capabilities where the
United States has clear advantages and
the Islamic Republic is deficient and
ever more defined in terms of who can
appeal to regional public's where the
Islamic Republic has real advantages
Tehran is both encouraging and taking
advantage of this transition to enhance
its own regional standing another
important respect in which the United
States has gone wrong
in its Iran policy is its refusal to
understand that only an Islamic Republic
of Iran can accrue the kinds of soft
power gains I'm talking about the Shah
couldn't have done it a pro-western
secular republic of iran couldn't have
done it only the Islamic Republic of
Iran can do it instead of recognizing
this American political policy media
elites persist in depicting the Islamic
Republic as an
illegitimate system so despised by its
own population that it's in imminent
danger of overthrow American elites have
been saying this for more than 30 years
virtually since the Islamic Republic's
founding out of the 1979 Iranian
Revolution and for more than 30 years
the Islamic Republic has consistently
defied their relentless predictions of
its collapse or defeat the Islamic
Republic has survived because its basic
model the integration of participatory
politics and elections with principles
and institutions of Islamic governance
and a strong commitment to foreign
policy independence this model is
according to polls electoral
participation rates and other indicators
it is in actual fact what a majority of
Iranians living inside their country
want they don't want a political order
grounded in western-style secular
liberalism they want an indigenously
generated order reflecting their
cultural and religious values as the
reformist president mohammad hot to me
described them freedom independence and
progress within the context of both
religiosity and national identity that's
what the Islamic Republic with all its
flaws offers Iranians the chance to
pursue even those Iranians who want the
Islamic Republic to evolve in
significant ways at the end of the day
even most of them still want it to be
the Islamic Republic of Iran and it's
not just a substantial percentage of
Iranians who seem to think this way in
every Muslim society in the Middle East
where people have had the opportunity to
choose their political futures through
elections clear majorities have voted
for some version of what the Islamic
Republic has been trying to do since the
Iranian Revolution and the Islamic
Republic has made progress in some
impressive ways Khan
two deeply rooted but ill-informed
western stereotypes the Islamic Republic
has achieved far more progressive
outcomes in alleviating poverty
delivering health care providing
educational access and yes expanding
opportunities for women then the Shahs
regime ever did certainly the Islamic
Republic has achieved more progressive
outcomes in these areas than any of its
neighbors including US allies like Saudi
Arabia and Turkey these realities never
seem to count when Americans and
expatriate Iranians engage in self sat
at gratifying criticism of human rights
conditions in the Islamic Republic but
they matter greatly in legitimating the
Islamic Republic for most Iranians
living in their country notwithstanding
the Islamic Republic staying power
foreign policy pundits who in many cases
have no direct connection to on the
ground reality inside Iran continue
telling us that the system there is on
the verge of collapse the basic features
of this storyline stay the same
whether it's reflected in claims that
the 2009 presidential election was a
fraud that the green movement which
emerged in the aftermath of that
election represented something more than
a narrow and alienated elite stratum of
Iranian society that sanctions are now
finally working to undermine the Islamic
Republic's basic stability or that in
the context of the Arab Awakening the
same social currents empowering
Islamists across the Arab world will in
Iran somehow transform the Islamic
Republic into a secular liberal
democracy every time and in every form
the story proves false but foreign
policy pundits who know nothing about
Iran Iranian expatriates who fled the
revolution and want the Islamic Republic
to fail and pro-israel advocates keep
peddling it what all of this constantly
getting Iran wrong reflects is a
delusion that the United States
is still basically in control of the
strategic situation in the Middle East
this is a dangerous delusion grounded in
persistent American illusions about
Middle Eastern reality here's reality
because of failed Wars and occupations
in Iraq and Afghanistan a war on terror
that has turned Muslim societies ever
more firmly against US policy and de
facto support for open-ended Israeli
occupation of Arab populations America's
position in the Middle East is in
freefall if with regional public's
increasingly mobilized the United States
launches another war to disarm yet
another Middle Eastern country of
weapons of mass destruction it does not
have the damage inflicted on America's
position in the Middle East and globally
will make that inflicted by the decision
to invade Iraq look almost trivial by
comparison for its own interests
Washington has to take a different
approach the United States needs to come
to terms with the Islamic Republic not
as a favor to Tehran but to save its own
position in the region and avert the
strategic and moral catastrophe of
another Middle Eastern war coming to
terms with the Islamic Republic means
accepting it as a legitimate order
representing legitimate national
interests and as a rising regional power
unwilling to subordinate its foreign
policy to Washington there is an
important precedent in recent American
history for the kind of diplomacy I'm
talking about accepting a rising
regional power as a legitimate entity
pursuing its interests in a
fundamentally rational and offensive way
is how President Richard Nixon enabled
the historic opening to China in the
early 1970s for 20 years from the time
of the Chinese Revolution the United
States had worked to isolate and
undermine the People's Republic of China
Washington didn't just pursue a regime
change policy toward the People's
Republic it recognized a whole other
political structure based on Taiwan
as the quote-unquote real government of
China and the results were terrible for
the United States trying not to contain
but to suppress and undermine China
ended up undermining the u.s. position
in Asia and took America into the
Vietnam War in this context Nixon
recognized the imperative of
rapprochement with Beijing his
initiative to realign relations with
China saved America's position in Asia
after the draining disaster of Vietnam
if the United States accepted the
Islamic Republic in the same way an
equally thorough realignment of US
Iranian relations would be possible
Ayatollah Khamenei and the three Iranian
presidents elected over the course of
Hama days 23 year tenure as supreme
leader have all said repeatedly that
Iran is open to better relations with
America but only on the basis of mutual
respect equality and American acceptance
of the Islamic Republic mutual respect
equality and American acceptance
if Washington wants to get its ray Ron
policy right that's a pretty good road
map thank you very much
oh yeah
the most important thing I can say
tonight is actually very brief three
words read this book that's good advice
you'll find a lot of information that's
not generally available something that's
not available at all also very valuable
insights and understanding which is
sharply different from views in the
United States attitudes in the United
States that are so conventional and
unchallenged that they can fairly be
called a party line and also
perspectives that may help if they're
widely enough understood to halt the
very clear drift towards what could be a
terrible war and perhaps not far in the
future now that's actually anticipated
last December there was a conference in
New York of the Washington Institute of
Near East policy it's actually an
offshoot of AIPAC but the press pretends
not to notice that when they cite them
as a major source the conference was
attended by high officials of the with
regard to the Middle East of the last
two administrations Martin Indyk Dennis
Ross Elliott Abrams and according to
press reports they concluded apparently
happily that they're a few months left
for possible negotiations and after that
we'll have to go to war and that could
happen this drift towards war
you couldn't it's understandable if you
if you pay attention to the party line
so if you paid if you followed the say
the last presidential debate final
debate of the last free election the two
candidates Obama and Romney agreed that
the gravest threat to peace in the
region is Iran and the press dutifully
reported the next day not that they said
it but that the greatest threat to peace
is Iran if you followed the Hagel
hearings shortly after two countries
were named and Hagel was denounced by
the Republicans for not his position on
them when one was Israel he was
apparently not sufficiently a worshipful
of Israel and the second was Iran namely
he wasn't eager enough to go to war with
Iran practically no other country was
mentioned all of this raises a number of
questions three simple questions in fact
first of all who believes that Iran is
the gravest threat to world peace - what
is the perceived threat and three
assuming that there is a threat is there
a way to deal with it well let's take a
look
Hillary already answered the first who
perceives that Iran is a threat the
United States few of its allies it's a
Western obsession not the non-aligned
countries most of the world they
vigorously supported Iran's right to
enrich uranium as a member of the
non-proliferation treaty they elected
Iran as the head of the non-aligned the
countries right now on a meeting ran the
meeting in Tehran last August and not
the Arab world and pointed out right
nearby they do see threats in the Arab
world
mainly Israel and the United States
in several countries in Egypt and Iraq
and a couple of others the United States
is seen as the greatest threat to the
Arab world in fact about two-thirds and
the most recent poll think that he
Israel's possession of nuclear weapons
justifies other nations developing them
you read here that the Arab support the
US on Iran and that's not totally false
but you have to recognize how the US
another US party line the reference to
Arabs refers to Arab dictators but we
don't care what the population things
and the dictators more or less support
the United States so that justifies the
headlines Arabs support the United
States if the population happens to
think the US is the greatest threat well
it's just not interesting people on
people as Georgia or will refer to
people in other words it's typical of
the contempt for democracy that's
another part of the fundamental party
line concealed and misleading rhetoric
so that that's who thinks Iran is a
threat what is the threat supposed to be
well actually here we have authoritative
answers they come from the highest level
of US intelligence Pentagon they give
regular presentations to Congress on
global security situation control public
you can pick it up in the internet
doesn't get reported the they explain of
course they talk about Iran as the
Iranian threat and they point out that
the threat is not military
Iran has very low military spending even
by the standards of the region of course
minuscule was compared to the United
States it's it's it has a strategic
doctrine which is defensive designed to
deter invasion long enough for
just said in and they say that if Iran
is developing nuclear weapons for which
they have no evidence but if it is it
would be part of their deterrent
strategy and that's crucial the u.s.
cannot tolerate a deterrent strategy
Israel incidentally is exactly the same
you've read a couple of weeks ago that
Israel bomb military sites in Syria and
the reason that was presented was
because they might help a deterrent to
Israeli attack on Lebanon namely they
might go to the only force that deters
an attack Hezbollah and States which are
technically called rogue states that
believe they have the right to use force
freely everywhere cannot tolerate
deterrence for obvious reasons that's
what the threat is is there any way to
deal with it well there are actually a
couple of ways there's some efforts in
the past that would have succeeded if
the US hadn't blocked them such time go
into it actually they discuss it in
their book but there's a more
far-reaching proposal which is an
important one in fact it came up at the
non-aligned meeting in Tehran last
August a renewed a proposal that's quite
old and has been advanced most strongly
by the Arab states primarily by Egypt
and that is to establish a nuclear
weapons free zone in the region now that
I was overwhelming support such strong
support that the United States has been
compelled to formally agree but with
qualifications not now sometime in the
future and must exclude Israel well
that's not going to get anywhere is
there any way to pursue this project
yeah
definite ways in fact we just passed a
milestone
I could have exploited it if there were
any interest in solving the greatest
threat to peace last December there was
to be a meeting under international
auspices auspices of the
non-proliferation treaty in Helsinki
Finland to try to move forward towards
establishing a nuclear weapons free zone
to weapons of mass destruction free zone
Israel said it wouldn't attend the
conference everyone was waiting to see
what Iran would say in early November
Iran said it would attend the conference
a couple of days later Obama canceled
the conference the European Union
proceeded to the European Parliament
proceeded to pass a strong resolution
calling for carrying the conference for
the carrying the process forward anyway
the Arab states said they would pursue
it but if Washington blocks it then it's
not going to get anywhere there's only
one way to change this and that's
American citizens American public
opinion could change US policy but
there's a precondition they have to know
something about it have to know that it
exists and in this case you can't know
that it exists unless you carry out your
own research projects or read arms
control journals you know arcane
journals there wasn't a word about it in
the American press all of this passed
without a word it was shortly after this
that the Washington student for Near
East policy meeting that I mentioned
took place they doubtless knew about it
and now could happily move on the war so
there are things that can be done well
those are the three main questions
there's another point that should be
recognized that's come up and both of
the previous discussions it's now 60
years since the US
overthrew the parliamentary government
in Iran and since that time not a single
day has passed in which the u.s. hasn't
been torturing Iran constantly Jimmy
Carter was asked about this and he said
well it really didn't matter it's
ancient history
Obama standard line is let's not look to
the past let's look to the future that's
a very convenient position for criminals
let's forget about everything that
happened but it's not a unmeant that
somehow victims don't feel that way they
have memories you see this all over the
world the victims have memories which
the perpetrators don't they'll know
about and like to forget this is all in
the past let's forget it
actually it's useful to remember a quip
of William Faulkner said the past is
never dead it's not even past and that's
true in this case for the victims the
past is not past so first came the
overthrow of the parliamentary regime
actually is a very we now have for the
first time a really kind of definitive
scholarly study of what happens worth
very much worth reading your ones
lbrahim ends new book called the KU
scholar at Columbia and Iranian American
scholar he point he makes a pretty
convincing case very convincing that the
reasons that were offered at the time
and that have been maintained in
scholarship where it's not correct it
had almost had nothing do with the
Russians it it didn't even if anything
do with profits it had to do with
control over the oil and control for a
good reason it was necessary to prevent
what's sometimes called the domino
effect the effect on others if a country
gains control of its own energy and they
were very concerned at the time
particularly with Egypt Egypt was right
in the process of throwing out the
British
and there were big demonstrations and
Egypt about the overthrow the coup and
so on and they were concerned that
British work the Americans were rightly
concerned that if Iran could gain
control of its own resources Egypt might
be impelled to do so as well
and after that in the official
terminology the rot might spread
elsewhere the rot of independent
development that's not tolerable for
rogue states that expect to dominate the
world and the US media actually grasped
the essential point in an interesting
way so here's the New York Times right
after the coup underdeveloped content to
praise the coos of a great idea
underdeveloped countries with rich
resources now have an object lesson in
the heavy cost that must be paid by one
of their number which goes berserk with
fanatical nationalism it's perhaps too
much to hope that Iran's experience will
prevent the rise of Masada the
nationalist leader in other countries
but that experience may at least
strengthen the hands of more reasonable
and more far-seeing leaders who will
have a clear-eyed understanding of the
principles of decent behavior which
means do what we say or else that's
decent behavior and understood New York
Times is accurate well the torture
continues all through the period of the
Shahs had one of the worst Human Rights
records in the world u.s. strongly
supported him actually it's an MIT
connection that some of you may remember
those of you who were around in the 70s
will recall that the campus practically
blew up when an arrangement was supposed
to be a secret arrangement leaked
showing that MIT was to exaggerate
slightly effectively selling the nuclear
engineering department to the Shah
admitting Iranian nuclear India
years in return for some unknown amount
of Lord yes we never found out the money
the students were strongly opposed that
was a big student uprising I think about
80% of the students were opposed and
referendum it went through it was
strongly support it was on actually
under Washington's initiative the
initiators were familiar people Henry
Kissinger Dick Cheney Donald Rumsfeld
they thought the Shah needed a nuclear
power of course means develop nuclear
nuclear weapons if necessary and it went
through and has consequences the current
irani and nuclear energy program is run
by PhDs from MIT so we contributed to
the gravest threat to world peace
then then comes the the fall of the Shah
the u.s. immediately immediately turned
to support for the Iraqi invasion strong
support Ronald Reagan removed Saddam
Hussein from the terrorists list so that
the United States could provide him with
direct aid and support other Western
powers too and the support was really
strong
in fact the Saddam Hussein was granted a
privilege that otherwise only Israel has
had mainly to attack a u.s. ship and
kill several dozen a crewmen USS stark
and to get away with it without without
even a comment that's a shows real love
shortly after that US forces pretty much
entered the war directly controlling
making sure that Iraqi ships could get
through the Gulf us worship shot down an
irani an airliner in the mystic airspace
of any question about it the USS
Vincennes killed
290 people you want
a civilian airliner the commander of the
ship right next to it David Carlson
actually wrote an article and they've in
the naval the official naval journal
about it coming very close to saying
this just had to be delivered
he said they kind of watched with
amazement as the events in trained its
advanced Egypt missiles on this plane
and domestic the airspace and shot it
down well the US reaction was to provide
the medals of honor to the flight
officer who shot the plane down in the
commander of the ship George Bush and
vice president said that he was asked
whether the US auto apologizes is no the
I will never apologize for anything the
United States does whatever the facts
are well you know the Iranians with
their strange memories probably remember
all of this immediately afterwards Bush
been president showed his love for
Saddam Hussein by inviting Iranian
nuclear engineers to the United States
for advanced training in nuclear weapons
production that's Iran that's the
country that had killed hundreds of
thousands of Iranians during a us-backed
attack and meanwhile Iran was subject to
sanctions harsher and harsher sanctions
that continues and now it's threats of
war the phrase all options are open has
a meaning it means the option of attack
military attack is open for those of you
have kind of antiquarian interests
there's something called the UN Charter
you know way back there which is the
foundation of modern international law
but not for rogue states and it's first
principle is that outlawing the threat
or use of force threat or use of force
in international affairs what you hear
daily from the White House and other
threat
for Israel of course well there's among
other things along with reading this
book that's just you look up something
else which you can pick up on the
Internet it's a very interesting lecture
at Chatham House that's Britain's
counterpart to the Centre for unfuck for
foreign relations it's by John snows
leading British journalist very
important journalist and a very good one
who has a lot of experience with Iran
it's electric on Iran to Chatham House
you can find it on the internet and his
main point is that the West
he takes pretty much the same view as
who are in Flint
he says the West must overcome its
contempt for Iran and its people the
question he's talking mostly in the
British they must engage with Iran with
trade with cultural interchange and he
brings up a highly successful example of
this cooperative effort of the British
Museum and Iran on cultural exchanges
British Museum has lots of great Iranian
art which somehow found its way they
were means on mention and there were
exchanges over it which worked very well
and another example came up right here a
couple of months ago many of you may
know that the triple-a s had its annual
meeting American Association for
advancement science at here in Boston
and one of the panels was an interesting
one that the speakers and one of the
panels had just attended an
international conference in Tehran was
conference on hiv/aids and at the panel
here they described
Iran as a model for the rest of the
region in its response to AIDS and added
that we can learn a lot from what
Iranians are doing but they also added
that Iran's efforts are now being
barely hampered by the harsh sanctions
one of the points of them well so Jon
Snow ended his talk with the word esteem
esteem esteem he said we should respect
Iran in its history of civilization
while making clear whatever we think
about its government and I think you I
might just add that we might have the
honesty conceivably to look in the
mirror learn something about ourselves
and if we do we can avert the dangerous
drift to war and we can hope to settle
existing conflicts such as they are
peacefully
we have about half an hour for your
questions and responses from the
panelists in view of the time that we
have only half an hour may I request
that you make your questions as brief as
possible and direct them to one or
another of the speakers and introduce
yourselves first and then raise your
question yes please
yes my name is Ken Oy and I teach
political science and engineering
systems here at MIT
my question is to Flint and Hilary
you've done a beautiful job of
describing a bipartisan US policy of
unrelenting hostility towards the
Islamic Republic my question centers on
your assessment of the preconditions for
change in that policy you've sat inside
and witnessed the arguments you've been
doing your book tours trying to
influence opinion you're also astute
observers of the Middle East with
sensitivity to potential changes in Iran
itself and throughout the region Nixon
went to China as you point out policies
to change what will it take for US
policy to change on your own
I think that Professor Chomsky touched
on something very important
Nixon's effort to realign US relations
with China was very much a top-down
effort
it was led from within the executive
branch indeed probably for most of the
period that the ground was being laid I
think probably not more than ten people
in the US government knew what was
really going on and the Secretary of
State was not always one of those ten
people and the calculation was that this
was going to be so domestically
challenging to do that you almost had to
do lay the groundwork in secret kind of
spring this achievement on the world on
the public and count on the public
responding in a favorable way so that
those forces in American domestic
politics who would try and subvert a
realignment relations with China would
be put on the defensive and and
marginalized and I think is a political
strategy that worked pretty well for all
that it reflected a certain Nick Sounion
cynicism it actually worked pretty
pretty well I don't know if you can do
that in a 24/7 news cycle wired world
like we live in I think it is going to
take real presidential leadership I wish
I could say I was more optimistic about
President Obama in this regard than I am
but I think it is going to ultimately
take presidential leadership but it is
also going to take what
professor Chomsky talked about it is
going to have to take a greater
mobilization of public opinion public
attitudes I mean you see it in the polls
now that I mean varies depending on how
you ask the question but there is kind
of a general war weariness among the
American public right now that can be
manipulated that could be turned around
with a you know clever propaganda but
it's also something that could be
mobilized in another way it could be
mobilized in a way that could actually
make it more possible to try and rely US
relations with Iran the obstacles you
point to are all there they're real
they're strong I wish I could be more
optimistic than I am but we have to make
the best argument that we can make and
it's a reason why we call our new book
going to Tehran because when we first
started this when we were working in the
US government working in the White House
we thought that the United States could
do particular things for example it
could stand down in some of the covert
operations the hundreds of millions of
dollars that we've allocated for covert
operations to undermine and overthrow
the Islamic Republic or we could somehow
decrease some of our aggressive
patrolling of the Persian Gulf but it
gets to really what Professor Chomsky
was getting at how do you allow the
United States American citizens to
become more educated to see Iran the
Islamic Republic for what it is what
it's built including its flaws but what
it's doing that makes it not just a
power that has staying power but that
has real power for the region in the
world and that's always say it's going
to Tehran it's going to track Iran
intellectually strategically but
physically that the president today in
the political system that we can't have
can't really lift sanctions can't really
stop the covert operations unless there
is this leadership to show Americans
that you can go to Tehran and you're not
going to be hung in the square but there
are real people they're doing real
things and that's why that's such an
important driver in our book going to
Tehran intellectually but physically the
president needs to do that thank you yes
sir my name is sto said I am from
Pakistan the majority of people in
Pakistan are now facing the spheres
loadshedding and there is a Ron and
Pakistan pipeline which has been opposed
by the American administration that is
ending the feeling in the general public
against imagine that why they are not
allowing that gas line by pipeline
project to be completed it's you know
the the case he raised is a very good
example of an instrument that the United
States uses more and more in dealing
with Iran so-called
secondary sanctions there are some UN
sanctions
you know authorized by the Security
Council against Iran there are a lot of
unilateral US sanctions that affect what
US businesses us individuals can do visa
vie Iran but most of the sanctions that
cause difficulties in Iran are are there
through what are called secondary
sanctions where the u.s. threatens to
punish a third country not for what it's
doing in the United States but for doing
perfectly lawful business like wanting
to have a natural gas pipeline with Iran
these sanctions are almost certainly
illegal under the World Trade
Organization under the WTO you have a
national security clause where is a
you're at war with a country you can
truncate your trade relations with that
country by invoking the national
security clause you don't have a right
to punish third countries for what they
do in another country but that is now
routinely what the United States does
and if you know the United States ever
sanctions
two important a country under those
secondary sanctions I think there's a
good chance the US will get taken to the
World Trade Organization over it and the
world United States will lose that case
this is this is illegal what the United
States is doing and what they're trying
to block Pakistan from doing is is a
good example of that the United States
does this routinely it's been doing it
with Cuba for 50 years
that's right against a unanimous world
opposition that's what it means to be a
rogue state you do what you like yes
but from your statement of your
statement about the main argument of the
book and from a critique I read about
the book I think you may be conflating
two things there are realities about
life in Iran and about how people view
the government and there is also the US
government taking advantage sometimes of
those realities and using those
realities for propaganda or for its own
purposes for its own benefit I think
that for example the green movement is a
good example of that the fact that there
were millions of people on the street
after the elections shows that there is
a group of your onions and they may be
the majority but there are millions of
your onions who are opposing very main
elements of the government of the of the
regime in Iran and they're not in
support of the at least the current form
of the government the way or the current
order of power in the regime in the
Korean regime but then there's also the
United States government taking
advantage of those realities and it is
true that the government did take
advantage of what went on after the
elections for its own for its own agenda
or for its own propaganda but it's
unfair representation of the realities
of Iran and of the people of Iran to
deny the the way that Iranian people
view their own government if if it is to
show what the US government is how the
US government is using those realities
look American American governments have
been doing this since 1953 as Professor
Chomsky articulated and there's a
there's a new book that goes through
this very very cogently about the about
the coup the United States has always
taken advantage of disaffected people
particularly disaffected elites in Iran
so certainly go to North Tehran where a
Moussa be one the majority of I mean one
through North Tehran clearly anyone the
majority of Tehran not the province but
the city
clearly there are disaffected people
there like there are all over the world
and the United States does take
advantage of them the United States
clearly tries to find expatriates and
people within countries disaffected
people to hold them up whether it's Cuba
whether it's Iraq whether it's China the
1960s we hold them up to say see these
people need liberation this is this is
an American Way of war to liberate what
I would call marginalize narrow group of
disaffected elite now does that mean
that they don't have a right to do
whatever they want to do all power to
them if they want to and they can mount
a revolution to have a different
political order that's not my business
but if you look at public opinion
polling if you look at motor
participation rates not just for the
presidency the City Council for the
Parliament they're very high in Iran
people actually think their vote matters
which is a bit different than here and
contrary took all the the thing
everything that we see in the media that
there's just going to be the supreme
leader is going to just anoint the next
president the next presidential election
in Iran is likely to be very interesting
very exciting and highly contested
because as the political order inside
the Islamic Republic has matured it is
independent it is indigenous it is far
from perfect but people contest outcomes
we have gone from morph about 32 years
ago every single Iranian being a royal
subject 32 years later 100% of Iranians
can vote they can vote for Council they
can vote for Parliament they can vote
for president they
vote for the the Assembly of Experts
that oversees a supreme leader we went
for a situation in Iran where thirty-two
years ago there were very high literacy
rates especially for women too today for
the people that have been educated by
the Islamic Republic literacy is 97%
with no gender disparity between men and
women these are real outcomes the
University of Mississippi is going to
Iran to try to figure out how Iran ian's
could help them get health care delivery
to the Mississippi Delta these are real
achievements of course they're
disaffected people of course you know
our heart goes out to disaffected people
everywhere to do what they can to have a
better life but Americans use that and
try to manipulate that Cuba Iraq China
and now Iran there is no way that an
independent country is going to
negotiate their internal political order
with a hostile power no way if I may I
would like to insert a few comments here
taking advantage of my position it seems
to me that the arguments that all three
of you have presented regarding American
foreign policy have all been well taken
based on premises with which I
wholeheartedly agree against
intervention against imposition of
American will on Iran or in the region
and so on but I hope that that argument
and that sentiment as laudable as it is
does not lead to a distortion of the
political realities inside of Iran we
are not talking about a few disaffected
people in northern sections of the Iran
we are talking about a movement after
the contested elections in particular
that according to the mayor of Tehran at
the time God above who is now a
presidential candidate brought out two
to three million people in the streets
of Tehran protesting the policies of the
government
and the manner in which the elections
were held that led to a brutal put down
of that movement we are talking about
individuals with high-ranking positions
whose commitment to the Islamic Republic
was beyond question namely the prime
minister of Iran for eight years during
the iran-iraq war USA Mousavi the two
times Speaker of the Parliament care
ruby who have been under house arrest
ever since the elections with the
government absolutely lying about its
policies with regard to these
individuals we are talking about
hundreds of individuals who are
imprisoned journalists high officials of
the government human rights activists
attorneys who have defended those
individuals who are in jail these are
realities these need not be overlooked
these need not be you know this means in
favor of the arguments that you are
making with which I wholeheartedly agree
that concerns American foreign policy
you need not link these two things
together the realities in Iran the
realities in Iran speak for themselves
and it requires a knowledge of those
realities on the ground to speak
meaningfully about them that's what I'm
not trying to you know it it's not my
place to tell Iranian is what their
political future should be my place as a
political analyst is to try and
understand what political reality is not
what I might wish it to be
but what it is and I think the two
things that you want us to separate are
inextricably linked you talk about
journalists imprisoned in Iran which
country imprisons more journalists the
romic Republic of Iran or the US ally
NATO member secular Democratic Turkey
the answer is turkey turkey imprisons
more journalists than any country on the
planet including China including Iran
including any other country you might
want to name that the US has problems
with okay now I'm not saying don't care
about journalists imprisoned in Iran or
not care about journalists imprisoned in
Turkey I'm saying that if you if you let
an uncontested
on certain specific aspects of human
rights in Iran undercut American
engagement you can say all you want that
you're opposed to war you can say all
you want that you're opposed the United
States trying to pursue coercive regime
change in Iran but if that's what you
were doing if every discussion about US
diplomacy toward Iran has to have the
obligatory but what about the green
movement section then you are
undercutting diploma prospects for
better policy and you are pushing the
United States closer to war you can say
that's not what you want you can say
that's not what you're trying to do but
that is what you are doing and that's
why that's what's happened under
President Obama who ostensibly came in
who said we should engage but that's
what's happened because he was he took
Iranian expatriates he invited them in
he asked them what therapy was even
though they don't go to Iran even though
they don't take into account a fish
objective data like voting statistics
what people actually care about who they
said they voted for before after and
during the race and he held that up and
said well we can't engage we have to
first have a pause we can't engage and
then we have to impose more sanctions
and then we have to send
tens of billions of dollars in weapon
systems to Saudi Arabia and Israel just
to be prepared in case we have to attack
Iran all of that happened under Obama
he took Bush's policies and increase
them exponentially against Iran using
the green yes so from one side the
Iranian nuclear plans is making Western
country policies united towards Middle
East and Iran and then from one side you
are saying that the the solution is
behind American people words to to
change the view of American policy
towards Iran and then from the other
side is Iranian side that is kind of
complex it's it's not really clear and
again they feel victim so they prefer to
be approached by American side so the
question is given these two sides which
nobody is really moving towards each
other what can happen to United Iran and
us and Western country again together
who was it directed it was it directed
to a particular person
dr. Jones sorry it was a bit hard to
hear the question so the question is
what can what can fix American policy
point of view towards Middle East
briefly mm-hmm we have a different
policy toward the Middle East we can
easily have a different policy towards
the Middle East so for example with
regard to Iran we can stop threatening
war and do exactly what Hillary and
Flint and Jon Snow suggested engage have
commercial and cultural relations try
too many ways to deal with whatever
conflicts there are for example if
there's a if someone thinks that the
threat of nuclear weapons are there are
many possibilities I mean like give
narrower proposals but the broadest
proposal and the most sensible one is
the one that most of the world wants
including the Arab states including Iran
virtually everyone except the United
States and Israel and that's to move
towards a nuclear weapons free zone in
the region and we can do that I had a
chance to do it last November
last December wasn't reported but there
was a chance and it can be done tomorrow
if the problem is let's say Israel
Palestine which incidentally of all the
problems in the world is probably the
easiest one to solve
it's called intractable it's not
intractable there is an overwhelming
support virtually universal support for
a very straightforward solution to it
actually that solution was proposed that
the UN Security Council in January 1976
by the three major Arab states Egypt
Syria and Jordan and it's now accepted
by essentially everyone in the world the
proposed
is to have a political settlement
diplomatic settlement on the
internationally recognized border
perhaps with minor and mutual
adjustments that's official u.s. wording
because it's a ceasefire lines you
straighten it out with two states each
of them with guarantees of quoting the
right to exist in peace and security
within secure and recognized borders
okay
virtually universal support the Arab
states the Organization of Islamic
states includes Iran the non-aligned
movement it's one problem right here the
u.s. fully dependent on the u.s. in into
the resolution vetoed another similar
one in nineteen eighty right up until
today it continues to block a diplomatic
settlement well okay can't have a
diplomatic settlement if the you know
the biggest thug on the block says you
can't have it but that's something we
can do something about and uh look at
the other problems well I can look at
them too for example if if Egypt and
Iraq people in Egypt in Iraq believe as
they do that the United States is the
greatest threat they face that we could
ask ourselves why why the age of
Egyptians and Iraqis that believe that
the greatest threat they face is the
United States maybe there's a reason for
that well you know there is a reason if
we look and we can do something about it
and the same with other problems there
are none that I know of that we can't do
something about often something decisive
thank you yes hello my name is Reza have
a question for Hillary can you tell us
more about the negotiations took place
in Afghanistan like during the
Afghanistan war which are sometimes
referred to as like a missed opportunity
for like a better relationships did you
know thank you yeah
so I had the opportunity as a I was a
career foreign service officer in the
State Department assigned to the US
mission to the United Nations in New
York
and one of the things I had the chance
to do there was to meet with actually
say hello to an Iranian diplomat the
first time in studying and working on
the Middle East in 20 years that I met
and was allowed to say hello to and have
a conversation with someone
an Iranian diplomat an official who
supported the Islamic Republic of Iran
that was something that I had not gotten
in the US government I hadn't gotten in
any of the academic institutions in
which I was educated and certainly
hadn't hadn't seen in any of the any of
the media in those negotiations well the
reason why we were allowed to do that we
were given an exception to talk to the
Iranians as part of a multilateral
mechanism that Afghanistan that was set
up it was the six countries surrounding
Afghanistan of which Iran is one of
those six the United States and Russia
and we were allowed to meet together to
talk not about bilateral relations but
about Afghanistan under the Taliban a
situation that both the United States
and Iran saw as threatening we were able
to have these discussions and they were
basically civil interesting constructive
but not really going anywhere before
9/11 with the 9/11 attacks that changed
pretty significantly we were all in New
York my sister actually was at the World
Trade Center
she's fine nothing happened to her but
she worked at World Trade Center of
building 7 and I got a call right after
right after the the planes hit the
building from my Iranian counterpart
asking how was my sister it was both
interesting negotiation politically but
then even personally to have that kind
of that kind of outreach but coming back
to substance which was what was really
interesting and important was this
Iranian official was the most
constructive person in the room out of
all the other diplomats from the six
countries in Russia was the most
knowledgeable about Afghanistan about
the other countries in Central Asia
about the geopolitics of the region and
had really constructive ideas of how we
can deal with a post-911 environment the
United States was just looking to bomb
anywhere we had no real plan for dealing
with Afghanistan we had no plan for down
with al-qaeda there were tremendous
divisions in Washington and my Iranian
counterpart said well you know what we
the Iranians and the Indians and the
Russians have worked during this period
of the Taliban rule we have worked to
actually put together various Afghan
groups different ethnicities people in
Afghanistan into something called the
Northern Alliance we've worked to give
them money feed them clothe them train
them they're about 15,000 of them we
will work with you these are people on
the ground we will work with you the
United States unconditionally to help go
in overthrow the Taliban and rout al
Qaeda from Afghanistan this was
critically important because you might
say it's not only we didn't have a war
plan we couldn't have a war plan there
was no way to get American troops to
Afghanistan it was any kind of with any
kind of speed so there's this idea that
we've always had tens of thousands of
troops or nearly a hundred thousand
troops like we have now in Afghanistan
that's not how we fought the war in the
first year we had about 2,500 u.s.
special mostly Special Forces people on
the ground the rest of it was air power
from the United States and these 15,000
Afghan Northern Alliance people that the
Iranians had helped put together this is
a very constructive not just
relationship but negotiation and
dialogue with the Iranian between the
United States and the Iranians we came
together then in Bonn Germany to put
together the political product part of
the process and there too it was
fascinating what I heard from the
Iranian side the United States continued
to just be focused on the military the
Iranians were focused on the
Constitution that Afghanistan had to
have a constitution that empowered and
gave representation to all of
Afghanistan's ethnic groups they were
very firmly convinced that this was the
way forward for Afghanistan there needed
to be some sort of built-in power
sharing in the Constitution so that
everybody could come into the government
and have a say in the future of
Afghanistan I'd say so care that much
about it but you know we let the
Iranians have their push this silly
thing called democracy voting and
constitutionalism for Afghanistan we
finally met at the end of this session
in Bonn we they all came together there
was a new government put up that stood
up for Afghanistan with Karzai as the
head
Iran was very very constructive and
helpful to the United States and trying
to help see that there were figures that
represented various ethnicities but who
wouldn't be too anti-american coming
into this process we stood together in
bond and then we went back to
Afghanistan to coordinate this new
government few weeks later there was
something called the Carina
a ship that the United States said left
from somewhere in Iran and somehow got
through essentially the American Suez
controlled Suez Canal which never let
Iranian military shipping through before
the overthrow of Mubarak but somehow
this got from Iran with 50 tons of
weapons to go to Gaza to give to our
ephod to use against the Israelis our
thought who the Iranians who Ayatollah
Khomeini had said was not just an idiot
but a traitor for how he dealt with the
Palestinians how we dealt with the
Iraqis how he done with your audience
but somehow the Iranians were giving him
50 tons of weapons going through Suez
which had never allowed Iranian shipping
to go through and eventually essentially
there was an American veto over it
well the Israelis interrogated the
captain so they said and the captain
said that he came from Iran and the
weapons were from Iran to RF I 50 times
they displayed them for the media which
the media dutifully reported well in the
White House David Frum one of the speech
writers said no this is really something
we can connect to Iraq in North Korea
and therefore the axis of evil was born
the axis of evil Iran didn't matter what
they had done in Afghanistan didn't
matter how much they helped us it didn't
matter how constructive how rational how
defensive they were in their foreign
policy national security strategy
because they had to have had to have
sent these 50 tons of weapons to Gaza to
use against Israelis they should be
designated as part of the axis of evil
this was a real lesson for me coming
into in foreign policy I worked on it
for 20 years but to actually work with
Iranians who are working constructively
in defense of their own country working
with the United States I realized that
we can't just work with Iran in issue
specific areas because every time
and we've gone back and researched this
for a book every time whether it was
Lebanon whether it's Bosnia whether it
was Afghanistan every time the United
States pockets what Iran does and
actually because we're embarrassed to
have done business with them we increase
sanctions we increase the threats and we
get closer and closer to conflict the
only real way is a comprehensive
negotiation aimed at acceptance not just
trying to pocket concessions from the
audience one last question
I have the honor my name is Jeff Khalifa
I am a citizen of Syria and I would like
to say it's interesting that you call
your book going to Tehran people Syria
and the Middle East have not only gone
to Tehran they have people have
respected and even served Tehran and all
they saw in response was an outrageous
war bloody war that thought that Iran is
co-leading with with other regional
allies of Assad and it's interesting
that you think that going to Tehran
would reveal that anything different
than the core values that are being the
bloody values are being demonstrated on
the streets of Syria right now
by the Islamic Revolution of Iran I mean
Iran is not only supported Assad with
true with weapons and money they have
actually sent troops to participate in
the killing that's going on in Syria and
there has been a big shift in the last
two years when two years ago people in
the Middle East used to respect and like
Iran the Islamic vision of Iran now Iran
is actually the first enemy is
considered the first enemy of Sunnis who
are the majority in the Middle East and
I don't think it's interesting that you
think that going to finish I'm finishing
this but then if the u.s. goes to Tehran
now we've got come any close to the
support of Arabs it's actually are Arabs
right now especially the Middle East are
so disappointed with the u.s. that it's
not helping bringing those in the sanger
region
of tehran to justice I mean maybe you
don't want to go to war with them but at
least help as a superpower bring them to
justice for after they revealed
themselves and their core bloody values
that the values of the Islamic version
of Toronto thank you thank you question
for professor Chomsky yeah the question
seems to be that that how can we say we
should go to check Ron when Chevron is
perpetrating a bloody war against
Syrians and that in fact will alienate
the United States from from the vast
majority of Sunni Arabs well I don't
agree with you that nobody should come
to the United States but that's what
you're claiming the United States is
carrying out the worst one of the worst
terrorist wars in history all over the
region people here talk about a drone as
something that assassinates a targeted
person
well that's murder but it's much worse
than that if you walk down the street
outside and you don't know whether two
minutes from now a blast is going to
occur across the street from you killing
somebody who's there and anybody who
happens to be standing around if you
have to live with that constantly you're
terrorized a drone is a terror weapon
designed to terrorize the villages
communities and in fact all regions
so where's terrorists war going on
anywhere and that's only the beginning
of it but I don't think that because of
that nobody should come to the United
States whatever you think about Syria
yeah we would have loved to have more
questions from the audience and
responses from our distinguished
panelists but I'm told that we do need
to be in the back from in the session
but I do want to make one other point
and that is that the leverets have
kindly agreed to sign copies of their
book that received the highest
recommendation from
professor Chomsky so you're welcome to
salsa professor Chomsky latest yes and
mr. Chomsky baked this book is out there
too he was too modest to mention that
which also must be Randy and so we
invite you to stop by the tables and
