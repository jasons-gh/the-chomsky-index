on monday night over 2 300 people
packed into the historic riverside
church here in manhattan to celebrate
the 20th anniversary
of democracy now democracy now first
went on the air
on the eve of the 1996 new hampshire
primary the date was february 19
1996 the show began as a radio show on a
handful of stations
today over 5 000 episodes later
democracy now airs on over 1400
public television and radio stations
across the globe
well today we spend the hour airing
highlights from last night's celebration
we begin with noam chomsky
world-renowned political dissident
linguist author institute professor
emeritus at the massachusetts institute
of technology where he's taught
for more than 50 years well i'd
just like to begin by saying a word
about what a
privilege and honor it is
to be able to participate in the
celebration of the remarkable success
of democracy now for these
many years and in particular the
quite astonishing achievements of amy
goodman
juan gonzalez their colleagues
in showing us how we might
aspire to achieve democracy now
it'll be a long struggle and again it's
an enormous pleasure to be able to share
this
occasion with people like harry
belafonte
who has been such an inspiration and
being in the forefront of this endless
struggle
for many hard years and
for the young people among you
a special word you'll be
facing problems that have never
risen in the 200 000 years of human
history
hard demanding problems
it's a burden that you can't ignore
and uh will all
you in particular and all the rest of us
will have to be
in there struggling hard to save
the human species from a pretty grim
fate
well my wife and i happened to be in
europe
on november 8th that fateful day
in fact in barcelona where we watched
the
results come in that had special
personal resonance for me the first
article i wrote or at least that i can
remember it was in
february 1939 uh
at the it was about the fall of
barcelona
to franco's fascist forces and
the article which i'm sure was not very
memorable
was about the apparently inexorable
spread of fascism over europe and
maybe the whole world old enough to have
been able to listen to hitler's speeches
the nuremberg rallies not understanding
the words but the
tone and the reaction of the crowd
was enough to leave indelible memories
and watching those results come in
did arouse some pretty unpleasant
memories
along with what is happening in europe
now
which in many ways is pretty frightening
as well
well the reaction to november 8th in
europe was
disbelief shock
horror it was captured
pretty eloquently in the
on the front cover of the major
german weak lead their spiegel it
depicted a
caricature of donald trump presented as
a
meteor hurtling towards earth
mouth open ready to swallow it up
and the top headline red
thus ended their velt at the end of the
world
small letters below as we have known it
uh there might be some truth to that
concern even if not exactly in the
uh manner in which the uh
the artists
the authors the others who uh echoed
that
uh conception had in mind
it had to do with other events that were
taking place right at the same time
november 8th events that i think were a
lot more important
than the ones that have captured the
attention of the world
in such an astonishing fashion events
that were taking place in morocco
marrakesh morocco there was a
conference there of 200 countries
at the so-called cop22
their goal at this conference was to
implement the rather vague
the promises and commitments of the
preceding
international conference on global
warming
cop 21 in paris in december
2015 which had in fact been left
vague for reasons not unrelated to what
happened on
november 8th here
