just about as I was leaving my house
tonight I picked up a late news report
shall read it's a news release from the
Coalition for justice in Iraq and it's
announcing a press conference at the
United Nations tomorrow calling for an
international tribunal on iraq to indict
those who are responsible for what's
happened there and the principle is they
say that only through the only through
due process and administration of
justice can the wounds of three decades
of oppression begin to heal among the
speakers are going to be the mayor of
halabja to just heard about and a former
iraqi general and that all makes sense
those who are responsible for the
atrocities of the last three decades
should certainly be brought to the bar
of justice they named one of them so I'm
saying the Commission the tribunal as
being they're calling for a tribunal to
indict Saddam Hussein which is fair
enough and would have some moral content
if the list of candidates were broadened
to include his those who've participated
with him and continue to participate
with him in bringing about the
atrocities you've already heard about
some of them I won't elaborate the mayor
of halabja brings to mind the fact but
Howard mentioned that at the time of the
Halabja atrocities and leader atrocities
against the Kurds all of this after the
Iran war the atrocities were being
carried out with the support of George
Bush and Margaret Thatcher to mention
two who are still alive and kicking the
and could easily be brought to trial the
attack on the Kurds in northern Iraq
destroyed large agricultural areas as
well as killing plenty of people
probably tens of thousands that gave the
bush an opportunity to do a favor for a
big us agribusiness he explained to
Congress that we should we had send
extensive credits to Saddam Hussein so
he can purchase agribusiness exports
that's a subsidy from US taxpayers the
US agribusiness to get them to provide
the supply the agricultural needs of
Saddam Hussein and his coterie after
they had wiped out agricultural areas in
Iraq along with gassing Kurdish citizens
and so on the u.s. also and Britain
continue to provide not alone but they
among others continue to provide
dual-use technology which could be an
indeed was used for development of
weapons including weapons of mass
destruction this continued in fact
during the invasion of Panama on
December 1989 Bush took a little time
off to inform Congress that to request
from Congress and to obtain a
substantial new credits for his friends
that I'm Hussein it's a couple of months
before the invasion of Kuwait the forget
who either am Anthony or Howard
mentioned the visit of senators headed
by Bob Dole that was actually in april
nineteen nine
just a couple of months before the
invasion of Kuwait they brought George
Bush's greetings they assure its that
I'm saying that if there was any effort
to impose sanctions on him which would
veto it they told him not to be
concerned about the criticisms he was
hearing it's just that some people in
the media are kind of getting out of
control and the one person on the voice
of America who would dare to criticize
Saddam Hussein had been removed senator
Simpson who's now the head of the
Kennedy School suggested the Saddam that
he invite media people from the United
States over to Iraq to see what a nice
benign government it is this is after
two of the three decades of atrocities
that the Coalition is calling for
indictment for correctly and that
continued up until saddam committed his
first crime the crime has Howard said it
had nothing do with invasions in fact he
was pretty much duplicating what the US
had just done a couple of weeks before a
couple of months before in Panama and
the Bush administration one of the
reasons they were so concerned to evade
diplomatic efforts and they did was as
they said you know chief of staff Powell
and internal discussion said the problem
is that Saddam me withdraw leaving a
puppet regime in place at which point
everyone in the Arab world will be happy
that's what they expected they wanted to
prevent if he had done that it would
have virtually duplicated with the US
had just done in Panama with the one
exception that people in Latin America
or anything but happy about it they were
bitterly angry but other than that it
would have been a duplication so that
suggests a couple other people who
should be brought before the bar of
justice the general the former generals
guests others don't know which generally
is they didn't say but you know maybe he
was one of the rebelling Iraqi generals
from March 90 91 that's after the
Iraq slaughter this is named war when
there was a rebellion in the south she
Bell yin and the United States of course
had total command of the air and
everything else at that point the
rebelling Iraqi generals requested from
the United States from general
Schwarzkopf they wanted to obtain didn't
want help but they wanted access to
captured Iraqi arms that they could use
in their effort to overthrow the tyrant
and carry out a popular revolution that
was refused they were not permitted
access to arms Saddam Hussein was
authorized to use military gunships to
attack the rebels general Schwarzkopf
later said that he was snookered by
Saddam Hussein he didn't realize that if
he authorized helicopters they might
actually be used to bomb the people who
were rebelling the rebellion was crushed
by sbarro was devastated so or other
areas and the Bush administration was
pretty frank about the reasons remember
this is March 1991 after the so-called
war they simply preferred what they
called an iron-fisted Iraqi Hunta to the
threat of a popular revolution and
therefore had to in the name of what's
called stability had to support these
major atrocities in which very possibly
as many or more civilians were killed
and you know were killed during the
bombing the month earlier so that
suggests more people who could be
introduced into the indictment George
Bush and everyone around them and those
in the press who were most of the
commentators who approved of this and
explained what this had to be done
there's more actually just last week
another example came along was reported
in the British press read it it's a a
document was
really that was obtained by a George
Washington University professor who gave
the information or the British press
took the information the documents from
the Defense Intelligence Agency it was
presented internally to the government
was just Declassified it was presented
the day after the bombing began the
document is called Iraq water treatment
vulnerability okay and the document
describes how to an intelligence report
how Iraq had established over the years
it had a difficult water problem but it
had developed a sophisticated system for
providing and treating water which was
now reaching most of the people in the
country with clean potable water but it
was a complicated system and it
therefore could be destroyed leading to
a catastrophe and the document says it
says full degradation full degradation
of the water system probably will take
at least six months they at least six
months at least another six months sorry
full degradation of the water system
will take at least another six months
they had just had one day at it well
they didn't get six months but they got
six weeks and they came reach full
degradation of the water system but
certainly a lot of it as planned the the
bombers destroyed dams water supply
stations sewage stations pumping
stations electrical system all of that
amounts to biological warfare you can
simply ask yourself what would happen if
something comparable was done say in
Boston people would be dying like flies
from disease and starvation and so on
that's that is use of weapons of mass
destruction it's biological warfare with
exactly the catastrophic effect that
they predicted the professor who
released this to the
s only published so far in Britain
suggested not implausibly that that
might be grounds for a trial for
conspiracy to commit genocide and well
that's bush and the implementation of it
is Clinton which suggests more people
who might be brought before the bar of
justice actually that's been proposed
proposed by people who know what they're
talking about Dennis Halladay who was
the first as you I'm sure you know the
first humanitarian administrator of the
UN oil-for-food programme resigned in
protest as did his successor the he has
just recently called for a criminal
trial for Clinton for two on two charges
one week equals genocide another what
Howard mentioned illegally is a force
that is the bombing that is being
carried out its without any
authorization from the Security Council
in fact the December 1998 bombing was
carried out not on violation it was
carried out in contempt of the Security
Council the bombing was actually time so
that it began us British bombing of the
bombing took place just as the Security
Council was meeting in an emergency
session to deal with the question of
Iraq it was very clear and explicit
gesture of contempt that's a war crime
in itself and only one of many one of
the effects the intended and effect of
the bombing which was of course achieved
was to undercut any possibility that
arms inspectors would be permitted in
that was predictive and the consequence
the arms mission had already been very
severely compromised by the fact that
has had recently been exposed it was
being used by the United States for
intelligence purposes was being
subverted under the cover of an arms
inspection mission which I'll
was enough to pretty well ensure that it
would not be permitted so that suggests
further charges that might be added to
the list and in fact it's not very
difficult to go on I'm afraid why so as
far as this Tribunal that's being called
tomorrow is concerned if it is indeed a
calling for if it were it is not calling
for a a tribunal to indict those
responsible for the last 30 years of
atrocities in Iraq there would be fair
number of candidates if it doesn't do
that it's not a Coalition for justice in
Iraq it's a coalition for Victor's
justice in Iraq and that's true of all
the human rights groups who are
participating in it and so on and there
should be no illusions about it well why
are the sanctions being continued
everybody knows what the consequences
are they're attacking the population and
destroying the population and
devastating society and strengthening
Saddam and his circle so why are they
being continued well there I've their
two reasons which are repeated over and
over again essentially without comment
and might as well pay attention to them
the first repeated passionately by
Madeleine Albright Tony Blair other
dignitaries just to be acumen occur
although go to the continent the last
statement of it I've seen a couple
months ago was by the head of the
sanctions committee happens to be Dutch
at the UN Security Council peter van
balsam and he gave the usual line which
reads like this he said that iraq he
said is unique is in a league of its own
it's the only it's the unquote in it
it's the only country that has actually
used weapons of mass destruction against
an enemy and even against its own people
well it's not exactly true you can think
of and think of another country that's
used weapons of mass destruction but
putting that aside it's partly true but
there are words missing namely what
we've all been talking about yes Iraq
used weapons of mass destruction against
an enemy and against its own people with
our support in fact with our
enthusiastic and decisive support I've
seen that argument given over and over I
don't know how many dozen times and
repeated in the press with never a
comment on the missing words which takes
a certain degree of discipline you have
to respect it in addition to the fact
that those missing words and the fact
that there are other countries that have
used weapons of mass destruction there's
another observation highly relevant here
that it was made by too hawkish military
analysts writing in the journal foreign
affairs you know the premier
establishment foreign affairs journal
they pointed out that the sanctions
against Iraq have killed more people
than all weapons of mass destruction in
all of human history put together they
didn't say that in criticism in fact
they added that it was necessary to do
this but if one is concerned with
weapons of mass destruction yes they've
been used we've been using them for the
past ten years it is a form of
biological warfare quite apart from the
bombing and its consequences and that as
as they said has killed more many more
people in fact in all weapons of mass
destruction and history well there's a
second argument that's given the second
argument is that Saddam Hussein could
terminate this regime anytime he wanted
so therefore he's responsible that's
true he could terminate it by committing
suicide for example no other
the arrangements have been set up so
that there's no other way for him to
terminate it I try to think it through
imagine you're Saddam Hussein how could
you terminate the sanctions well if you
consider the position that the United
States has taken very explicitly there's
one way you can commit suicide so yes he
could terminate the sanctions therefore
he's responsible he certainly is a
brutal tyrant and a mass murderer just
as he was when the US was openly
supporting him in fact his major crimes
by far the overwhelming majority of his
crimes were committed during this period
when he was a friend and ally but he
could terminate them so therefore he's
responsible for them so therefore we
have to continue that's the argument the
logic is intriguing since saddam is is
in fact taking actions which are
crushing his population and destroying
the country therefore we have to join
and make sure that they work that's the
logic and that also passes without
comment at least I can't find any
comment I have been able to find any
other arguments those are the two
arguments that are presented they are
they're never criticized it's an
illustration of the astonishing
discipline of the educated classes that
they can repeat this over and over again
without commenting on the significance
of those arguments which hardly needs
comment that's enough to tell us that
something else is involved not this
nothing that's being talked about can
have anything to do with what's going on
well what is going on you can think
about it but one thing you can be
certain of is that it has to do with the
oil regime the only reason for us
concern for things that happen in that
region is that happens that the largest
energy reserves in the world and in the
future those reserves will be even more
important than they are now if current
projections are anywhere near
Iraq is the second largest oil producer
in the world or potentially second
largest reserves in the world after
Saudi Arabia it's a certainty that the
u.s. is not going to allow that source
of energy to get out of its hands the
there's right now lots of criticism
about the French and the Russians for
interfering with what's called breaking
the UN sanctions that actually means
interfering with unilateral us decisions
about how the sanctions should be
applied and they are doing that indeed
there's another way of looking at the
same fact and that is to say that the US
and Britain insist on a form of
unilateral sanctions which the rest of
the UN doesn't and there's something
that lies behind that something
transparent right at the moment France
and Russia had the inside track on
exploiting iraqi oil US and British
corporations don't they are excluded for
the obvious reasons not to go into the
too obvious to comment on and as long as
that remains the case you can be pretty
certain that
that Iraq will not be permitted back
into the civilized world there is in
fact the way in which Saddam could
re-enter the cyst be allowed back into
the system apart from committing suicide
kick out the French and Russian and
Chinese and other oil companies and
allow the US and British companies to
take it over again when that happens the
Iraq will be brought back into the
family of Nations unless actions that
are taken by the American people and
it's primarily their responsibility
decisive and effective and powerful
actions will reverse the course of the
atrocities and terminate them whether
there's a legitimate tribunal to indict
those responsible or not
