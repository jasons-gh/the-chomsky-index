for the excellent presentation first off
after my question I was kind of curious
in light of all the incredible
challenges and impediments looking
forward what do you feel like is the
best approach to change a top-down
approach or an approach from the bottom
kind of using a thorough Ian concept a
state cannot be conscientious but a
state composed of conscientious
individuals will act in a conscientious
manner depends where you are I mean if
you're in Saudi Arabia you can be in
favor of Iran having nuclear weapons but
there's nothing you can do about it it's
a dictatorship us back dictatorship we
don't happen to be in a dictatorship so
there's a lot that we can do from
political action the demonstrations the
organization to rebuilding the labor
movement to endless number of things but
fundamentally the public has to be away
her and organized and active and there
are many ways of doing that happened
often in the past and a lot of effect I
mean this happens to be a kind of a low
point but there have been worse times
before question question I have the mic
here if I might you mentioned
concentrations of power how would you
relate horizon and scope scope duration
expected of stability we expect over a
century over two decades over two years
or the last quarter to the degree of the
concentration of resources wealth power
needed to maintain that in the credible
fashion
ah I need to translate dr. dr. Thompson
mentioned the concentrations of sort of
unconscionable concentrations of power
and I'm asking about how much power is
needed in order to say maintain
stability of an institution from the
country to this university over decades
or even a lifetime or longer and to
relate that not all concentrations of
power are intrinsically bad I don't want
to put words in I want to ask the
question rather than concentrations of
power typically act the way Adam Smith
said they typically work to make sure
that their own interests are peculiarly
attended to however grivas the impact on
others I was hoping to address systemic
risk partly from the systemic risk I
mean what resources are netted nated
necessary to effectively regulate say
systemic risks / infective the nation or
over a century what should be done in
various ways is to diffuse power I mean
as long as you have centralized power
you can be pretty sure it's going to do
things and so on interest which will
only accidentally be in anyone else's
interested so therefore power should be
diffused that's what democracy is
supposed to be about and then I guess it
has been limited now hi excusing we're
faced with this destructive juggernaut
and we there's a growing sense that time
is running short with global warming
corporate control of our government and
other governments and I wonder if you
believe that non-violence is capable a
nonviolent approach is capable of saving
the day or do we need to expand our
strategies to encompass other
tactics well that's now we're back to
Confucius if a nonviolent approach is
not capable of doing it we might as well
kiss each other goodbye because there's
no question that a violent approach
won't work in fact a violent approach
using violence is exactly what systems
of power want you're moving to the arena
where they where they dominate I mean I
remember debating this with kids in the
60s who wanted you were going out to
demonstrations and you know wanted to
wear the helmets because the police are
going to attack and what I argued and I
think is correct is that you shouldn't
and if you wear a helmet they're going
to come back with assault rifles and if
you have an assault rifle they're going
to come back with tanks and if you have
tanks they'll come back with nuclear
weapons I mean force is their strength
the only strength we have is
non-violence and it works in fact if you
take a look at Iraq it's quite a
striking example nobody looks at it this
way but think about it the United States
was defeated in Iraq it was it had to
abandon its war Eames and if you look at
the record step-by-step the United
States had to back down it had to permit
elections which had tried to bar in all
sorts of ways they tried to control the
outcome it couldn't as late as January
2008 that late george bush announced
that air he finally announced the work
by the end they were announcing the war
him specifically explicitly no more
fooling around about democracy and so on
they said the we must have a settlement
in which the United States has freedom
to compare it to carry out combat
operations indefinitely in Iraq and any
settlement must privilege US
corporations for investment
oil I was January 2008 had to back down
on that Forces Agreement back least
formally they back down on it and
Obama's least informally living up to
the bush agreements every step of the
way the Iraqi victory was based on
nonviolent the insurgents were never a
problem the u.s. can kill insurgents
easily you know no matter how many there
are for the same reason I mentioned so
that's okay that's that's the
comparative advantage of a powerful
state but they could not deal with
500,000 people in the streets for tests
you know would cold out by you know
Ayatollah Sistani and so on so step by
step there to back down it ended up with
a us defeat which is quite unusual you
know state this powerful fighting a
non-existent country has almost never
defeated but it was in this case and
it's not the only case I mean if you
look at the achievements of and there
are a lot of achievements of the past
even the past generation civil rights
movement the women's rights the anti-war
movement a lot of things have happened
all non-violently that's the only domain
in which the population can hope to
prevail so going back your question if
non-violence doesn't work well like I
said kiss each other goodbye
and thank you all very much for
attending I'd like to invite you now to
move outside and on two levels there's
food
you
