the ability or the capacity humans have
for self to see you quote people like
John Stuart Mill and and wealth Waldo
Emerson people who are some of the
leading progressives of the time with
moral integrity and you quote them in
Emerson's case advocating invading
Mexico and in Mills case imperialism by
the British in India I'm once no like I
mean it's natural that we look to people
to emulate and to look as as people with
moral integrity do you remember when you
first started reading these philosophers
and uncovering some of their less
altruistic sides so now since childhood
it's hard to read anything seriously and
not to realize that the people you're
reading however much you admire them are
human beings with and we all have
failings and the failings often derive
from
just general assumptions of the time
that people can't extricate themselves
from we all will surely know this from
our own experiences and it's hard to
learn it's hard to learn about yourself
so for example one many examples but one
pretty striking array of experiences
from the late 60s was I had to do with
resistance against the war in Vietnam
the kids who were resisting we're facing
we're making very difficult choices
you're an 18 year old kid you decided
okay I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna ruin my
life I'm gonna go to jail I'm gonna go
into permanent exile I'll never see my
parents again my friends but I have to
do it because it's right
and if you want to be able to do that
you have to be able to convince yourself
that you're morally upright
that's justified then people tried to do
it but you have to recall that that was
the just the bare beginnings of the
feminist movement and inside the
resistance organizations of course there
were women but the women were expected
to be servants they brought out the food
you know took the notes of the men did
the important things and the early
stirrings of the feminist movement and
among young people began with the
raising of consciousness that this is a
form of oppression we don't have to
accept it well at that point young men
who were in fact facing extremely
dangerous and difficult decisions
somehow had to come to the terms with
the fact that they had never faced which
they had never faced that they too are
oppressors and that's hard and it was
true for them particularly because of
the extreme situation they were in but
was true for everyone men just had never
thought about the fact that they were
oppressors in fact women had never much
thought about the fact that they were
oppressed and when these things break
into consciousness you get a new
perspective on yourself and it can also
often be pretty distressing and that's
true all through life the people you
mentioned you know if if they were alive
today and you could bring their words to
them they'd be shocked how did you have
any experiences yourself having to
confront some I mean you say how hard it
is to look at ourselves honestly in the
mirror were there any experiences you
yourself faced in in confronting your
actions and and I guess your your
thoughts well that was one everyone went
through that I was involved with the
resistance of course I was old I was
technically a draft resister but too old
to be draft but I was very much involved
with all this we all had to face it we
faced it in the
distant support groups that we were
taking chances we were I mean I came
pretty close to the long jail sentence
it was possible for all of us so there
were chances but we realized that this
point that the resistance support group
were almost entirely men and the lead
positions were almost entirely men
didn't have to be but they were and we
all had to come to terms with this but
there are many other cases I mean I
recall I'll tell you another experience
which stuck out my mind back in the
early 60s I went to a civil rights
demonstration down in the South Jackson
Mississippi it was pretty brutal
State Police beaten people bloody
driving up to the states of the Federal
Building you know a very moving
experiences in the evening and black
churches where people were trying to
regain their courage and companionship
altogether an extremely moving
experience a couple of weeks later I
happened I was teaching a summer summer
school in Indiana it was and I was
walking across you know nice campus
summer everybody cheerful I was walking
across campus and ran into a kids who
had met down in the demonstration and we
talked little and we just walked across
the campus together and quietly and all
of a sudden he turned to me and he said
looking he said
talking to the other plenty of other
students around he said how can they be
so interested in phonemes meaning how
can they be working so hard on narrower
technical questions when this is going
on right before their eyes and that's it
and it's true how can you be but we do
it all that time and we have to face it
all the time if we're honest right this
minute
and it's a hard it's a hard realization
and it keeps coming back so did that
have an effect on you like was this
before you had dedicated to yourself
consciously to becoming an activist well
first of all I never I mean that goes
back to childhood I was just an activist
long before I got to college you know
that was in very in you know it's
different things in the 1930s and 1940s
during the 50s I've kind of dropped out
for a while I was at college I was
married and had kids family you know got
a job which I never expected to get and
it was a pretty passive period nothing
much was going on things should have
been going on there's a lot of awful
things happening but nobody much was
paying attention to him I'm even South
Vietnam I'm at the time to get involved
and active protest against the war in
Vietnam would have been maybe early 50s
not early 60s I was much too late by
then maybe 80,000 people have been
killed all kind of atrocities and so on
but in the early sixties I came back
into it again mostly the theme and iwere
movement partly civil rights later other
things so it was it was revival not not
beginning and when I got back into it I
I did think about it I mean I I knew
enough from experience to know this is
not the kind of thing you can put one
foot in and then walk away if you get
involved it's going to get deeper and
were compelling it'll draw you away and
a lot of things and my life in which I
was like that like my work I like
teaching here had a family little kids
everything looked nice no but I said
you know you have to make a choice
because once you get into this it's so
it's gonna drag you farther and farther
which is true does one of the things
that personally is an example of that is
you know I can watch talks or watch
documentaries and think about things
like global warming and all these big
issues confronting our times and then
sort of racket it to one side of my mind
and then continue moving on because it's
I think that's what stops a lot of us
from getting involved because the
implications would be that we would have
to drop everything if these things
really were as dire as but of course you
know even the most dedicated people have
to do that I'll tell you another
anecdote mature mind this is from India
I was in India I know if you've been
there but I mean it's just a traumatic
experience there's a lot of wealth a lot
of vitality a lot of excitement and
miserable poverty which you just can't
miss it's all around you one time a
couple years ago I happened to be there
and I was driving in New Delhi to a
demonstration where I was going to get
the talk and another person was in the
car with me a woman who was also going
to give a talk there she's a woman who
had had taught in the university she was
at a university position but she left
and in order to go live in a poor
village in one of the poorest areas
Rajasthan where she lived in a hut and
what we would call describable
conditions of working mainly on women's
issues and I think she'd been there
about 17 years by then so a really
dedicated person throughout her life
into it I noticed as we were driving
through this when you drive through a
city as soon as the car stops there's a
horde of miserable people who come
asking for a you know
we'll be up any you know showing a gypsy
woman with a starving child you know
every are you can think of and she told
me right away don't give anyone anything
because once you do you can't make any
dent anyway and once you do it just get
them out but as we drove I noticed that
she wasn't looking out the window and I
asked her you know I asked her well how
do you live with all this and she said
the only way you live is not looking
you can't look and survive so you have
to somehow ward yourself off just in
order to keep going and this is a person
who had dedicated her life at a level
that you almost never see but she's
right we all have to do it you can't
survive otherwise but it's easy to the
bracketing so it's necessary in some
sense but it's very easy to overdo it
like take global warming but you
mentioned I mean that's a really dire
catastrophe a Canada right now is on the
verge of destroying civilization
it's almost literally true if Canada
proceeds with tar sand development in
Alberta the effects could be really dire
if Obama approves the XL pipeline which
will then accelerate the tar sands
development and that continues the
effects on human life could be really
severe how much is being done about it
well you can tell me and it's this is
not small it's not like stopping a war
across the ocean is very important but
destroying human civilization is more
important and it's and that your choices
are right before us and you know very
well how people are dealing with it all
of us and for Canada it's particularly
important
one thing you point out is that after
talks dealing with activists and in
developed nations like can in the u.s.
you often get the question well what can
I do
whereas when you go to to developing
nations like Colombia or you talk to the
Kurds and in Turkey they don't ask you
what to do they tell you what they're
doing just came back from Turkey and the
same thing I was there happened to be
there this time partly for protests
about repression of Kurds but the main
invitation was for a talk at a memorial
for an assassinated journalist the front
think been assassinated a couple years
ago too because he was exposing Armenian
atrocities a century ago which really
broke it was probably the government was
behind his assassination it's kind of
obscure but that's what it looks like
anyway it was a bad call because the
assassination aroused enormous concern
and an involvement and so for example at
this memorial there was also a huge
demonstration of people going through
Istanbul big demonstration at the site
of the assassination people really
engaged there's been a lot of further
exposure of what happened the efforts to
try to overcome some of them reach the
rehabilitating rebuilding destroyed
churches and things and vote and I was
talking mainly to activists people were
there but but and these are and you know
being an activist in Turkey is a lot
harder than in Canada or u.s. it's a
pretty repressive state and there's a
lot of state violence this it has for
example more journalists in jail than
any other country in the world the world
champion it's increasing but they're
very very courageous they're energetic
they they want to talk to you about
their doing and how you can help and
that's moral for us it's easy and we're
very privileged
there's some repression but my
comparative standards we live in very
free societies and there isn't a lot
that the government can do to you
especially if people like us you know
who are part of the privileged sector we
go to college you know that sort of
thing and there's just endless
opportunities I mean I just mentioned
one tar-sands but can go on listing and
you know or others can you take me back
to your own evolution when you were
becoming more active and decided to that
you would have to jump in fully to
activism in politics I guess how
conscious was the decision and what
stopped you from doing it earlier I mean
were you worried about being a rabble
rouser when you're a professor and
giving up the comforts I came along with
your life as a linguistics professor I
was very conscious I thought about it
seriously
I mean I wasn't giving up my life I
continued to teach you know I wasn't
giving up my family spent time with the
kids but it's you know it's facing risks
I know soon within about seven or eight
years I was actually facing a long jail
sentence which I didn't anticipate
specifically but for what for organizing
resistance which was you know
technically illegal can't say it was
repression was this not paying taxes not
paying taxes I started earlier in the
year around 1965 I guess and that could
have led and sometimes does lead to the
government reaction most of the time
they just take the money basically but
they support for draft resistance was
more serious you know that meant openly
defying Lee openly defying laws
regardless crucial and I wasn't any
means the only one to do it but I was
called the Spock trial one of the big
trials was it I was an unindicted
co-conspirator and was his name this
the person who would be indicted in the
next trial
mostly the trials were kind of a joke
they didn't know what they were doing
but it was serious enough so that we had
three kids but then my my wife went back
to school after about a 16 year gap plus
we figured she I left it take care of
the kids and but it's you know it's not
like facing repression in a country like
Turkey
we shouldn't exaggerate it's like a good
jail you're not gonna be tortured for
example and at first there were the
early stages there was really not much
to do support for the war was just
overwhelming I mean the first talks I
gave we're literally in people's living
rooms or in a church with four people or
something in fact the first efforts to
have demonstrations public
demonstrations here in Boston which is a
pretty liberal City
we're just smashed by counter
demonstrators there is a place in Boston
for demonstrations that Boston Common
traditional place for public speaking is
kind of Hyde Park and London that sort
of thing and our first public
demonstration there we planned for I
came is October 65 it's about four years
after the war started into the South
Vietnam was already half destroyed but
it was broken up violently with a strong
support of the liberal press supporting
the smashing up of the demonstration a a
couple of years later that it continued
like that but a couple of years later
developed into a mass movement by 68 67
and 68 it was substantial popular
movement what was the reaction of your
fellow colleagues at MIT and professors
I mean you're right that there isn't
many risks that go along with becoming
involved with politics and activism here
in American and can
but it seems that as you point out the
higher more prestige and more
recognition you've gone from the system
the because you have something to lose
in just a sense of respect from your
colleagues it seems almost harder to to
give that up and I see there was plenty
support I mean not you know small
minority the faculty were also seriously
involved in fact oddly enough a--they
the library was where the department was
electronics lab was a hundred percent
supported by the three armed services i
was the main academic centers of any war
resistance practically you know the
proper the whole faculty was even at
either involved or sympathetic student
body to and others around the college so
it wasn't you know not everyone
participated directly but was a fair
amount of sympathy a lot of antagonism
but okay live with that so you didn't
suddenly lose respect if your colleagues
or anything like that many yeah many
because they just don't see why you're
wasting time like this it's different in
different countries i remember kind of
one country this kind of interesting
stir pan when they're fairly regularly
since the early 60s and there the there
was there was an activist fairly
militant group but it just wasn't the
kind of thing to do like the
universities didn't do things like that
I remember Japan was one of the few
countries I went to till recently where
I wasn't asked to give political talks I
was asked to give technical talks on the
radio of newspapers at general audiences
and so on which was okay and I was
occasionally asked to give a talk but it
was usually by expatriates from
Australia
and I remember one talk I gave to this
must be the mid-eighties probably about
Central America or something like that
was a couple of Japanese professors came
and they came mainly because they were
curious as to why I was spending time on
things like massacres and torture and
terror when I could have been writing a
technical paper on some problems that
came up and footnote 4 of the latest
that's the the inverse of this young guy
I mentioned to you at the summer school
in the early sixties and that's that's a
pretty that's a pretty standard attitude
if quite apart from not liking what
you're doing because people tend more or
less reflexively to support the crimes
of their own state that's why they're
mostly unknown so for example literally
unknown I'm this very very rarely a poll
asking people to assess say the number
of people killed in Iraq or Vietnam or
something but when the polls are taken
the results are utterly shocking the
tiny fraction of the reality because
people just have no sense of it it's
just too easy to protect yourself from
you don't want to know things like that
you might know about a particular
atrocity that makes the news you know
belie of a grave but not not that these
things are just footnotes to much worse
atrocities what sort of advice would you
give to someone just trying to grapple
with how the world really works and how
power works when faced with the fact
that you know the New York Times doesn't
necessarily talk about the crimes of the
West whereas all the crimes of who knows
who Cuba or things like that get a lot
of play how do you start digging I don't
know if you can see a painting that's
half hidden back there but if you look
at the painting afterwards you'll see
it's it's a painting of
the truth that depicts Archbishop Romero
who was assassinated while reading Mass
the Angel of Death hovering over him a
six murdered Jesuit priest slept deeply
leading Latin American intellectuals
their housewife and her daughter very
graphic I'll show it to you later if
anything like this was 1989 it was the
end it's sort of almost brought to the
to an end a bitter violent us war
against the church in Latin America and
that's not an exaggeration started with
Vatican two Pope Ratzinger who just
retired today every yesterday he
announced his resigned he was fighting
the war from the Vatican side he was the
enforcer for the Vatican but the US Army
was doing it on the American side and
they're proud of it so if you read the
talking points for the School of the
Americas which trains Latin American
officers they announced that they are
with pride that the US Army helped
defeat Liberation Theology Liberation
Theology was a movement which really
took off in 1962 when john xxiii vatican
ii tried to transform the church back to
what it had been before it was taken
over by the roman empire in the fourth
century the church and persecuted not
the persecutors and that had a big
effect in latin america priests bishops
laypeople went out to bring the message
of the Gospels to poor people
preferential option for the poor the
Gospels was kind of a radical pacifist
document people read the words but they
don't think about it and that set off
the Vatican repression and the much more
violent u.s. repression leading
culminating pretty much in that
almost unknown well if anything remotely
like that had been going on saying
Eastern Europe the non it would ever
would know about it we could have had
nuclear war but when it's going on under
our eyes and we're doing it you don't
see it I presume it's barely known in
Canada but on the anniversaries of say
the assassination of the archbishop or
the Jesuit intellectuals there'll be a
commemoration in Boston but usually in a
church and a poor neighborhood
noth-nothing Harvard Square so how do we
besides just I mean when there's so
little information out there about the
crimes that we do the information we can
get the information but it's alternative
I guess you have to work and it's not
going to be in the headlines like the
headlines about the Pope today and the
articles they may be a word about how he
was opposed to liberation theology but
you ever going to find anything about
what I just described but the
informations there
I mean people write about it the
original documents are there we kept we
can claim that it's work to get
information but not that we can't get it
okay Penn & Teller it occurs to you
about there is a difference it has to
occur to you after you Kerdi is there's
a problem otherwise you don't look and
most of the time it's easier just to
listen everything's okay I'm the same is
true one I mean even things like the
fate of the species let's go back to the
tar since again
you know really major issues are at
stake like the fate of the human species
but it's much easier to pretend I don't
know anything about it I find myself
avoiding about articles in the paper
yeah it's painful to know and if you
don't it's a little bit like this Indian
woman looking out the window if you look
at the window you've got to do something
about it that's hard I know you don't
dwell on spiritual or psychological
explanation
of how power works and why we do what we
do but it seems that the root of what
you're talking about in many ways is
first a need to let go of our attachment
to both our ego and I guess our
attachment to our pride of state or a
pride of group could you talk about that
I don't think there's anything profound
to say I think it's pretty clear what it
is I mean we all have some of us really
suffer but not you and me and the people
we know we have a fairly decent lives
you know do a lot of things we like to
do a lot of words in it and so on work
we like you know people we like and so
on and it's it's just easier not to face
the kinds of realities which would lead
us to giving it up even in part so what
do you draw you close the window we do
it all the time
and as I say at some level you couldn't
survive if you didn't do it like the
woman at the car and they're doing she
does it I respect that she has to do
otherwise be no way for her to survive
but for most of us we close the window
much too early and were like these
people that young man and Indiana was
referring to rather work on a technical
problem one thing that you always talked
about or point out when people ask
certain questions about ask for advice
on how to do this or how to best achieve
change is that there's no magical answer
there's no easy solution people want the
quick fix but what it really takes is
years of boring work and dedication to
organizing and protest and an education
and things like that things that aren't
necessarily sexy are exciting not you
know they can be exciting but the point
is they're not going to give instant
gratification they'll be you can make
efforts sometimes to succeed partially
there will be a reaction you'll lose and
you go on I mean take what's happening
right now and say yeah gypped in Tunisia
those two uprisings were extremely
important historical events I mean there
have been major achievements on the
other hand they've been huge for headers
they're now at a stage where might all
collapse the chaos in the streets in
both Cairo and Tunis
nobody knows Richmond nobody can even
think of a simple solution it seems to
essential that we deal with sort of the
uncertainty that we don't know if our
efforts are going to be successful or
not and we don't know what's going to
actually work the only thing we know
with complete come a lot of confidences
and we don't do anything things will get
worse is that what keeps you going I
guess just knowing that things can't
change but you don't know when or how
yeah you never know when or how I mean
take say the Occupy movement I mean if I
had been asked one week a day before the
Zuccotti Park encampment I'd have said
it's a waste of time
because it couldn't possibly work I was
totally wrong it sparked a mass popular
movement you could say the same about
Taher square they'd go back to 1960 a
couple of kids and students black
students in Greensboro North Carolina
decided to sit in a lunch counter of
course they were arrested brutalized and
all could have been the end of it but it
turned out others came and pretty soon
you had people riding freedom buses
pretty soon you had mass marches did
demonstrations ultimately there were
achievements achievements are limited so
there were achievements I mean it was
undoubtedly the civil rights struggle
had major lasting achievements on the
other end if you take a look at the
african-american population in the
United States they're about as bad off
as they were then and then she's just
enough I mean you're in your 80s and you
maintain a schedule that would tire most
thirty worlds year
constantly answering emails you're
flying across the world you're giving
interviews so what personally keeps you
going then just in the face of having to
deal with and talk about things like the
essential end of the species because the
alternative is totally unacceptable so
do what you can do and you've already
going into cynicism just by the cases
where things have changed part and you
avoid cynicism by just seeing how things
have in fact changed over the years no
cynicism is a kind of an evasion we
should face face the world realistically
there's a lot of unpleasant things what
it's not a base for cynicism it's
basically we're doing work professor

so it's first of all the Annette the
brazen announcement of this but then the
implementation of it I mean there were
number of reasons for invading Iraq but
one reason it was widely recognized I
think correctly that one reason was just
to illustrate that when we say we are
going to attack anyone we want without a
pretext we'll do it and we don't care
what you think so it was that you recall
that right after the strategy was
announced the Bush administration
including Colin Powell the so-called
moderate informed the Security Council
very clearly that you can as they put it
be relevant and endorse what we're going
to do anyway so you can put your
meaningless stamp of approval on it if
you want or else you can be a debating
society you can talk to each other but
we're going to go ahead anyhow and in
fact very dramatically on the there was
a two days before the invasion there was
a summit meeting of bush and Blair and
Eisenhower I suppose was there to wash
the dishes or something and they met in
the Azores an American military base and
the reason I had to meet the air is they
had to keep themselves very far away
from any human beings it's like the
World Trade Organization meeting in Doha
you know so they

the distinction between old and new
Europe that was a main theme of the
early part of the year old Europe
Germany and France
are the bad guys the ones we hate and
revile new Europe are Berlusconi and
eiszner and the former Russian
satellites who we admire for their
marvellous achievements what's the
criterion that distinguishes new Europe
from old Europe well it was absolutely
clear and definitive old Europe the bad
people were the countries where the
government's took the same position as
the overwhelming majority of their
population new Europe were the countries
where the government's overruled an even
larger proportion of their population
the criterion was absolutely explicit
you couldn't say more dramatically I
hate and despise democracy maybe the
most extreme

fact the best example to my knowledge is
the Spanish revolution in 1936 and in
fact we can't tell what would happen
that anarchist revolution was simply
