well today we have the enormous honor honor presence of intellectual chomsky 
US linguist, philosopher, political scientist and activist was born in 1928 from 
1945 studied linguistic and mathematical philosophy at the University of 
Pennsylvania received his doctorate in 1955 after undertaking the major 
part of his research at Harvard University in 998 
received the honorary doctorate in linguistics from the rovira university and 
virgili and received this same distinction in numerous universities throughout the 
world the work and life done and we can 
divide into two large planes not obviously separated but are 
related because it is always positioned against the structures of 
power and oppressor of the dominant groups either in the theoretical plane 
philosophical as well as political one has to do with the field of linguistics and 
the other with his political commitment and activism against US policies in 
1907 with only 29 years jones who revolutionized the field of linguistics 
history with his theses on logical structures of theories 
linguistics would not be published until 1975 his linguistic and psychological theory 
derived from central assumptions of structuralism as well as of psychology 
behaviorism with typical forgiveness noam chomsky became interested in politics very 
early age stimulated by the free readings and guides of the 
Spanish anarchists exiled in New York 
defines himself as a supporter of the anarchist tradition especially of 
the labor orientation current of anarchism anarcho-syndicalism and is 
member of the famous American and revolutionary union east 
www.cristinaonline.com and 967 when it began its inclusion in activism 
politician totally opposing the participation of the United States in the war of 
vietnam from this he produced his essay book entitled the responsibility of 
intellectuals for which he obtained great recognition is associated with the law 
new left and was therefore arrested several times for his activism 
against the war although he has published numerous books and articles against 
neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization imposed by the US as another 
great work of the North American intervention what he has asked 
United States and Canada lift economic sanctions imposed Cuba and 
Venezuela so we are beyond proud 
to have this great intellectual and thinker of reference throughout the world in our 
dear sancho and ezequiel 
attention for 
is in question world of all the question forums 
and that it is important to note that the focus of everything is currently on the 
the issue of the pandemic and therefore the crucial question that people ask is 
how the pandemic is going to change everything from this great event 
three questions 
then 
He is an expert in pandemics such as the projectiles of 23 teachers of Federico 
sanchez in the index impressions was the next a robot awards and things 
[Music] first the question would be for 
what is a pandemic after all is important the crucial thing now is to find 
the reason for its origin since it was predicted in 2003 
after the sars case that was so serious then scientists are 
predicting a similar event due to global warming 
factors that led from blatantly to each other 
but it is not, they are not new god 
extreme football waner libertadores water black white

There are basically three factors that have led us to this situation in the 
2003 it was understood that it was very possible that this happened and there was the knowledge 
to deal with it however currently knowledge is not what 
enough and someone has to be willing to act on this 
So what do we mean by big pharmaceuticals that are governed by 
a logic of capital that if something is not profitable or cannot be voted on 
profit because it simply cannot be developed or should not exist 
oops 
that's the problem 
if drugs companies pharmaceutical companies 
they are being excluded due to this logic of capital 
The obvious alternative is the government that counts for the resources and thus has the 
means to develop this profitable solution that is not rigid by capital 
However, there is therefore this neoliberal thought that, taking it to 
to the presentation of former president reagan 
in which he simply said that the government is the problem that cannot be 
leave things in the hands of the government so we have this limitation 
also by the government game 
[Applause] 
issues 
basic adherents 
the replay 
the worst of Greece 
for ever ready 
if you feel ahead because I feel that way that private companies 
are excluded due to the logic of capital and the government is excluded by 
the logic of liberalism then as how governments can react 
Faced with this reality, the cases are known, China reacted by producing 
own medicine in search of the solution in his vaccine just like the 
countries of east asia oceania also the response of other countries 
varied however, since other slow forms such is the case of in the 
western hemisphere usa and brazil emblematic in their reaction to the case 
of the pandemic 
it's me with a glass globe 
chris ware 12 
beijing

tucker 
in the case of the countries of the hemisphere where things where they can 
call from outside or outside the reaction are those countries in which things 
are out of control and these two are countries that are led by fans 
extremists where they are willing to open the economy 
In search of profit and power we can mention for example the case of works 
Now in Brazil, the numbers are very high in deaths from the pandemic 
because simply his answer was who cares in the case of the 
president of trump in the us seeing the numbers so high just what 
He said it was then that the tests were stopped so that they would not have us more 
cases these are the countries where 
things are a little out of control or not at all 
on the balance sheet 
laughs 
Wow 
then the world awaits us after the pandemic in the case of the most 
powerful in the history of the United States as the president of Trump said that in 
February when he produces his new annual budget he will continue 
withdrawing its fund from all international initiatives of 
development of some and that it will then continue to provide funds for everything 
what is the militarist initiative and nuclear weapons 
in a nutshell [Music] 
lesson 
of is 
[Music] 
2 reuters 
in a theme a theme that unifies everything that refers to the new proposal 
first of all destroy the US budget system 
health for people for the simple fact of not being profitable so it can 
Therefore, it does not make sense, we will have a center to control 
diseases are still planted for the public and return to subsidize from a 
open way all that is seeking 
fossil energy as part of making the capitalist initiative profitable 
also the regulation of environmental controls and this must be 
highlight the malicious nature of this mentality in removing all 
the regulations on air quality controls in the environment in 
full pandemic of a health nature where health is greatly affected if 
these industries are active and pollute the air more than 
which is already part of the condition of 2019 and delays the 
If you allow me, is to add that the important thing there is what the doctor says 
Chomsky is that reducing regulations to 
Pollution controls did so at this time under the mask of 
that the economy was going to be reactivated if there were regulations, the 
economy is not why it is the malicious character they hide behind the 
reactivation of the economy and thus seek to justify what they are 
politics the one that is moving thanks 
this [Music] 
efe 
[Music] 
oops 
[Music] 
from saint marc 
just 
so the media have described the cuts destroy the world where you kers 
if there are really two elements that it is important to highlight that we already mentioned 
the subsidy to everything that the fossil industry because in the destruction of the 
public health systems and the increase in the military budget and give 
that last blow to the remnants the gun control plan that had 
evident for 30 years which all translates into new contracts for the 
government because the new countries would 
also as a means of continuing to direct public funds to large 
arms industries and thus leading us to a new nuclear race and a 
weaponry again

If there are some basic principles of this neoliberal doctrine, we must take 
in consideration above all because greed greed and 
Apart from that, the goals of that greed, where does it lead us? 
the corporate guru as he simply stated it by explaining that 
It seeks to expand the profits for the members of private these these new 
government owners at the time leaders like Thatcher and Reagan 
simply because they expressed the need for private sectors to have the 
control of the economy and it is understood that Karl Marx in the 16th century his 
criticism of converting this intention to convert the population into simple 
sacks of potatoes is inhabitants and in this more modern era the minister of brazil 
simply good talks about the fact that there is a whole private structure within the 
government I don't know if you want to add something louis

then the main thought or the main slogan below the government 
except when we need it and it tells us to look for other 
mechanisms to protect ourselves and we have a very important lesson from this 
pandemic which is that the result of the following that there is state violence 
more economic plans that is the same as I wish occurred in Austria between the 
two great wars in the 20th century komen doctor chams that there is something to rafael 
that it seems important to me when teaching it that the idea of 
neoliberalism is to remove the government from the center, but control is the hands 
of individuals but simply when they need the government they use it 
new to protect them that is why he says that neoliberalism and 
violence the state goes hand in hand as is happening at the moment no 
There was the very strong economic crisis that we are still in, we have not come out of it 
and what the businessmen and senators did 
Both Democrats and Republicans wrote trillions in money to the 
entrepreneurs to regain that power that control they had was not 
they want the government does not work but they use it when they need to rebuild

and in this 
6 
one way 
if he is the main idea or what moves 
really because this movement of change can really lead to 
exemplify it through the case of austria in the 20th century 
because it was a moment in which although a strong movement was led 
which was destroyed was economic forces to make way for 
new to new forms of government such as fascism such as that of mussolini 
it can be said that the establishment of these friendly dictatorships of good 
intentions because in many cases it was said that they were the ones that saved 
europe at the time 
efe 
I'm going to take I describe take 
name is it you 
Well, to do it in a fairly simple way if we go to the pages 
web of the institution fan gleizes we need to understand that many of the 
things that are explained there after saving civilization because 
important is to save 
the structures not the people the important thing is 
the collective in its logic if not but but in the idea that 
added in that web page is that people were told at those times where 
they were destroying governments like the Austrian Social Democrat who 
after saving society from the black shirts who were kind of 
clothing worn by those who supported those fascist dictatorships were 
to return and they will disappear from the scene no and unfortunately we gave ourselves

the one with the sun

Nine dollars 
I don't know why [Music] 
because there is a compromise it could be called that this neoliberalism 
somehow it will bring violence as in the case of Chile for 
identify cliche cases without going into more detail 
since the structure chambers and the money of foreign investors and 
the geese therefore caused the Chilean industry to change 
However, by ignoring the anxiety of priman completely no 
they privatized the copper industry, which we know that somehow 
helped anyway in 1982 it should be remembered that there was a destruction 
total of its economy which is what in the end then causes all this

working 
as soon as this neoliberal experiment had problems, there was a 
establishment of a system that we know prevailed for 40 years with the 
doctrine of wigan and touch has caused enormous instability 
suffering and discomfort worldwide due to the way in which the 
same

and luis huerta also and for and for also for the translation 
so we are doing there is a louis couple who watched the truth is that this 
Rafael is great the price added what I think may be an importer was 
of perfect context 
we continue 
Okay 
hc we see with concern that all genders in davos switzerland are therefore 
concern of these elite groups of the world because in their private environments 
where they argue for 40 years they have held hegemony in the past 
January there was concern due to the follow-up of a nuisance at the 
world against capitalism and as it would be a new issue the issue was the 
development of new companies that work in a more humane way in which 
propose to privatize everything for the benefit of humanity this is the 
new we could say doctrine 
so if it is something that seems important than we authorize it to be 
pointing out is that generally in each year they met in Switzerland in a resort 
to ski and all that what the people of the capital met and congratulated each other 
each other to point out how well they were doing in their driving the 
world in fact are excellence for the owners of the world of the universe but 
that this year in January was different because they started talking about 
concern that they had as the masters of the universe for the resistance 
social uprisings that people were doing against the 
capitalism as a system, not for that reason what Rafael says very rightly that 
recognized that for 40 years mistakes have been made and that they were going to be now 
now more this humanitarian companies not that they were going to work for the people 
take descriptions that order 
we had the story before exteriors igal our activity repression rating of

is prohibited 
are corrected 
if I wanted to refer to a term 
because if going to history 60 years ago 
companies changed them throughout this long period of time when 
his thinking dominated approximately these 40 years and they were perfected because 
somehow his way of selling himself to the public then this term 
software human embeddings 
to companies with the human being in the middle or in the 
center of its activity because it is like a proposal that 
they had originally made and that they are going to take it again they have wanted to sell that 
to be retaken they are going to rule the world putting people at the center to 
your personal benefit they will offer you that you will have a role in everything else 
however they will dominate what is in the end the internal and something to 
point out is that this story was told 60 years ago in 1960 when the 
capitalism was emerging again with great force after the 
Second world war we were told that companies were that kind of 
concern for people did not work for people etc have not passed 60 
years and now what the Swiss have mentioned they worried because the 
people were resisting capital so now they told us again 
account are going to be human enterprises like you said that they are worried that 
people are well participate etcetera etcetera but but the doctor says we raise 
that we are going to wait another 60 years to realize that what happens 
same then the state repeating that in reality the data are the facts that 
we see are not important or do not take them into consideration

2 letting the crisis arm the lord of 
plan give me is to collect the crises so today the new mistress has come through the black 
yes this is very important to make an illustration of three major themes that 
we are living the first is that we are in a crucial moment 
capitalism is fighting a very tough class struggle 
in a way that ensures that the post-pandemic world is a world 
totally according to his vision and second this represents a possible end of the 
organized movement a social movement organized for reasons 
quite obvious and thirdly because there is a crisis 
that will also be intensified by the hammer of the 
capitalism in the same way and I would like to add how important 
It is the vision that the chamos share with us that what the world will be like after 
what happens in this pandemic is a great question is very important because because 
capitalism at this time as illustrated when he said remove the 
regular regulations here in the United States for example in the middle of the pandemic that will 
help production for example oil companies companies 
that companies that extract fossils from fossil energy and it is a class struggle 
what is he doing against people all over the world and then what will happen 
if they really succeed if the neoliberal system 
triumphs when the pandemic passes because they right now as they do in the 
doctrine of shock 'which I believe that somehow we have 
heard what happens when that will shake what the system does at this time 
we are under the pandemic but capitalism is acting the 
neoliberalism is pushing to remove all regulations and it will come 
a time when if they succeed they will continue to make excessive profits 
all that greed and there will come a time when it will put us in a 
instance where we are at the point of the destruction of human life from 
democratic societies as we know them 
racing meters this means two achievements or the new 
opportunities this opportunity because it is we can work to order will rest ruiz 
Ternitz raids football no temple and wish road production 
To conclude, this is a moment of historical significance where there is a 
great opportunity also to focus on the human being their needs their 
rights and not only in the profit and the obtaining of returns 
to put it this way and because at the same time we 
presents great challenges as Rafael mentioned it is a historic moment 
It also gives us opportunities and we should think about the possibility of 
build in this case on the social resistance that is emerging 
in many countries of the world even here in this country in the usa many people from 
power I'm like in a trance I'm in shock I don't know how to describe it because people 
he is protesting he is moving he is articulating he is acting 
jointly and that did not happen then that is the opportunity for example that 
Dr. Sessions points out that because if we can take advantage of this moment that 
we are living with resistance in the system we can get to establish 
better a new social order where the needs of beings are important 
humans not just corporate profits 
what fernando 
do your good 
ok fernando, in 5 minutes he has to go to 
another interview very good in condition for questions but 
maybe in a dialogue we can get him out of the bar then congratulate and 
thank or insane this conference the proposal now of this cycle the other 
politics is also in asking some questions if we can 
go quickly to the questions and thank Rafael Cardenas teacher of the 
english department at the university of panama public selector and doctoral student 
humanities and social sciences panama university y les guardas 
marry them associate professor of critical couples and multiculturalism who 
was doing this translation and we can move on to the questions all three 
questions that we had of slow light and we are each the word is to educate 
popular and hungary dora and history teacher of the institute left with joaquin 
gonzalez argentina member of the cooperative of educators and mentors 
Well, historical llc, sorry for interrupting that Professor Chomsky 
has to go in five minutes well then I don't know if it would be 
good to say goodbye to thank him and between us to handle the questions of 
the participants I don't know why he won't be there longer but I do think and 
if suddenly a final message ask the teachers for a message and with that 
those audiences does if it is a final message from Dr. Chams that for the 
teachers from Latin America and around the world 
you mean terraces 
big benefits

in this 
racing 
the expert the com 
rising risk observed band mix we know where you guys and william a 
waiting 
2 discreet is serious 
[Music] 
question 
there luis if you can translate 
if it is not saying as a final message it is that we are living in a moment 
unique historical and that some of the things have to be resolved by 
example the great risk that still exists with the pandemic that is active 
I still eat like affecting a lot of the world's population 
we have another big risk another big threat is the environmental crisis that follows 
deteriorating and continues to generate many problems at the world level and the other is 
the risk or threat that exists with the issue of nuclear war not because 
investment that is being made at the moment especially in this country but 
he says the essence of hope we have time but not much 
actually say a couple of decades to decide what kind of world we're going to have 
or how are we going to change the world we have 
louis ask him if you can do it just a final greeting to close 
is 
she left and I think she was in a hurry she's hard
