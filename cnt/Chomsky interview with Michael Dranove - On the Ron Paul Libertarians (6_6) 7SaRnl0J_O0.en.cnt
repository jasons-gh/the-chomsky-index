well I live out in Georgia and there's
lot of people I've talked to who are
ultra right-wing you know Ron Paul
libertarians is there any way for the
day I mean they're they're extremely
cynical is there any way to reach out on
the left is there any way to reach out
and talk to them about trying to bring
them over to the left well I think what
you have to do is ask what makes them
wrongful libertarians and I you know
happen to think that that makes a lot of
sense but nevertheless underlying it our
feelings that do make sense I'm in the
feeling for example that the government
is our enemy well that's it's a very
widespread feeling in fact that's been
induced by propaganda as well so
president will be April fifteenth and
the people in your neighborhood are
going to have to send in their income
taxes the way they're going to look at
it we've been trained to look at it is
that there's some alien force what may
be from Mars which is stealing our
hard-earned money from us mainly the
government okay well that would be true
in a totalitarian state but if you had a
Democratic Society you'd look at it the
other way around you say great it's
April fifteenth we're all going to
contribute to implement the plans that
we jointly decided on for the benefit of
all of us but that idea is even more
frightening than Social Security it
means that we would have a functioning
democracy and no set of concentrated
powers ever going to want that for
perfectly obvious reasons so yes there's
major efforts and successful efforts to
get people to fear the government as
their enemy not to
guarded as the that's just the
collective population acting in terms of
common goals that we've decided on which
would you would have what happen in a
democracy that is to an extent what does
happen in functioning democracies like
Bolivia poor country in South America
that's kind of what's happening they are
more or less but in very remote from
here so well i think you know ron paul
supporters can be appealed to him on
these grounds they're also against a
military intervention and we can ask ok
why no i mean is it just for their own
security or because they want to be
Richard or something well I doubt it i
think people are concerned that
destroyed iraq and so on so if there are
lots of grounds for for fighting there
are lots of common grounds that can be
explored even if the outcomes at the
moment look very different they look
different because they're framed within
fixed doctrines but those doctrines are
not graven in stone and they can be
undermined I hope Kathy thank you so
much it's a pleasure yeah
