well today we have the honor enormous honor the presence of chongqing 
intellectual, linguist, philosopher, political scientist, and activist from the 
1,928 since 1945 he studied linguistic and mathematical philosophy at the 
University of Pennsylvania received his doctorate in 1955 after leading 
conducted most of his research at the University of 
Harvard in 1998 received an honorary doctorate in linguistics from the 
rovira and virgili university and received this same distinction in numerous 
universities around the world the work and life done and we can 
divide into two large planes not obviously separated but are 
related because it is always positioned against the structures of 
power and oppressor of the dominant groups either in the theoretical plane 
philosophical as well as political one has to do with the field of linguistics and 
the other with his political commitment and activism against US policies 
in 957 with only 29 years they are who revolutionized the field of linguistics 
history with his theses on logical structures of theories 
linguistics would not be published until 1,975 his linguistic and psychological theory 
derived from central assumptions of structuralism as well as of psychology 
behaviorism with typical forgiveness noam chomsky became interested in politics very 
early age stimulated by the free readings and guides of the 
Spanish anarchists exiled in New York 
defines himself as a supporter of the anarchist tradition especially of 
the labor orientation current of anarchism anarcho-syndicalism and is 
member of the famous revolutionary union of americans ted and 
ww although he is a great critic of capitalism especially with politics 
outside the U.S. was in 1967 when he began his inclusion in activism 
politician totally opposing the participation of the United States in the war of 
vietnam from this he produced his essay book entitled the responsibility of 
intellectuals for which he obtained great recognition is associated with the law 
new left and was therefore arrested several times for his activism 
against the war although he has published numerous books and articles against 
neoliberalism and neoliberal globalization imposed by the US as another 
great work of the North American intervention Joyce who has asked 
USA and Canada lift economic sanctions imposed 
to cuba and venezuela so we are beyond proud 
to this great intellectual and thinker of reference throughout the world in our 
dear noam chomsky and ezekiel 
other 
in question 
question 
and that it is important to note that the focus of everything is currently on the 
the issue of the pandemic and therefore the crucial question that people ask is 
how the pandemic is going to change everything from this great event 
three cool questions is rock and roll 
expression of condemnation that is like that of both projectiles of 23 teachers 
sainz test in which 26 predictions was the next to an robots wars and things 
[Music] first the question would be for 
what is a pandemic after all is important the crucial thing now is to find 
the reason for its origin since it was predicted in 2003 
after the sars case that was so serious then scientists are 
predicting a similar event due to global warming 
factors that led discharge 
but it is not, we are not 
God 
the one world water is water black white list 
two 
There are basically three factors that have led us to this situation in the 
2003 it was understood that it was very possible that this happened and there was a 
knowledge to deal with it however currently knowledge 
is not enough and someone has to be willing to act in relation to 
This, then, what do we mean by big pharmaceuticals that are governed by 
a logic of capital that if something is not profitable or cannot be voted on 
profit because it simply cannot be developed or should not exist 
it is 
that problem 
if the drug companies the pharmaceutical companies 
they are being excluded due to this logic of capital 
The obvious alternative is the government that counts for the resources and thus has the 
means to develop this this cost effective solution 
which is not rigid by capital, however, there exists because this thought the 
neoliberal that taking alpes to the presentation of the former president 
President Reagan in which he simply said that the government is the 
problem that you can not leave things in the hands of the government so we have 
this limitation also by the government 
game 
or [Music] 
physically 
the worst of the control replay 
United States 
for ever ready 
henceforth because I feel that private companies are excluded 
due to the logic of capital and government is excluded by the logic 
liberalism then as how governments can react to 
this reality the cases are known china reacted by producing its own 
drugs in search of the solution in their vaccine was that the eastern countries of 
Asia Oceania also the response of other countries varied however because 
another slower way is valid in the case of in the western hemisphere usa and 
emblematic brazil in their reaction to the case 
of the pandemic 
and me

Mr 
i 
in the case of countries in the hemisphere where things can be done with them 
call from outside or outside the reaction are those countries in which things 
are out of control and these two are countries that are led by fans 
extremists where they are willing to open the economy 
In search of profit and power we can mention for example the case of the stock market 
In Brazil, since the numbers are very high in deaths from the pandemic, then 
His answer was simply who cares in the case of the president of 
trump in the usa seeing the numbers so high just what he said was then 
that the tests were stopped for I have no more cases arise these are the 
countries where things are a little out of control 
and nothing is together 
m 
with 
the werder elements claim in crisis funding hans op 64 false field in 
destroy 
then the world awaits us after the pandemic in the case of the most 
powerful in the history of the United States as the president of Trump said that in 
February when he produces his new annual budget he will continue 
withdrawing its fund from the entire international initiative to develop some and 
that will then continue to provide funds for everything that is the initiative 
militaristic and nuclear weapons in a nutshell 
[Music] 
in that direction 
of is 
efe 
the tukkers 
in a theme a theme that unifies everything that refers to the new proposal of 
US budget first distribute in the system 
health for people for the simple fact of not being profitable so it can 
Therefore, it does not make sense, we will have a center to control 
diseases are still planted for the public and return to subsidize from a 
open way all that is seeking 
fossil energy as part of making the capitalist initiative profitable 
also the regulation of environmental controls and this must be 
highlight the malicious nature of this mentality in removing all 
the regulations on air quality controls in the environment in 
full pandemic of a health nature where health is greatly affected if 
these industries are active and pollute the air more than 
which is already apart from the condition of 5,019 land for 
know if you allow me to add to what is important what the doctor says 
Chomsky is that reducing regulations to 
controls of the contaminations did it at this moment with under the mask of 
that the economy was going to be reactivated if there were regulations, the 
economy but that is why it is the malicious character they hide behind the 
reactivation of the economy and thus seek to justify what they are 
politics is moving thanks

It is important to note that we already mentioned the subsidy to everything that the industry 
fossil as in the destruction of public health systems and the 
increase the military budget and give that last blow to the remnants the 
gun control plan that had been evident for 30 years which all 
translates into new contracts for the government since the new countries 
would also serve as a means of continuing to direct public funds to 
the large arms industries and thus leading us to a new career

If there are some basic principles of this neoliberal doctrine, we must take 
in consideration above all because greed greed and 
apart from that because the goals of that greed 
keep pace with corporations is simply established by explaining that 
seeks to expand profits for members of private 
these then new owners of the government at the time leaders like 
thatcher and reagan simply as they expressed the need 
that private sectors had control of the economy and it is understood that 
that Karl Marx in the 16th century criticized for turning this intention of 
turn the population into simple sacks of potatoes the inhabitants and in this 
more modern times the minister of brazil simply good talks that there is 
a whole private structure within the government 
I don't know if Luis wants to add something to

and os windows 
then the main thought or the main slogan below the government 
except when we need it and it tells us to look for other 
mechanisms to protect ourselves and we have a very important lesson from this 
pandemic which is that the result of the following that there is state violence 
more and economic plans than in the same as 
It was ceded in Austria between the two great wars in the 20th century 
it is something common doctor chams that rafael there is something that seems important to me when 
teaches that the idea of   neoliberalism is to remove the government from 
center not but control is the hands of individuals but simply 
when they need the government they use it again to protect them for 
that says that neoliberalism and state violence go hand in hand 
as is happening at the moment there was no very strong economic crisis that 
we are still not out of it and what did the entrepreneurs and the 
Senators both Democrats and Republicans 
they wrote trillions in money to entrepreneurs to get back that 
power that control they had, they do not want it, the government does not work but 
used when they need to rebuild 
the gourd today 
[Music] 
[Music] 
i 
[Music] fusion 
and in the attempt 
wang wei 
if he is the main idea or what moves 
really because this movement of change can really lead to 
exemplify it through the case of austria in the 20th century 
because it was a moment in which it was led with a strong movement 
which was destroyed by economic forces to make way for 
new to new forms of government such as fascism such as that of mussolini 
it can be said that the establishment of these friendly dictatorships of good 
intentions because in many cases it was said that they were the ones that saved 
europe at the time 
efe 
I'm going to take two layoffs 
with months 
Well, to do it in a fairly simple way if we go to the pages 
website of the institution fan page is we need to understand that many of the 
things that are explained there after saving civilization because 
important is to save the structures not the people 
important is the collective in its logic 
yes no but but the idea that he added in that web page is that he was told to 
people in those moments where they were destroying governments like the 
Austrian Social Democrat that after saving society those of the 
black shirts that were type of clothing that they wore in which 
supported those fascist dictatorships were going to return and disappear from the 
scene no and unfortunately we realized that it did not happen that way or there 
neither with hitler nor with mussolini thanks reflex

because there is a compromise it could be called that this neoliberalism 
somehow it will bring violence as in the case of Chile for 
exemplify cliche cases without going into more detail 
Well, torture chambers and money from foreign investors 
thus caused the Chilean industry to change 
However, by ignoring Feinmann's anxiety, I do not completely 
they privatized the copper industry, which we know that somehow 
helped anyway in 1982 it should be remembered that there was a destruction 
total of its economy is what in the end because it causes all this

as soon as this neoliberal experiment had problems, it was seen as a 
establishment of a system that we know prevailed for 40 years with the 
Reagan and Thatcher doctrine has caused enormous instability 
suffering and discomfort worldwide due to the way in which the 
same visit the world

and luis huerta there are also para para and para also for translations and 
we are doing aybar son louis and of course rafael is great in price he added 
what I think may be importing now of the contextualize effect 
we continue 
Okay 
hc we see with concern that all genders in davos switzerland are therefore 
concern of these elite groups of the world because in their private environments 
where they argue for 40 years they have held hegemony in the past 
January there was concern due to the follow-up of a nuisance at the 
world against capitalism and as it would be a new issue the issue was the 
development of new companies that work in a more humane way in which 
propose to privatize everything for the benefit of humanity this is the 
new we could say doctrine 
so if it is something that appears important than doctor chams that 
is pointing out is that generally in each year they met in Switzerland in a 
teacher to ski and all that what the people of the capital met and 
congratulated each other to point out how well they were doing 
In their managing the world, in fact, the Salesians are the owners of the world of the 
universe but that this year in January was different because they started talking about 
the concern they had as the masters of the universe for the resistance 
the social uprisings that people were doing against the 
capitalism as a system, not for that reason what Rafael says very rightly that 
recognized that for 40 years they have made mistakes and that they were going to be now 
now more this humanitarian companies not that they were going to work for the people 
with doctor chams I know 
we had the story of war z 'extralegal our activity repression harting of 
bernal only short rhythms to require regional 
natural de los de textiles del arenal software corporation neuer extract 
gordi with software 
when there is a private eye cherry bomb order 
by politicians 
if I wanted to refer to a term 
because if looking at history 60 years ago 
companies switched to them throughout this long period of time when 
his thinking predominated approximately these 40 years and they were perfected because 
somehow his way of selling himself to the public then this term 
software that is human corporations or corporations or businesses 
with the human being in the middle or in the center of its activity 
it is like a proposal that they had originally made and that they will 
retake it they have wanted to sell that it is going to be retaken they are going to rule the world 
putting people at the center for your personal benefit they will offer you 
that you are going to have a role in everything else, however they are going to dominate what 
is at the end the story and something to point out is that that story was the 
counted 60 years ago in 1960 when capitalism was emerging again 
has a lot of force after the second world war we were told that 
companies were that kind of concern for people they did not work 
for people etc they have spent 60 years and now what the one mentioned in 
davos switzerland worried because people were resisting capital 
so now they told us that once again they will be human enterprises like 
you said they are concerned that people are well participate 
etcetera etcetera but but doctor chams says that we are going to wait for others 
60 years to realize that the same thing happens then the state repeating that 
in reality the data the facts that we see are not important or do not take them 
in consideration people

2 warner crisis the lord all softly 
is to collect the crises then through the ebro has come the new ever 
yes this is very important to make an illustration of three major themes that 
we are living the first is that we are in a crucial moment 
capitalism is fighting a very fierce class struggle 
to ensure that the post-pandemic world is a world 
totally according to his vision and second this represents a possible end of the 
organized movement an organized social moment for reasons well enough 
governments and thirdly because there is a crisis 
that will also be intensified by the hammer of the 
capitalism in the same way and I would like to add how important 
It is the vision that they share with us, we take advantage of it, how to be the world 
After this pandemic passes, it is a great question, it is very important because 
because capitalism right now as it illustrated when it said it 
remove the regulations here in the US for example in the middle of the pandemic that is going to 
help production for example oil companies companies 
that companies that extract fossils from fossil energy and it is a class struggle 
what is he doing against people all over the world and then what will happen 
if they actually succeed in the neoliberal system 
triumphs when the pandemic passes because they right now as they do in the 
doctrine of the clash which I believe that somehow we have 
heard what happens when that shake that the system makes at this moment 
we are under the pandemic but capitalism is acting the 
neoliberalism is pushing to remove all regulations and it will come 
a time when if they succeed they will continue to make excessive profits 
all that greed and there will come a time when it will put us in a 
instance where we are at the point of the destruction of human life from 
democratic societies as we know them 
this means the use of new opportunities 
efe opportunities for what we can work to order rested ruiz football from 
raids ternitz no temple guys road production 
To conclude, this is a moment of historical significance where there is a 
great opportunity also to focus on the human being their needs their 
rights and not only in the profit and the obtaining of returns 
to put it this way and because at the same time it is some 
presents great challenges as Rafael mentioned it is a historic moment 
It also gives us opportunities and we should think about the possibility of 
build in this case on the social resistance that is emerging 
in many countries of the world even here in this country in the usa many people from 
power I'm like in a trance I'm in shock I don't know how to describe it because people 
he is protesting he is moving he is articulating he is acting 
jointly and that did not happen then that is the opportunity for example that 
Dr. James points out that because if we can take advantage of this moment that 
we are living with resistance in the system we can get to establish 
better a new social order where the needs of beings are important 
humans not just corporate profits 
fernando 
do your good but it is 
ok fernando, in 5 minutes he has to go to 
another good interview was not for questions but 
maybe in a dialogue we can get it out but then the happiness that is grateful 
really this conference the proposal now of this cycle of the other politics 
It is also in asking some questions, yes, we can pass 
quickly to the questions and thank Rafael Cardenas teacher of the 
english apartment at the university of panama public intellectual and doctoral student 
in humanities and social sciences panama university and keeps them 
listen to them associate professor of critical pages and multiculturalism that 
They were doing this translation and we can move on to the questions all three 
questions we had belen tanus the word is shown 
educate popular and hungary dora and institute history teacher left 
with any of gonzalez Argentina member of the cooperative of 
educators and mentors can you historic llc sorry for interrupting you 
professor chomsky has to leave in five minutes 
well then I don't know if it would be nice to fire him thanking him and 
between us handle the questions of the participants I do not know why he does not go 
to be more time but yes to think if suddenly a final message is to say 
a message to the teachers and with that those audiences do if it is a final message 
from doctor chams that for the teachers of latin america and of all 
the world ok 
you want to tell races

there luis if you can translate 
If you are not seeing the final message, it is that we are living in a moment 
unique historical and that some of the things have to be resolved by 
For example, the great risk that still exists in the pandemic that is active and 
very still as affecting many population of the world 
we have another big risk another big threat is 
the environmental crisis that continues to deteriorate and continues to generate many 
problems at the world level and the other is the risk or threat that exists with the 
issue of nuclear war not because of the investment you are making in 
these moments especially in this country but he says that the essence of the 
hope we have time but not much 
actually say a couple of decades to decide what kind of world we're going to have 
or how are we going to change the world we have 
louis ask him if you can do it just a final greeting to close 
regards 
He left and I think he was in a hurry for two degrees

research and international other voice of education

Argentina and the international education center of the regidor del rio sin
