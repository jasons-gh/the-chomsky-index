we're going to turn now to Noam Chomsky
who gave a major address yesterday at
the University of the District of
Columbia in Washington DC two thousand
people packed into the gymnasium to hear
the professor of linguistics and when
the leading dissident voices in this
country speak about the politics and the
Middle East the invasion of Iraq and
much more this is professor Noam Chomsky
well let me start with the last fall
last September for 2002 that was a
September was a very important moment in
world affairs in world history in fact
last September the most powerful state
in history declared its intention to
maintain its domination of the world by
force the dimension in which it does
reign supreme and that it made it clear
that it would use this force not only
control the world but to destroy any
potential challenge that it sensed -
trying to equal or oppose this force
there wasn't any mistaking the intended
message it was clear Frank
honest and it was understood right in
the heart of the establishment in fact
so the main establishment Journal
Foreign Affairs and its next issue had a
an article by a well known foreign
international relations specialist John
ikenberry who described it in words so
clear and accurate that I'll just quote
him instead of giving my own he said
that the United States had announced a
grand strategy that begins with a
fundamental commitment to maintaining a
unipolar
world in which the United States has no
peer competitor a condition that is to
be permanent so that no state or
coalition will ever challenge the United
States as global leader protector and
enforcer the position renders
international norms of self-defense
enshrined by article 51 of the UN
Charter almost meaningless in general
the stance dismisses international law
and institutions as of little value he
says if you read the document as you
should you'll notice that there's barely
a mention of either the United Nations
or international law the going on with
Eikenberry the new imperial grand
strategy presents the United States as a
revisionist state seeking to parlay its
momentary advantages into a world order
in which it runs the show it will prompt
others to find ways to work around
undermine contain and retaliate against
US power the strategy may appear
successful in the short term but he goes
on it threatens to leave the world more
dangerous and divided and the United
States less secure it's a view which is
in fact widely shared right within the
foreign policy elite not to speak of
overseas where George Bush has indeed
succeeded in granting Osama bin-laden
wish beyond his wildest dreams I imagine
I've turned the United States into the
most feared and disliked and in many
quarters hated country in the world the
rhetorical radicalism of this imperial
grand strategy is highlighted when you
contrast it with the conception of world
order that's sustained by the
International Court of Justice the World
Court that was reiterated shortly before
the strategy was announced by its
president who happens to be a US
judge conservative US judge suevel is
long been a defender of lone defender of
US policies at the court he was
presenting the annual ICJ report to the
United Nations he informed the General
Assembly that as the court enters the
first century of the third millennium it
stands for international law not
international lawlessness for the
peaceful settlement of international
disputes in conformity with
international law not the will of the
more powerful party for international
organization not for international
anarchy nor for a state sovereignty
which purports to be above the law it
stands for human rights rights that can
be effectively realized only within
functioning systems of law local
national and international exactly what
is to be torn apart by the imperial
grand strategy hard to find more
dramatic antithesis than this statement
by a conservative US justice and the
administration of his country and it
plant sent to plenty of shutters around
the world including as I mentioned u.s.
foreign policy elite if you read about
it it's often called a new doctrine of
pre-emptive war that's not really
accurate the term pre-emptive war
actually has a meaning pre-emptive war
means which could fall within the range
of article 51 of the UN Charter that's
the article which grants the unique
right of use of force and self-defense
against armed attack pre-emptive war
would be a war against ongoing or
imminent attack when no other means are
available so for example you may recall
that 20 years ago
the cowboy a leader over in the White
House warned us that we were about to be
attacked from a an airbase in the
dangerous state of Grenada where the
Russians were going to use it to if they
assuming they could find it on a map
they were going to use the airbase two
bombers
okay suppose that fantasy was real it
led to a u.s. invasion after which the
US was standing tall once again for
saving us from this threat but suppose
it were true and you know the Russians
were bombing us from Grenada and the
planes were in the air and they were
plainly heading to Washington to bomb
the White House then it would be
legitimate under the doctrine of prevent
pre-emptive war for the u.s. air force
to shoot them down before they actually
did the bombing and maybe even to attack
the airbase and Grenada that would be
pre-emptive war but that's not what's
proposed what's proposed is sometimes
more accurately called preventive war so
in the technical literature that's
pointed out pre-amp preventive not
preemptive means you're going to prevent
any potential challenge however even
that has much too generous there's
nothing to be prevented so the invasion
of Iraq wasn't intended to prevent
anything and the doctrine makes clear
that what's going to be prevented is any
any challenge that the US government
decides is a potential challenge well
it's a doctrine of prevention which
calls for Nuremberg trials at the
at the outset the explanation was that
preventive war would be against any
country that's threatening to develop
weapons of mass destruction which could
ultimately threaten us after the fiasco
about finding weapons of mass
destruction that was modified and the
latest version that's been pronounced by
a high official is that the u.s.
entitled carry out preventive war
against any country that has the ability
and intent to produce weapons of mass
destruction well just about anybody has
the ability including the local high
school here if it has a chemistry and
biology lab and intent is you decide
when there's an intent so that
essentially means we'll attack anybody
we like we decide they have the intent
they always have the ability so it's
fair game the imperial grant strategy
that was announced as a doctrine when
you announce a doctrine you have to get
people to take it seriously it has to be
converted into what respected okay if I
criticized lawyers you know but
respected legal commentators will call a
new norm in international affairs and in
order to establish a new norm in
international affairs the doctrine has
to be implemented
so therefore Washington needed a test
case to implement the new doctrine and
establish it as a norm with the New York
Times after the event called a petri
dish test case where you try it out and
make people know that you mean it
seriously
the target for preventive war has to
meet a number of conditions first
crucial condition and this is worth
keeping in mind for predicting the
future of the doctrine the first crucial
condition it has to meet is that the
country has to
completely defenseless I like Grenada
that otherwise it's not a good idea to
get involved in a conflict the that
requires a huge propaganda campaign like
in the case of Grenada to build it up as
an awesome threat but then you
miraculously succeed in overcoming it
but you have to understand that its
defensive the second crucial case
condition it has to meet is that the
country has to be important enough to be
worth conquering so there's no point to
conquering some country in Africa that
nobody ever heard it
the third point the third condition is
it has to be evil that so when you put
together
put together the three conditions
defenseless important evil that spells
Iraq the first two conditions are
obvious obviously
defenseless its enormous ly important
right in the heart of the world's energy
producing regions second largest
resources in the world as to the evil
that's easy to you just have to repeat
the standard bush and Blair and Powell
rhetoric which is Paul accurate except
hypocritical you have to repeat the mock
horror about a man who is so evil that
he would even use gas against his own
people for this hundreds of times always
omitting the crucial words with our help
because we didn't care
you also have to express more makar
about the in fact horrible mass graves
that are being exposed every day from
Saddam's vicious repression of the 1991
uprising that might well have overthrown
him again omitting the crucial words
with our help for reasons that were in
fact clearly explained right in the
mainstream press so when the u.s. turned
down requests from rebelling Iraqi
generals to have access to captured Iraq
equipment and authorized this and I'm
saying to use the military helicopters
and other heavy weapons that were of
which you can now see the effects was
none then but now it's graphically
explained it was explained in the press
this we didn't like it but it had to be
done for higher reasons of state to
maintain what was called stability the
chief diplomatic correspondent in The
New York Times
Thomas Friedman essentially giving the
State Department position explained that
you just had to do it is that the best
of all worlds for Washington would be an
iron-fisted military Hunta ruling Iraq
the same way that Saddam did but with a
different name and because his name was
now embarrassing
we supported him all along but can't do
it anymore so we need another Iraqi
military Hunta but somebody else and
since we have been able to find anyone
else we'll settle for Saddam Hussein
second best but definitely not leave
Iraq in the hands of its own people
which would have been the very likely
outcome of the uprisings had the United
States which is of course in total
control of the air the ground
that hadn't essentially authorized the
slaughters whose effects a grisly
effects are now being deployed well that
worked but and there is a guiding
principle that remains you take a look
at all the meandering of US policy with
regard to Iraq over the last years there
is one fixed principle Iraq cannot be
ruled by its own people Noam Chomsky
addressing two thousand people at the
University of the District of Columbia
on Sunday in Washington DC we'll be back
with that address in a minute Ani
DiFranco singing to the teeth here on
Democracy Now the war and peace report
has returned to MIT linguist and leading
dissident Noam Chomsky speaking in
Washington DC
two days ago leading Shiite cleric who
was speaking to a huge crowd and the
it's now been renamed the Sadr City
Sadr City slum Baghdad appealed to what
he called people of humanity in the
United States to oppose the US military
occupation and leave Iraq to its own
people and again all the meandering of
policy that principle has remained
rejection of that option remains a
constant invariant principle and it
follows from the second the two can
three conditions Iraq is just too
important to be left to its own people
we've got a running well any event Iraq
met fall three conditions the new norm
preventative Wars therefore established
legal scholars can now explain learnedly
that law is a flexible living instrument
Norm's established by practice so on
again there's a few words omitted the
norms are established by the practice of
the most powerful state nobody else if
others commit what was called at
Nuremberg the supreme crime namely the
one that was just written acted in Iraq
if others carry that out or even lesser
crimes they don't establish new norms in
fact they have to be severely punished
but when the most powerful state does it
that's an enormous doctrines fixed ok
back to September 1 crucial event in
September was the pronouncement of the
new doctrine and the second a second was
the beginning of the massive propaganda
effort to build up some degree of
popular support for the planned
implementation of the doctrine the petri
dish that's members when the drumbeat of
propaganda began about how Iraq was an
imminent threat to US national security
there were also insinuations about
Iraq's responsibility for 9/11 about its
links with al-qaeda it's Manta terrorist
and so on and that had a very quick
effect within a few weeks Congress
passed a resolution granting the
executive the right to use force at the
White House's choice because of the
threat to the national security of the
United States those of you who with a
good memory may recall that in 1985 the
previous cowboy leader declared a state
of national emergency in the United
States because of the threat to the
national security
the United States posed by the
government of Nicaragua that was after
the threat from Grenada had been
thankfully beaten back but the
Nicaraguans were only two days driving
time from Harling in Texas they're
waiving their copies of mine Kampf as
Secretary of State George Shultz put it
just about to destroy us but Reagan
courageously announced
despite the odds he's not going to be
afraid he's going to continue fighting
recalling Winston Churchill which are
supposed to do in those circumstances
and we had a state of national emergency
Rheda cleared annually and really
cleared again by Congress last October
this time with regard to Iraq not
Nicaragua the that had an instant effect
there was a huge government media
propaganda campaign by and the September
polls registered that about 60% of the
population thought that Iraq was an
imminent threat to the security of the
United States similar percentages
quickly came to believe that Iraq was
involved in maybe even responsible for
the September 11th attacks and it was
linked to terror and planning new ones
and so on that those opinions were as
you'd expect closely correlated with
support for war and that makes a lot of
sense
you know if you believe that Iraq is a
major threat to an imminent threat to
our security that it carried out the
September 11th bombings planning new
ones then it makes sense to prevent the
next attack before it's too late
so correlation is not surprising there
was a carefully stage-managed
speech victory speech on the Abraham
Lincoln aircraft carrier was announced
that Bush announced
a victory over terror because of Iraq's
links to al-qaeda all of this is known
to be complete fabrication but it's
quite effective he could make that
speech without fear that the headlines
were going to say you're lying and you
know perfectly well there's no
connection to al-qaeda senior one
well-known commentator senior associate
of the Carnegie Foundation Anatole
Lieven describes this government media
propaganda campaign he says for
systematic mendacity it has few
parallels in peacetime democracies and
that's not entirely false so if you go
back to the first tenure in office of
the same people it's mostly recycled
Reaganites there are plenty of similar
examples and unfortunately plenty in
between - it was effective the u.s. is
unique in the world in having regarded
Iraq as a threat to its security Saddam
Hussein was despised everywhere quite
rightly but not fear the countries of
the region which had every reason to
fear and didn't fear it in fact they'd
been working for a number of years to
try to reintegrate Iraq back into the
regional system and maybe hope for some
internal overthrow which could have
happened he the you wait and I ran two
countries which Assad aam Hussein
invaded he they of course despise him
but they didn't fear and they didn't
fear him perfectly obvious reasons
perfectly well known the US intelligence
Iraq was the weakest state in the region
by a long shot its economy and its
military expenditures were about a third
those of queit which has 10 percent of
its population much less than other
regional countries far below the
regional superpower the u.s. offshore
military base in israel which completely
dominates the region militarily the
but even next to the neighbors it was
essentially nothing it's the condition
first condition for the petri dish there
was a relationship to al-qaeda the
relation is that recruitment for
al-qaeda and similar networks shot up
during the build-up to the war and since
then exactly as had been predicted by
intelligence agencies and the
independent that strategic analysts and
for very obvious reasons it's been
understood that measures like this and
threats like this will lead to
proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and terror if only partly
for revenge but if only for deterrence
that's well understood
well another event last September
critical event was that September was
the opening of the midterm election
campaign the most important person in
Washington Karl Rove Republican campaign
manager had explained to Republican
activists before the 11:00 before over
the summer in fact that they had better
make sure not to go into the election
campaign allowing domestic issues to be
have any prominence because they'll get
smashed on that for obvious reasons they
have to switch the focus of the campaign
to national security
that way maybe people will you know hide
under the umbrella of power and forget
the fact that they don't have a pension
and Kenneth Lay is walking away with
their money and so on and so forth so
and that was done on the for the next
presidential campaign coming up the
rogue has already stated the obvious
it's nice that he says that you can
quote it's obvious even if he doesn't
say it namely that they're gonna have to
do the same thing for the presidential
campaign for even more striking reasons
the Wall Street Journal
we pointed out that the extravaganza on
the Abraham Lincoln was the opening shot
and the presidential campaign was in the
victory speech a victory but it was a
presentation of the powerful wartime
leader protect us from the next dragon
he'll be about the sleigh
by then the campaign just by sheer
accident is beginning in New York City
on September 11th it's delayed to be had
the right date and the core issue will
be defending us from an imminent threat
to existence crucially don't pay any
attention to that 44 trillion dollar
deficit trillion dollar deficit that was
calculated by government economists but
kept out of the federal budget message
to Congress couple months ago so as to
expedite passage of another tax cut for
the rich the purpose as a number of
mainstream top economists have pointed
out and it's obvious again is to yield
what they call a fiscal train wreck
the purpose of which is to destroy
social spending so you can go into an
election saying we're going to wipe out
any social spending to find help people
but you can say we've got a fiscal
disaster
so therefore what can we do I got to
destroy everything in fact it was
conceded by White House spokesperson Ari
Fleischer a couple days ago in a press
conference here he was asked about the
44 trillion dollar deficit he said Yanis
accurate he said there is no 10 here's
what he said he said there is no
question that Social Security and
Medicare are going to present future
generations with a crushing debt burden
unless policymakers work seriously to
reform those programs well
reform doesn't mean fund them with
progressive taxation what it means is
this
by various devious means one is to
transfer over to the states which have a
crushing fiscal burden as well and all
of this is really important
Social Security Medicare Medicaid
schools these all have very serious
defects they are based on a principle
that is evil as George Bush hears from
his direct line to God they are based on
the principle
they're based on the principle of the
sympathy the principle that Adam Smith
and David Hume and other dangerous
radicals described as the core of human
nature and that's correct all of these
institutions are based on the idea that
you should care if the disabled Widow
across town
can survive another day or if the kid
across the street can get a decent
education and that's evil you're not
supposed to believe that evil doctrines
have to be driven from the mind as
ashcroft and Bennett and other moral
authorities can explain and that means
you got to eliminate the institutions if
you can only do it by a fiscal
trainwreck do it that way actually there
are other advantages many others but one
is the state privatization of Social
Security so is a privatization of
pensions that has the great positive
element of compelling working people to
be actively committed day by day against
their own interests so if your pension
depends on the profits of the company
you're working for or whoever else
you've invested in stocks you must
oppose decent wages safety standards in
the workplace labor rights
you got to oppose all those things
because otherwise you won't have a
pension you have to make sure that the
rich are happy because if they're happy
maybe they'll be nice to you just as in
the feudal system which their effective
Lee trying to restore well maintained at
some time the number of commentators
have pointed out that the focus on
national security in Iraq and all this
business was done for short-term
political advantage but that understates
the point this is very serious
maintaining a very thin hold on power is
a very high priority a couple more years
in power they may be
who institutionalize the extremely
regressive programs that will seriously
undermine human rights civil liberties
create a kind of utopia the masters and
the only way to maintain that thin hold
on power is to inspire fear exactly as
karl rove explained and a worth bearing
in mind that all of this is second
nature to the people in office right now
mostly recycled from the Reagan Bush
administration in fact from its most
reactionary component during the Reagan
years the policies that the government
was carrying out were quite unpopular
domestically which isn't surprising
there was a period of stagnant with
bearded relatively slow growth but also
a stagnation or decline for much the
population the u.s. ended up that period
with the highest workload in the world
and lowest wages that was a welcome
development of transcendent importance
The Wall Street Journal editorial said
but the population didn't quite agree
with that in 1984 which is called a
Reagan landslide and about 30 percent of
the electorate of the voters by I'm a
considerable majority about three to two
I hope that his legislative program
would not be enacted and the
unpopularity continued at the end of the
period Reagan Bush period in a regular
poll of the popularity of living ex
President Reagan ranked right at the
bottom just beat out by Nixon was a
little more unpopular you're listening
to Noam Chomsky professor of linguistics
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
leading political dissident will be back
with his speech in Washington DC in a
minute Shalom Salaam by alone early our
Chicano mal Marcos here on Democracy Now
the war in peace reporters were returned
to Professor Noam Chomsky speaking
Sunday at the University of District of
Columbia in Washington DC
there are a lot of consequences of the
imperial grand strategy and they're well
known one I mentioned it's a almost
certain to lead to proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction as a
deterrent that was recognized at once
it was increases with every additional
step
so last week Congress dropped the ban on
research and development of low-yield
nuclear weapons
low-yield means approximately a third of
the Hiroshima bomb that technology is
too advanced for others to follow
except maybe for Israel because it's an
offshoot of u.s. power but other
countries aren't going to be able to
follow that however it was immediately
predicted and plausibly that that would
be a incentive for other nuclear states
to expand their own offensive capacities
for example Pakistan or China which
means it will spread the Indian and
there will be a chain reaction probably
on to the major nuclear power in the
Middle East Asia region a number of
analysts have pointed out and again
obvious that the Bush administration is
practically pleading with Iran to
initiate or accelerate a nuclear weapons
program that's going to create a
self-fulfilling prophecy in order to
justify an invasion or more likely I
think subversion because Iran fails the
primary condition for target it's not
defences and that subversion may already
be going on another consequence is to
increase terror as a deterrent and a
revenge and it's a serious threat one
should joke about it
well enhancing serious threats to u.s.
security is in fact quite rational
within the accepted framework of
assumptions
maybe the framework is
take but the choices within it are quite
rational there just are some higher
priorities so establishing the imperial
grand strategy of world domination and
restructuring domestic society under the
control of unaccountable systems of
private power reducing democracy to
empty forms these are really high
priorities and to achieve them it's
worth facing the threat of massive
terror and possible nuclear war it's not
the first time in history that such
choice has been made by dedicated
leaders kind of a miracle we've survived
this long but you can understand the
rationality of the policies given the
framework are there other problems one
critical one is the Middle East Israel
Palestine problem
continuing turmoil there threatens us
control of the world's major energy
resources and something has to be done
about that
well what's supposed to be done read
about we're supposed to stare and awe at
the president's vision of a Palestinian
state you've noticed I'm sure that
there's a journalistic convention by now
that whenever you mention George Bush
you have to mention his vision of
something or other the vision that is
never described what it is but it's
noble by definition in this case his
vision of a Palestinian state somewhere
some authority nobody knows that's a
wonderful vision you have to forget a
few facts when you describe his vision
of a Palestinian state namely there's
been an international consensus for
almost 30 years on establishing a
Palestinian state in the territories
occupied by Israel it's also supported
by two-thirds of the American public now
meaning a two-state settlement from the
international border region 67 with some
mutual adjustment one to one land swap
or something like that
for 30 almost 30 years that's been block
you laterally by the United States run
through it but it continues right
through the Clinton Barack years so
during the Clinton Barack years the
1990s there was a huge program of
building settlements and the
infrastructure with the clear design of
splitting the West Bank into four
Canton's north central South all
separated from East Jerusalem little bit
of East Jerusalem the center of
Palestinian cultural and commercial life
which is to be virtually separated I'm
technically there's some passages very
hard to maneuver kind of a four-man to
Stan settlement and that's continuing
the Camp David proposals of year 2000
and Clinton Barack proposals they were
lauded profusely in the press
magnanimous wonderful and so on there's
a very easy way to evaluate the praise
and namely have a look at the map that
was proposed well that's a little
difficult apparently not a single map
was published anywhere in the US press
least nobody can find one it's not that
the maps were unavailable published in
Israel they were published in Europe
they were published in the standard
scholarly sources and the dissident
literature but no map was available for
people to determine the magnanimity of
the offer and there's a plausible reason
for that as soon as you looked at the
map you saw exactly what I described for
Canton's
makes South Africa's ban to Stenton
programs forty years ago it looked
pretty good and Chiron and Bush in the
next phase are just extending that the
well the vision is being pronounced
built the bulldozers are
happily at work as well and they're
creating the facts on the ground which
will tell you what the vision is there's
a separation wall being built from the
north it's already surrounded and
virtually destroyed the Palestinian town
of calcula it was announced a couple of
weeks ago that south of that it's going
to extend an East including aerial and
monorail to settlements to the east that
establishes within the separation wall
meaning on the Israeli side one of the
two Clinton Barack settings which were
to split the West Bank in three
establishes the northern of the two
salient nobody doubts that the bigger
and more important salient from
Jerusalem way over to the east almost to
Jericho will also be included that
includes the town of allowed the meme
which was built primarily under Clinton
Barack in order to bisect the partition
the West Bank the territories that are
signed to the settlement ago far beyond
the actual settled part allowing to for
expansion without any change in some
boundaries estimates by Israeli analysts
or that includes approximately fifty
percent of the West Bank and Sharon
understands it perfectly we'll a lot of
talk about how he made this diplomatic
move of accepting roadmap let's talk
about what he told his cabinet he told
them don't worry about it about
settlement he said there is no
restriction here and you can build for
your children and grandchildren and I
hope for your great-grandchildren as
well and that's a very reasonable given
the way the facts on the ground are
being established quite apart from the
vision and the facts on the ground
there's also a record of actions which
can look at so the Bush administration's
first major act with regard to Israel
Palace
but at the United Nations in 2001
December was to veto the dispatch of
international monitors to who in an
effort to reduce the level of violence
and the territories they want the
violence to continue because they know
it's mostly Israeli violence to suppress
the Palestinians just a week before that
the English administration boycotted and
therefore undermine a meeting of the
High Contracting Parties of the Geneva
Convention that's just that everybody
including whole European Union which
once again produced a harsh condemnation
of illegal actions including about
everything that's going on there great
preaches and the Geneva Conventions all
of this incidentally silence don't read
anything about it in December last
December at the next meeting of the UN
the u.s. took a position which it's
taken seriously is extremely significant
every year the United Nations has
ratified 1968 Security Council
resolution calling on Israel to
terminate and withdraw from its
effective annexation of East Jerusalem
expansion annexation of Jerusalem this
year last December for the first time
the United States voted against it it to
be precise it voted against a resolution
reaffirming it meaning voted essentially
in favor of the annexation if that's
meant seriously that's extremely
significant it ends any possibility of
any settlement Jerusalem is not big area
extending into the West Bank there are
two major areas of the world which could
go their own way and these are long
stances one of them Europe is a
long-standing problem thirty years ago
was the most called a year of Europe and
Henry Kissinger then made a famous
address called the year of Europe
address in which he instructed the
Europeans that they have we called
regional responsibilities which they are
to carry out within the overall
framework of order managed by the United
States but don't forget your limits
a lot of the manufactured the hatred
about France and Germany has to do with
they are the heartland of the European
economy and of its political strength
and therefore the threat that they might
move towards some kind of independent
course remains very significant by now
there are similar problems in Asia
Northeast Asia is the most dynamic
economic region in the world
fastest-growing its gross domestic
product is considerably larger than the
United States it has a half of the
financial reserves of the world it's an
integrated region it has resources
industrial developing industrial
countries leading ones that need the
resources integrated pipelines going
from say Siberia to South Korea quote a
recent US study pipelines could enhance
regional stability and provide cheap
alternatives to oil imported from the
Middle East where the United States
maintains control that's quite
significant one of the major reasons to
control the Middle East oil reserves has
been to maintain what George Kennan 50
years ago called veto power over other
countries they forget that they have on
a regional responsibilities we can
strangle it but if the integrated region
of Northeast Asia
actually moves towards independence as
it could
be that veto power could be lost the
North Korean issue is very much
entangled in this well without going on
there plenty of ominous developments in
world affairs of the United States of
course plays a leading role it is far
and away the most important military
power and a huge economy and for us
that's a very lucky thing in much of the
world people can't really do very much
large parts of the world they live under
such repression that they can mostly
watch and fear but we are uniquely
privileged and we can determine the
