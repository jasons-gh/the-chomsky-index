this this concentration on CIA
atrocities is one of the techniques
that's used to avoid criticism of the
government of real power if you can
blame something on the CIA you know this
kind of rogue outfit then you do exactly
what the government wants you to do and
the CIA is there for what's called their
not plausible deniability
it's the phrase that's used inside so if
the government wants to say you know
overthrow the Indonesian if if
Washington wants to overthrow the
government of Indonesia you say ok the
CIA did it and then you can say well you
know we don't know anything to do with
it that's just that rogue outfit if
something goes wrong the CIA is an
agency of the executive branch of the
government they do what the executive
branch of the government tells them to
do there's a long record rich record and
there are some exceptions but
overwhelmingly the CIA is just an agency
of the executive which acts in ways to
provide plausible deniability to sort of
keep us clean if something goes wrong
then you blame them if something goes
wrong now that's true on case after case
so yeah when we when you talk about the
CIA you should think of that as a
metaphor it's a way of describing what
the executive branch of the government
is doing and the corporate backers of
the executive branch and they've got
this agency which carries out the ugly
stuff for them and that's what secret
agencies are like in most states so I
think one should be cautious about that
and it's not wrong to blame the CIA for
this that and the other thing but
remember they're the hand that's not the
brain
