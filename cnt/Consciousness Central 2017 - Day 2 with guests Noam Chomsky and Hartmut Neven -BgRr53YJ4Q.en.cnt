hello and welcome to day two of
consciousness central coming to you from
the science of consciousness conference
2017 here in San Diego we have a great
show for you today including an
interview with Noam Chomsky so stay with
us for that and much more
[Music]
so I'd like to welcome to the science of
consciousness and consciousness central
2017 renowned philosopher pioneer and
linguistics Noam Chomsky welcome thank
you very much for coming so I think
perhaps it's a very fertile area the the
convergence of linguistics and
consciousness I hope you agree what is
it that you found coming to a conference
like this and thinking about perhaps
more about consciousness does that
inform your work on linguistics in any
way to begin with as a point of
convergence that interests me
particularly is has to do with the
phenomenology of consciousness
the traditional view of consciousness
was that it regarded it as inner
directed so the primary concern of the
study of consciousness in the 18th 17th
18th century early days of modern
science was the inner life how to what
extent are we aware what's the nature of
our awareness of our inner life that
raises all of the by now familiar
questions about you know what is it like
to and so on what it's like to see this
color blue what is it like to have the
thought so until the same kind of
questions but it's a rich area in many
respects I think a richer area to
investigate than the phenomenology of
external consciousness in the color blue
some more complex internal system and we
can say a lot about its nature and I
think when you look into it you find
some surprising things for example in
the case of language which is kind of
the core of our mental life what
basically differentiates us from
animals I think you find that the
internal system of language is basically
a system for generating thoughts and
that system is disconnected from both
consciousness and the externalization of
it to the outer world so there's things
going on in our mind then you can
sometimes externalize them in one or
another sensory modality we usually the
speech but sign is about the same it's
even possible to use touch Helen Keller
for example but the the internal
workings of the mind are inaccessible to
consciousness and even when we produce
what's called inner speech when you
construct the thought in your mind
talking to yourself something you do all
day constantly even all night that's the
external system it's not getting to
what's going on internally it's taking a
long time to get to realize this the
study of language for the last 2,500
years and the philosophy of language and
so on I concentrate on what's produced
but what's produced is not really
language it's an interaction of the
internal system with a sensory motor
system now that's the interaction of two
entirely different systems so it's
complex of course and in fact as we are
now learning I think the apparent
variety of languages and the what looks
like the complexity of language and the
easy mutability of language changes from
generation to generation is actually the
externalization doesn't seem to affect
the internal system in fact it's even
possible you can now produce a credible
thesis not established credible that the
internal system of constructing thoughts
could be universal it may not
change the role among humans is just
part of being human and then there are
various ways of mapping it to the
outside which look complicated and those
are the external light there's the
external system but they're not they're
a mixture of language with another
system and even our what we find when we
investigate them and if you think just
construct the thought in your mind it's
not the internal system you can show
that it's the external system so what's
going on internally it doesn't is so
deep inside that even when we introspect
and construct thoughts in our mind we're
not getting to it but it's pretty strong
evidences there and it's determining the
fragments that reach awareness and it's
interspersed with them it's inextricable
amalgam so if you wanna study the
phenomenology of consciousness I think
it's necessary that crucially to bring
in the internal computations about which
we learn in an indirect way I'm
wondering to what degree some of this
could be at least shall we say some
correlation between bohmian theory of if
you're familiar with David Bohm and his
his idea of the implicit and the
explicit and the implicit seems to be
this field potential that gives rise to
what we experience and I suppose Plato
had some prior version of that and along
with this field of potential comes into
being such things as mathematics which
once upon a time didn't really exist and
now does and mathematics of course is a
language as well mathematics raises
interesting questions for one thing
there are two separate questions
there's arithmetic and everything else
and they're very different arithmetic
conduct the knowledge of arithmetic
seems to be kind of like language it
seems to be a common unit possession
even there plenty of languages that
don't have words for numbers beyond
maybe one two three but it appears that
the people have the whole numbers isn't
it there's been interesting study about
that they just don't they made other
ways of expressing it like five Panem
they enter into a commercial economy to
deal with things pretty quickly you know
it's it's part of our nature a lot of
the great results in mathematics were
just done and pretty much by intuition
and I think which the way mathematics
developed by now mathematics is not--
it's a an idealized formula could be
formalized enterprise all that the
formalized process of joke you know
still to this day mathematical proofs
are done largely by intuition you assume
that you'd be for months but so that's
its interest that's some cognitive
capacity that we have they are if
medical capacity the capacity create
mathematic but for that matter the
capacity creates science and why should
we have that capacity and it's a very
interesting one so if you go back to the
origins of modern science the Galilean
period it was a real wrench
psychological wrench to try to
comprehend and to be practical to
convince the aristocrats who funded
because you've got to convince them or
you can't go on to comprehend that it
makes sense to study things that don't
exist
like a ball rolling down a frictionless
plane and why should you study a ball
rolling down a frictionless plane why
not study leaves blowing
the wind that any natural phenomenons
much more interesting exciting why these
idealized structures that you're
constructing some of which are even
impossible you know now it's taken for
granted that science studies highly
abstracted idealized systems with not
the data of the world
you don't take videotapes of the world
if you want to learn the laws of motion
let's say the had to make that to
overcome that psychological barrier was
by no means easy Galileo and others had
to really struggle with and in fact the
conception that they came up with almost
immediately
it wasn't the world must be a
complicated machine in that period in
Europe skilled artisans were making
extremely complex automata you know
which were acting out scenes from the
Bible doing all sorts of complicated
things the physical world they were
peopled with machine with was a world of
complex automata and the idea that the
world itself is just a bigger and more
complex otamatone constructed by super
skilled craftsmen was very intuitive in
fact I think it's probably our intuition
too about what the world is that's why
it was such a shock when Newton
demonstrated that the world is not a
machine that there are no machines that
nothing works by mechanical principles
there's interaction without contact
Newton himself regarded as a total
absurdities at nobody with any
scientific sensibility could pay any
attention to this but it just seems to
be true which was which is why he
presumably why he called his great work
the mathematical principles
not physical science it wasn't physical
science it was just mathematical
principles that seemed to work and again
it took a quite a long time before it
became common sense science to disregard
intelligibility the disregard
conceivability and incidentally in the
study of consciousness that leap hasn't
been made so it's very common to hear
that you know consciousness could not be
reduced to physical things because it's
inconceivable that conceivability was
thrown out afternoon in the hard science
is that just not an argument we don't
try to get a conceivable intelligible
picture of the world and we try to
science just reduced its goals from
conceivability of what the world is or
intelligibility of the world to
intelligibility of theories so the
scientists of Newton's time didn't
himself live Nets organs others they
could understand that ins theories
Magnus's theories that wasn't the
problem
it's just what they the world that they
described was unintelligible
but that concern has disappeared from
the Natural Sciences though it still
shows up in the emerging Sciences so you
read that you know we can't conceive of
how neurons could have the feel of
seeing blue and saying no can't conceive
it it's too bad that it's just not
initial in the sciences the question is
is it true you know and and those leaps
are not easy to make and they come right
through the history sciences up till
today
I'd like to thank you very much for your
conversation contribution this afternoon
has been a pleasure to meet you and
listen to you I could listen to you for
a much longer appreciate it very much
that's Noam Chomsky
[Music]
so in this exhibit we've got the arthur
c-- clark center for imagination at UC
san diego and it's like a arts media and
engineering creative collaboration so
we're gonna hear about what their
exhibits about so tell me what's going
on here with this exhibit right now
we're partnered with the Penrose
institute which it was founded by Sir
Roger Penrose and what we're doing now
is a lot of research and design
logistics into artificial intelligence
creation and hybridization with human
consciousness so basically what that
means is that we would have a AI avatar
as you see before you and partnered with
the human operator so to augment and
supplement each other so there's things
that the human brain can do better than
an artificial intelligence and vice
versa there's things that an artificial
intelligence do much better than the
human mind this is mathematics so kind
of a teamwork collaboration between
humans and machine
exactly it's a hybrid AI system this is
just step one of the initiative or the
phase talking with another associate of
mine Eric very dr. Yuri at UCSD we're
hoping to push this out in the future to
different industries such as medical
personal business to basically augment
people's lives with AI and human
operators so we've got a poster here
about Hindu temple architecture as a
sort of mini cosmos can you please tell
me what's going on in your poster here
actually I have just focused on the
architecture part of the Hindu temple
which is exactly replicas of our human
body if seen from above
so first of all I will just like to tell
you that there is a small difference
between what goes on in the Hindu temple
and in the church or mosque it is not
only the place of only congregational
worship but here one-to-one connection
is sought between the deity and the
devotee that is the main difference
basically so for that fixing the place
of the deity is very important in the
site in the precinct of the temple and
when it is where the Gardeners intersect
is the point which has the maximum
positive energy and then if you look at
this temple because temples are made for
us humans so they are from here the
extension takes place this is a place
for the deity and the extension takes
place towards the entrance gate and we
can see here mayor you can take over so
this is the place which we have fixed
which has the maximum positive energies
the place of deity and then we extend
the construction in such a way that this
construction represent our human body
okay in eastern theory we say that we
have assumption that we have different
chakras through which our consciousness
we feel elevated because we are
travelling from the lower chakra towards
the higher chakra towards the point of
consciousness which is here in on our
third eye right so when this
construction is done which represents
our human body and when we enter into
the temple from this gate and then
gradually when we go here to worship
where the place of deity is there we
feel elevated so tell us about your
telling no etic device here
well it's some I'm interested in
artworks that exchange or communicate or
transfer a condition or state of
consciousness or state of awareness and
so I'm thinking of what what would be
the best medium to do that and I think
video and electricity and human beings
are probably a good medium for
exchanging communicating no etics so
this piece uses rhythms to entrain
multiple types of awareness to hopefully
exchange or communicate a certain state
awareness great and it seems like you've
got good results I'm already entranced I
think just watching it's good thank you
very much
so we're here with bhakti Kapur baki
tell me what's going on with your poster
so I'm an electrical engineer so we try
to put the concept of consciousness from
electrical engineering kind of a
perspective so in signal processing guys
there exists a sampling theorem which
says the signal can be observed and
uniquely reconstructed if it is sampled
at a frequency that is twice the
frequency of the signal itself so this
can be extended to any system any system
which has a higher frequency should be
able to observe a system which is at a
lower frequency so our brain it works as
a relatively low frequency as compared
to the subtle regions that can be
observed during the process of
meditation so how is this possible this
would in fact defy the sampling theorem
so we've tried to overcome this
observers paradox using electrical
engineering we've said that the
different levels of meditation they can
be said to be connected through feedback
loops which can be these switches can be
switched on when we focus our attention
on these points of resonance and when we
do so information can flow top-down and
we are observed able to observe the
subtler regions but this happens only
because there is harmonic resonance that
exists and through these quantum quantum
feedback coverin stand through harmonic
resonance we are able to solve the
observer's paradox thank you so much
[Music]
so I'd like to welcome to consciousness
central hartmut neven heartwood is a
pioneer in the field of quantum
computing I think I'm allowed to say
that how much is that a fair description
would I would you say you're planning I
think that's a little bit grandiose
descript okay okay well the real scale
it back a little bit then so but tell me
a little bit about quantum computing and
how it relates to consciousness
that's of course the big question and if
you came to my target to consciousness
conference last year I had actually
slides that started what can we learn
from quantum computing about
consciousness and the answer was not
much not much very fortunately there
certain other aspects that we care about
when thinking about the human brain for
example what is creativity that is a
much easier question and there I think
we are bringing in quantum elements can
lead us to designing systems that might
work very well be the most creative
systems imaginable actually that's a
very interesting let's go there straight
away because if I hear you say create
describing creativity is so much easier
it sounds like that's quite an
achievement in itself so how is
describing creativity easy and how do we
describe creativity and what are we
talking about when we do that so first
of all of course we have to subscribe to
a common notion of what we would call
creative I think a pretty good
formalization of creativity is thinking
of it as an optimization problem and an
optimization problem is often best
visualized as a landscape where you have
to find a low point in this landscape so
the let me illustrate some more let's
say an architect you know we look at the
work of an architect
we ask OS is a creative architect we
would typically use this term if we look
at the building the architect and
designed and this building is beautiful
of course that assumes we can subscribe
to some comments landed there but then
there are more objective constraints
also did the architect do this within a
certain budget did he do this was in
such constrains and he permits did he
build it and certain timeline and so on
so there's a long list of constraints he
had to fulfill in order to create
buildings that just fits all these
constraints now what does this have to
do with landscape I described you can
think of any constraint you have and
that you do not fulfill this creates a
penalty and so the best solution is the
one that has no penalty you did well on
all your accounts all the constraints
are fulfilled now if I look at all the
different designs and I could have come
up with and say ok this design violated
ten constraints as well design violated
five constraints then you see it would
create over the axis of all possible
designs it would sort of create this
cost function that counts how many
constraints were violated and the best
solutions of the most creative solutions
are those that are low in this landscape
so how does a quantum quantum computer
find and reach these low points in a
landscape faster than a supercomputer
so what a typical classical algorithm
does when you have this landscape and
you need to find a low point so the most
popular algorithm is called gradient
descent which is a little bit like what
you would do let's say you and some when
the desert mountains are on to some and
you are supposed to find some water and
you know
to go to a low spot then you might just
look around and say where's the steepest
pass down and then you take a few steps
and you follow the steepest pass and you
keep going down and that brings you to
the valley floor and but now you may be
disappointed oops in this valley floor
there's no water what do you do next now
you cannot keep going down anymore
you're already in the valley floor so
you have to but maybe there's a deeper
Valley past and next mountain ridge but
there are multiple mountain ridges and
often the optimization landscapes that
occur in computing they are not just
two-dimensional landscapes as they are
very high dimensional landscapes so
there are many directions many mountain
ridges and you don't know which one you
have to go over to hopefully find a
lower Valley on the other side and the
only thing that a classical process can
really do is to these over the mountain
ridges escape so physicists what causes
thermal escape because you have to
essentially add noise to your gradient
descent process and shake it a little
bit and then maybe you hop over this
mountain ridge and then with some luck
or maybe are not lucky on the other side
you find a deeper belly but in quantum
mechanics we have what we call the
tunneling effect so this would
essentially allow a system to traverse
the mountain ridge without having to
have the energy to take it all the way
to the rich so they had to escape routes
to cross a mountain ridge one is over
the barrier and one is through superior
and sort of because there's this
additional process the Quenton enhanced
optimizer will have a higher chance
finding low lying minima that's why we
are rather confident to say that if you
buy into my definition of creativity
that a quantum processor or a quantum AI
will be the most creative systems that
we can build however thank you so much
for talking this afternoon is really
exciting stuff I mean
it's it's you know it really feels like
we're on the cutting edge of we're on
the cusp of a whole new realm of
technology at a level that just simply
hasn't existed before and for a lot of
people I think is just enormous ly
exciting and big adventure so good luck
with it and thank you so we've come to
that time of day when we find out what's
been going on at today's plenary
sessions and here is our plenary roving
reporter once again here's Cameron
Cameron what's been going on so today we
had three different plenary comfort
talks three sets of plenary talks the
first one was on language and
consciousness with the great Noam
Chomsky and a whole lineage of Noam
Chomsky's graduate students and their
graduate students Chomsky talked about
put linguistics in the context of
evolution and talked about some of the
promising possibilities of then being
able to create a science of
consciousness and he views consciousness
mostly in terms of a linguistic
capability that are you that's unique to
humans and that's what he wants to focus
on
so 200,000 years ago some weird thing
happened inside of animal brains and it
gave us this capacity to have an
infinite number of thoughts and to
create an infinite number of sentences
with a finite brain and so Chomsky is
interested in figuring out how that
works and and so since the language
faculty came about much later than
earlier faculties like using your voice
and your gestures there's some problems
that happen with linguistics so that you
know it's very difficult to put the
language of thought into the language of
speech and so he thinks that that's a
promising area for future consciousness
studies research to look at specifically
that zone where the language of thought
meets the articulation of language so us
having this conversation right now there
are elements of my thought stream that
are getting deleted and I'm having to
piece it all together and how that works
inside the brain is an area of research
that Chomsky shares
interests in as law as well as Thomas
bevor and Michael Spivey who were the
two other speakers the second round of
talks was on anesthetics and the action
of anesthetics and interesting topics in
quantum biology so that was Matthew
Fisher and Travis Craddock Matthew
Fisher is interested in learning how
pharmaceutical drugs work and
specifically he focused on an
antidepressant lithium which is just an
element and there are different isotopes
of lithium and so he tried to figure out
what's the difference between those
isotopes the only difference chemically
is that they have one more Neutron one
has one more Neutron than the other and
it turns out though that if you give
rats lithium-6 and lithium-7 the rats
that you give lithium six behave very
differently than the other rats so like
they would give the lithium 6 to mother
rats and their mothering behavior would
be completely transformed and so he
thought well if all that's different
about these molecules is that one has a
one more Neutron than the others then
there must be something about the
nuclear spin the way that the neutrons
are interacting that's causing this
biological effect well that's really
interesting for quantum biology because
there so then he looked inside biology
and looked for molecules that have that
are really pop you know all over in in
the body and he found that phosphorus
and calcium when they combined they have
a similar kind of property that their
nuclear spins might be able to play a
role in chemical reactions inside
biology so he's looking forward to a
future where we could do a kind of
quantum neuroscience and try to find out
whether the same kind of molecules that
interact in pharmacology might have a
role to play in cognition so that's
exciting and and Travis Craddock spoke
with us about anesthetic gases and the
different theories that are available
about how anesthetic gases actually work
so he specifically focused on
a quantum biological interpretation
called the quantum mobility
interpretation which Stuart Hameroff is
famous for and on that view the the
microtubules inside the brain are
interacting with the anesthetic gases
and that's producing the loss of
consciousness that you get in anesthesia
so then he talked about what they were
going to do in the future and I think
today's plenary zwerling the had in
common is that all of everyone had been
doing very busy research for the last
year since we last saw them and lots of
new studies one of the speakers had nine
ongoing studies at the same time that he
was trying to tell everyone about so and
the final plenary was on varieties of
non-invasive brain stimulation so there
was magnetic stimulation transcranial
ultrasound transcranial direct current
stimulation and low field magnetism so
we had four speakers talking about the
interesting experiments with those
different kinds of brain intervention
and the effects that it has on mood
enhancing mood on mindfulness on a whole
range of improving people with
depression improving people that have
dementia so that they get better at
tasks and it's certainly a burgeoning
field where you got people developing
new devices to do non-invasive brain
stimulation they're getting more a
little more funding and so it was an
exciting day at the conference full of
all those details it sounds like an
awesome day actually Cameron really this
is one of the best I'd say so we'll come
back tomorrow
at this time and we'll find out what's
what's happened on on let's see where
are we today's Wednesday
so as tomorrow is Thursday we're already
losing track but that's a really great
round out and once again thank you very
much for your excellent work and that's
all for now

[Music]
what's this bring it up on the screen
what I feel time-slowing
it's good story in Elektra she's pulled
us into her time where you might must
resist the urge to dance to organize the
work away you'd have to be a framework
