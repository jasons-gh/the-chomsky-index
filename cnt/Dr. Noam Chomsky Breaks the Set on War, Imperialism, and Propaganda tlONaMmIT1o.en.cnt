you live on 133 bucks a month for food I
should try it because you know how
fabulous I'd look I'm so skinny
I mean camera adds ten pounds I really
really messed up and we're all very
sorry I personally apologize does that
happen white house soup of the day my
favorite radio guy in Fort Lauderdale is
minestrone chicken sausage oh I can't
watch what we're about to do because
you've never seen anything like this
time television
[Music]
hey what's up guys I'm Adam Martin and
contemporary times of consumerism and
superficial commentary philosophy seems
like a dying art which is why I'm
excited to share an in-depth
conversation I just had with dr. Noam
Chomsky philosopher linguists professor
political critic and author of over 100
books the last 50 years dr. Chomsky has
worked out of his MIT office where I sat
down with him surrounded by large stacks
of books papers and memorabilia he's
collected over the years that 84 years
old dr. Chomsky is as sharp as ever I
was able to articulate his unique
viewpoint on everything from media
propaganda to the war on terror so
without further ado my one on one but
dr. Noam Chomsky so much for taking the
time to meet with me it's a great honor
to be sitting here and were in Boston or
Cambridge actually but you know as
someone who was living in the aftermath
of the Boston bombing the chaos what did
you think of the police and media
response to them well I had I hate the
second guess police tactics but my
impression was it was kind of overdone
that there didn't have to be that degree
of militarization of the area maybe
there did maybe not it's kind of
striking that the suspect they were
looking for was found by a civilian
after they lifted the curfew he just
noticed some blood and a street you know
but what I have done to say about police
tactics as far as the media was
concerned it was 24-hour coverage on
television on all the channels also just
zeroing in on one tragedy whilst
ignoring the tragedies incurred well in
fact it across the Muslims after the
Boston bombing there was a drone strike
in Yemen
one of many but this one we happen to
know
because there was a young man from the
village that was hit I testified before
the Senate a couple of days later and
described it and right at the same time
and what he said is interesting and
relevant he's he said that his village
was a nicely they were they were trying
to kill somebody in his village they
said the man was perfectly well known
they could have apprehended what they
wanted
he was a drone strike is a terror weapon
we don't talk about it that way but it
is just imagine if you're walking down
the street and you don't know whether in
five minutes there's going to be a
explosion across the street and from
some place way up in the sky that you
can't see and somebody will be killed
and whoever else is around will be
killed and maybe you'll maybe you'll be
injured of you there that's it that just
as a terror weapon it terrorizes
villages regions huge areas in fact the
most massive terror campaign going on
well long sermon and what happened in
the village is that according to the
testimony testimony that he said that
the jihadis had been trying for years to
turn the villagers against the Americans
and had not succeeded he said in one
drone strike they turned the entire
village against the Americans that's a
you know maybe a couple hundred new
people who will go terrorists if they
take revenge
it's a terror generating machine it's a
terror it's a terrorist operation and a
terrorist generating machine so it goes
on and on that's not just the drone
strikes also the special forces and so
on well that was right at the time of
the Boston Marathon that it's just one
of innumerable cases and it's it is more
than that this the man who was the man
who was targeted for
reason they had the target and that's
just my first Lester's murder there are
principles going back 800 years to Magna
Carta holding that people that cannot be
punished by the state without being
sentenced by a speedy trial of peers
that's only eight hundred years old have
various excuses but I don't think they
really apply but beyond that there are
other cases where which come to mind
right away or should where a person is
murdered who could easily be apprehended
with severe consequences the most famous
one is bin Laden he was there were 80 or
so special forces highly trained navels
Navy SEALs broken his invaded Pakistan
broken his compound killed a couple
people they had captured him he was
defenseless I think his wife was with
him but and under instructions they just
murdered him through his body into the
ocean well without autopsy of that
that's only the beginning the
apprehension of bin Laden and the
assassination and dumping his body in
the ocean and of course the narrative
completely fell apart and also you've
said that you know in the aftermath of
9/11 when the Taliban said we will give
you bin Laden if we if you present us
with evidence which we didn't do no
another proposal was move a sure he
could have pursued it but why are people
so easy to accept conventional wisdom
government narratives with virtually no
question over here I'm here a drumbeat
of conventional propaganda in my view
and it takes a research project to find
other things
and of course at the same time as the
Boston bombings Iraq saw almost its
deadliest week in five years I mean
April was the deadliest month and in a
long time
atrocities going on every day suicide
bombings yet seen the zeroing in on this
tragedy when at the same time our
foreign policy is is causing this
effects these effects and you rockers I
mentioned Magna Carta but which is 800
years but there's also something else
which is about 70 years it's called the
Nuremberg Tribunal which is the
foundation as part of the foundation of
the modern international law and it
defines aggression as the supreme
international crime differing from other
war crimes in that it encompasses all of
the evil that follows now the u.s.
british invasion of iraq was a textbook
example of aggression you know not a
question about it which means that we
were responsible for all the evil that
follows like the bombings serious
conflict arose it's now spread all over
the region
in fact the region is being torn to
shreds by this conflict well that's part
of a part of the evil that follows the
media's lack of coverage with everything
that you're speaking on and I know that
America runs on this nationalism and
American exceptionalism but is America's
severe lack of empathy unique or do we
see this in every country and are we
just growing up an American we just you
know are isolated with our own viewpoint
I think it's true for every great power
that I can think of Britain was the same
Frances the same Germany was unless a
country's defeated like when Germany was
defeated after the Second World War it
was compelled to pay attention to the
atrocities that had carried out but
others don't in fact it was an
interesting case this morning which was
I was glad to see in fact it was finally
there are
the trials going on in Guatemala for of
Rios Montt
it was basically responsible for the
virtually genocide or destruction of the
Mayans and the US was involved in it
every step of the way finally this
morning there's an article about saying
that something was missing from the
trials the u.s. role which is good I'm
glad to see they are of course Reagan
the school of America's do you think
that we'll ever see white war criminals
from and from imperialist nations stand
trial in the same way every journalist
Montes almost impossible
take a look at the ICC International
Criminal Court the black Africans or
other people the West doesn't like I
mean a bush and Blair ought to be right
up there there's no crime and recent
crime worse than the invasion of Iraq
Obama ought to be there for the terror
war but these that's just inconceivable
in fact there's legislation in the
United States which in Europe is called
the Netherlands invasion Act the
Congressional legislation signed by the
president which authorizes the President
to use force to rescue any American
brought to the Hague for trial I mean
yeah you know and speaking of the drone
wars I can't help but think of John
Belanger the chief architect of the
drone policy who was speaking to a
think-tank
recently and he said but Obama's ramped
up the drone killings simply to avoid
the bad press of Gitmo of capturing
suspects alive and trying them at Gitmo
when you hear things like this what is
your response to people who say his
hands are tied he wants to do well
that's like it was pointed out some time
ago by a Wall Street Journal military
correspondent what he pointed out is
that Bush's technique was to capture
people and torture them
Obama's improved that you just killed
them and anybody else's around it's not
that his hands are tied
he's a that's a much more
it's bad enough to capture them and
torture them but just murder on
executive whim and as I say it's not
just murdering the suspects a terror
weapon terrorizes everyone else that's
it's not that anyone's hands are tied
that's what he wants to do I'd rather be
detained indefinitely than be blown up
as well as my family and friends around
me yeah and that terrorizes everyone
else and there's there are recent polls
which show that our public opinion the
results are kind of interesting the they
don't the Arabs don't particularly like
it ran but they don't regard it as a
threat it's ranked very low they do see
threats in Egypt and they were act and
Yemen of the United States is the major
threat Yemen is real slightly above the
US but basically the u.s. regard as a
major threat what why is that
why would Egyptians Iraqis in Yemen II
regard the United States is the greatest
threat they face well it's worth knowing
the controversial Obama policy is
obviously the National Defense
Authorization Act the NDAA which you're
a plaintiff on the case you've also said
that holder V humanitarian law is
actually worse you know providing
material support for terrorism do you
think that both of these policies are
just codifying practices that are that
have already been in place for decades
the NDAA is pretty much codifying
practices that have been employed it was
a little went a little beyond and the
court case in fact is narrow it's about
the part that went beyond authorization
to imprison American citizens
indefinitely without trial that's that's
a radical violation of principles that
go back as I said 800 years I
see frankly much difference between
imprisoning American citizens in the
prison anyone else they're all persons
but we make a distinction and that
distinction was extended extended by the
NDAA the humanitarian law project broke
new ground and there was a concept of
material support for terrorism already a
sort of a dubious concept because what's
how do you decide what's terrorism well
that's an executive women there's a
terrorist list I created by the
executive branch without review without
anyone having any right to contest it
and if you look at that terrorist list
it's it really tells you something so
for example Nelson Mandela was on the
terrorist list until three or four years
ago the reason was that in 1988 when the
Reagan administration was strongly
supporting the apartheid regime in South
Africa in fact a ruling congressional
legislation in order to hate it they
declared that the African National
Congress that was one of the more
notorious terrorist groups in the world
that's Mandela that's 1988 barely before
apartheid finally collapsed and he was
just done that the earth listen till
then or to take another case and 1982
when Iraq invaded Iran the US was
supporting Iraq and one day the Iraqi
invasion
so Saddam Hussein was taken off the
terrorists list it's not a terrorist
we've gotta give him a hey well it's you
know it's it's executive whim to begin
with we shouldn't take it seriously but
there was putting that aside material
assistance meant you know you give him a
gun or something like that under the
Obama administration it's so you give
them advice well let's talk about the
linguistics and language of the war on
terror
what did Obama's rebranding of Bush
administration policies do to
what consciousness the the policy of
murdering people instead of capturing
them and torturing them can be presented
to the public in a way that makes it
look clean its presented and I think
most people see it this way as a kind of
a surgical strike which goes after
people who were planning to do us harm
and this is a very frightened to country
terrified country has been for a long
time so if anybody's going to do us harm
it's fine for us to kill them and some
of the reactions are how this is
interpreted is quite interesting for
example it was a case about a year two
ago when a drone attack in Yemen killed
a couple of little girls and there was
discussion but with a well-known liberal
columnist joe klein he writes for time
he was asked what he thought about this
and he said something like it's better
that four of them are killed and four of
four little girls here so because I mean
the logic is mind boggling but if we
have to kill people elsewhere who might
conceivably have aim to harm us and it
happens that a couple little girls get
killed - that's fine we're entitled to
do that
I mean suppose any other kind of country
was doing that to us or to any anyone we
regard as a human it's credible but this
is this is very common I remember once
when right after the invasion of Iraq
the tomtom Thomas Friedman New York
Times the Middle East specialist
columnist was interviewed on the Charlie
Rose show you know the sort of
intellectuals row and this guy and he
Rosa
what we ought to be doing in Iraq and I
wish I could you got to see the actual
words to grasp it but basically what he
was what he said it's something like
this he said American troops sort of
smash in two houses in Iraq and make
those people understand that we're not
going to allow terrorism and he said
gonna suck on this we're not going to
allow terrorism in our society you got
you better understand it so these
terrorized women and children the in
Basra and Baghdad have to be humiliated
degraded and frightened so that because
so that Osama bin Laden won't attack us
I mean it's mind-boggling and that's the
peak of liberal intellectual culture
supposedly famous atheists like Richard
Dawkins saying that Islam as long as one
of the greatest threats facing humanity
I mean that's a whole nother form of
propaganda the liberal elites
perpetuating this now just neo-cons
right now is a much greater threat well
the media I want to talk to you about
that because obviously that's
instrumental and manufacturing consent
for these policies I mean your book
media control was written a decade
before 9/11 yet it outlines exactly how
sophisticated the propaganda model is
when you wrote that book did you have
any idea how far would come and where do
you see it in ten years I'm afraid it
didn't take any foresight but because
it's been going on for a long time I
mean take the US invasion of South
Vietnam did you ever see that phrase in
the media and when we invaded South
Vietnam John F Kennedy in 1962
authorized you bombing of South Vietnam
by the US air force authorized napalm
authorized chemical warfare to
destroyed crops started driving peasants
into what were called strategic Hamlet's
basically concentration camps where they
were surrounded by barbed wire to
protect them from the guerrillas who the
government knew very well they were
supporting will recall that if someone
else did it but it's now 50 years
over 50 years I doubt that the phrase
invasion of South Vietnam has ever
appeared the press you could hardly I
think it's at a latarian state would
barely be able to achieve such
conformity in fact probably wouldn't be
able to and this is at the critical
dissident end not talking about the ones
who said there was a noble cause and we
were stabbed in the back you know which
intimately Obama now pretty much says
but it's become so sophisticated and I
don't know if it's just because I'm
younger and I've seen it you know just
in the last 10 years and at in the post
9/11 world the media sophistication and
and my question is you know with the
internet and the advancement of
Technology do you see a reversal of this
trend where more people are just going
to be making this form of media and
propaganda relevant or do you see a
worsening somebody the internet gives
options but options of which is good
it's good to have more options but the
print media gave plenty of options you
could read because in journals if you
want to do the internet means you can
read them faster okay that's good but
you know if you think back the that was
a shift from saving the invention of the
printing press that was a much greater
step forward than the invention of the
Internet that was a huge change the
internet is another change smaller one
and it's it has multiple characteristics
so on the one hand it does give access
to broader range of commentary
information
if you know what to look for you have to
know what to look for however on the
other hand it also provides a huge mass
of material which is well let's put it
politely off the wall and the how isn't
a person without background framework
understanding isolated alone sitting in
his living room how you're supposed to
decide another form of propaganda is
education you've said that you know the
more indoctrinated you are I'm sorry the
more educated you are the more
indoctrinated you are and that
propaganda is largely directed toward
the privileged how dangerous is it to
have an elite ruling class with the
illusion of knowledge perpetuated in
advancing their own worldview on
humanity and it's just this perpetual
feedback loop of the ruling class this
old as the hills I mean there have
always been every society has had some
form of privilege daily who claim to be
the repositories of understanding and
knowledge and want to control what they
call the rabble make sure that they like
the people who say we want to be ruled
by countrymen like ourselves you know
the people's sores not by knights and
gentlemen who do better presses they
don't want people to have thoughts like
that so therefore there are major
propaganda systems it's kind of striking
that propaganda is most developed and
most sophisticated in the more free
societies of the public relations
industry which is advertising industries
mostly propaganda a lot of it commercial
propaganda but also you know folk
control that developed in Britain in the
United States to freest societies and
for a good reason it was understood
roughly a century ago that the people
have won enough freedom so you just
can't control them by force you
therefore have to control the beliefs
and attitudes the next best thing
it had always been done but it took kind
of a quantum leap forward about a
century ago with the development of
these huge industries devoted to as
their leaders put it the engineering of
consent if you read the founding
documents of the PR industry but Edward
Bernays he says we have to make sure
that the general public are incompetent
they're like children if you let them
run their own affairs you have all kind
of trouble the world has to be run by
the intelligent minority and that's us
and we therefore have to control we have
to regiment people's minds of the way in
army regiments at soldiers for their own
good just as you don't let a
three-year-old and run into the street
you can't let people run their own
affairs I'm going to be you get these
country men like ourselves who know the
people sewers you're going to be in real
trouble and and that's a standard idea
and it's taken one or another form over
the centuries but and in the United
States it's institutionalized in two
major industries none are so hopelessly
enslaved and those who believe that
they're free and those gothe who said
that thank you so much dr. Chomsky
amazing to sit in front of you and take
the time to talk to you about all these
things I really appreciate it thanks I
appreciate it and I'll leave it on that
powerful note as always thanks for
watching and I'll see you right back
here tomorrow
