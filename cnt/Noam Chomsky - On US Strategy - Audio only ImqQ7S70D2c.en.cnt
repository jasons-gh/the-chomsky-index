I'd like to start with an event of
considerable significant that the place
last fall last September this was the
announcement of the national security
strategy of the United States what's
been called the Imperial grand strategy
which was the framework for the invasion
of Iraq and undoubtedly many things to
follow and it was has been high on the
global agenda ever since the
announcement the strategy report
declared quite explicitly declared the
intention of the most powerful state and
history to maintain its dominance over
the world through the use of military
force it's the one dimension in which it
ranks supreme competitors and other
dimensions the official formulation is
that our forces will be strong enough to
dissuade potential adversaries from
pursuing a military buildup in hopes of
surpassing or equaling the power of the
United States that caused a lot of
shudders around the world including the
US foreign policy a lead the next issue
the very next issue of the main
establishment journal foreign affairs
journal of the Council on Foreign
Relations had an article by a well-known
international relations specialist John
I can vary discussing the grand strategy
in these words he said the grand
strategy begins with a fundamental
commitment to maintaining a unipolar
world in which the United States has no
peer competitor a condition that is to
be permanent so that no state or
coalition could ever challenge
United States as global leader protector
and enforcer the strategy renders
international norms of self-defense
enshrined and article 51 of the UN
Charter almost meaningless in general it
dismisses international law and
institutions as being of little value in
fact if you read the security strategy
you'll find that they're scarcely even
mentioned the going on with eikenberry
the new imperial grand strategy presents
the United States as a revisionist state
seeking to parlay it's momentary
advantages into a world order in which
it runs the show it will prompt others
to find ways to work around undermine
contain and retaliate against us power
the strategy may appear to be successful
in the short term given overwhelming US
military force but he goes on it
threatens to leave the world more
dangerous undivided and the United
States less secure a view that's exactly
widely shared within the conservative
foreign policy a lead the rhetorical
rattle radicalism of the Imperial grand
strategy is highlighted by contrasting
it with the conceptions of world order
that are that happened to be reiterated
at about the same time by the president
of the International Court of Justice
the World Court this is the very
conservative US judge judge fabled who's
been a lone defender of the United
States at the court for many years
presenting the he was presenting the ICJ
report annual report to the General
Assembly of the United Nations and he
said as the court enters the first
century of the third millennium it
stands for international law not
international lawlessness for the
peaceful settlement of international
disputes in conformity with
international law not the will of the
more powerful party for international
organization not for international
Anarchy or for a state sovereignty which
purports to be above the law it stands
for human rights rights that can be
effectively realized only within
functioning systems of law local
national and international you couldn't
construct a more sharper antithesis than
this conception from a conservative US
Justice heading the International Court
of Justice and the Imperial grand
strategy that was announced shortly
afterwards the Imperial grand strategy
is often described in the press and
elsewhere as authorizing preemptive war
that's a mistake an important one
preemptive war has a meaning within the
framework of international law a
preemptive war mayor on the border of
being permissible under the existing
framework of international law so a
preemptive war for example would be say
planes were flying from across the
Atlantic
with the clear intention of bombing the
United States and the US Air Force was
sent to shoot them down before they
spawn and may need to attack the bases
from which they came that would be the
gray area thats called preemptive war
might fall under Article 51 which grants
the right of self-defense against an
armed attack that's pre-emptive war but
that has actually nothing to do with
what was proposed on last September that
was it's more more accurately called
preventive war meaning you attack
someone who you believe may pose a
challenge to you in the future actually
even the term preventive war is a little
misleading because there doesn't have to
be anything prevented so for example the
invasion of Iraq and prevent anything it
was done for other reasons wanted to
attack Iraq preventive war just means
war and it's an extended already in its
first first instance of the doctrine to
include attacking anybody you feel like
actually that's been made pretty
explicit after the failure to discover
the weapons of mass destruction that
were the pretext and I mean pretext
because I don't think anybody really
expected to find them that were the
pretext for the war after that's failed
and sort of disappeared from the news a
high US official of the Bush
administration explained that the
doctrine of preventive war goes beyond
what had been announced the original
announcement was that we're going to
prove
development of weapons of mass
destruction by potential enemy and since
there weren't any the doctrine has to be
expanded and now we the new doctrine the
new expanded version says that we can
carry out a preventive war against
anyone who has the ability and intention
of developing weapons of mass
destruction well ability everyone has
I'm in Arlington High School has the
ability to develop weapons of mass
destruction and I suspect if you
somebody related to and detailed
inspection of the kind of doing in Iraq
and the under them in the backyard
they'd probably find something left over
from the chemistry or biology lab they
could indicate that they had the ability
to develop weapons of mass destruction
as far as intention is concerned that's
completely in the eye of the beholder so
the doctrine that says we can strike
anybody with the ability and intention
to develop weapons of mass destruction
that means very simply we can attack
anybody we like on our own authority and
since international laws and
institutions are gone they're simply hot
air as a beating local professor of
international law really recently put it
in foreign affairs that means we just do
like we rule the world by force and the
weekend saying about well that's that
was last attempted the one of the events
that took place last ember there were
two others also important the less broad
and scale one event that took place last
September simultaneously with the
announcement of the
Imperial strategy was the beginning of
the drumbeat of propaganda about the
danger to our existence posed by Iraq up
until then it was us for a nasty place
but starting last September's eminent
threat to the survival of the United
States began with Condoleezza Rice on
low vision warning that the next thing
we find out about Iraq would be a
mushroom cloud presumably in New York
nobody else seemed to expect anything
and shortly after the Congress was
frightened into or railroaded into
passing a resolution authorizing the use
of force because of the grave threat to
the national security of the United
States hosed by the government of Iraq
and then came a massive onslaught of
government media propaganda does not
with the presenting the message that
Iraq was a imminent threat to us
security and insinuating that Iraq was
responsible for 911 was tied up with
al-qaeda and other international
terrorists was planning more and that
had its effects it's is this a very
frightened country and it's
unfortunately not easy to frighten
people by the end of September and for
the subsequent months majority the
population came to believe this so
around sixty percent of the population
varying month to month it did it believe
that Iraq was an imminent threat to
the security of the United States the
United States is alone in the world in
that respect with the neighboring
countries for example despised Saddam
Hussein but then in fira in fact they'd
been trying to reintegrate direct back
into the region for some years of her
strong us objections that includes
Kuwait and Iran both of which were
invaded and attacked by you Saddam
Hussein so they have little love for him
but they knew he wasn't dangerous and
they know perfectly well exactly what US
planners knew and I presumed the
editorial offices note that Iraq was the
weakest country in the region it had
been smashed by the 1991 war had a
decade of sanctions which devastated the
civilian society with horrifying effects
that had been effectively disarmed by
the UN inspections and in fact its
military expenditures were about a third
those of Quade which has ten percent of
its population and far below the major
powers in the region said nobody guarded
as a threat except in the United States
we're about sixty percent of the
population regarded it as an imminent
threat to us there's nothing new about
that the congressional resolution if you
read the wording of it is very similar
to a declaration of a national emergency
by ronald reagan in nineteen eighty five
when he declared a national emergency in
the united states because of the threat
to the security of the United States
opposed by the government of Nicaragua
which
cousin you're old enough to remember it
was a Nicaraguan sir only two days
marching time from Arlington Texas
waiting there copies of mine come as
Secretary of State Schultz put it and
we're just about on the verge of
destruction well you know that worked
too and it's only one of many and bear
in mind that the people in office now
are the same people who were doing it
then this administration is pretty much
recycled from the more reactionary
elements of the reagan-bush one
administration so it comes as second
nature the on the it also over the
following months a substantial part of
the population ultimately about half
they came to believe the complete
fabrication that unknown to be
fabrication that Iraq was involved in
911 and that it had relations with
al-qaeda there's no intelligence agency
in the world who believes that or a
strategic analyst nevertheless it was
instituted sufficiently by effective
propaganda that when Bush gave his
victory speech on the Abraham Lincoln he
was able to declare the victory of war a
victory in the war against terror
because of the connections of direct to
al-qaeda which were fabricated by his
public relations specialist as he
probably knew certainly the press the
reporter didn't know well that had a
fact if you look closely the there was a
close correlation between support for
the war and belief that Iraq is a threat
to our security was carried out 911 and
planning to do it again and that's not
really surprising if you believe those
things there's good reason to go to work
for a preventive
war and the so the propaganda was indeed
spectacularly successful unique in the
United States if you take away the
factor of panic in the United States
induced by spectacular propaganda
opposition to the war here was
approximately like everywhere namely
he'll overwhelming but this is here
that's what were worried about that was
the second major event that took place
in September the third major event
connected with it was the onset of the
congressional midterm election also in
September and that is connected the it
was understood in fact karl rove the
ministration campaign madison manager
had already informed public and
activists over the summer that if that
they'd better go into the election on a
national security issue if they went
into the election with people worrying
about pensions and the medical aid and
Enron and the rest of the familiar
litany then the administration would get
smashed but if they get shifted to
national security issues at a chance
people will especially a frightened
population does tend to huddle under the
umbrella of power
and it barely worked they sort of sneak
through the election by a couple of tens
of thousands of votes and if you look at
the exit polls people maintain their
preferences for the parties but they
shifted their priorities so guess if you
cared about medical care your pension
and so on they would be opposed to the
administration but if concerned about
security overwhelmed it fairly so they
managed to sneak by and get another two
years of power and Karl Rove has already
announced that that's what they're going
to have to do for the year for the
presidential election in fact the wall
street journal one of the more honest
journals report went during this Abraham
Lincoln extravaganza two weeks ago the
staged event pointed out that that's the
opening that's the opening of the
presidential campaign the presidential
campaign is going to have to be
conducted with the image created the
image right out of central casting of
the war president who saved us from
destruction by Iraq and this by then
you're going to be saving us from
destruction from some new dragon it will
be slain the Republican campaign was
delayed so it opens in mid-september in
new york September 12 you can write the
speeches right now okay but that's the
way it's going to have to be done and
they understand it perfectly will they
are carrying out a major assault against
the general population they know it
people know it you gotta divert
attention away from it and there are a
lot of ways to do it the only way that
England's ever figured out is fear for
the people in Washington now it is
second nature that's the way they
they're following a script which is very
close to the first
their first ten year in power 1981 1992
just take a look at that period and you
see the script laid out very clearly
through that jury to they instituted
domestic policies which were quite
harmful to the population wages
stagnated or declined working hours went
to the highest in the industrial world
poverty rates for the highest in the
industrial world the there was a major
attack on labor rights and so on and
that was extremely unpopular fact Reagan
ended up in 1992 as after the Bush
administration was over as the most
unpopular living ex-president in the
United States with the exception of
Nixon Nixon slightly the amount and that
was true right through the ages so when
Reagan won what's called a landslide
victory in 1984 I mean he got about
thirty percent of the electorate by a
considerable majority people who voted
opposed his legislative program they
voted for other reasons among them fear
there was a constant that was constant
pushing the panic button right through
the 1980s started right away with Libyan
hit men wandering the streets of
Washington and 1981 going to assassinate
our cowboy leader who was hiding in the
White House tanks managed to save that
before the where that was as if it just
managed to barely get out of that one
and the
were building a air base in Grenada
which they were going to use the bomb
the United States well you know US air
force could help us elite by but we
managed barely in time to save ourselves
from that one and we were standing tall
as the cowboy leader told us six
thousand US Special Forces succeeded in
overcoming the resistance of about a
couple of dozen armed and Cuban
paramilitary workers and they got eight
thousand medals of Honor for it but we
were safe after that came Qaddafi was at
it again there was an attack on the
administration from the right wing
especially on George Shultz Secretary of
State he was militant enough and
fortunately even they discovered a
Libyan invasion of the Sudan across six
hundred miles of desert again with the
US and Egyptian Air Force was unable to
do anything about it the plot was so
well hidden that neither Egyptian or
Sudanese intelligence knew about it and
in a few American reporters very few who
went to investigate of course found that
it was a total fraud but it was it was
enough for Schultz to get up on
television and strike heroic poses tell
us how Qadhafi's back in his box because
of error powerful cowboy and so on then
came the Nicaraguan today's marching
time from Texas and then I went on and
on one thing after another
a lot of it was domestic those of you
here well remember I'm sure how George
Bush the first managed to win the
election his presidential election
namely by playing a very vulgar race
card Willy Burton card so it was race
crime drugs Nicaraguans Libyans one
thing after another and the population
was kept enough in a panic so that they
could stay in office and push through
their reactionary agenda now they want
to do it much more extensively maybe
read the Treasury Department than the
Department of the budget of the Bush
administration economists have just
released a study showing anticipated 44
trillion dollar deficit in the next
couple of years which will be a fiscal
train wreck the economists are
commenting on it it was kept out of them
it was supposed to go into the budget
mr. februari but they kept it out
because they didn't want people to know
about it when they're trying to push
through another tax cut for the rich and
almost everyone recognizes is on purpose
they want the fiscal training they have
a fiscal train wreck you have to have
what's called fiscal responsibility
meaning cut back extending not cut back
spending that goes into the pockets of
rich people so they'll be plenty of that
but cut back on social spending
eliminate Medicare Medicaid Social
Security funding for the states so that
they'll have huge deficits eliminate
public schools and so on and just roll
back any of the progressive legislation
of the past century it's a pretty
awesome program and it's gotta be
conscious in this a way that
be doing this without understanding it
and how are you going to get people to
accept it well exactly the way that karl
rove described frightened terrified
that's what happened last September and
that's what's going to happen for the
next collection that to understand and
it's hard to visit so that's those are
the three events national security
strategy the propaganda about the Iraqi
threat and the election which happen to
be a midterm 1 but the same things gonna
happen next time just as it happened
right through the 80s I mean we have to
really be blind to see that the script
is being replayed in a much more extreme
form well the national security strategy
is a doctrine and if you announce the
doctrine and you want people to take it
seriously and make sure that they know
you mean you have to implement it so you
have to have a what's called a test case
with the New York Times call the Petry
dish to make people understand you
really mean this well the test case for
the doctrine has to meet several
conditions first of all it has to be
defenseless I mean nobody there you know
brain functioning would attack anybody
who can shoot back so you have to pick a
defenseless country and it has to be one
that's important enough to conquer so
there's no use picking some country in
central Africa that
what he wants thirdly you have to be
able to present the target as an awesome
power either about commit genocide or
about the Destroyers okay Iraq qualified
on all three counts it's completely
defenseless and they knew it it's a very
important it's right in the heart of the
major oil-producing regions of the world
itself has the second largest reserves
in the world and controlling those
resources has been a centerpiece of US
policy since the 1940s Britain before it
and it's not hard to portray it as an
ultimate evil all you have to do is pick
up the rhetoric you hear from Tony Blair
and colin powell and george bush which
you've heard a thousand times about how
this man is so evil that he even
committed the ultimate crime he uses
poison gas against his own people
obviously can't be allowed to survive on
always missing from the impassioned
orations is that he did it with our help
because we didn't because you in fact
help the people now in Washington
because they didn't care so they
therefore over Road congressional
attempts to condemn the atrocities went
on supporting their friends and I'm
saying providing them with badly needed
aid agricultural means for developing
weapons of mass destruction had nothing
to do with the war with
ran and on without a change after the
war with Iran was over fact he went on
up to the day of the invasion of quake
when he committed a real crime
disobedience you don't do that but he
wanting Cassar on people that's fine the
same surname would there were
parliamentary objections but if you look
at them you find some names missing like
all of New Labour a Tony Blair Jack
Straw Geoff hoon all missing Thank here
but now you can bring it up to prove how
evilly is actually we've just seen an
interesting illustration of that in the
last couple of weeks I'm sure you saw
they're digging up his horrendous mass
graves throughout much of the Iraq where
you there are thousands of people buried
from the Saddam Hussein's a murderous
repression of the interactions of April
1991 and that's portrayed with proper
horror and again with the usual or
mission Saddam Hussein was authorized to
do that by George Bush number one Colin
Powell and the other thick Cheney and
the others who are now in charge because
who had complete command of the air and
could have easily stopped in one minute
but they authorized Saddam Hussein to
use advanced weapons and military
helicopters and others to crush the
rebellion and what's more if you look
back you'll even find the explanations
so Thomas Friedman was in the chief
diplomatic correspondent of the New York
Times voice for the State Department
essentially in the New York Times
explain that makes us unhappy but we
have to do it he said the best of all
worlds would be an iron-fisted Iraqi
military junta ruling Iraq the same way
Saddam Hussein
ended but without his name because he's
an embarrassment and since we can't find
the replacement this is the second best
what cannot be allowed is for Iraq to be
run by its own people that would be
unacceptable and if there was rebellion
that's what would happen but I can't be
tolerated in fact the one consistent
strain US policy over the years has been
that the things vastly but the
consistent part is they're not going to
run it either will run in person some
basil will run it well known as a secret
you know it right in New York Times or
anywhere else in 1991 but it's somehow
miraculously missing in any event Iraq
met all three conditions given for a
period some subservience and
subordination on the part of the
educated classes which is not hard to
get its defenseless it's it's extremely
important and it can be portrayed as the
ultimate evil and he was and certainly
no one who supported so them Hussein and
those actions should have impunity which
happens to include everyone in the White
House right now but that part isn't
mentioned well the the the point of
carrying out such an action is to
establish fertile to gain control of
Iraq which is important in itself but
also to establish with what's called a
norm in
national law you have a doctrine you
apply that establishes a new norm of
course norms aren't established when we
countries carry out actions only when
those powerful states carry out actions
so for example it takes a humanitarian
intervention the supposed to have been a
new norm of energy monetary and
intervention established in the 1990s it
could debate the cases but that's the
standard version why and some questions
arise why was the alleged new norm of
international intervention humanitarian
intervention established in the 1990s I
mean why not for example in the nineteen
seventy in the 1970s there did take
place to military actions which since
the Second World War are by far the most
significant in ending really terrible
atrocities the first was the Indian
invasion of of what's now Bangladesh in
1971 which put into an end horrendous
atrocities millions of people the second
was the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia
in 1979 which put it into paul potts
atrocities drove khmer rouge out of the
country just at the time when the
atrocities were peeking there's nothing
in the 1990s it comes even close to this
we could argue about whether those two
actions qualify as humanitarian
intervention but there is not the
slightest out that they put to an end
major atrocities vastly beyond anything
that happened in the 90s so why isn't
that the decade
if humanitarian intervention well
because countries like India and Vietnam
can't establish norms they don't rule
the world so therefore that's not a norm
if the u.s. does something no matter how
shaky the argument that establishes a
norm furthermore the United States was
strongly opposed to both of those
interventions the Indian invasion was
the u.s. threat actually threatened war
the primary reason was that India was
spoiling some photo ops for Henry
Kissinger who was planning a secret trip
to China through Pakistan and this kind
of you know spoiled the opportunities oh
he was furious in the u.s. sent
nuclear-armed aircraft carrier into the
Bay of Bengal and threatened sanctions
and so on in the case of Vietnam was
even worse Vietnam was bitterly
announced for having gone for getting
rid of hot the u.s. imposed very harsh
sanctions on them it supported a Chinese
invasion to punish them for this crime
and the u.s. turned immediately to
supporting Pol Pot directly both
militarily and diplomatically so
obviously that couldn't have established
a new norm but when the powerful states
do it it can be a new norm and now we
read eloquent descriptions of the
international law literature about how
the new norm of preventive war has been
established by the US invasion of Iraq
and now that there's a norm now you can
go on the next step and we come in fact
expect more of the same well let's take
a look at that doctrine that was
announced last september's one important
question to ask is how new it is and it
is in some ways new
a good reason why the world was startled
and upset by it but it's not quite as
new as is often believed there are
presidents when Colin Powell says it's
not that president he's quite accurate
so let's have a look at a couple of
those one important precedent at the
opposite end of the political spectrum
was in was just 40 years earlier in 1963
when Dean Acheson respected elder
statesmen senior adviser to the Kennedy
administration gave a lecture to the
American Society of international law
and which he explained to them that if
he said that no legal issue arises if
the u.s. responds to a challenge to its
power position and prestige okay so if
anyone poses a challenge to the power
position and prestige of the United
States and the United States responds by
violence or any other way it's not a
legal issue notice that his wording goes
well beyond the national security
strategy they at least talk about a
threat you don't talk about a threat
just to challenge the position power and
prestige atchison said remarks were
particularly significant because of the
timing this was immediately after the
cuban missile crisis that simmered down
it was already known then that the
missile crisis came very close to
leading to a nuclear war how close we've
just learned last October it's pretty
shocking but it was pretty well
understood
already the Cuban Missile Crisis was the
result of an international terrorist
campaign carried out by the Kennedy
administration against Cuba which was
building up until October and during the
crisis the the actions the terrorist
actions continued they were briefly
called often than they were picked up
again right after the crisis was over
was a major factor in the lunatic
reaction of putting nuclear-tipped
missiles there this was a international
terrorist campaign aimed at regime
change pretty familiar words these days
right after that as the international
terrorist campaign and illegal economic
warfare were picking up atchison
explained to the legal profession that
there's no legal issue when the United
States carried out these actions why
incidentally was it carrying out these
actions actually we are lucky to live in
a very free society and we have access
to government planning documents beyond
any other country in the world as far as
I know and we know exactly why they were
doing because a ton of documentation has
come out secret documentation the
problem was what US planners Kennedy
Johnson planners called Cuba's
successful defiance of the United States
they were defying a policy that goes
back a hundred and fifty years nothing
about the Russians the policy of 150
years was this region it has to be
subordinated to us power and they were
challenging that and that was successful
to finance
that's unacceptable further onyx even
more unacceptable was the fact that
there was a threat in quoting Arthur
Schlesinger an internal document there
was a threat of the spread of the castro
idea of taking matters into your own
hands which might appeal to other people
in the region who were suffering from
similar circumstances and that's got to
be cut off right away so therefore the
terrorism and the economic warfare were
legitimate and if they came close to a
terminal nuclear war that's the way the
cookie crumbles we're then going to go
on and in fact do well those are the
circumstances of atchison statement
that's at the left-liberal end of the
spectrum discover the other end of the
spectrum the right-wing the current
incumbent in 1985 the Nicaragua which
was being subjected to an international
terrorist campaign carried out by the
current incumbents in Washington brought
a case to the World Court in which they
asked court to order the United States
to terminate the terrorism and pay
reparations the United States refused to
accept world court jurisdiction and that
if we threw its earlier the grant of
jurisdiction I was explained by Judge
Abram so fair who was legal adviser of
the State Department he explained it
publicly he's that in the early days of
the United Nations we could count on
other countries to go along with what we
said just true given the conditions of
power they had to he said but by now
many other countries in the world just
don't agree with us and therefore we
will have to reserve to ourselves the
right to determine what falls within the
domestic jurisdiction of the United
States in this case terrorist war
against Nicaragua well that's the other
end of the spectrum another clear
precedent for the national security
strategy however these and their many
other cases but these two examples are
different from what happened in
September in two crucial respects
etchison and so fair were describing
policy and in fact they were describing
it accurately that's the way it works
but they weren't proclaiming an official
policy that's quite a difference
furthermore atchison and so fair we're
talking within the family and so I doubt
if many people know about this you know
about it if you're inside a narrow
circle of people who pay attention to
such things but the population is not
allowed to know that these are the
guidelines of policy we're supposed to
believe all sorts of things about you
know benevolence and wilsonian this and
that and so on and so forth Tony inside
and closed circles that you're supposed
to know about this on the other hand the
national security strategy of by
September was announced loud and clear
they want everybody to know about it
they want everybody to know
that we are a revisionist state which
uses force to achieve its end and we'll
do it without limits that was announced
as clearly as possible the rack were
made it clear if anybody didn't believe
the words and that is a significant a
very significant difference there are
other precursors and they're worth
looking at two so take just to
understand ourselves which is presumably
a good thing to do the National Security
Council which is the top planning body
was established after the Second World
War 1947 its first memorandum NSE number
one called for military support for
underground operations in Italy along
with national mobilization in the United
States quoting it now in the event the
Communists obtain domination of the
Italian government by legal means okay
mother's there was election coming up
and it looked as if it wind resistance
at anti-fascist resistance at my name
prestige and Italy have strong labor
movement but if they won the election by
legal means the United States would
declare a national mobilization and
support paramilitary and other
activities inside Italy overthrow the
government okay that's pretty strong
statement fortunately they were able to
win the election by withholding food and
reinstating the fascist police and the
diverting Marshall Plan they'd only to
the right people and so on so they
didn't win the election by legal means
but if they had that
would happen what's we can go back even
earlier so right for the United States
got into the Second World War before
Pearl Harbor there were high level
meetings going on of the State
Department of the Council on Foreign
Relations planning for the post-war
world and they knew this big event the
Second World War they didn't know if the
US would be involved but plainly it was
going to have effect and they naturally
carried out careful planning and that
plans are worth reading they can have
been public for 60 years but they're
never read the and they're extremely
important not because only because they
were high level planning because but
because those are the plans that were
pretty much implemented after the war
the this is the war peace studies group
of the State Department of the Council
on Foreign Relations and before the u.s.
got into the war in 1940-41 they held
that the in the postwar world the United
States must hold unquestioned power and
it must act to limit to ensure
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that interfere
with us global designs and they
recognized further that the foremost
requirement to secure these ends is the
rapid fulfillment of a program of
complete rearmament which is a central
component of an integrated policy to
achieve military and economic supremacy
for the United States and to a bar any
exercise of sovereignty that might
threaten it well you'll notice that
that's the national security strategy
Jane but again with the same two
reservations it was plans but it wasn't
an open announcement of an official
policy plans were indeed implemented and
it's in sight it's for the family
not for the general public to know about
even though who was public well at that
time these ambitions were limited to
what they called the non-german world it
was assumed at that time that Germany
would end up holding some part of the
world and the non-german world would be
organized as what they called a grand
area which would include the Western
Hemisphere the former British Empire and
the Far East after Russia beat back the
Nazi armies of Stalingrad it was clear
that Germany was coming defeated and the
plans were extended to cover as much of
Eurasia as possible well that's earlier
presidents differing and the important
respect that i mentioned track of time
well let me just make a couple of
comments about the implications of all
of this so it takes there are some
problems implementing the grand design
three major problems one in the
oil-producing regions one in Europe and
one in Asia they're all kind of the same
problem but different show up in
different ways so in the Middle East the
primary concern of the United States has
been and for obvious reasons a control
of the world's major energy resources
and there's disruptive factor there
namely the israel-palestine conflict so
one problem is to somehow dampen down
that but that problem and gain regained
supportively oppressive and tutorial
Arab states which is kind of shaky
because of this well there's and this is
understood so for example michael
ignatieff at harvard who's when
supporters of the iraq war had a long
article in the new york times magazine
early January sporting the war in which
he pointed out accurately that the chief
danger in the Iraq gamble is to enforce
a piece of Palestinians and Israel
otherwise the region will remain in
constant ferment it may blow up and the
US will lose its control of the world's
major energy energy supplies well how do
you deal with that front pages tell you
that there's something called a roadmap
which is a map towards the president's
vision of a Palestinian state I'm sure
you've noticed that there's a
journalistic convention that when you
mentioned George Bush you have to
mention in the same paragraph his vision
or his dream or something like that and
there's usually a picture accompanying
of George Bush staring off into the
distance that is vision with its eyes
narrow and so on one interesting thing
about these visions and dreams is that
although we're supposed to worship them
no one has a clue what they are you know
nothing has ever said about what the
vision is and that's important the
public relations people understand that
so if you want to find out something
about the vision you're gonna have to
look at the event you know the events of
history documentary record all forbidden
territory you're not allowed to go into
but that's the only way to find out what
the vision is well the fact is that the
vision of the Palestinian state is not
George Bush's that was a international
consensus back in the mid 70s there was
a very broad international consensus for
to state settlement on the international
borders on without going into the
details it's been blocked unilaterally
mid-seventies until this minute by the
United States it simply wouldn't allow
vetoed Security Council resolutions
voted alone with Israel of the General
Assembly and in every possible way has
blocked that vision and nothing has
changed in every state the same was true
right through the Camp David 2000
negotiations you had about the
magnanimous and generous offers that
Clinton and Barack were making and how
the terrible Palestinians turned and
down but if you look carefully yoga
there's an easy way to test that very
easy way to evaluate how generous and
magnanimous the offers were that's to
look at a map but can't do that because
the media and commentary journalists
were very careful not to publish a
madman so if you search you won't find a
map unless you go about the disin
publications or scholarly sources or the
Israeli press for example with it
published the maps and this is very good
reason why the maps weren't published in
the United States as soon as you looked
at the maps you found that Clinton
Barack proposal sort of made South
Africa four years ago looked pretty good
when they were establishing the advanta
stint the Clinton Barack proposals broke
the West Bank in 24 almost separated
canton's full points of connection
between them one of the northland in the
central central region one in the south
three of them separated from a little
area of east jerusalem which is the
center of os nain commercial and
cultural life but is disconnected and
then of course all disconnected from
Gaza so kind of a band whose net
proposal meanwhile Clinton and Barack
were busily using your dollars paid for
by US dollars of course to build
substantial settlement programs
infrastructure and so
to establish the facts of the Bantams
banta stand proposal which was to be
implemented at Camp David well what's
happened since let's play in Bush bush
for our actions that you can look at not
just visions so a good place to look as
the United Nations which has meetings of
the General Assembly of RIA every winter
Bush's first intervention at the United
Nations was to veto a Security Council
resolution calling for the dispatcher of
international monitors to reduce the
level of violence and territories that
is the way to do it but they don't want
to do that they want to allow the
violence to continue because they know
perfectly well it's overwhelmingly a
u.s. effect Israeli violence and they
want that to continue even if it does
lead to violence against Israelis so
monitors were blocked at the same time
the missus december 2001 switzerland
which is the repository of the geneva
conventions and responsible for them
switzerland called another meeting they
do it regularly of the High Contracting
Parties that's almost every country in
the world to Geneva to deal once again
with the
applicability of the Geneva Conventions
to the occupied territories well in the
past the United States supported that so
for years the United States voted with
the majority in fact it Security Council
everybody on the applicability of the
Geneva Conventions to the occupied
territories under Clinton the United
States moved to AB stanchion vote
against or for so they can continues to
be reformed Bush switched policy gun
essentially under minded he boycotted
the meetings in Geneva and therefore
when the u.s. boycott something or
vetoes it it's a double veto for one
thing that's blocked and for another
thing it doesn't get reported and it
doesn't enter history so this wasn't
reported and entered history and that's
quite important because the Geneva
meeting reaffirmed this is the whole
European Union even England everybody
else reaffirmed that just about
everything that the United States and
Israel are doing in the occupied
territories is a breach of the Geneva
Conventions and many of them are grave
breaches that means serious war crimes
under US law the geneva conventions are
not a joke they were instituted in after
the Second World War to formally
criminalize the crimes of the Nazis the
relevant on the fourth convention crimes
of the Nazis occupied territories so the
US doesn't want publicly to say they
don't apply but what it's doing a
silencing them and Bush took at a stage
forward by undermining the meeting well
that's december 2001 december 2002 he
went beyond there's an annual resolution
at the General Assembly which reaffirms
a Security Council
Lucien of 1968 passed unanimously United
States as well ordering Israel to
terminate and withdraw from its actions
in occupied East Jerusalem okay it's
meaningless because the United States
never enforces it but at least it's been
voted year after year this year for the
first time wish administration shifted
position on that and voted against that
resolution well if that's men seriously
that ends any possibility of a political
settlement it means it's authorizing
Israel's occupation of east jerusalem
jerusalem and jerusalem by now is a huge
area cutting out of being piece of the
West Bank it's nothing like Jerusalem
used to be so that virtually cuts the
West Bank in two if the u.s. mented and
this every reason to think that they do
bushes next statement about Middle East
was in February of this year it was
called you know highly touted in the
press is his most significant comment on
the Middle East repeated right away by
Powell most of it was just usual
boilerplate would be nice to have peace
and so on and so forth but there was one
significant statement in it namely he
said that us-backed Israeli settlements
could continue without limit until
progress is made in the peace process
and he'll decide when progress is being
made that's again a significant shift in
policy up until now everything's been
gestures to say that the settlements are
illegal or maybe unhelpful or something
but this was a straight authorization of
them if you look at the road map we'll
go through the details but it
essentially repeats that says nothing of
it borders says nothing in fact it says
something vague about terminating
NAT what's called natural growth in the
settlements but the aerial shall run the
official man of peace is called by but
immediately told the Israeli Knesset
that don't worry about it you can build
their for your children and your
grandchildren so my soulful relation
with President Bush guarantees that and
that's correct so what's happening is
just a continuation and extension of the
policies of undermining any hope for a
peaceful political settlement there
that's if you look at the facts of
course if you keep the division well
then you can believe it's about one
final comment it was going to late but
this is a really important topics that
should be mentioned another comment has
to do with Europe and Asia especially
Northeast Asia there's an there's a
long-standing problem in post-war
international affairs and that is
whether Europe will be subordinated to
the United States who will pursue its
own path Europe's rich place big place
on the scale of the United States
economies on a scale of the United
States educated and so on it's
conceivable that it might go off on its
own path and that's always been a
problem the United States was in favor
of the integration of Europe for all
kind of reasons but it was wary that it
might take off on its own this was it
described very lucidly by Henry
Kissinger when he was national security
adviser and Secretary of State back in
1973 1973 was called the year of Europe
celebrate the unification for Europe and
Kissinger gave most called the year of
Europe address and which he informed the
Europeans that they
have to understand that Europe has we
called regional responsibilities within
the overall framework of order
maintained by the United States in other
words don't think about posing a
challenge you can carry out here you can
take care of you know immigration in the
Mediterranean or whatever your regional
responsibilities are but it's within the
framework of order maintained by the
united states that continues a Europe
means primarily France and Germany
that's the industrial financial
heartland of Europe and a large part of
the hysteria about France and Germany in
the last couple of months which is kind
of interesting in itself but a large
part of hysteria has to do with concern
that Europe might strike out on an
independent course as it could okay the
same problems arising in Asian Northeast
Asia which includes japan south korea
china eastern Siberia is by now and has
been for some years the most dynamic
economic region in the world it's gross
domestic product is considerably larger
than the United States it's growing fast
it has about half the financial reserves
in the world it's a major source of
foreign direct investment in and by now
it has in its an integrated region has
plenty of resources eastern Siberia and
China have resources the industrial
countries of the region need the
resources is a very natural unit and
it's significant accepted military force
it's on a par with the United States in
Europe well that's a concern because
Northeast Asia also could
move on its own towards independence and
a lot of fussing about North Korea and
this is part of what's behind it in the
regional countries all of them want to
pursue some kind of negotiated
diplomatic settlement North Korea
somehow integrated a horrible place but
they don't want a war that would be too
awful they want to move to integrating
it into the region somehow and that
makes a lot of sense from every point of
view pipelines from Siberia through into
South Korea through North Korea or
expansion of the trans-siberian railroad
into South Korea would maybe important
moves towards integrating the region and
as one high-level US planning document
really recent analysis really put it
pipelines through North Korea could
enhance regional stability and provide
cheap alternatives to oil imported from
the Middle East well one of the ways the
u.s. controls Northeast Asia and Europe
is by controlling its energy resources
if they move towards independent energy
resources and other resources that would
be a spur towards separating into a
independent area and with the resistance
to the national security strategy that I
can vary quoted this is exactly what's
feared that other parts of the world are
going to break out of the system create
their own areas which could lead to
unpleasant conditions if the u.s. really
does insist on barring any challenge by
violence as it has stated that it will
these are the things that I think are
right me often
well first of all I don't agree that it
doesn't make any difference I think it
makes a huge difference so for example
if just look over history of recent
years you can see the difference the
above first time I lobbied Congress
actually first and last time was with
Howard Zinn we went down in april
nineteen sixty-five to talk to our
congressional representatives and
senators this was right after Lyndon
Johnson had expanded the war in South
Vietnam to the bombing of the north I
won't run through the details but we
couldn't even talk to them Tip O'Neill
wouldn't let us into his office
saltonstall who was the senior senator
said well you know kind of let us give
him a rap and says interesting but the
president has spoken what he talking
about Kennedy who was in a junior
senator said you know sounds kind of
interesting but I'm not much my
brother's a brother takes care of
foreign policy issues of the people in
Congress or the only ones who can even
talk there were a couple of Republican
representatives or at least kind of
helpful but that's just changed over the
years I'm by now there there's much more
access and much more pressure because
the populations change they are under
popular pressure and to the extent that
they're under popular
sure they can they will be thinks
they're not going to stand up alone very
few do I mean you can count them on the
fingers of one hand there's a extruding
and you know occasionally you'll find
someone else but these are people who
are happy to say I'm your leader when
there's a enough people around for them
to be the leader of and it has to be not
just large and numbers but active and
committed these things aren't achieved
in a minute you know the anti-war
movement in Vietnam took years before it
got off the ground the situation today
is far more advanced than it was then
you didn't have hundreds of thousands of
people on the street before Kennedy
started bombing South Vietnam in 1962
it's different and it's not just habits
everything else to civil rights women's
rights environmental issues all sorts of
things that countries just changed and
it's changed because and we done you
just we all have to understand these
things don't happen fast these are long
struggles of abolitionism took forever
you know I it didn't happen by SAVAK by
one demonstration so yeah I have to
create the groundwork for it and in fact
in the United States it's my feeling is
it's an easy pretty terrific situation
for organizing people the only way
people are kept in line by now is by
terrifying them with phantoms and the
fam and they are phantoms you know and
it's not hard for people to get to
understand that but it's not going to
happen easily you know it's going to
take work because people really are
afraid and you can overcome that fear
but only by heart border
same oh I'm the media have their own
agenda which is the sport power if very
if the general population changes and
the culture changes and people's
commitments and beliefs change the media
will partially reflected otherwise not
in the same way that I mean for example
when the first you may know well go back
to nineteen sixty-five again 1965
happened to be the first public
demonstration against the international
demonstrations against the Vietnam War
and there was a demonstration here on
the Boston Common the dem that didn't
take place it was broken up by
counter-demonstrators violently I was
supposed to be one of the speakers on my
way gotta live less bizarre couple
hundred state troopers around the Boston
Globe covered it supporting the counter
demonstrators and denouncing the people
who were daring to stand up and say
maybe we shouldn't bomb North Vietnam
well that's changed over a couple of
years and it didn't change because their
genes changed it changed because of the
country change and that's where you have
to work
you know if there were a magic key to
answer to open these stores somebody
would have told us about it a long time
ago and there isn't the only way to deal
with it is by patient constant
educational and organizing activities
and we have to face reality it is a very
frightened country it's not new and it's
not just that I'm saying takes a crime
crime in the United States is
approximately like other industrial
countries fear of crime on the other
hand is way beyond other industrial
countries same sir of drugs in other
country other countries like ours
industrial countries drugs are
considered sort of a problem you know
you deal with them here it's considered
it's turned into a threat to our
survival you know if Canada is going to
make the perfectly rational move of not
arresting people for can throwing them
in jail forever for having small amount
of pot people here will go crazy
they make cut off relations with Canada
okay those are things that you know
those are the results of long and
effective propaganda programs they go
way back and it does go way back I mean
some of you will be old enough to
remember I'm sure that back in the early
siclen in Lexington where the back in
the early 60s when my kids were in
school they were literally being taught
to hide under desks in the Lexington
schools to protect them from atom bombs
well you know we can laugh they didn't
laugh and there is no place in the world
where anybody was there was anything
like this I mean for a long time it's
been an extremely frightened country and
that is exploited by unscrupulous
leaders and they're going to try to
exploit it for the next election just as
robizzy and the only way to deal with
this is to get to people and help them
participate with them so that they can
under get us a sane grasp of reality and
that can certainly be done and then it's
been done on all sorts of issues we
don't have to go back very far to see
how it's done I mean I mentioned a
couple of cases linked another one I
mean there is an original sin in this
country very straightforward original
sin namely why are we here you know what
happened to the people who were living
here well you know what happened you
know is that they were exterminated
millions of like it wasn't small well
until the 1960s that was simply not an
issue it wasn't an issue in scholarship
that wasn't an issue in consciousness
when I was a kid we played cowboys and
Indians and we were the Cowboys are
killing the Indians it I can't say it's
has been a that it's so marvelous today
it isn't but there's an enormous change
in that respect because people's
awareness and consciousness has changed
on issue after creation and it doesn't
happen by a gift it happens by hard
dedicated constant work and it takes
time I mean take something like women's
right and the century before it became
right on the agenda
sunday assume assuming my voice holds up
well a patriot act is a pretty rotten
act as a lot of horrible things in it
but so far it has been used mostly
against very vulnerable people where
they're pretty sure they can get away
with it you know like illegal immigrants
so on they certainly want to use it
against everybody there's a real fascist
streak in the administration there's no
doubt about it and they would like to be
able to really undo the whole civil
libertarian tradition but it's not so
simple because people have are not going
to accept it easily with regard to the
Freedom of Information Act there haven't
been many changes I'm in the bush
administration like the Reagan
administration wants the government to
be free from scrutiny by citizens they
are not conservatives they're
reactionary status they don't think that
the population has any right to know
what the government is doing so the
Reagan administration very radically
undermined efforts to get declassified
documents from 30 years earlier and the
Bush administration is trying to do the
same thing but so far they haven't
succeeded very much and whether they
succeed or not is up to us no I mean
they can't really do these things if the
citizens won't allow it they're pushing
it as far as they can go and they're
pushing very hard so just a couple of
days ago the office even made the papers
too there is a legislation which has
been upheld by the courts for the last
20 years the Alien Tort Claims Act which
actually goes back to the 18th century
which allows people to bring suits
against foreign foreigners or their
local affiliates for acts like torture
so forward so we're in suit in American
Court against a you know Indonesian
torch burns on and against preparations
well one of the suits that's going on is
an important one squirt cup through the
courts in California is a suit against
Unocal big oil company for using what
amount to slave laborers and laborers in
Burma and it's being filed under this
act and it's moving along at the
Ashcroft Justice Department just
intervene with 80th first time to with a
amicus brief to support unical and to
call for termination of any use of this
act against for torture victims and
slave earlier victims and so on I mean
they really want to cut out civil
liberties at every point you can look at
the new Patriot to act which they're
thinking of their trying to sneak it
through it's leaked you know hasn't been
made public it's leaked on the internet
law professors are written about it so
I'm they are actually intending to
claiming the right to take away
citizenship on simply on what they call
inference so if the Attorney General
infers from some pattern of action of
yours that you're a terrorist support or
whatever that means they want to be able
to take away your citizenship that's
unheard of any any Western society but
they will go as far as again and they
have to be stopped or else it will be in
bad trouble as for why the Palestinians
accepted the roadmap its first of all
the Palestinian Authority accepted the
roadmap what the Palestinians may have
in mind is another matter the and but I
can understand what I mean whether it
would have done it
they don't have a lot of alternatives
they're hoping very they're under an
illusion i think but they're hoping that
somehow the u.s. is going to change its
traditional position on this there's no
evidence word but they're hoping for it
and there's only one way to realize that
hope and that is for us here the force
that change to take place they can't do
anything about it I think we have time
for about two more questions
yeah well there has been some
interesting stuff coming out about the
actual planning for the war and it's
been pretty obvious that they had made
their minds up quite early and they're
most of everything was my house for show
but for those of you who want to look at
it a little more closely there's a quite
a good series that came out and the what
I think is the best newspaper in the
world the London Financial Times
business newspaper best international
business newspaper had a detailed
investigation of the planning not as far
as they could unearth from talking to
people on the National Security Council
and so on and what they ended up with
it's plausible is that by mid-december
the Bush administration had decided that
was definitely going to be a war and
their reasoning is interesting tells you
a lot the reasoning as described and
it's plausible the reasoning was
described by a high official who was
involved in the National Security
Council Planning he said by early
December of the administration had the
feeling that in virtually quoting it
that a tin-pot dictator is mocking us
and we don't let tin-pot dictators mock
us that's called establishing
credibility in Internet
affairs are in the Mafia which are very
similar you da mafia don does not allow
some local tin-pot to mock him and if
you have the biggest military force in
the world and you know you're immune
from retaliation you don't let them mock
you either so we'll go destroy the
country or where we feel like doing
that's very it fits very well with
mentality and it bears on Iran I mean
the problem with Iran is it's not it
fails the first condition of those
conditions three conditions actually it
fails to of the conditions you can't i
miss ugly place in many ways which can't
claim that it has a horrendous record
like a plenty of other states in the
world but the worst thing is it's not
defenseless and since it's not
defenseless it can't be attacked the so
what the US has been trying to do for
some time it's not just starting out is
to try to carry out subversive
activities internal to iran which all
fragmented or maybe cause pricings or
something so there's pretty good reason
to believe that for less at least for
the last year and maybe farther back the
US has been trying to stir up azeri
nationalist movements in the north which
do want independence and have some
justification in fact the u.s. is now
trying to do it appears what the
Russians did in 1946 which is one of the
early Cold War confrontations where they
tried to support Azerbaijani
independence within Iran which would
have split up for rent and the u.s.
Berkeley went to war over that at the
time but now it looks as though do is
trying to do the same thing they're very
complicated dealings going on in that
region with the you know azeri Turkish
Israeli Lions you know
trying to take power control there's
pretty good evidence that the good part
of the Israeli Air Force which is not a
small Air Force it's bigger than more
technologically advanced than any NATO
air force accept you as a lot of its
stationed in eastern Turkey and they're
apparently flying reconnaissance over be
read as part of a preparation for some
kind of actions probably not a direct
attack because the red can fight back in
fact the u.s. is now driving he ran
towards developing weapons of mass
destruction oh you know just almost
transparently and you know intelligence
agencies have pointed this out strategic
analysts pointed it out I mean the u.s.
is making it clear to the world and has
been for some time that if if you're
defenseless we're going to attack you so
you better have a deterrent and there's
only two kinds of deterrent one is
terror and the others weapons of mass
destruction so the Bush administration
is quite openly proliferate causing
consciously causing proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and increase
in terror I'm you know every
intelligence agency in their own
analysts pointed out to them the
invasion of Iraq that Iraq had whatever
you think about what I'm saying he had
nothing to do with al-qaeda and those
guys there's worst enemies but attacking
Iraq would increase the threat of terror
and apparently that's what's happening
reports from around the world or that
with the build-up of the invasion and
the invasion itself recruiting for
al-qaeda style organizations is by not
fast and we just saw two major terrorist
attacks which may well be the effect of
it but they're perfectly willing to face
that I mean they don't want terror but
they don't really mind that much you
know if there are terrorist attacks or
weapons of mass destruction you know
nice but it's of low priority as
compared with higher ones like ramming
through the domestic agenda and
controlling the world and furthermore
they know perfectly well that they can
exploit terrorist attacks there could be
a serious terrorist attack in the United
States if you really want to be
frightened correctly take a look at the
heart Redmond report on terrorist
threats in the United States high level
planning analysis that just came out
good people and what they say makes
sense I meant as horrendous
possibilities of it's like a cookbook
coat you know we can do many of those
things that very much talent and it's
going to happen and it will you can
increase the likelihood of it by
refusing to ask where it's coming from
if you react to it by violence you
increases I'm every terrorist specialist
mostest if you look at the grievances to
try to deal with them and so unwell and
could reduce the threat they're doing
the opposite and the same is true with
Iran I mean they probably are forcing
around to accelerate efforts if they
have them to develop weapons of mass
destruction for perfectly sensible
reasons how they're going to defend
themselves from a US attack and maybe to
get involved with terrorist
organizations so there's no evidence
that they are on the u.s. claims that
they're involved with terrorist
organizations but you have to look at
the definition of terrorist so high on
the US list of terrorist organizations
very high as Hezbollah okay why is that
a terrorist organization well because it
drove a u.s. client out of Lebanon in
Israel invaded Lebanon 20 years ago
killed around 20,000 people stayed on
ran a brutal military occupation in the
south and they were driven out by
Hezbollah okay that makes it as Bowa
terrorists
just like the current administration the
guy powell rumsfeld the rest they
regarded the nelson mandela and the
african national congress is in their
words one of the more notorious
terrorist groups in the world because
they were resisting our allies South
Africa so they got to be really cautious
about what's called terrorism i'm not
saying because people are nice people
probably you know probably not but their
main the main charge against them is
that they drove a u.s. client out of an
illegal military occupation and it's
undoubtedly true that iran supporting
well
I mean right son I mean then look the
people running Washington now happen to
be an unusually dangerous crowd within a
spectrum that isn't that broad that's
what I was trying to suggest by quoting
Dean Acheson and the planners of the
Franklin Roosevelt period and and others
I mean it's a narrow spectrum and
nevertheless within that spectrum there
can be differences in those differences
can these guys have so much power there
in their hands that small differences
can translate it to huge outcomes so I
think it makes good sense to prevent
care about bush but the crowd around him
from wielding power on the other hand
any Democrat I mean Democrats have done
the same things you know what has to be
done has changed the environment in
which any of these guys are going
through something and yeah just what you
said is exactly correct it's this 40
years of work have made a huge
difference not just in this area in
every area anybody our age knows it so
take my own University a mighty have
been there for about 50 years if you
walk through the halls of MIT today it's
half women about a third minorities
people casually dressed which reflects
relation personal relationships means
much authority and subordination if you
walk through the same walls 40 years ago
we've been white males well-dressed ties
and jackets so beat in you know those
are just changes that have taken place
everywhere and they're not insignificant
they've changed the country and they
change politics and they change the
media and everything else and it doesn't
come easily the fear is very real but
you know that's the kind of
element that in a way it's easy to
combat it's hard to combat security
forces who are going to take you away
and blow your brains out three in jail
and torture you okay we're lucky we
don't combat that what we combat is a
culture of fear and subordination that's
a lot easier to deal with so but it's
hard work
