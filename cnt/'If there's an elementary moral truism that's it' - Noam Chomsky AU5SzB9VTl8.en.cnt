well I already gave you the answer to
what I think we ought to do
let's go through your questions
I blame America and that is false I
blame you and I blame me and I blame the
rest of us who are allowing this to
happen right in front of our eyes
that's not blaming America secondly
secondly when you say that the United
States had nothing that it's the world
economy that had to do with Afghanistan
that's just not true the Afghanistan has
always been a very poor place and there
are many reasons for its current straits
but two primary ones are called Russia
in the United States the United States
Russia in the United States and the
1980s practically destroyed the place
not to help the Afghans as soon as the
place was destroyed they they pulled out
and the forces that the United States
had organized to harass the Russians
then took over there now called the
Northern Alliance and that led in the
early 90s to what Human Rights Watch
calls the worst period in Afghan history
as these various criminal forces that
the US had organized with its allies
just tore the place apart they probably
killed 50,000 people I mean they were
carrying out mass rapes and slaughters
and destroyed Kabul in fact they were so
horrendous that when the Taliban came in
in the 1994-1995 they were actually
welcomed because at least they were
bringing some kind of order to the place
and driving I think mad madmen who had
been left behind from the US war
meanwhile the US didn't do anything for
him so when you say first let's not
blame America it's blaming people like
you and me who can do something about it
there's no abstract entity America that
acts and we had a lot to do with this
quite a lot to do with it there plenty
of other forces too you say the Taliban
could solve the problem by just handing
him over to according to salt the
Taliban could solve a lot of problems by
disappearing you know I'm sure I'm been
strongly in favor of that for a long
time however I have no way of making
them disappear see like I suppose we
were in Russia in the 1980s you know
somebody could have some and some
dissident was criticizing the Russian
invasion well a commissar could have
stood up and said look what do you is I
am the Russian invasion why aren't you
criticizing what the Afghans are doing
to each other yeah that's the standard
commissar align we know what to think
about it you and I are responsible for
what you and I can do and what we do we
have no moral responsibility for what
other people do that we can't affect we
may hate it but we can't do anything
about it like we could have a debate the
discussion right now about the crimes of
Genghis Khan and we might be correct
about it it would have no moral value
whatsoever might have some historical
value same with the crimes that are
going on in Sri Lanka you know I can't
think of anything to do about them fine
then have an academic seminar but don't
think it has any moral value when you
tell me what the Taliban can do it's
exactly the same the moral value of that
is zero yeah they could do a lot of
things for example one thing they could
do is what you said turn them over to a
third party oh the problem with that is
the US has refused to allow it now are
they serious and that offer that's been
going on for a couple of weeks well we
don't know because every time the offer
is made George Bush stands up and says
we're I'm going to talk to you we're not
going to negotiate with you we don't
want turned over
let's has nothing to do with how rotten
the Taliban are yeah they're rotten a
lot of rotten things in the world we
should be if we're serious we should be
concerned with what we do and what we
can do if there's an elementary moral
truism that's it people don't understand
that they're just not an Amaro
what about your amount what about your
analogy so let's say there's a killer in
a house and incidentally we don't nobody
knows where he is
first of all they don't even know that
he's the person notice they don't have
any evidence against it I mean there's
evidence that his networks are in the
background
yeah that's son almost certainly true
although no evidence is presented like I
said it's prima facie plausible but they
don't know that it's him he may be
telling the truth when he says he wasn't
involved and there's some reason to
believe it in fact a good deal of the
foreign press and commentators believe
it because it just doesn't seem credible
that he could have carried it out or
initiated it so they don't know that
he's the perpetrator and they don't know
where he is they haven't a clue where he
is so what the writer so let's pick your
house analogy if you like you say that
there are people there were going to
defend him are those the 7 to 8 million
Afghans who we're trying to starve to
death are they defending it no no there
is victims there not defending it the
people we're killing our innocent
Afghans not people who are defending
Osama bin Laden they're the victims of
the Taliban they're the ones we're
attacking is that you're in the analogy
you made is an interesting case and you
could talk about it in some seminar it's
got nothing to do with this what's going
on here when the New York Times tells us
that food shipments have been cut back
to the point where the number of people
now at risk of starvation since
September 11th has increased by 50% to
7.5 million that's another two and a
half million people at risk of
starvation zin september 11th as a
result as they point out correctly of
the threat of u.s. bombing and the
terror it's caused and so on and that
withdrawal of aid and of international
workers well those people are not
defending men Laden those are perfectly
innocent civilians who have nothing to
do with it except that they're victims
of the Taliban who we meaning you and I
not some abstract entity are consciously
acting to murder ok if we can't face
that we have no right talking about this
problem
