you
I've never been entirely happy with that
slogan of my many Quaker friends with
whom I shared plenty of experiences
about speaking truth to power we should
be speaking truth about power but not to
power rather to the people who are going
to get rid of it and that's a slightly
different slant on the thing I think
maybe it doesn't ring as well but it
seems to me more accurate
well as you all know we're the meeting
our meeting happens coincide with the
50th anniversary of the United Nations
the other end of the country and it is
almost inevitable I guess but even
appropriate that we should take this
time to think seriously about hunters of
world order as they were then what the
prospects are for them now and what the
factors are that have determined them
and will continue to determine them well
50 years ago there were two conflicting
visions of the new world order of the
day you're only hearing one of them in
the commentary on the United Nations and
it's in fact only one of them that gets
publicly articulated but there was
another one they're both highly relevant
today I think the one that one hears all
the time is the vision of the United
Nations and all the wondrous things we
hope for and are dedicated to the United
Nations may now be facing its demise
because of its alleged failure and
bringing about these marvelous things to
which we're committed the second vision
is what sometimes called realism in
international relations theory which is
critical of what they call the
utopianism of that accompanied the
forming of the United Nations and that
still resounds and the rhetoric and the
realist vision was also articulated 50
years ago in fact with great clarity
perhaps most clearly by one of the most
respected statesmen of the 20th century
in fact speaking for the victors in
World War 3 Winston Churchill one of the
World War two sorry that's the next one
speaking for one of the in one of the
big three one of the victors
he explained at the time fifty years ago
that in his words the government of the
world must be entrusted to the satisfied
nations who wish nothing more for
themselves than what they had our power
placed us above the rest we are like
Richmond dwelling in peace within our
habitation rather ample habitations and
we must keep the hungry Nations under
control or they'll be danger well that's
the realist vision earlier in the
century in fact at the peak of British
power right before World War one
Churchill articulated this vision with
greater clarity in internal discussions
of the British Cabinet which have only
recently been Declassified released here
he said we are not a young people with
an innocent record and a scanty
inheritance we have engrossed to
ourselves and altogether
disproportionate share of the wealth and
traffic of the world we have got all we
want in territory but our claim to be
left in the unmolested enjoyment of vast
and splendid possessions mainly acquired
by violence largely maintained by force
often seems less reasonable to others
than to us so we have to teach them
regular lessons and reasonableness and
in fact in this internal secret meeting
he was going for an increase in the
military budget so that the lessons can
be taught better a sanitized version of
that did reach the public with all the
offending phrases removed but that's the
actual version and a very good one I
thought to add that the more humane
among the conquerors didn't always find
the mez measure so reasonable for
example Adam Smith who bitterly 200
years ago bitterly condemned what he
called the savage in just
this of the Europeans who as he saw very
clearly were brutally creating the first
world third-world divide that's now so
dramatic and was much less so at the
time in fact virtually undetectable at
the time created as he pointed out by
the savage injustice of the Europeans
well Smith Adam Smith was a figure of
the Enlightenment pre-capitalist and in
fact anti-capitalist in fundamental ways
and he was also smart enough to detect
the fundamental illusions of the realist
position one of them was that contrary
to Winston Churchill the rich men are
never satisfied rather as Adam Smith
pointed out they will always follow what
he called the vile maxim of the Masters
of mankind all for ourselves and nothing
for anyone else
second the we who are enjoying their
vast and splendid possessions acquired
by violence were not the people of
England or France or the United States
and so on except for accidental
exceptions rather as Smith put it the
principal architects of state policy
design it to ensure that their own
interests are most peculiarly attended
to however Grievous the impact on others
including the people of their own
country which is quite a valid
observation the principal architects he
went on to say were the merchants and
manufacturers that's changed now it's
the huge transnationals and financial
institutions but the picture is valid he
was no fool so to correct the realist
illusion story the realist vision with
Adam Smith's insights it comes out like
this the rich men of the rich societies
will pursue their vile Maxim seeking to
expand their vast and splendid
possessions which they have gained by
violence and maintained by force
resorting to savage injustice when
necessary and
who don't play that game will fall by
the wayside the lot of the vast majority
of the population is just to serve and
to suffer that's the realest vision
incidentally these observations of Adam
Smith's and Churchill's can be
generalised to domestic forms of
property and so-called property rights
and possibly even to a proposition
that's being debated not too far from
here but I leave that to you
well that's one vision of world order
the other was the vision of the United
Nations or at least the rhetoric that
accompanied its founding and I won't
review that because we're engulfed in it
all the time and a flood of such
pronouncements presented with great self
adulation as heir permanent and noble
commitment since you know all this by
heart I won't waste time on it we can
ask
realistically however whether the people
who produced the rhetoric have ever
believed a word of what they were saying
or whether either consciously or maybe
not too far below the surface they
actually adopted the realist vision that
was advocated by Winston Churchill and
corrected and condemned by Adam Smith
that's a fair question and I think
historical practice provides a rather
clear it's not particularly flattering
answer to it well there are of course
plenty of people who are deeply
committed to the vision of the rhetoric
and who hoped and often sought to make
it a lot more than that I suspect that
that includes the vast majority of the
population of the world which is why
reality always has to be masked in such
so much secrecy and deceit after all
easier to tell the truth why construct
the illusions also this includes some
fairly prominent individuals but power
has always resided elsewhere those were
the visions of World Order then we know
which one succeeded and I don't think
it's fundamentally different now going
back to the United Nations in the United
States attitudes toward the UN
the ones articulated that we can read
the ones that are articulated by the
educated classes folks like us they have
oscillated all over the place throughout
these last 50 years from great praise to
utter contempt I'll return to that at
the end suggesting a kind of a realist
principle that gives I think a simple
explanation for the variations but first
limit let's take a look at the major
arguments that are now current as to why
the United Nations has failed in its
mission and why they get rid of it and
what all this tells us about the
realities of world order there are two
basic failures of the United Nations
that appear in all the discussions one
is that during Cold War it was paralyzed
and then there was this moment of hope
after the Cold War ended but the
illusions were shattered by the rise of
ethnic conflicts and the failure of the
United Nations to deal with them that's
the basic story so to give a couple of
representative quotes from the moment of
hopefulness around 1990 the I'm quoting
from leading columnist sand editorial
writers in the Washington Post in the
New York Times but this is perfectly
typical it was a flood of this stuff
I've got a lot of it in print if you're
interested it's virtually Exceptionalist
so here's typical examples uh during the
long cold war years the Soviet veto and
the hostility of third world nations
made the United Nations an object of
contempt of scorn to many Americans who
were rightly appalled by the sight of
grim-faced Soviet ambassadors casting
Veta vetoes and starving out of Security
Council meetings and shrill anti-western
rhetoric from the third world but with
the end of the Cold War this is from
1990 with the end of the Cold War in
1989 in 1989 Soviet policy changed and
that brought about a wondrous sea change
in the United Nations which can finally
work the way it was designed to that's
completely typical of a flood of
rhetoric from that period then came the
disillusionment the era of ethnic
conflicts replaced the Cold War the
United Nations again failed to deal with
them so
maybe the time has come to bid farewell
that more or less encapsulate the story
well let's have a closer look at these
two eras of modern history and what they
actually tell us which i think is a
little different with regard to the Cold
War there's again a standard version I
won't waste much time on it because too
familiar the it was articulated for
example by President Kennedy the
communist world he said from Havana to
Moscow to Payton Peking as it was in
those days through you know Saigon and
so on the Communist world he said is a
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
planning to take over all the rest his
right-hand man Robert McNamara
elaborated he said that Soviet
aggression has no historical parallel
its goal is total obliteration without
any hint of moral restraint anywhere and
in the entire literature of Marxism and
communism so therefore our stance is
defensive we are defending civilized
values from the monolithic and ruthless
conspiracy which aims at total
obliteration there's a lot of stuff like
that I won't go on there's also a kind
of a more sober version of this which
you find in the better scholarship so
for example and let me turn to that
takes a John Lewis Gaddis whose delete
may be the most respected of
contemporary diplomatic historians and a
major cold war historian as well who
pretty much accepts what's called the
Orthodox version of the Cold War's on
nowadays sometimes called post
revisionist for those of you who know
this stuff rather realistically he
traces the Cold War to 1917 agreeing
with George Kennan and many others and I
think that's right and he explains that
the of course it was an immediate
invasion of Russia right after the
vulture group the coup revolution or
take over whatever you call it
he there was immediate invasion and he
explains that as defensive the west
carried out a defensive invade
instantly on the side that invasion was
taken pretty seriously
so Britain for example used poison gas
which at that time was the ultimate
atrocity this is right after World War
one poison gas was usually reserved to
what were called recalcitrant Arabs and
uncivilized tribesmen among whom it
would spread a lively terror I'm again
quoting Winston Churchill from secret
documents also worth reading but in this
case it was possible to use the ultimate
weapon even against white people not
just Kurds and Afghans who Churchill was
talking about so I was taken very
seriously the defensive invasion but
let's go back to why it was a defensive
invasion
well Gaddis explains the reason is it
was a present it was a preemptive strike
it was taken in order to prevent
potential Soviet actions so therefore it
was defensive as he puts it
it was undertaken in response to a
potentially far-reaching intervention by
the new Soviet government in the
internal affairs not just of the West
but of virtually every country in the
world namely the revolutions challenge
to the very survival of the capitalist
system so that's serious business now
what was that challenge well obviously
it wasn't a challenge by military
conquest nobody claims that that was
true in the time some claim that it was
true you know years later in certainly
Gatiss like other serious historians and
the internal record also discounted for
the later period but for this period
it's not even under debate so that
wasn't the challenge rather the
challenge was a demonstration effect of
an alternative social alternative
development model which it was feared
might have great appeal to not only in
the traditional service areas it's now
called the third world but even at home
among working people and the poor and
the industrial societies themselves that
incidentally was a prospect that very
greatly concerned Lloyd George in
England would
Wilson here and others and incidentally
that remains if you look at the
documentary record the dominant theme
until the record runs dry which is now
in the 1960s so you go all the way
through up to this a interchanges
between Kennedy and Prime Minister
Macmillan in the early 60s it was always
fear of the demonstration effect of
successful development it was the
perceived success of the so-called
communist model an undo it communism but
it was the so-called success of that
model that was considered the threat
which is entirely understandable when
you compare what was going on there to
what was going on in comparable Western
domains and maybe educated Americans
can't see that but people around the
world can see it very well because they
are known benefit from our education
which prevents us from seeing what's
obvious and was indeed obvious to
planners now of course Stalin in
particular carried out horrifying crimes
maybe some of the worst of history but
these awesome crimes are totally
irrelevant to the story and that's again
pretty clear from the documentary record
so it takes a Truman Truman liked Stalin
he admired it he said he was honest he
said what goes on in Russia is none of
his business
there would be a disaster if anything
had this all in private it would be a
disaster if anything happened to Stalin
this is around 1945 and he said in fact
he could get along fine with Stalin as
long as the United States got its way
85% of the time that was the issue
Churchill was the same after he's late
as after Yalta that means February 1945
Churchill and internal cabinet meetings
when Britain was defending Stalin as you
know honest man we can trust great man
so on and so forth the crimes were
completely irrelevant they knew about
them of course but that's not
significant and that fits into a very
traditional pattern if it stood I'm
Hussein Tokyo's heart though you go
through the list the crimes are
irrelevant that in close up to the limit
so it includes that admirable Italian
gentleman as President Roosevelt called
the man
brought fascism to Italy who was greatly
admired it includes even Hitler in
internal records up until the late 30s
when he started to get out of line its
disobedience that's the crime not the
crimes now if anything is clear in
history that is it's the record on that
is completely overwhelming and it's also
true of Stalin the couple of years
before the Kennedy McMillon discussions
early 60s on the demonstration effect
President Eisenhower and Secretary of
State Dulles in again an internal secret
discussion since Declassified they
highlighted the central issue they were
lamenting what they called bizzle quotes
the ability of the communists to appeal
directly to the masses and to gain
control of mass movements something we
have no capacity to duplicate and the
reason is that the poor people are the
ones they appeal to and they have always
wanted to plunder the rich now as
Eisenhower and Dulles understood their
position on who should plunder whom was
going to be a pretty hard sell so it was
kind of like an unfair competition in
the you know in the general arena and so
that's an old worry goes back to the
founding of American constitutional
system if you read the debates over the
in the in 1787 over the constitutional
in the Constitutional Convention most
strikingly and most interesting is James
Madison who was the main framer and it
was his ideas that got incorporated and
he warns very strongly against the
danger of allowing a democratic system
to develop he discusses what would
happen if they allowed it to develop in
England which was then the model of
democracy said you know the majority the
population will undermine the rights of
landed proprietors and obviously we
can't allow that the our system has to
be designed he said and was designed so
that in his words that so the government
will fulfill its primary responsibility
and the prime responsibility of
government is to protect the minority of
the opulent against the majority
just yet these people out here are
always trying to plunder the minority
the opulent and that has to be prevented
and the constitutional system was
designed to prevent it and that theme
runs right through all of all of our
history in the actual history
now I'm only sampling from a very rich
record which suggests Surratt a
different perspective on the Cold War
that different perspective in fact I
think is reinforced pretty powerfully
when you look further and it tells us a
lot about the future as well one place
where you can look further is in the
very rich record of Declassified
planning documents which stress quite
forcefully that the major threat to US
interests is what is called sometimes
radical nationalism or economic
nationalism that calls for improvement
in the low living standards of the
masses and development for domestic
needs on the principle that the first
beneficiaries of a country's resources
should be the people of that country not
foreign investors
that's a conception that must be
destroyed in all its forms that's a
constant theme these are all quotes
constant theme right through the
internal planning record at the highest
level exactly as it was with the British
before us and I presume for other
countries too but I haven't examined the
records of France and other countries
the same conclusion is strongly
supported by a look at the public record
and that's obviously too great to sample
but it's it's substantial and quite
intriguing so just take one pretty
dramatic case of it a few years ago you
recall in 1986 the World Court condemned
the United States for its what they
called its unlawful use of force in
other words international terrorism or
aggression against Nicaragua and for
it's illegal economic warfare against
Nicaragua that was 1986 in the World
Court us of course refused to accept the
judgment Congress immediately responded
democrat-controlled Congress responded
to the World Court judgement by
increasing by a huge amount under
million dollars the
US aid to the international terrorists
who were carrying out the unlawful use
of forces American agents and what the
what was used to rammed through the you
know the real thing that was most
efficiently rammed through and enabled
the Reagan administration ran this
through was the appeal to what was
called the Sandinistas revolution
without borders they had actually
announced a revolution without borders
they were going to conquer the world
these guys in the garage and they
denounced it and since they denounced
that we had to defend ourselves with
another one of these preemptive strikes
so therefore you know too bad about the
World Court or anything else we'll go on
with international terrorism at a
massive scale now the revolution without
and that was all over the press that
journals you know went on and on big
propaganda theme right for a long time
and it was a kind of an interesting it
wasn't totally false it was interesting
and true in an interesting way when you
look at it there was a basis for it the
basis for it was indeed a speech by
Thomas More fading son minister who in
which he said that every country has to
carry out its own revolution and we
can't do anything about other people but
we would like to create a society that
will be a model that others will want to
follow and that's in that sense he said
our revolution transcends borders that
was the actual text it was known like
the fact as soon as the Reagan of the
propaganda system started using this as
a threat of conquest it was exposed and
prominently like right in The Washington
Post but it didn't matter it was true
anyway and in a sense it had it
expressed a deeper truth the deeper
truth is that the threat was the same
the demonstration of threat and that's
the same as military conquest so
therefore we have to defend ourselves by
violence against the threat but an
alternative might be proposed that
people might choose to follow well
there's plenty of that in the public
record take a look at the post Cold War
period that also gives me some good
insight into what the Cold War was about
in fact that's a good idea generally a
good rule of thumb is to take a look at
what happens after a war is over and see
who's cheering and who's complaining
when you do that you often get a
surprising insight into
war was actually about try it out on the
second world war and you get some
interesting conclusions but let's take
the cold war so after the cold war says
a post 1989 whose rejoicing and who is
unhappy that tells you something always
does so whose rejoicing well let's look
at the East Eastern Europe whose
rejoicing in Eastern Europe that's very
clear
the old communist party leadership
they're better off than their rich
beyond their wildest dreams very
powerful the only difference is that now
they're the agents of Western power in
other words they're now playing the
typical role of third world elites very
rich very powerful favored by the West
who loves them in fact there's even a
name for them they're called the
capitalists nomenklatura than the mink
litter is the old Stalinist comma czars
now you know working for the bosses in
the West and very rich and very powerful
favored opening up a franchise in Moscow
those are the guys you want to run it
tough know the ropes and so on and so
forth
so they're delighted they're the winners
of the Cold War the old Stalinist
bureaucracy and command they won the
Cold War and they're rigid what about
the there's others who are rejoicing too
for example CEOs of Western corporations
Western corporate world is rejoicing as
well and they're rejoicing for quite
good reasons which are explained in the
openly and frankly in the International
Business press like the Financial Times
which is the most important
International Business Journal in London
which had an article about two years ago
with the interesting headline green
shoots and communism ruins meaning whole
thing as a wreck but there's some green
shoots there's some good things what are
the green shoots well the green shoots
they said are that with the reforms that
have been instituted in Eastern Europe
the reforms they say have led to in
poverty and poverty and very high
unemployment which means that now
Western
investors can get well-trained
well-educated healthy workers at a
fraction of the cost of the pampered
Western workers who are going to have to
abandon their luxurious lifestyles as
Businessweek added so this is really
great
we've got a new weapon against our own
population now we can not only invest in
you know Indonesia Mexico but we can get
these guys in Poland to for 10 percent
the wages of the pampered Western
workers and of course since none of
these people believe in the free market
except for anyone else when Damon would
bents or Audi or GM or somebody invests
there they insist on very high tariff
protection and all sorts of you know
infrastructure support and so on
exactly incidentally is when Daimler
Benton invests in Alabama which they
treat as a third world country properly
and where they get the same amenities
but now they got all of Eastern Europe
opening up to them so they're among the
winners of the Cold War - so there's two
categories of winners of the Cold War
well let's go on what about the people
of Eastern Europe they're not so happy
about it
in fact the Financial Times again just
ran on been running regular polls the
polls now in Eastern Europe are well run
you know Gallup polls and all that stuff
and they're interesting the the latest
poll that's the they've been asking
people to tell what the best period in
Russian history is is Russia around 1992
50 percent said the best period was pre
perestroika you know before the whole
thing fell apart last of April that was
last one that went up to 67 percent said
that was the best period meanwhile
optimism about the future is declining
that's Russia rather general people are
of course delighted and properly by the
collapse of the tyranny but they're not
so delighted about what's been about the
result of the so-called reforms reform
is supposed to be a good thing that's
why the word is used and the reforms
have been have had a devastating effect
in most of the region so for example in
Russia
alone they've led to about an extra half
a million deaths a year according to
UNESCO to a Eunice UNESCO report which
incidentally supports them and says it's
necessary but in any event the reforms
have been very harmful to the general
population who are complaining bitterly
about it so they're not among the
victors they're among the losers of the
Cold War what about in the West
well those pampered Western workers who
are being have another weapon against
them to force them to give up their
luxurious lifestyles they're not so
overjoyed about it either
and indeed at some level at least they
are well aware of this new weapon in the
hands of the Masters to drive down wages
and benefits and increase working hours
and maintain the huge increase in
corporate profits that's gone on since
the end of the Cold War and indeed to
contribute to this spectacular
redistribution of wealth that's taken
place in the United States in the last
15 years now escalating so they're not
among the victors well again if not take
a look and ask who the winners were and
who the losers were and you get a
certain picture of what it was about a
useful technique after any conflict
well this alternative and I think more
realistic perspective makes a good deal
of sense and broader historical terms as
well and carries us forward so the
east-west conflict in fact had many of
the features of the so-called
north-south conflict that's the
euphemism for Europe's conquest of the
world in the last 500 years the
north-south conflict the basic property
of it is the one I just indicated the
service areas that it's now called the
third world of the south they can carry
out what's called complementary
development but not competitive
development they have to be subordinated
to the needs of the rich men who run the
rich societies and if they try to move
towards independent economic nationalism
has to be crushed because their servants
like Churchill and other realists said
the NSSA runs the whole record
furthermore if they seem to be
succeeding in independent develop
and then it's even worse than they
become what are called rotten apples who
might spoil the barrel or a virus that
might infect others and they really have
to be stopped
because of the demonstration effect so
for example Henry Kissinger when time of
the end a regime in Chile warned that
successive them of social democratic
Chile would be a virus that might infect
people all the way to Italy he didn't
think that Chile was going to conquer
Italy but it was sending the wrong
message to Italian voters namely here's
an alternative you might want to pursue
and we can't allow that so it's got to
be crushed that's basically the
north-south conflict and a good deal of
the east-west conflict fits right into
that framework it becomes even more
clear when you think about the history
Eastern and Western Europe have been
separating for about over 500 years
around the 15th century they started the
split actually in a fault line right
down in Germany with the West beginning
to develop and the East becoming its
service area and that division deepened
right up to the 20th century
so Russia was a deeply impoverished
third world country getting poorer
relative to the West right up to 1917
and that same was true of most of
Eastern Europe after that it was a
standard it was the traditional third
world providing resources and markets
and investment opportunities and there
was a very wealthy class of course but
that's true of every third world country
the of course even at this period when
Russia was a deeply impoverished third
world country it was different from
others so under the Tsar it had a big
military force it was a very different
in scale wasn't grenaded you know it had
a big military force and that was aware
was an unusual third world country and
that persists right through the Cold War
- meaning that this aspect of the
north-south conflict had a took on a
life of its own because of questions of
scale but aside from that it has many of
the familiar features if you look over
the
historical range and everything fits
pretty much into place I think when you
look at it that way as does the
aftermath that is what has happened
since 1990 as the region mostly returns
to its earlier origins the parts
there were sectors that were parts of
the industrial West like the Czech
Republic or Western Poland and they're
returning to that most of it was
third-world and it's returning to that
very dramatically which explains
I think certainly explains who's happy
and who's unhappy but I think also adds
to the account of what in fact was going
on well this picture is reinforced when
you look at the continuity of policy
sense which is pretty dressing changed
end of the Cold War and nothing changed
take say the Pentagon budget we had to
have a huge Pentagon budget to defend
ourselves from the monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy okay monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy is gone Pentagon
budget is the same barely declined now
going up it's actually higher already
than it was in in real terms and under
Nixon and it's going up so obviously
something wrong there or take say Cuba
which was which we had to defend
ourselves against by international
terrorism and legal embargo and so on
ever since 1960 because it was a
tentacle of the you know this monolithic
and ruthless conspiracy bent on total
obliteration which was going to strangle
us so we had to defend ourselves against
it by the biggest terrorist campaign in
history in fact unless you count
Nicaragua the plus the economic warfare
ok 1989 Berlin Wall Falls it's not--
whatever you think about it it's no
longer a tentacle of the you know it's
no longer part of the monolithic and
ruthless conspiracy so what's the effect
the effect is we increase the attack on
Cuba the economic warfare is tightened
but now it's for another reason turns
out it wasn't because of the fear of
Cuba all this time it turns out it was
because of our profound concern for
human rights and democracy and the
propaganda if you look back you'll
notice that the doctrinal system didn't
miss a beat nobody noticed or pretended
at least not to notice
rather sudden change that took place and
in fact the concern about human rights
and democracy is about as plausible as
the fear of the Cuba was going to invade
us and destroy us whatever you think of
Castro take any view you like the
harshest condemnation you like he looks
positively saintly in comparison to the
guys that we support throughout the
region again is not controversial the
real problem about Cuba which explains
the continuity all the way through was
illustrated pretty well and what
happened in the UN yesterday can read it
in front page of this morning's paper
Castro issued what the New York Times
calls his controversial call for social
justice which is just as controversial
they say as his critique of American
imperialism and worse he got more
applause from the delegates and Clinton
did so that's a problem the problem is
but you're not supposed to notice it if
you've got a benefits of a proper
education like us we sort of read those
words but I don't see what that means
the problem in fact is that the is the
standards of health and social services
and education and in fact even high tech
that have been achieved there which
other people in the world who aren't as
well educated as we are conceit and
that's the problem there's plenty to
criticize about Cuba for people who are
seriously concerned with human rights
and democracy now excluding everybody
who's talking about it but people who
are serious about yeah plenty to
criticize but as far as the doctrinal
institutions are concerned and certainly
the planning system its the successes
that are the problem the threat
it's what Oxfam once called the threat
of a good example when they were named a
pamphlet that in which they were
discussing the u.s. attack against
Nicaragua and that's accurate
well anyway policy has persisted in fact
even got harsher under ludicrous pretext
with the end of the Cold War which tells
you whatever it was about it wasn't what
they were saying just as in the Pentagon
budget or take the what immediately
followed the Cold War what immediately
followed the cold of the Berlin Wall
fell
and in November 1989 absolute end of the
Cold War a couple of weeks later the
u.s. invaded Panama absolutely typical
footnote to history
you know fact about the only difference
from a million other examples like that
is that the pretext were different in
fact the pretext were like the ones that
Woodrow Wilson used right before the
Cold War when he invaded Haiti and
Dominican Republic and there was no
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy then
he was defending us from the Huns if you
remember this time George Bush when he
invaded was defending us against
Hispanic narco traffickers but other
than that it was the same as before same
actions you know footnote the history no
changes let's turn finally to the United
Nations what happened that the United
Nations happen to be in session at the
time as a winter session so fall of
winter in 1989 of fall winter 1989 the
UN was in session and there were indeed
Security Council vetoes in fact three
one of them voted 14 to one was on
Israel's practices and the occupied
territories vetoed by the United States
to further Security Council resolutions
were condemned the u.s. attack on Panama
vetoed by the United States those the
only Security Council resolutions veto
the General Assembly had very a few too
in fact highly lopsided votes you know
in fact two votes against everyone else
US and Israel alone voting against a
resolution which condemned u.s.
international terrorism against
Nicaragua the other same two against
with a reservoir General Assembly
resolution condemning the u.s. illegal
economic warfare against Nicaragua now
why didn't it come up in Security
Council well the reason is the Security
Council had been disabled couple years
earlier when it passed a resolution
calling on all states to obey
international law not referring to the
United States but everybody understood
what it meant and that was
by the United States so that got rid of
the Security Council actually this is a
rather intently continues another vote
this time around in which the US and
Israel again were alone was against the
US economic warfare against Cuba two
against as usual and this pattern is
very traditional
its standard the you recall the 50th
anniversary line about how the UN was
paralyzed by the Russian obstruction and
vetoes and the grim-faced Soviet
ambassadors well here there's just data
that you can look at since it's not easy
to find
you got to search for it but it's there
since the 1960s the u.s. is far in the
lead and Security Council vetoes in
second places the United Kingdom a very
distant third is France and forth for
the grim-faced Soviet ambassadors in the
General Assembly the story is about the
same votes like 153 2 1 or 152 2 and so
on are not at all rare and that covers a
whole range of issues obeying
international law aggression human
rights terrorism and so on and it's
always the u.s. against those are the
isolated votes and a US vote against in
the General Assembly amounts to a veto
of course now all of this is almost
totally suppressed in the Free Press
I've reviewed it if you're interested
it's almost never reported it's not an
it's not even in the even in the
mainstream scholarly literature you
don't follow but it's there
and worse the press and journalism and a
good deal of scholarship not only
suppresses the actual facts but repeats
endless lies about it of the kind that I
just reiterated well that's something
though to concern people who have any
you know who are worried about the
nature of their country and the fate of
their country tells us something about
the culture that we're living in and
something worthwhile but instead of
going on with that let me go on to the
that's the cold war you can think about
it let's take a look at the ethnic
conflicts you know this that
disillusioned us after the end of the
Cold War there real there are new ethnic
conflicts
namely in the area where the Imperial
system collapsed so where the Soviet
Union collapsed there are ethnic
conflicts that were held under control
by the tyrannical system same in the
Balkans but that's hardly a new phase of
world history that calls for deep
thought from you know serious
intellectuals in facts actually standard
its standard and expected with the
decline of any tyrannical system always
takes a post-colonial Africa when the
when the imperial power is left lots of
ethnic conflicts or take say India and
Palestine after the British withdrew
horrible ethnic conflicts the last most
recent imperial system to collapse prior
to the Soviet Union is the Portuguese
Empire that collapsed in 1975 and it led
to very serious conflict ethnic
conflicts actually three primarily
Angola Mozambique and Timor they're
rarely discussed in the same context but
they belong in the same context these
are three ethnic conflicts that took off
right at the time of the collapse of the
Portuguese Empire in 1975 and they were
serious on short and I won't talk about
Mozambique and Angola but let me just
quote the conclusion by one of the
leading Western historians of Africa the
British historian basil Davidson he says
that those responsible for the Contra
subversions
against Angola and Mozambique will be
cursed by history for enormous and
terrible crimes which will Longway
heavily on the whole of southern Africa
he is referring to you and me
incidentally if it's not obvious and
he's quite right in fact too kind in
fact the UN Commission on Africa
estimated that more than one and a half
million people were killed and there
were over sixty billion dollars in
damages in the Reagan years alone by way
of South
with us support that's under the rubric
of what was called constructive
engagement in Angola its continuing with
horrible consequences well let me turn
to Timor which is even more dramatic in
a way it's not a small matter
incidentally it's the worst slaughter
relative the population the only
reasonable measure since the Holocaust
and it's very clear and unambiguous
ethnic conflict the worst case in
post-war history in fact and also
outright aggression on top of it now
it's true that the UN failed to stop it
this was a real failure of the UN so
therefore we have to dismantle the UN
until we take a look at what happened
what happened is that the u.s. role in
implementing the invasion and the
slaughter was decisive both at the
military level and at the diplomatic
level at the military level the US had
been providing about 90 percent of the
arms and immediately after the invasion
Henry Kissinger who now produces noble
words about the United Nations the
meeting he immediately secretly enhanced
the flow of arms to the aggressors at
Jimmy Carter then stepped in a couple
years later the Indonesian army was
actually running out of arms in this war
and and as the slaughters peaked in 1978
they became real genocide 'el Carter
increased the flow of arms to to
implement what about at the diplomatic
level well our ambassador was Daniel
Patrick Moynihan and he's explained it
in his memoirs so I don't have to make
it up
he said he writes in his memoirs that he
that the State Department wanted things
that the United States wanted things to
turn out as they did and he was given
the task of rendering the United Nations
utterly ineffective in anything it might
do to impede the Indonesian aggression
and he said he carried this out with
great success then he goes on in the
next sentence to say well apparently
within the next couple of weeks about
10% of the population was slaughtered
and then we go off to the next
so yeah the United Nations feel and in
fact it continued to fail for similar
reasons end result of all of this
Moynihan has lauded all over the place
as the most courageous and leading
exponent of international law and
morality a lone voice of of Honor the
United Nations Carter's you know soul of
our foreign policy is human rights
Kissinger gives speeches at the UN and
so on again tells us something about the
intellectual culture in which we live
what about coverage of all of this
that's interesting too pre 1975 believe
it or not Timur got a lot of coverage in
the press the reason was concern about
the collapse of the Portuguese Empire
what it was going to mean as the
invasion took place with you at decisive
US military and diplomatic assistance
decisive as it took place coverage began
to drop by 1978 when the slaughter
peaked coverage reached zero both in the
United States and Canada another leading
investor in Indonesia later on there
were some changes in an interesting way
so by the 80s there is coverage and has
an interesting touch good thing that's
there sometimes even accurate but has an
interesting tone to it it's indicated by
say headlines the editorial in New York
Times called the shaming of Indonesia or
articles in The Washington Post by say
James Fallows and others saying well we
just in Tibet our mistake we didn't do
enough to stop the atrocities actually
we did more than enough we implemented
them and it's not the shaming of
Indonesia it's the shaming of the United
States and the shaming of the New York
Times and so on but that insight is
inexpressible it's no problem that are
not doing enough
we didn't as I indicated and barely
indicated did plenty actually the in
fact made the decisive contribution but
that's inexpressible that's not part of
the possible culture now there have been
changes important ones one change is
that popular opposition finally
developed enough so that US Congress did
impose constraints on sending arms to
Indonesia which forced the Clinton
administration to undertake all sorts of
the chicanery to evade the restrictions
as it did but that's important there are
also been significant changes in
Indonesia it's a lot harder to criticize
things in Indonesia than it is here
very much harder but student
organizations and independent
intellectuals and human rights activists
and labor leaders and so on have been
openly and vocally condemning the
Indonesian invasion of East Timor in the
last couple of years and also condemning
the west condemning us for refusing to
join with them in doing so and it's easy
for us and for refusing to join in their
own struggles for internal democracy and
human rights and labor rights in
Indonesia and for them to do it I stress
again is a lot harder than for us to do
it that's heroic nothing for us to say
that well the end of the Portuguese
Empire had consequences there are far
worse than the end of the Soviet empire
the end of the French Empire still worse
led the Algeria and China with about
four million people killed there was a
cold war element but pretty far at the
margins
I suppose we look elsewhere say at the
Middle East
well that's technics a Lebanon you know
the absolute symbol of ethnic conflict
yesterday and you know and still today
in fact Lebanon hit the front pages
recently all of its horrible ethnic
conflicts right after the Oklahoma City
bombings remember the headlines were
Oklahoma City looks like Beirut you know
horrible I mean here's this horrible
stuff coming back to haunt us right here
real atrocity it's true that Oklahoma
City did look like Beirut in fact very
much like it of course Beirut has been
looking like Beirut for some time in
particular it looked like Beirut exactly
ten years before the Oklahoma City
bombing when the biggest car bomb in
history went off the worst terrorist act
in the region in that peak year of
terrorism which was virtually identical
with the Oklahoma City bombing a bomb
went off in a month right outside a
mosque a huge carbon time-to-kill the
maximum number of people when they were
leaving killing mostly women and
you know babies slaughtered in their
beds and that sort of thing
huge casualties you remember that after
the Oklahoma City bombing there's a lot
of talk about how we're going to hunt
the criminals to the end of the earth
and bomb the Middle East if it's there
and so on well in the case of the of the
Beirut bombing just exactly ten years
earlier all of that would be really easy
that is assuming that the US Air Force
has the capacity to bomb Washington and
California and Texas and places like
that because the bombing was organized
by US intelligence by the CIA and
carried out with the assistance of
British intelligence so maybe there's a
couple of bombs left for London -
yesterday at the United Nations
Clinton's big announcement was that
calling on everybody to aid us in the
struggle against international terrorism
and to find the criminals wherever they
are and so on and so forth some other
interesting things there which I'll talk
about if you like there's no time
yeah that's pretty easy we can certainly
do it no big problem we know exactly
where they are there's incidentally no
controversy about this you know but
oddly somehow it was missed
you know and all the talk about Oklahoma
City looking like Beirut nobody was able
to point out that there is after all a
comparison and if you want to look for
international terrorists we know where
to look for him it's not that the press
didn't know about it it was brought to
their attention I know myself because I
did it lots of times and some people
tried to write about it and couldn't the
same was true in Britain incidentally so
anyhow yeah Lebanon has horrible place
and there are some entry interesting
reasons why the Middle East is also
supposed to be a grand success in
overcoming ethnic conflict namely the
Oslo agreements I would like to talk
about that but there's no time right now
again I'll come back if you like it's
exactly again very revealing what
actually happened what actually happened
is the victory the huge u.s. power play
in which the United States for about 20
years has stood alone against the rest
of the world alone in blocking a
diplomatic settlement and has now rammed
through its own rejectionist position
the u.s. blocked the United Nations
Security Council resolutions every
voting every year there
like you know 152 - at the General
Assembly to block any diplomatic
settlement because the u.s. insisted on
two things one no rights for the
Palestinians and the rest of the world
would agree to this and the u.s.
insisted on no withdrawal except as they
decide and the world wouldn't agree with
this it's only after 1990 when the u.s.
after the that the world capitulated in
fact with a big effect of the Gulf War
was the world capitulated and said ok
you run it yourself and then we had a
genuine peace process namely one run a
peace process run unilaterally by the
United States with nobody interfering
and ramming through the rejectionist
position of the United States which it
had held against the rest of the world
all of this is documented beyond any
question the facts are not in doubt and
it's undetectable you got to go way deep
in the memory hole even in scholarship
to dig out the facts again a great
success of propaganda and an explanation
of why the headlines read day of all at
the White House a week or two ago yeah
it was a day of all but not exactly for
what they were talking about well let me
finally return to attitudes toward the
United Nations there's a lot of
self-righteous commentary about its
failings as some given some indication
of why and where I think it's failed in
my opinion the what has happened is
exactly what was predictable namely the
unreal estrella
of the responsibility for the failure
Falls not surprisingly on the world's
most powerful state which has been in
fact rendering the United Nations
utterly ineffective in anything it did
exactly as our ambassador and leading
exponent of international law was kind
enough to tell us that he did in the
case of the worst slaughter since the
Holocaust and that's dramatically been
true since the early 1960s what happened
then
was that the United Nations fell under
what's called here the tyranny of the
majority which is also sometimes known
as democracy and it just stopped
following orders as soon as it stopped
following orders down the tube we then
render it utterly ineffective and
anything it's going to do the commentary
on all of this is quite amazing I
sampled a bit of it a lot of it's in
print it's a pretty remarkable story
well what about the principle that
explains us attitudes toward the UN the
ones that are articulated in our culture
the intellectual culture I think if you
check you'll find that the explanation
is extremely simple insofar as the
United Nations followed the orders of
Churchill's rich men and the rich
societies which means primarily the
United States exactly to that extent it
was praised insofar as it didn't follow
those orders it was condemned that's
pretty simple principle and it accounts
with remarkable precision for all the
variations and attitudes again go
through more of it if you like and
there's a lot in print but I think
that's the way it is well that I'm
afraid these are some of the issues that
lie behind the fashion some of the
realities behind the illusions and if
they continue to be kept in the shadows
that is if Churchillian realism
continues to prevail in the coming World
Order we can praise ourselves and our
colleagues and our friends and our
institutions for the achievement thanks
you've been watching a from the archives
lecture by MIT professor of linguistics
know'm Chomsky the contours of world
order 50 years of the United Nations in
a moment we'll return to the question
and answer session from this program no
I'm Chomsky is world renowned for his
revolutionary work in the fields of
linguistics and philosophy from the
early days of dissent against the US
invasion of Vietnam Noam Chomsky became
widely known for his analysis and
criticism of United States foreign
policy he has published hundreds of
articles and dozens of books at the time
of this lecture October
95 he had most recently published year
501 the conquest continues and World
Order's old and new his most recent
books include hegemony and survival
America's quest for global dominance and
failed states the abuse of power and the
assault on democracy for more
information about Noam Chomsky and his
work please visit the Noam Chomsky
website at WWE Champion foe and now we
return to the question and answer
session from our program the contours of
World Order 50 years of the United
Nations ah thank you I can have one more
minute there's something I really feel
bad about the president yesterday made
an eloquent appeal to people to help him
out and since I've been talking about
following orders I'd like to perform my
duties as a citizen and respond to the
President's request you can read it in
the front pages of today's papers and
it's actually not quite what I was
talking about but closely relevant apart
from the appeal for everyone to search
out the international terrorists and
pursue them to the corners of the earth
and so on which is easy as I mentioned
easy ways to start on that there were
other there was another thing equally
dramatic he called the national
emergency because of an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national
security of the United States and he
called on everyone all nations and
everyone to join with us to in the task
that he announced which is the following
to identify any nation person or company
business engaged in money laundering or
playing a significant role in drug
trafficking centered in Colombia and all
such nations and companies and
businesses will be banned for operations
in the United States and please help him
out so here's some help in identifying
there was a major study done by the OECD
a couple of years ago that's the
organization of the rich countries they
tried to trace money laundering not so
easy because it's illegal but they tried
to trace it and their conclusion is that
over half of it goes through US banks
Columbia gets about 7 percent of it
according to them now it's not not a
secret it was published in the major
national daily in Mexico however
Excelsior I don't think was ever
recorded here that's the organization
you know utterly reputable organization
of the big rich countries and it tells
you one good place to start in trying to
close down anybody who's involved in
money laundering over 50 percent sounds
like a good place to start second during
the are there any companies involved in
playing a significant role in drug
trafficking well yeah during the Reagan
administration years the CIA and
congressional investigators did an
analysis of the chemical flows to
central to Latin America from American
chemical companies and discovered that
they were far in excess of any possible
industrial needs and that the in fact
the chemicals that were flowing down
there are exactly the ones that are
being used for manufacturing cocaine and
Colombian so there's another way to shut
down businesses that are doing business
because here though they have a
significant role in the drug racket
namely start with the big American
chemical corporations which again ought
to be pretty easy
what about nations that are involved in
in playing a significant role in drug
trafficking in Colombia well you know a
good place to start is to look at those
who are funding the traffickers now it's
well known you can read it in every
Human Rights Watch report and Amnesty
International report and Church study
and so on it's pretty well known who
they are mostly the military the
military and the security forces are up
to the necks in lead with the drug
traffickers and the paramilitary and the
landowners who have given Colombia the
worst human rights record in the hem
again documented a whole flow of
documents on this from all the
international human rights groups and
church groups and they're getting funded
namely blasts in fact they get more than
half about half of US military aid the
Latin America goes to them at night into
the drug war but except insofar as we're
funding people who are involved in it
it has a lot to do with killing peasants
and things like that but that's half of
US military aid actually it's increasing
under Clinton so it's pretty easy to
identify the nations and major
corporations and banks and financial
institutions that are engaged in money
laundering and drug trafficking in
Colombia and well we'll have a test
presumably all of this will be headlines
in the Free Press tomorrow so I'm just
giving you a foretaste but in any event
is an easy way for all of us to help out
and the president's appeal if we want
okay your turn
thank you for on this trip professor
Chomsky and thanks to the groups who
sponsored your trip here as well my
question regards nuclear weapons policy
in the United States in the post Cold
War era
my understanding is that pretty much a
year ago there was a Nuclear Posture
review conducted by the administration
and the decision was to continue a
policy of nuclear deterrence as a result
of that review the specific question I
have is regarding the nuclear weapons
establishment subsidizing the high tech
corporate sector in the continuation of
the development of very sophisticated
replacement components for nuclear
weapon systems in the years to come
specifically the Intel Corporation which
is now moving to the neighboring County
north of us has an R&D facility which is
involved with a contract with Department
of Energy to develop a new
supercomputing system which will be able
to do simulation and modeling of very
precise physics of nuclear detonations
so that in conjunction with the proposed
National Ignition facility in California
seems to continue the policy of
sophisticated weapons development yet
what is right what impacts does this
have for future directions for the
non-proliferation treaty for the
Comprehensive Test Ban and for an
eventual nuclear weapons convention
banning nuclear weapons in the post Cold
War era could you address that yeah I
think the answers are pretty obviously I
mean there is a shift in nuclear weapons
policy there's a shift towards I mean
you know a lot of stuff they don't tell
us but from the public record there's a
shift towards you know sort of lower
more sophisticated and precise and lower
yield targeted weapons and there's even
a public posture about this it was
announced in the first right after the
fall of the Berlin every year that
Congress the White House gives Congress
a statement about why the Pentagon has
to be bigger than it ever was in history
and it's used for all through the Cold
War was the same statement you know the
monolithic and ruthless conspiracy area
defend ourselves and so on and the
bottom line you know more weapons more
nuclear weapons and so on well the
interesting one to look at was March
1990 the Russians are gone you know no
Russian bear if you look at the posture
statement it was the the bottom line was
the same as before you know bigger
Hannegan you know maintain the military
industrial base and so on and so forth
but the argument was different no
Russians in fact they even said that our
main interventive before the Gulf War
main intervention forces have to
continue to be targeted to the Middle
East where the threat to our interests
has not could not be laid at the
Kremlin's door you know contrary to the
lies of previous years but there was a
threat namely what they call the
technological sophistication of third
world powers that's the thread all of a
sudden so we have to maintain the same
system because of the technological
sophistication of third world powers
which at least is getting closer to the
truth all of this is a system of world
control and if the Russians aren't there
will let's be more honest
so the clouds are kind of lifting and I
think the weapons policy is shifting in
that direction there's another comment
that's worth making about weapons policy
and here just let me suggest an inquiry
to you there's a good deterrent and
that's the word that's used but there's
a fair question one should ask were the
weapons designed for defending us well
you know you can sort of check that you
can look at the threats that the United
States faced and there have been some
and ask how what response there was to
them so if they go back to around 1950 I
mean the US had them was the most secure
country in history of the world you know
control the whole hemisphere controlled
both
the opposite sides of both oceans you
know a huge military effort I mean it's
just there's no level of security
remotely like it but there was a
potential threat potential at that time
the potential threat to the United
States was intercontinental missiles
with high yield meaning hydrogen bomb
warheads so simple now the records are
out take a look and see how much
attention was given to relieving that
threat answer it never even came up
meaning the one threat that there really
was was of absolutely no concern to
anyone not you know could of the
negotiations have been carried out that
would have prevented that threat well
you don't know you know till they were
tried and they weren't going to be tried
because basically nobody cared and if
you check the story you'll find that
that runs through to the end like take
say the Reagan years the biggest
military threat to the United States in
the Reagan years with sea launch cruise
missiles the United States has long
coastlines you know submarines can come
right up to the coastline cruise
missiles are very precise they can carry
nuclear weapons so that's a real threat
to the United States no threat to Russia
they don't have coastline but it's a big
threat to us so ask yourself how the
Reagan administration strategists
handled sea launch cruise missiles they
wanted them extended they wanted to
block any negotiations that might stop
and in fact that story runs quite
consistently all the way through which
again suggests that something else is
going on and I think we see what else is
going on even more clearly now when we
look at the shift of weapons policy
about the non-proliferation treaty I
mean obviously as long as the major
powers mean mainly us but you know
Britain and France too are going to hold
on the nuclear weapons and as long as
they are kind of client states do like
Israel with our support incidentally
sure it's gone non-proliferation treaty
is going to work just and so far as you
can beat people over the head you know
in some of this even one thing you might
keep an eye on is a proposal coming to
the world Court the World Health
Organization that two years ago I guess
voted to ask the world court for an
advisory opinion on the legality of
keeping nuclear weapons the Western
powers were passionately
most of this they've tried in every way
to prevent the World Court from hearing
this they went as far the United States
went as far as threatening Indonesia
with sanctions what not fur you know
invading his team weren't killing off
the most large part that's ok but
because Indonesia was planning to
propose to the world court a an opinion
you given a pass a resolution on from
the non-aligned countries and yeah
they'd like to hear the world's court
opinion on this that was going to call
for sanctions well you know it's still
coming up I think it's still being
discussed it's very hard to learn
anything about it you know because it's
never reported but it's in process now
and that could be of some interest it's
of course an opinion of the World Court
and the rich and powerful don't pay any
attention to it if they don't feel like
it's the Nicaragua case should but
nevertheless it's another step towards
trying to which can be used to try to
get people to understand what all this
stuff is about but you know other than
that I think things are going in a very
dangerous direction a quick question and
ask you for a comment asking for a
response you referred to the preemptive
strikes used by the United States one in
the early 60s was used at a place called
the Bay of Pigs in Cuba and one of the
gentlemen who helped repel that
preemptive strike as you indicated has
now grabbed a much bigger share of the
world stage then President Clinton felt
like sharing at the United Nations this
weekend and I wanted to point out that a
couple of months ago in Cuba there was a
demonstration about half a million
people to support the Cuban Revolution
one of those little facts that also
doesn't climb into the daily newspapers
in the United States very often in 1989
there were all kinds of predictions that
Fidel Castro would be going the way of
Chao hsq and others in Eastern Europe
all of that has turned out really to be
not true and the Cuban people have asked
for help from people in the United
States and elsewhere in trying to fight
against this criminal embargo that if
I'm not mistaken perhaps you can correct
me is the longest embargo of its type
carried out by any country in the world
against any other country so under if
you could say a word or two about that
and I would just like to tell everyone
that if you're interested in doing
anything to fight that embargo there is
literature and information at one of the
tables outside thank you yeah yeah it's
by far the longest also in economic
warfare
embargoes which are completely illegal
the United States is way in the lead the
third world the South you know the
non-aligned countries actually tabled a
resolution at the United Nations about
three years ago calling on the General
Assembly to ban the practice of economic
embargoes which are and of course it you
know big powers would never even let it
get to a discussion it's been in them by
the world court in the case of Nicaragua
in the case of Cuba it's you know it's I
mean you take a look at the last vote at
the UN not only the United in previous
votes about the embargo the US had
gotten more than one that's automatic
one vote it had also gotten Albania one
year and got Romania one year but this
year Albanian Romania dropped off so
it's just the US and Israel which means
the u.s. is one vote alone furthermore
very interesting was the discussion
about it even US allies loyal US allies
usually pretty craven US allies like
Britain were bitterly condemning the
embargo and it has nothing to do with
your attitude toward Castro a wholly
separate issue and the u.s. is in fact
tightening making it worse
interestingly the US business community
is now split on the issue on the same
principle as Vietnam I mean torturing
people make some sense but making
profits makes more sense and if the two
things come into conflict then there's
two values that have to be considered
and you know one might prevail over the
other as to I mean the practice ought to
be considered intolerable I mean like
nobody puts in bar goes on the United
States you know it's a practice that can
be carried out by the powerful against
people they want to hurt and
that's exactly why the vast majority of
the world's population through the non
line countries have wanted to ban it and
that's exactly why we're the leading you
know well in the lead and it's
completely illegal you know under get
rules under international law and so on
it goes on as long as we let it in the
beginning of you're talking you talked
about daringness speak truth about power
and obviously what you're saying wakes
up a lot of people and I'm just
wondering what protects you from being
one of the many people that just
vanishes very simple um white privileged
you know I'm part of the wealthy classes
it's a this is there's no such thing as
a capitalist country in the world it
couldn't survive for a second but this
one is sort of more toward the
capitalist end of the spectrum and most
and the more you are toward that end of
the spectrum the more everything becomes
a commodity of which you get about as
much of as you can buy well here freedom
is a commodity if you're rich enough and
the right color and everything else you
can buy a lot of it and I I'm rich
enough and privileged enough so I have a
lot of it you know in fact the people
who would protect some fight like I was
a black organizer in the ghetto maybe I
get killed you know happen but the
people who really have power in this
country would not want the state to be
powerful enough to go after people like
me because if so they would go after
people like them you know so civil
rights are indeed protected under the
condition that freedom is a commodity
that you can purchase like shoes and
there is a lot of it this is a very free
society and there are a lot of people
like us who are pretty privileged and we
have an awful lot of freedom to do
things if we don't do them it's you know
it's our fault because there's you know
there's no cost I mean if there's any
cost it's pretty slight you know not
like most places in the world it's not
like protesting and Indonesia for
example or in Central America you don't
get to get your Blane brains blown out
like Jesuits and El Salvador and that
just gives us more response
I want to draw some references to your
earlier statements about nerve gas and
international terrorism with the use of
chemicals that are being put in our food
and our clothing and our cleaning
products you could smell it when you
walked in here today when the rugs were
rolled out and tobacco and our medicines
ad infinitum and we're seeing it in the
statistics most recently told us about
the the high numbers of children in New
York with the astronomical levels of
respiratory problems these manufacturers
it is an international terrorism and
they're killing themselves as well as
everybody I kind of see it doesn't
matter whether we have education or
money in the future I think we're all
going to be too sick to go to work and
produce much and the numbers of chemical
sensitivities cases are are at least
being recognized today but are being
recognized in big numbers I wish you I'd
like you to comment on that
you know it's a serious problem but I
think we should be clear about it's
mostly a problem for poverty people like
us may suffer somewhat but not a lot the
people who are really going to get it in
the neck are the ones who are poor here
and of course in the third world so it
just takes a tobacco tobacco is a is a
very dangerous drug in terms of the
number of people killed it's like I
think latest figures I saw us about a
hundred times as high in the United
States as all hard drugs combined as
compared marijuana I'm sure is not good
but I don't think there's a single known
overdose from death from overdose in
marijuana after about 60 70 million
users plenty of the deaths from tobacco
the so it's very and furthermore of
tobacco is different from other drugs in
that it harms other people like if I
smoke at harms you you know and the
costs are very high but they're not much
here you know they're going down here
especially if by now smoking is mostly a
class issue here so if you if you look
at the you just look at the statistics
on smoking it's not totally but by and
large they sort of as you go towards you
know as wealth goes up smoking goes down
very considerably it's become sort of a
class issue on the other hand there are
other parts of the world where smoking
is going way up with aggressive US
intervention at the very same time that
George Bush announced the drug war same
month in fact the US Trade Commission
was conducting hearings on sanctions
against Thailand and South Korea which
passed because they were not permitting
aggressive advertising of US lethal
narcotics namely tobacco aimed mostly at
women and children so here's you know
all kinda hysterical talk about Noriega
and the drug war on the one hand on the
other hand we're using state power to
force women and children there to smoke
more and more so that they can more and
more can be killed incidentally the
press wouldn't cover this either that
was brought the it was hard to avoid the
Surgeon General of the United States
ever coop properly conservative was
outraged about it and tried to get some
attention and nobody could do it was
like the opium wars nobody would report
well the the scale of that is
substantial there's an well-known
epidemiologist in Oxford University who
really trekked recently tried to do an
estimate on what the cost was going to
be to China of the aggressive marketing
of tobacco they are mostly to young
people and you know his estimate for
what it's worth was that of people now
under 20 I think I think
that was the number I think he said
about 50 million we're going to die from
the effects of tobacco that's a I mean
fairly substantial killing even by
twentieth century standards and it's and
it is very much kind of you know it's
not uniform but it's highly correlated
with privilege and opportunities and I
think the same is true if you look
across the board yeah you're right these
things are going to harm everybody but
not not equally I hope you'll forgive me
if I ask the question that should
probably be a lecture in itself but um I
think a lot of people probably came here
expecting to hear some kind of solution
or looking for solutions and I was
wondering if you could address this kind
of a 3-part thing like personal
solutions that you've participated in
like I believe I read in an introduction
to one of your books that you
participated in the early Zionists
movement which was an anarchist sort of
socialist movement and also in the 60s
as well and also if you could address
what most people here are young
intellectuals who want to affect change
in society in the way and intellectual
can sort of break with their class
privilege and third a lot of people
leaning towards the anarchist bent of
solutions have a very hard problem
dealing with the organization like more
less organization is seen as like a more
bigger solution and to me I can't see us
being like two organized but it's more
the type of organization that's a
question that's a question and I was
hoping you could address maybe some of
the solutions and participated in they
are not all article okay just first of
all to clarify that it's true that I was
pre active as a teenager in the design
movement in fact remain so for a long
time but was anything but an anarchist
movement you know it was a you know it
was a nationalist movement which had it
this is in the early before the state
was established had various wings and
there was a kind of a libertarian
socialist wing and that's the part I was
interested in but by 1948 that was
essentially dead in fact that part of
the Zionist movement was opposed to a
Jewish state it was part of the Zionist
Moot mainstream at the time because the
idea of a Jewish state at a fairly
recent one was even opposed by the
leadership until about 1942 but but
that's a different story I want to go
into that whole thing but as far as
things that can be done there's tons of
them I mean take say East Timor which I
just mentioned you know if for about 15
it's so it's you know it's the worst
slaughter since the Holocaust relative
to the population and for a long time
you just could not talk about it the
number of people involved there's a kind
of got a dozen people maybe mostly young
who were involved in it I can name them
if you like the and you just couldn't
break through you knows Europe well the
last couple of years have changed I mean
it got to the point where there's a
considerable protest and it you know
it's mutually supportive like protests
here relates to protests in Australia
and they're mutually stimulative in it
and to England then even Indonesia now
the Indonesian protests don't get
reported here but they do get reported
in Australia and if we could do it we
could report it here and that's
important and that made a big change you
know it made such significant change
that by now there is actually a
possibility that Indonesia might
withdraw and allow self-determination
when the u.s. changes policy the world
listens you know because this is a big
thug you know and everybody knows it
except educated people here and if you
if it changes policy on something
everybody listen concluding Indonesia so
there's something that can you know that
was done by a very small number of
people who had a tremendous effect for
if you count the number of hours that
were put in and the number of lives that
were saved that's extraordinary
or take say the Indochina war I mean
it's true that it ended up killing about
4 million people but the u.s. did not
use nuclear weapons you know didn't it
it didn't totally destroy all the
countries of the region just mostly well
that's because a lot of people struggled
against it or take say Central America
the biggest popular movement of I think
post Second World War it's never talked
about in the press but it certainly was
there was the Central America Solidarity
movement way beyond anything that
existed in the 60s and very sprit nice
spread but pretty deeply rooted in
mainstream American society whereas the
movement of the 60s was kind of marginal
it was enormous I mean you know churches
most it was much stronger in the Midwest
and South West than it was in places
like say Boston campuses and it was very
effective I mean the Reagan
administration tried to duplicate
Kennedy Kennedy just attacked South
Vietnam 1961 just sent the US Air Force
started bombing it's not part of our
official history but had happened the
Reagan administration tried to duplicate
that in 1981 and in fact announced it
with a white paper very similar to
Kennedy's who they were who was their
model and there was such popular
reaction at the back off and resort to
international terrorism instead of
direct aggression well you know
international terrorism is harmful but
direct aggression is a lot more harmful
so that's a big innocent you know it's
not pretty what happened but could have
been a lot worse
and you can go across the board I mean
the more we can do the more we can
change things I don't think there's any
secrets I'm not spending any time on it
because things sob these if you
recognize our responsibilities which are
great and our options which are enormous
instantly you can think of all kind of
things that can be done whether it's
Columbia or Timor or you know Africa or
wherever you like just think about it
for two minutes and you'll think of
things that can be done now as for
anarchists and organization you know
anarchism
a lot of things but I don't and I've
always been much interested in it and
engaged in it and committed to it but I
don't think there's any conflict between
anarchism and organization at least the
parts of the anarchist movement that
I've been interested in we're looking
for a highly organized society but
organized from below organization
doesn't mean hierarchy and authority
that's something else but if people get
together to run things and they
federated with others and they make
voluntary associations maybe across the
planet that could be an extremely high
level of organization and it's on
anarchist principles so there's no I
don't see any conflict between anarchism
and organization in fact I think a
Newark ISM is going for a highly
organized Society but a popularly and
democratically organized one invite
people who are interested in discussing
these issues I'm got some Flyers for a
magazine that I'm putting together on
these issues yeah if you're interested
too with the I noticed McNamara came out
with the new book on Vietnam and I was
wondering if you would comment on what
the u.s. relation to Vietnam is at this
current moment as well as what is the
current political economic and situation
inside of the country
well I won't I've written about
McNamara's book if you're interested so
I won't comment any further it was it
was quite interesting what was
interesting about it was that there
isn't a it was the discussion about it
was what was most interesting the
question was did he go too far in
apologizing or you know was it right
that he did it and the people in the
peace movement said you know let's honor
and for apologizing and others said no
it shouldn't meant too far
fact of the matter is there is not a
word of apology in the book except to
Americans he apologizes to Americans for
what he did to American society there is
not a word of apology for the four
million corpses that he left there in
three destroyed countries that is beyond
discussion and it's amazing to me that
activists in the peace movement and
religious leaders and so on we're
praising this as an
apology to everybody except the victim
the fact that that could happen you know
tells you something quite astonishing
about the culture again and there's more
to say about the book but I won't go
into it as to the US and Vietnam well
you know long story but what happen in
my opinion I mean back around 1970 I
thought the US had basically won the war
the big threat nobody was ever worried
about Vietnam conquering Indonesia
you know Hawaii and all that stuff that
was for you know the frighten the public
what they were worried about was the
usual thing the demonstration effect of
successful independent development and I
was part of a broader concern about
China and so on and that's pretty clear
in the internal documentary record I
thought a sort of obvious by 1970 but
with the release of the Pentagon Papers
it became quite well documented over 20
years ago and in fact by about 1970 it
was clear that was never going to be any
demonstration effect in fact the
countries would be lucky to survive this
is a huge assault by a superpower and be
lucky if they could survive at all but
they certainly weren't going to be a
model buddy in fact one effect which I
thought was again I read about it in
1970 was pretty obvious then was that
whatever either the place would be
totally what or else what would survive
would be the harshest and toughest
elements because they're the only ones
who can survive that kind of an assault
well it's pretty much what happened I
didn't predict the Khmer Rouge but it's
generally what happened so I thought the
u.s. had basically won a victory in
terms of its actual war aims well I
still think so actually the business
press more or less agreed like the Far
Eastern Economic Review a couple of
years later said look you know I want
you guys call off you've won already you
know they're never going to bother us
we've put up dictatorships all in the
neighborhood so no virus is going to
infect anybody and crush this one's no
virus and go onto something more
productive ok then comes 1975 after the
u.s. escalated the war but in a
different way turned it into a
strangulation the idea after 1975 was to
make the victory to deepen the victory
make sure that they don't even that they
don't have a chance of recovering so put
a heavy economic embargo
block the international lending
institutions from giving them assent
make them really suffer and starve
exactly what we're doing the Nicaragua
right now Nicaragua is going down like
that you know it's now the second
poorest country in the hemisphere right
after Haiti we got a stranglehold on it
we are not going to let it develop we
are now insisting that they return
basically the Somoza properties and so
on Hillary Clinton was just there
praising the Chamorro government for for
reuniting the Nicaraguan family and
rejuvenating the economy since democracy
came in 1990 a couple of days before she
was there the ultra-right paper of the
business community left abouna which is
you know super neoliberal and everything
else published a story on a UNICEF
report on Nicaragua which has yet to
make it here and never will which was
headline something like you know
Nicaragua mortgaging its future by the
district by the fact that the child
malnutrition is the starvation is out of
sight and everything's collapsing and so
on and so forth yeah that's the
revitalization revitalization of the
Nicaraguan economy we got a stranglehold
on and we they got to suffer same with
Cuba and there's reasons for that too
I mean just imagine yourself in the
position of say the Mafia Don who runs a
certain neighborhood so you're running a
certain neighborhood suppose somebody
doesn't pay protection money
you just go in and get the money no you
send goons in to you know break his legs
and beat him to a pulp and make a model
so that others understand that you
follow orders okay now again people in
the world understand this but if you're
well educated like us you don't see it
you know so it kind of looks odd that
every time anybody gets out of line and
we've won we go on a torture yeah makes
complete sense you know in fact we
wouldn't have the slightest problem
understanding it in the case of say you
know the Mafia Don in the neighborhood
and that's us you know we're the Mafia
done for the world so sure makes a lot
of sense and the fact the u.s. kept the
stranglehold on the excuses kept
changing so at first we had
this missing-in-action story was
concocted a total fraud I mean nobody
ever cared about missing an action
before you know there's still people who
haven't been found from the war of 1812
we don't have any problem digging up the
bodies there were bodies all Flanders
field which nobodies cared about nobody
bothers with them same for every war but
this was a good way to get people upset
you know behind the idea of strangling
Vietnam then fortunately something else
came along Vietnam invaded Cambodia and
put an end to the Pol Pot regime as
atrocities and they and that since the
US was in fact supporting fall PUD that
they were bitterly attacked this is the
one humanitarian intervention that I
know of in modern history and it's not
that they were trying to be humanitarian
it was just a consequence of it was to
put it into a major massacre so they
came under huge attack you know the
prussians of Asia we got a strangle and
so on that went across the propaganda
system without a whisper and we started
openly supporting Pol Pot the Democratic
Kampuchea coalition and now we had to
embargo Vietnam because the prussians of
Asia were had put an end to the Pol Pot
regime
okay then they withdrew from Cambodia
without a missing a beat we shifted back
to missing in action now we got to
strangle him because of missing in
action and this continued until a couple
of years ago and it then stopped for a
very simple reason most of the world
listens when the United States gives
orders but it was starting to leak I
mean Japan was starting to invest and
Europe was starting to invest and so on
an American business just didn't like
the idea that they were being cut out of
lucrative markets so we had exactly the
conflict which is now showing up in Cuba
makes perfect sense to torture people
teaches people a good lesson and so on
but at some point the need to make
profits is more important so Vietnam is
now allowed back into the civilized
world at a on our terms after
that and that will sooner or later
happened with Nicaragua too if anything
is left of the place
Nicaragua may be uninhabitable in ten or
twenty years it's possible but that's
the way you treat people who get out of
line and I think that's exactly what's
going on in a cubic case right now in
their garage beucase incidentally much
the same as true of Iraq which is
another story but that your investment
options the transnationals have like
euro dollar investments are doing to the
speculation economy it was hoping that
you could protect perhaps articulate
more of the impact on the real economy
when though that money is essentially
stripped mine from it and you know
playing in the larger global casino well
instead I mean late but instead am I
trying to say anything let me just quote
an absolutely impeccable source Paul
Fokker who was the head of the Federal
Reserve under Reagan's on very respected
we'll just headed a commission which was
looking into the decline of the growth
rate since the 1970s there's been a
general decline in the growth rate
around the industrial world since the
1970s and they concluded that about 50
percent of the decline could be
attributed just to the shift of capital
to speculation against currencies and
there's pretty well understood why I
mean it's a weapon against growth
anytime any country starts to undertake
policies that might stimulate the
economy capital flows from it so it's a
weapon against growth and their estimate
for what it's worth is about 50 percent
of the decline in the growth rate is
attributable to it I don't have an
independent judgement yeah thanks for
coming again and especially all these
people here this is quite the turnout it
you don't get to see that Olympia very
much so it's an honor to everyone here
and show up I wanted to say three things
one had to do with
international law indigenous issues in
corporate colonialism and how that rates
in the Western Hemisphere especially but
I know its global second thing is about
the international court of public
opinion and the third would be on the
what to do question and I think that
fits nicely into what was said earlier a
little bit is that I mean one of the
things I've heard used to have been
listening for years is that inform
yourselves inform each other identify
allies and get out there and work on it
and one of the things I'd asked to when
we get to that part but on indigenous
issues in corporate colonialism hoping
you could speak to that a little bit I
know that it's a little bit lacking in
some of your public talks I know that
you do get into it and I know that the
book function1 years relates to that to
a degree but if you could speak to that
especially as regards regionally
we've been looking at a situation
British Columbia whereby that Empire is
on its beyond the treaty frontier
there's no treaties and most of what is
now BC and the Native Nations and
people's there have been in a very
strong resistance there was a 30-day
siege it was blacked out of the US it's
very recent and also the BC Treaty
Commission which in terms of
international law I think is really a an
interesting concept that you know if
we're going to believe in NAFTA and GATT
and the rule of law and constitutions
and Parliament's you know how is Canada
getting away with this and it's with its
reputation and in terms of the
international court of public opinion I
think a lot of the people here will
pretty much always you know agree with a
lot of what you have to say on detailing
history for us and bringing us up to
speed but at the same time I find more
intriguing is your talk on mind control
and and and what we can do about it and
how people are really being manipulated
or not and what we can do about that so
in terms of the international court of
public opinion and why did we all see
the person at Tiananmen Square standing
in front of the tanks you know we all
got that yet
is there any hopes in that regard so
maybe you could tie that into the what
to do those those couple of things well
on let's may begin with the end you know
what to do that
any answer about what to do that's like
saying look people are suffering all
over what should we do you know well
there's no answer at that level ask what
should you do about X you know let's
pick a problem then we can ask what do
we do about that problem and then we'll
ask for what our capacity is you know
what's the problem how can we deal with
it and so on and so forth that's how you
answer what can we do questions you can
talk about a bigger vision like the
person who asked the question over there
about anarchism and organization yeah
you can think about long-term aims that
you're trying to get to and that makes
sense too but just what can we do let me
suppose people say what should we do
about slavery well get rid of it you
know now how do we get rid of it okay
now it becomes a problem and you get
serious and you try to do something
about it but general discussions about
what can we do they don't mean anything
you know we've got an enormous options
we're very free most of us are very
privileged you know where there's a high
degree of responsibility here for what
happens in the world so there's kind of
things we can do if we choose to do them
we want to talk about it then if we
decide more fun to talk about it well
then nothing will change as to
manipulation and what you can do about
manipulation yeah stop letting yourself
fall for it I mean again there's no big
secret you know you have to learn which
isn't all that hard to take a skeptical
critical eye to the kind of stuff that
you see and you know think about it and
look at it from other points of view and
so on I mean it's like asking you know
if I'm teaching a science class and
somebody says how do I figure out the
truth I don't know what can you say I
mean you try to use your mind that's
what you have a mind for you know you
try to be critical I mean maybe an
experiment comes out this way it doesn't
look quite right you look at it another
way and so on and so forth
there's no techniques you know there's
no techniques for finding out the truth
about things except having a critical
intelligence and using it and if you're
looking for secrets you're going to be
my very disappointed there aren't any at
least nobody's ever found them about
indigenous issues I can't say anything
about British Columbians know what the
facts are but the international law is
extremely weak on these issues on the
other hand there's plenty of cases
national law like the US for example of
the Canadian situation but the United
States for back since the eighteenth
century has had binding treaties with
one or another indigenous group which it
has violated in the most extraordinary
fashion over and over again because
power is one thing in binding treaties
or another thing and how can you
implement the binding treaties well
again by the public insisting on the
public and the powerful part of the
society that's us also I wouldn't you
know I mean right now the question of
what the legality is of the treaties
that were made in the chair with the
Cherokees for Southeast United States is
kind of academic but there are real
issues about what people what rights
people should have right now and those
should be addressed independently of any
formal question of treaties or
international law and what happening I
think yeah all right no I guess I'll hit
you with this big concept one here
basically I'd like you to describe the
conflict between autarky which is
regional self-determination and the New
World Order and specifically I guess go
back to Africa here and in the for East
Timor in a country that's now known as
Burkina Faso which means literally
standing tall it's named that by its
revolutionary leader who took money away
from the center of power in his country
and gave it to the farmers gave them
more money to grow food basically become
more self-sufficient and he was
suppressed by the French colonialists
and deposed very shortly thereafter by
his vice president but I'd like to talk
I'd like you to what's up I think he's
saying you better wrap it up I was
really I'd like to just talk about that
and also about what your vision of
libertarian socialism and that's that's
it's more than I can manage in the one
minute but on the questions of regional
self-determination and integration the
world economy I'm afraid that there are
no simple answers at a general abstract
level you have to look at the cases so
the problems of some country you know in
Africa say and Haiti are just different
you know and they have to be looked at
on their own terms which is not easy you
know and there's no formula it by and
large it's going to come down to the
same thing any country is going to be
able to follow a path of more or less
independent self development to the
extent that the rich and powerful allow
them to get away with it
now that happens to be mostly us which
means we have a big influence on this
like Latin America could in 1945 at the
foundation of the United Nations it
could have followed what it was calling
the philosophy the new nationalism it
was sweeping the region meaning
development for domestic needs on the
principle that the prime beneficiaries
of a country's resources should be the
people of that country and so on u.s.
didn't let them now American citizens
were just not involved in that they
didn't know what was going on in fact I
suspect 99.9% of them still don't know
it was going on fifty years ago and
don't associate the extraordinary
inequality of Latin America which is the
highest in the world and the huge
capital flight and everything else with
the fact that we had some very definite
decisions there and it played a big role
there for 50 years but the same thing is
true now and we got to learn about those
things and what we're doing and what we
how we can change and how it affects us
and how it affects other people but
there's no formula you know it's a
matter of looking at hard cases and
coming up with analyses and
understanding and then trying to do
something about it and I just don't know
how to answer the there's no answers at
this level of generality twenty years
ago there was an energy crisis what has
happened there was no energy crisis well
in terms of where are all right in terms
of where fossil fuels are heading into
the future there is an energy crisis
look and how come is being totally
ignored as anything loudly it's not
being totally ignored that a ton of
people interested in it and concerned
about it and exactly what should be done
about fossil fuels is another is a hard
question so for example take say the
question of nuclear energy here I
disagree with a lot of my friends I
should say I don't think that's a moral
question I think it's a tactical
question technical question basically I
mean whether nuclear energy is more or
less harmful than fossil fuels or and
say no energy those are technical
questions that it is not a moral issue
and you got to be serious about it
the same is true of fusion whether
fusion is an option and what its
consequences might be is not a moral
issue it's a technical issue now a
technical issue has human consequences
significant human consequences so it's

technical issue is has huge consequences
but you can't take a stand on it on

are open to us and there are choices
like one choice is to say give up use of
energy but then you have to ask what
happens like you know it does that mean
genocide of five billion people or does
it mean something else well those are
questions which unfortunately have to
take seriously you know and the same is
true of all of these questions they are
not easy and it doesn't make any sense
to have slogans about them you got to
