richard nixon were in congress now that
he'd be caucusing with half a dozen
people on the far left it's not a joke
incidentally well while wealth and power
have narrowly concentrated for most
people in the country the real incomes
have stagnated and they've been getting
by with increased work hours by now far
higher than Europe even Japan debt which
can only go on for so long and asset
inflation like the bubble the housing
bubble is the most recent case and these
bubbles are repeatedly destroyed by the
financial crisis crises that began to
occur in the Reagan years as the
regulatory apparatus was dismantled the
effect is that the country is being
severely weakened well none of this is
problematic for the very wealthy in
particular for the financial
institutions by their share of corporate
profit the rose to an astonishing forty
percent in 2007 right before the crash
that they caused and the major players
benefit from a government insurance
policy which is called too big to fail
and as one commentator quipped too big
to jail
they can get away with any crimes they
like they can
the result is that with the government
insurance policy they can make and do
make very risky transactions which mean
rich rewards while adhering to a stab
ASIC market principle that you ignore
externalities in a market system make a
transaction you ignore the effect on
others what economists call
externalities in this case the
externality is systemic risk the risk
that if one of your transactions goes
back bad the whole system may collapse
well the system inevitably crashes it's
happened over and over again since the
Reagan years each time more serious than
the last but that's not a problem
because they can run to the nanny state
that they nurture ask for a taxpayer
bailout and meanwhile they clutch their
copies of Hayek and Milton Friedman and
ein Rand in their hands and that's been
the regular process since the Reagan
years it's each crisis more extreme than
the last for the public that is right
now a real unemployment is at the levels
of the Great Depression for much of the
population but the main architects of
the crisis are bigger and richer than
before that's what happens when you
control the state that Goldman Sachs for
example
the biggest criminal they've just
quietly announced 17 and a half billion
dollars in compensation for last year
for executives with the CEO void
Blankfein receiving a 12 and a half
million dollar bonus and his base salary
was tripled in appreciation for having
crashed the economy and much the same is
true among among its colleagues
England's pretty much the same well
these developments contribute to
American decline but not as often argued
to the shift of global global power to
china and india the world's becoming
more diverse but despite their rapid
economic progress these two great asian
powers are hardly poised to assume the
dominant role in the world one
illustration look it up on the internet
is the United the United Nations Human
Development Index kind of measures the
health of the society China now ranks
89th the right next to the Dominican
Republic and El Salvador into pretty
poor countries India ranks 115 it's next
to copy their day and timor-leste
extremely poor countries each of these
two asian giants also suffers from
extreme inequality about the same as the
u.s. that means that the large majority
the population ranks even lower the CIA
estimates that China's gross domestic
product
at about twenty percent of that of the
rich countries Europe for example for
them where they both have a huge
internal problems ecological and human
India is torn apart by major internal
Wars China by severe repression and very
wide labour unrest at tens of thousands
of labour actions every year according
to official figures reality is probably
greater china is also facing a severe
demographic problem it did have
spectacular recent growth but that
relied very heavily on the availability
of a young and productive labor force
that's a non-repeatable historical
phenomenon china scholar Wang Fang
observes that favorable Democratic
demographic dividend is expected very
soon to disappear and in fact to reverse
sharply with significant effects on
labor productivity and also on social
life in particular ability to care for
the growing elderly population social
system that formerly existed is
collapsed also there's an effect on the
of the sex selection of illegal but
there's a very definite sex selection
policy it has led to a vast excess of
males over females in the population
under 20 and that could have extremely
severe social effect China is indeed a
huge manufacturing center but it's not
like Germany
the China is basically an assembly plant
it's an assembly plant for the advanced
industrial societies surrounding it
Japan South Korea Taiwan they provide
the parts and the components and the
advanced technology as incidentally does
the United States and other rich
countries of the West everyone talks
about the US trade deficit with China
but when it's properly calculated has
been done by a couple of economists
namely estimated in terms of value added
how much is produced literally produced
in each country well it turns out that
the deficit with China declines by about
twenty-five percent and the deficit with
its Asian suppliers increases by about
twenty-five percent so this is not the
kind of export economy that Germany is
quite different sooner or later China
will presumably climb the technology
ladder but it's not going to be an easy
path there is in fact a very noticeable
and significant global shift of power
but a different one not from the west to
the agent Giants but from the global
workforce all around the world to the
very rich that's happening everywhere
the tendency is implicit in what are
called free trade agreements which have
little to do with free trade and
certainly aren't agreements at least if
people are part of their countries
they're mostly opposed but what are
called free trade agreements with
they're designed to set working people
in competition with one another the
globally while protecting wealthy
professionals and providing investors
with extraordinary rights among other
benefits for investors these agreements
allow free movement of capital but they
firmly reject Adam Smith's principle
that free circulation of labor is a
foundation of free trade and in many
other ways to the violate basic free
trade principles and these tendencies
are exacerbated in very ugly ways by
growing xenophobia in the rich societies
notably in Europe the picture that's
developing is very aptly described in a
brochure for investors that was produced
recently by Citigroup it's a huge bank
that once again is feeding at the public
trough as it has done regularly for 30
years in the course of a cycle of risky
loans huge profits and bail out when it
crashes the men like Goldman Sachs
they've gained from the crisis that they
helped create the bank's analysts in
this brochure they describe a world
that's dividing into two blocks the one
block they call the plutonomy that's
very rich globally they're the ones who
power the growth
and they're the ones who largely
consumed the growth then there are the
non-rich majority those are now
sometimes called the global precariat
precariat is a workforce proletariat
living in a precarious existence that's
increasing status of global workforce in
the united states that precariat is
subject to global working insecure
worker insecurity it's alan greenspan's
words when he was testifying to congress
about the success of the economy he was
managing he said it's based on growing
worker insecurity which is the basis for
a healthy economy any economist can
explain if workers are insecure they
don't ask for rights they don't ask for
wages they don't make any protests you
can harshly exploit them the Citigroup
analysts advise investors to focus on
the very rich where the action is they
have what they call a plutonomy stock
basket you know investment advice aimed
at the very rich and they point out that
that economies stock basket has greatly
outperformed the world index of
developed markets since 1985 that's when
Reagan Thatcher economic programs of
enriching the very
really taking off well that that's a
shift of power and a very significant
one I've barely skimmed the surface of
these critical issues enough i hope to
suggest things you can think about but i
don't want to end without mentioning
another externality that's dismissed in
market systems that's the fate of the
species if you're a corporate executive
your task is to maximize short-term
profit and market share that's in fact
when your salaries based on if that
happens to endanger the species that's
an externality you don't pay for it you
don't take account of it in a market
system in the financial system systemic
risk main externality that can be
remedied by the taxpayer but nobody's
come to come to the rescue of the
environment is destroyed and that it
must be destroyed comes pretty close to
being an institutional imperative so us
business leaders us is the most business
run Society in the world so significant
in this respect us business leaders are
quite openly the conducting energetic
propaganda campaigns to convince the
population that anthropogenic global
warming human contribution to global
warming is just a hoax and they're
having some success by now probably
two-thirds of the population
doesn't believe it well these same
people who are running the campaign's
they're just like the rest of us do they
understand very well that the threat is
grave I mean in their private lives
maybe they're contributing to you know
Sierra Club or something but in their
institutional lives they have a role
they have to maximize short-term profit
and market share if they don't do it
they'll be thrown out and somebody also
come in who will do it meaning the
problem is an institutional it's not
individual as it's much more severe now
this is another vicious cycle and this
one could will turn out to be lethal if
you want to get a sense of how grave the
danger is simply have a look at the new
Congress in the United States which is
propelled into power bi business funding
and propaganda almost all of the new
people in Congress are climate deniers
climate change deniers don't believe it
and they've already begun to cut
measures that might mitigate
environmental catastrophe so for example
they're trying to get rid of the
Environmental Protection Agency
introduced by Nixon blast liberal
president and now they want to get rid
of it and much else we're still some of
them are really true believers for
example the new head of a subcommittee
on the environment that he explained to
the press that global warming cannot be
a problem because God promised Noah that
there wouldn't be another flood
takes care of that will actually
one shouldn't laugh I mean if this was
happening in some small remote country
okay then you could laugh but not when
it's happening in the richest and most
powerful country in world history and
before we laugh we might also bear in
mind that the current the financial and
economic crisis is traceable in no small
measure to a fanatic faith in certain
dogmas such as what's called the
efficient market hypothesis and in
general to what Nobel laureate Joseph
Stiglitz 15 years ago called the
religion and it is a religion that
markets know best the religion made it
unnecessary for economists and in fact
the Federal Reserve the central bank
made it unnecessary for them to notice
that there was an eight trillion dollar
housing bubble it's a lot of money a
trillion dollar housing bubble no
economic fundamentals no relation to
anything that in the economy but they
don't have to notice it because the
market knows best efficient markets
devastated the economy when it bursts
that's a serious religion that interest
incidentally that religion has been
reconstituted almost without change
after the total collapse of this edifice
this intellectual edifice is remarkable
the economic history in fact an
intellectual history it's useful to
think about what's being done in the
richest country richest most powerful
country in human history and what's
going on in the poorest country of south
america in the united states congress is
taking the lead in the obama
administration's going along in
undermining any hope for preventing
catastrophe and as i mentioned it's
driven by deeply rooted institutional
factors first country in South America
is Bolivia they are have taken the lead
in the world in efforts to protect the
environment their most me some reason
effort is to pass legislation granting
rights to the natural world well
sophisticated Westerners ridicule such
naive Tay but unless we gain some of the
sensibility of the indigenous majority
in Bolivia the last laughs going to be
on us well all of this and a great deal
more can proceed as long as the washer
doctrine prevailed as long as the
general population is passive apathetic
diverted to consumerism hatred of the
vulnerable as long as that goes on the
powerful can do it please masters of the
universal at their will and those who
managed to survive
can contemplate the ruins Thanks i would
like to quote you in an article on
capitalism europe and the world bank
about a court case that that urged
corporations to carry out benevolent
activities or else and aroused public
may figure out what corporations are up
to and take away their privileges now
given that how you on different
occasions quoted John Dewey the
government is the shadow cast by
business of a society does court cases
like dodge vs 4th affect the behavior of
politicians so those were court cases
like dodge birth for ya the behavior of
politicians and the vs which methods are
at the disposal of small and regional
operating initiatives to make
politicians aware of the existence of an
aroused public sex well the business
can't ignore the minute I quote John
Dewey but I also quote Adam Smith said
the same thing the
business can't ignore what the
population is doing actually that's true
of totalitarian states as well so for
example the Nazi leadership could not
ignore public opinion if you look back
it provided benefits to the public to
try to keep him quiet and the same is
true in every totalitarian state and
certainly and more free and democratic
societies that's true and you can see it
happening so let's go back to the Great
Depression the there was President
Roosevelt was unlike the current
leadership he was fairly sympathetic to
Social Democratic measures but at one
point he told labor leaders who were
pressing for him to do various things he
basically told them you make me do it
what he meant is get out in the streets
protesting the factories carry out
sit-down strikes organize and if there's
enough public pressure i'll do it but
I've got a facedown corporate power well
that's basically the right advice and
that's exactly what happened the great
depression is an interesting case it
began in 1929 but the measured the New
Deal measures actually began about six
years later took a while and by that
time there was
massive public protest that was the
period of great labor organizing the CIO
the great industrial union was being
organized and they were moving on to
sit-down strikes the sit-down strikes
are extremely frightening to the Masters
of mankind because a sit-down strike is
just one step before saying we don't
need the bosses will run the place
ourselves okay at that point you get a
major concerns actually those are the
concerns that in the early post-war
period animated US and British planners
in places like Germany they were
concerned that that was going to happen
under pressure this pressure from the
East that they were worried about it's
one of the reasons they wanted the wall
off western Germany and the same
elsewhere so these are constant concerns
and it runs from factories to protest in
the streets so for example and it has
effect during the 1960's the next great
in the United States the next major
period of sort of social democratic
activism on the part of the government
that was clearly motivated
mostly used at that time activism in the
nineteen which you know about the
radical activism of the 60s and in fact
the business world was very upset about
it and the liberal intellectuals were
very upset about it if you haven't read
it there's a important book to read
called the crisis of democracy published
by the trilateral commission and around
mid 70s the trilateral commission is
liberal internationalists from Europe
the United States and Japan three major
industrial countries to give a sense of
their complexion they're the people who
staffed the Carter Administration that's
kind of the liberal extreme that you go
over the right it's much harsher so what
was the crisis of democracy that they
were concerned about they were concerned
that the population was demanding too
much democracy the people who are
usually passive and apathetic what they
call the special interests are getting
out in the streets protesting and
assisting on their demands so who are
the special interests the young the old
workers farmers in fact the population
the population of the special interest
if you notice there's one you read the
book you find is one interest that they
don't mention the corporate power and
there's a reason for that because
they're the national interest by
definition so they can ever ask for too
much they're supposed to get everything
but the rest of the population which is
supposed to be obey the washer doctrine
supposed to be passive apathetic
diverted something else they were
getting out and demanding things and
there were changes and in fact these
changes read primarily in the Nixon in
the Johnson administration but also in
the Nixon administration he as I
mentioned was the last liberal kind of
Social Democratic president well that's
from the pressures and that happens over
and over all the time so that's just a
continuing aspect of modern history so
there's a lot you can do in fact almost
anything you know free societies like
like ours very few limits the maybe
might be hard you know you might lose a
job or something but you're not going to
be tossed into a torture chamber you
know it's not like the global south or
totalitarian states so true this
everything's Oh exactly what to do
depends on the circumstances in the
issue a lot of it's going on right now
and say Spain with very significant
protests underway you went on in the
United States in the industrial
heartland Wisconsin it right at the same
time as the Arab Spring and also very
significant if that reaches enough of a
scale
the people who run the place have to pay
attention fact if you read the business
literature after the 1930s New Deal
measures they were terrified the
business literature talks about that the
hazard facing industrialists in the
rising political power of the masses I'm
quoting the need to fight the
everlasting battle for the mind of men
to indoctrinate people with a capitalist
story or else we'll be in trouble if
this sounds like a little red book
that's it's because it is the business
classes are vulgar Marxist and what
they're always fighting a bitter class
war and that values have inverted but
it's just what you read in you no malice
tracks or something like that so they
understand constantly at it and if the
population gets out of control then you
have to do things plenty of examples
modern history is full of them that's
why we have more freedom the more rights
and so on it's not given as gifts from
above hunger
as I understood you it's upon us as
citizens to change the system do you
think democracy as we have it at the
moment is enough for that we need forms
of direct democracy or new forms of
democracy and in principle we've got
institutions that could work but you
have to make them work it's like
Roosevelt said make me do it and there
are big barriers to democracy so for
example there's a fundamental country of
contradiction between capitalism and
democracy can't overcome that
contradiction so it's
capitalist system has changed over the
years but still divided between people
who give orders and people who take them
and as long as that goes on well that's
it plainly a barrier to democracy if the
Masters of mankind Adam Smith's phrase
if they get too much power then the
barrier is very high if they can be
controlled
barrier goes down it's dentally to quote
John Dewey again the John Dewey was not
a particular radical is the leading
social philosopher in the United States
the late 20th century 20th century
throughout his physician was not only
that what you quoted that democracy is
the shadow cast by business over society
he also went on he said this he went on
say this isn't going to change until you
have democracy everywhere meaning
industrial democracy in the workplace
worker control of production and popular
control of every other institution as
long as you don't have that policy will
remain the shadow cast by concentrated
power over society so yeah there should
be if you really want functioning
democracy it's got to go to
institutional changes significant ones
your fauna that we shop savannah is a st
of pharmacy redundancy him hello my
name's Julio's from radio station in
Kosovo Padilla mr. Chomsky I have two
questions you were speaking about the
Arab Spring how do you analyze the
uprisings now masses of people in Spain
and especially now in Greece garner
streets rejecting the party system and
demanding direct democracy and you were
referring to the nuclear ambitions of
Iran how can you do that without
mentioning the slaughtering of people in
Iran from the regime they're people who
are struggling for freedom in the last
years in a democracy in Iran in your
area well
first of all Spain and Greece quite
important things you're having quite
important things are happening in Iran
in Greece but they're different you
gotta look at these things in their
particular circumstances so in Greece
there's massive public protests against
the austerity programs that are being
imposed by the central authorities and
those are very destructive programs I
think for all of Europe my own feeling I
think that's what you need at a time of
recession is not austerity you need
stimulus in this case saying tend to
agree with the Obama administration they
do much do little of it but in Greece
it's harming them very badly and they
have real problems but the programs that
are being rammed down their throat but
the European authorities are very likely
going to destroy the economy so people
are protesting but if you look closely
they don't seem to be protesting for
anything not much at least there aren't
it's hard to find any positive corals
coming out they're opposing what's
happening and they should be but what do
you do well you know there are a few
options not very many didn't talk about
them in Spain there's major protests and
there are programs but if you look at
the programs they are sensible but
mildly reformist so mildly performant
they're needed but the even the press
points out Spanish press well these are
feasible mostly they're calling for a
political reform like a change in the
electoral system to allow more
participation and so on those are things
that could be instituted without
the Masters objecting much so it's very
important mega one may go on beyond that
but right now it's a significant call
for limited but essential reform that's
your aunt in Greece roughly in the
United States Wisconsin which was a big
uprising that tens of thousands of
people in the streets day after day
occupying the state capitol and so on it
went well beyond and not just young
people they were calling for something
else namely defense of rights that are
being destroyed there's an effort by the
right wing to eliminate the last limited
residue of labor rights collective
bargaining and there's big popular
uprising to produce that he mentioned he
ran this is very ugly regime highly
repressive but unfortunately it's not
unusual in the region like Saudi Arabia
is worse nobody talks about Saudi Arabia
because the US a Western client so they
can do whatever they like there was an
effort in Saudi Arabia to join the Arab
Spring have a day of rage protests on
Friday now the security presence was so
extreme that people were afraid to go
out in the streets nothing happened and
there's no protest in the West the same
equate loyal dictators are given the
right to do anything they want disloyal
ones you got to do something about Iran
nothing much at the West can do so you
know just they scream about it but
anything so sure we ought to talk about
it we ought to try to help the
protesters and try to protect them but
the means are quite limited in contrast
the means are very great where the West
has influenced substantial influence as
with the Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain
Egypt elsewhere so yes you're right but
what would you suggest doing Z see him
what do you take you to explain meaning
of nation-building nation-building
nation-building it's just another fraud
you know it's like I mean
come there are there are real cases so
the cases that are always presented in
the literature are the success in nation
building in Western Europe and Japan
after the Second World War but take a
close look at what was done first of all
these were societies that had already
been functioning like if you go back to
the 1920s let's say Germany was
considered the you know most democratic
society in the West also the peak of
Western civilization in many ways you
know sciences arts and so on a major
industrial power was all in people's
heads so to wreak their was no real
nation building in Germany it was just
allowing local forces to act within
limits and you should it's important to
understand the limits this good
scholarship on this I was quoting some
of it the effort the primary effort in
Germany and the rest of Europe was to
restore the traditional order and to
crush the anti-fascist resistance which
was largely labor based so they got to
be crushed traditional order has to be
rinsed restored
it started right away as the British and
American forces were beginning to enter
Europe that started in Italy remember
Sicily and up through the Italian
peninsula 1943 one of their first tasks
was to restore the fascist order and a
traditional business rule and to destroy
the resistance and the resistance was
pretty significant the Italian partisans
they were holding down six Nazi
divisions and they had pretty much
liberated the northern part of the
country before the British and Americans
got there the British and Americans had
to destroy the democratic system that
had been developed by the left movements
left labor movements and to restore the
traditional order then I won't go
through the details but subversion in
Italy goes right on until at least the
1970s when the record runs dry to try to
prevent those forces from emerging in
Greece it was the same Britain tried to
suppress the adding-up anti-nazi
resistance they weren't powerful enough
to do it they called in the United
States in 47 48 there was a major civil
war which may be a 150,000 people or so
got killed tortured terror or so on
essentially restoring the traditional
quasi fascist order through
out the partisan movement the left and
so on and it happened everywhere same in
Japan same in Korea that was a post-war
policy so yes there was a kind of nation
building but nation building in accord
with grand area principles not the
pleasant mythology that people are
taught in school so young it can happen
but the other places where there have
been economic and social successes it's
been over the objections of the west
there's pretty good scholarship on this
incidentally so it's the nation building
is kind of like democracy promotion it's
another term use the same way and
there's very good scholarship on it it
doesn't penetrate the intellectual
community doesn't reach the media and so
on but it's there if you want to look
into it speaking of the united states
that the very good source is the work of
a man named Thomas Carruthers he's a
true believer he's he was a fish alann
the Reagan administration insider
working on Nate on nation building
democracy promotion in mostly Latin
America but he's written about it all
over the world he was the head of the
law and democracy project of the
Carnegie Endowment no big prestigious
institution written several books right
up into the mid couple of years years
ago and he points out that he's a good
scholar and on a scholar he believes in
it but he says that you speak about the
United States same with everyone else he
said us leaders are schizophrenic they
support democracy if and only if it
accords with social and economic
objectives
and he takes the Reagan administration
which was full of talk of democracy
promotion and he was in it he was
working within it he said they were
sincere but they if you look at the
progress of democracy he said and the
Western Hemisphere it did occur but it
occurred in the regions where the United
States had least influence so if you go
down to the southern cone southern
countries of the Western Hemisphere
there was progress and democracy and as
he pointed out Reagan tried to prevent
it and support the dictatorships he
couldn't manage so there was some
democracy promotion but he come to the
regions near the United States where US
influence was overwhelming he's
essentially note moves towards democracy
and he gives the reason the United
States was willing to tolerate only
top-down forms of democracy in which
traditional ruling groups remain in
control and remain subservient to the
United States as it approximately his
words well he considers this a kind of
like a pathology so the leadership will
be sent to for psychoanalysis because
they're schizophrenic there's a much
simpler explanation plainly but that
one's ideologically unacceptable and the
same is true of nation-building so for
democracy is fine for the West in
Eastern Europe great so you hell what's
called democracy in fact it's
interesting to look at why they held it
to go back to the business press in 1990
they're very enthusiastic about the
right
separation of the eastern european
satellites from Soviet control the
reasons were it would enable business
leaders to undermine the quoting the
luxurious lifestyle of Western workers
because there's a new labor force that's
healthy educated blond and blue-eyed
they didn't say that but that's implicit
that can be exploited very brutally
exploited and that will undercut the
Western labor movements so it's terrific
democracy in Eastern Europe's fantastic
but not democracy in the countries that
we want to control like not in the
Middle East for example because it would
be a disaster as I said just look at
public opinion so that's nation-building
and democracy promotion it's very hard
to find an exception maybe there's space
for one last short question because we
have an invitation then to dinner with
the rector and I think they have to
I think it's worthwhile yeah and yeah
who is who is we see close to a 22
microphone
shut up
Christophe just give the microphone to
somebody
their son
we have in drum press we have Harry otic
reminders that the European monetary
union is on the brink of collapse on the
one hand because like our payments to
Greece and Portugal and Ireland of
course always with casino phobic
undertones and on the other hand that
the dollar is also very volatile I'm not
sure I'm really skeptic about what this
these announcements have for a function
but do you believe that or these
currencies are really on the brink of
collapse and if that would happen what
effect would that have on the global
order I don't think that the the euro
and the dollar and the end are not on
the brink of collapse now these are very
rich societies with all the problems
they're having historically speaking
it's pretty bridge that's not there
they're suffering but not at the style
of the South there are problems Europe
is it is rich enough to bail out the
countries that are in trouble but it's
not at all clear that that's the right
approach I mean why should Europe follow
the recommendations of the central bank
let's say the solution to recession is
austerity that's been tried and that's
Herbert Hoover in the United States you
know yeah his position was we got a big
depression let's go to austerity well
you know what happened economy totally
collapse
and there's pretty good reason to
suspect that that will happen again if
the austerity is just not the right
response to unemployment recession
what's the right response is essentially
in a state capitalist system they're
more radical responses but keeping to
the institutions the right response is
probably Keynes's response which worked
stimulate the shortage of demand demand
stimulated and that's got to come from
the government it could lead to a
deficit debt and so on but that can be
overcome with growth that's the way to
overcome it if freedom were the main
problem all over the Western world is
not yet its unemployment unemployment is
an extremely severe problem for one
thing it's very harmful to the people
you know in such as done human grounds
the people the families the communities
they are suffering but furthermore even
on just narrow economic grounds
unemployment means unused resources
these are this is working people who
want to work there things that have to
be done but the system is so irrational
it can't put on a eager needed work into
the hands of eager people well that's a
real social economic problem it's not
solved by increasing austerity programs
if you look at the particular countries
that you mentioned they're all different
so Ireland for example actually had a
surplus Spain to at a surplus in Ireland
the
economic crisis came primarily because
the government bailed out the banks I
mean the bank's destroyed the economy
they came up that come came to the
public and say ok bail us out and yeah
they did there's another approach and
that it's a it's your problem I mean
suppose we anybody really believed in
capitalism nobody does but if they did
if investors let's say banks and make
risky loans a lot of profit and then it
crashes it's the problem of the
investors it's not the problem the
community if anybody believes in
capitalism so that's another approach
that could have taken okay you made the
investments you made the profits now
it's your problem you take the losses
but the Masters of mankind don't think
of the losses they expect the public the
bail amount it's pretty much was
happening in Spain Greece is a somewhat
different problem but I don't doesn't
you know I all of these things are
debatable it's not two plus two equals
four but there's good reason to think
that the programs that are being pursued
are not well adapted to a situation of
deep unemployment unused resources you
know human cost and deficit which is a
problem that could be overcome with
growth if demand is increased the United
States is an interesting case actually
you know it's kind of leads led the way
in this but if you look closely at the
United States the deficit which is the
big problems the only issue discussed in
Washington is the deficit practically no
discussion of the fact that unemployment
is at depression levels for much of the
population what's the deficit well this
has been well
in the United States about half the
deficit comes from military spending
military spending in the United States
is out of sight you know it's about as
much as the rest of the world combined
it doesn't provide security in fact it
provides insecurity but it's there for
its own reasons basically granted the
area reasons in fact i quoted clinton as
saying we have to keep forces forward
deployed in europe and asia in order to
ensure that people do what we want okay
not for the american population so
that's roughly half the deficit the
other half the deficit comes from the
completely dysfunctional health care
system the US health care system is an
international scandal it's about twice
the per capita cost of other industrial
countries that has some of the worst
outcomes and the reasons not hard to
discover it's the only privatized
unregulated system and the private
sector is extremely bad at providing
public goods like health highly
inefficient a lot of administrative
costs profits of bureaucracy and all
kinds of things so sure it's extremely
expensive drugs in the United States
cost about twice as much as comparable
countries and the reason again is very
straight forward in the United States
and I think it's the only country in the
world at least that I know of the
government is not permitted by law to
negotiate drug prices they can negotiate
anything else but not drug prices so big
surprise correct prices are out of sight
this is incidentally over the objections
of about eighty five percent of the
population there are ways to deal with
this which are not utopian in fact if
the US had the same
kind of health care system as other
industrial countries no not utopian that
would be no deficit in fact it would
actually be a surplus but you can't
touch that because that's getting to the
centers of power the financial
institutions big pharmaceutical
institutions they won't allow it to be
discussed since they basically run the
government you have a huge deficit well
you know you take a look at other
countries you can find ways of dealing
with the deficit problem differs from
country to country and the big problem
is lack of demand and lack of jobs and I
think that's you know so the system
doesn't have to collapse I mean maybe it
will if the wrong policies are followed
but then look likely thank you very much
you
