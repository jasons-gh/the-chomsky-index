she in general according to German
critical theorist Herbert Marcus a
revolution can be defined in part as
action which seeks to secure the life of
freedom and happiness of future
generations in light of looming
catastrophic climate change this
definition would seem to hold a great
deal great amount of importance today
within the modern Western revolutionary
tradition some of the most promising
movements have arguably been gratis by
booth and the conspiracy of equals Rosa
Luxemburg and thus part of his league
and the Spanish anarchists what would
you say is the role of direct action in
revolutionary struggle you know this is
first of all I think we shouldn't assume
that revolutionary struggle is the only
option what we've just been discussing
for example you can call reformist if
you like it's taking the institution's
reshaping of reconstructing them turning
them into democratic institutions and
carrying out actions that are quite
feasible than with benefits for all of
it is that a revolution will reform
what's the role of direct action saying
that well the role of direct action
would have been realistically for
popular movements to have pressured the
government to take that direction which
would not have been impossible I'm in
fact right now and the old rust belt
there is something like this
and then the old rust / much smaller
scale back in 1977 young the u.s. steel
major corporation decided to close their
operations in Youngstown Ohio which was
a steel town had been built by steel
workers by the union that was major
steel town that I was going to destroy
every one's occupation the community
society everything that's a decision
made by bankers in work you know they
make not make enough profit the Union
Steel Workers Union offered to buy the
plants and run by the workforce of it
this was an effort that the company did
the corporation didn't want that it's
kind of interesting it would have been
more profitable for them but I think a
class interest militated against this
happens frequently multinational
frequently will refuse that offered by
the workers to buy out something they
want to close and prefer to take the
loss of just destroying it to having the
precedent of worker owned enterprises
that's what it looks like to me I can't
prove it corporations are totalitarian
institutions we don't get access to
their internal decisions but that's what
it looks like anyway the company refused
went to the courts and went all the way
to Supreme Court of the staunton lend
the art of the cases with community
Steelworkers they lost but they could
have one with enough popular support
anyhow after they lost the the skill
he's worth about they didn't give up
they started working people started
developing small enterprises worker on
which they tried to integrate into the
community and it's not proliferate it
significantly around Cleveland Northern
Iowa there's a quite a network of worker
owned the tender process on worker
manage until it's gap but worker owned
enterprises which can become worker
manage its extent extend expanding right
now there's an effort by the US Steel
Workers to make some sort of the deal
with monitor gone the huge best
conglomerate which is again worker owned
the management selected by workers but
not for advantage and that's got some
prospects too so I think to be so what
is direct action and well all of these
things are direct action their direct
action geared to the existing
circumstances direct action has to be
based on an analysis of what the
existing circumstances are and how an
action can modify them positively
there's no general formula you can't say
direct actions good or bad sometimes to
be harmful isn't
official sometimes it could be
revolutionary sometimes McCreery forums
you simply ask yourself what to be
achieved now so these developments in
say northern Ohio really are reforms
they're even supported by Republican
governors by some sectors business no
pets or fits their right-wing
libertarian conceptions fine this person
s nothing wrong with it but you just
have to he just can't give general
formulas for tactical choices they
depend on a exact close analysis of the
situation sparta cysts are a good case
in point rosa luxemburg went along with
the smartest of verizon toshi was
opposed to it she was opposed to it not
in principle but because she realized it
was going to fail gonna be crushed but
out of solidarity she went along with it
she was killed
