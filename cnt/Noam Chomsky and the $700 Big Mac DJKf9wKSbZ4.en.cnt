okay I'd like to start our discussion
with the $700 Big Mac the $700 Big Mac
you know purchasing power is usually
measured by Big Macs how much a Big Mac
costs and say Montreal $7.00 and how
much it costs in India for example I
used that data to compare the value of
money in different regions McDonald's a
big Donald's burger a McDonald's burger
burger
yeah burger from McDonald's the
signature burger yeah the Big Mac a
measure of the power of money so the
purchasing power selected like a coke
can
so I like to start this discussion with
the $7.00 $700 Big Mac yes basically
you're purchasing power if a rich person
buys a Big Mac for them it's it's
nothing but if we made it so that Big
Macs cost a rich person $700 then you
balance out the inequality of inelastic
suggesting adjusting yep costs to a
person's will yes you are basically if
they're the purchasing power because we
could argue injustice oh yeah yeah does
the storekeeper first do an
investigation yes yes you you would have
some kind of card or identification
saying you would pay only $7 for your
Big Mac you look at your income taxes
every year you get an income
will the sequestered number they pay a
fraction of the income taxes first of
all the income tax is no measure of
Taxation yeah
income tax is slightly progressive but
the total tax system is regressive well
there's many ways of going about this
was I think they have an incentive to
hide their taxes from from the top but
what about from the bottom for people
vendors of goods and services I'm not
even talking about the question because
it's so totally begin with it would
require an authoritarian state from the
ground up I think businesses could say
we're not gonna sell diapers or EpiPens
and unless you show us a copy of your
tax income it shouldn't be in a secret
your financial government of course
businesses it's turn Center because they
get more money from tourists while it's
in one of the cases where collusion
could work in the benefit of the
consumer collusion among businesses
first of all there's no all of these
presupposes some very powerful Authority
you know with extraordinary information
about each individual that's a
totalitarian state of the
I mean you look at Facebook and Google
these days they have that information
anyways why not for a change I mean
Robin Hood fish with no information
about your world well why should it be
so sacred I mean what is it a coffee
worth to you and what is the coffee
worth to Bill Gates for example Neil
deGrasse Tyson you said it if I walked
by a penny on the ground I won't pick it
up but if I see it a 10 cent dime I'll
pick it up the equivalent of Bill Gates
speaking I'm bending over picking up a
Ted said that would be $10,000 one can
discuss the moral ethical character of
this proposal that I see no point in
going into it because it presupposes the
level of totalitarianism no reason
directive I mean you're just showing how
much money you have it's a question of
Robin Hood used to steal from the poor
and give to the rich but Robin Hood in
this scenario would protect them from
the poor from having their goods and
services stolen from the rich since it's
totally inconceivable without a massive
totalitarian state I don't see any more
this 21st century I mean that artists my
phone to collect financial detail to
work out a system by which such
information will be available to people
well then so you're endorsing and if
it's conceivable are you endorsing it if
it's conceivable would you endorse if
it's good
I'd essentially don't so much isn't
involved but it's not a simple yes-or-no
question yeah but the question doesn't
arise because he presupposes that made a
kind of zoo surveillance and control
that I would never want to see exist
just giving what it's worth you know a
$700 Big Mac the 1% would basically pay
1% there have their money worth 1% I
don't think that's a reasonable social
policy but I also don't see any point
discussing it because of its pretty
selfish you know presuppose how do you
soft a 1% owning all of the goods and
services is not getting my point -
before we even talk about this proposal
you have to ask how does it get
implemented
it's as if you asked me why shouldn't we
have peace on earth and goodwill to men
there any point discussing then no
because the presuppositions are
unrealizable I'm in the case of your
proposal yeah the presuppositions
conceivably are realizable under a form
of totalitarianism so extreme that
no-one's ever dreamt of it before
because they're Greta Steinberg you know
anything so there's no point that we
need a comprehensive solution to all of
the problems are facing the world today
I bet I used to have become it has to be
doable and this is something that's
doable
same smart dude
you say you like them they have to be
doable because they can be implemented
so I have a simple suggestion lay out in
detail how this information is going to
be available to every business and how
both how businesses will be compelled to
adhere to when you present that we can
discuss the question so why don't we
move on to the mix okay
let's talk about Descartes Descartes
taker yeah we get into this scenario of
an existential dilemma which is I think
their fire and that only addresses a
representational approach to reality
whereas ownership it requires an
additional process of addition you have
to own your reality so instead of I
think therefore I am
it should be I add ethical son I add
therefore I am I in the process of
adding different they are therefore ya
know I add add you to my life okay
therefore
doc well I add them to my existence
and therefore we exist just thinking of
them what you Nathan
Neverland where there's no logic to it
what it's saying is if I can add yeah
it's not all the thinking that makes you
be its furthermore notice that the co2
is fallacious all that follows from I
think is there is
yeah but it's kind of funny to think I
add ergo sum sum which is the total of
addition I mean we have to have 21st
century solutions to 21st century
problems I mean we have to you know your
corpus has always been about finding
solutions to problems no not remaining
with the status quo and not trying to
innovate use innovation and we've known
each other for 14 years back and forth
otherwise our real problems like the
problem of you know could be conspicuous
consumption when you have all these
millionaires who are collecting
Lamborghinis and warehouses that are
collecting dust when people kind of form
diapers for their children
as every minute says in their recent
book very okay and can you I elaborate
I'm not familiar first of all we have to
recognize that any solution has to be
attainable there's no point talking
about solutions which you can obtain yes
okay so we therefore start with the
existing society that's what we're
talking about the beliefs that people
have the assumptions we think how we can
modify those are the institution
structure and we can take steps towards
modifying them so for example the wealth
tax yeah yeah yeah but that's just the
government getting your money from the
top it's not their businesses they're
getting it from the bottom there's a
belief white people who don't understand
democracy there are some difficult
matters in a in agent actually in a
democratic society the government is
just an agency of the population so if
money goes to the government that's
essentially money to the population yeah
now if this comes in society to the
extent of the Society's Democratic so
there's nothing wrong with the money
going to the government if the
government responds to people's
decisions and choices so for example for
better health care to veterans
so if money comes from the wealthy yeah
that goes to those services isn't that
smart
yeah that's not a solution to the
problem
no we need a it's a bad bigger bigger
solution a bigger solution would change
the institutions yeah that's that takes
a lot of food and it's a longtime
student yeah I'm beginning to try to
educate people I don't see this thing of
a very difficult to implement I mean
your smartphone through a financial
intermediary can multiply your bill at
any small bit of business by a certain
amount I'm sure that your smartphone
what you pay with it at the cash can
multiply your bill by say five or
divided by you know by two personal
issues - morphine because you don't
understand people living under the
poverty line money comes in and goes and
they can't hold on to money you know
whereas people who are rich if they do
it just flows into a stagnant water kind
of situation - yeah we have to Train
this money quality and as I said serious
proposals there's more long-term
solutions we have to drain the swamp
somehow drain the swamp
but there are we look for country two
issues we can also talk about little bit
an ideal society you know I like that
what would your ideals that reality be
like well I would like to see a society
in which decision-making over every
organization institutional community is
in the hands of participants that they
form voluntary associations with one
another we're very far from realizing
that we can take small steps - so for
example the work around enterprises or
small static - yeah yeah those are there
developer
but how would you deal with defense
problems problems that have to do with
defense defense defense defense its
motion aggression okay well yeah
aggression is freedom so how do we do
with aggression yeah we don't
participate there okay remember that
until 1947 the United States didn't have
a defense we had a war deportable yeah
because that was pre or will you know in
the time of war will want you to say
when you mean wars a defense hasn't been
federal defenses well more well referred
to it as the Ministry of peace how can
we pause for the sorry we've set the
cameras
okay
what do you think about the blackout in
Iran yeah the internet blackout they
shouldn't do it but notice that there is
a background yeah the background is that
the United States is very openly no
secret about it
it is packed doing everything it can to
do that I can do a lot to destroy the
economy of Iran with the purpose of the
eliciting protest internally the actual
didn't threaten the regime and the way
they do that in fact under conditions of
economic collapse which the US has
imposed there is are uprisings and the
government which is a pretty rotten yeah
but it's using force to impress yeah
that's the stories I got a great deed I
and we want to do something about it
seriously what we do is start here and
in Canada with the efforts to destroy
the economy if we want the government
not to use repressive methods we begin
by taking our attempts to destroy the
economy with the conscious purpose of
eliciting protists which in turn will
elicit refresh so there's a lot we can
do about it it's much easier to say well
terrible they fine
yes Victor but now look at ourselves and
see the earth and the way we're almost
worse than that well you know I mean two
wrongs don't make a right
the United States and it's basically the
Mafia done the kind of is
the lower mafia figures they collaborate
in Europe as well mainly under coercion
under US commercial unwilling to face to
carry out highly destructive programs
that would then need to repressive acts
and then the field about object into the
repressive acts but not looking into the
mirror not asking what we're doing to
listen to those days so we should modify
that we should start in Canada the
United States by trying to bring people
to face the fact that we we have major
responsibility for these repressive X
and let's change what we do so to
mitigate the situation yeah there's a
lot of blowback because to achieve
nothing to I think it's interesting
because the whole world is plugged into
the internet it's plugged into the
internet like 24/7 and then you have
this region of the world that suddenly
they've been out of the internet for a
while it's almost as though they're
going to be traveling back and forth in
time what's happening is this is one
area of the world where the United
States with the cooperation of Canada
and Europe is to purposely destroying
the economy with the purpose of
eliciting protests which of course with
any move by they keep being aggressive I
mean this is one example one person they
said what the Yemenis who attacks about
this out here well Edward it's the
United States from Saudi Arabia that are
being
no but that attack that well facilities
in Saudi Arabia for you know the the
drone attacks in Saudi Arabia they say
it was together me get me means restless
right
many people say me that is when you a
favor revenue torture and destroyed
people they sometimes react yeah okay
there's a famous French slogan thenen
Montreal you understand French oh yeah
set that name out of it they made Sean
great combo attack a form for near
Plymouth CUDA Gideon it's better to
foresee their to to fix afterwards if
you
what about Trump but the economy is
doing so professor Chomsky the math for
descendants have record unemployment
it's one afro-descendants in America
black Americans have record low
unemployment okay if you want to study
the employment you look at government
statistics okay there's one that they
that you and the media to quote yeah
it's cold in unemployment yeah you're
counted as employed if you have one hour
a week that's work okay
if you have a if you take a look at
other measures they have like percentage
of the labor force that has jobs it's
much lower than it's been in the past
because so many people just given up
yeah so it comes out to about seven and
a half percent furthermore Trump has had
no effect on this
it's a continue look at the at the
charts it's a steady decline decline in
the unemployment since 2008 has not
changed at all under Trump furthermore
the jobs are of very low quality there
are yes there are studies so a nature of
jobs turns out that you know whereas if
you go back a few years about half of
them were below the average amount about
two-thirds will have well there's
automation you know automation is
replacing everything artificial
intelligence automation as nothing
through artificial intelligence has to
do with definite social policies which
are transferring wealth to a tiny
percentage of the bubble yes
well everything else stagnant that goes
back to that forty years yeah Trump is
accelerating it like it's one
legislative achievement is the tax bill
which was just a gift to the super-rich
yeah I think they should be made to pay
to the through the teeth you know if you
want to buy a Lamborghini luxury goods
should be more expensive for rich people
and less expensive for middle-class
people whereas inelastic and demand the
good talked about that's not the source
of the problems all the source of the
problems are a set of policy choices
neoliberalism it seems I don't really
understand that term I mean it's like
never Trump furs or something never
Trump furs nobody really understands
what a nervous
from this began under actually began in
the late seventies we took off under
Thatcher and Reagan okay that was picked
up by Clinton the set of policies which
are designed essentially to throw most
of the population on the market
yeah well the wealthy and the corporate
sector are massively subsidized okay so
that has pretty obvious effect yeah and
Trump is just accelerating but that's
not a serious point the serious crimes
were much different for example he's
determined to destroy organized human
life on earth there wasn't a bit how do
you substantiate that I don't looking at
the policies why is the United States
the only country in the developed
country in the world where emissions
have increased under what he claims it's
a myth propagated by the Chinese that
woman he claims that global warming is a
myth propagated by the Chinese just
right and Hitler claimed that the Jews
were going to take over the world but we
know how to evaluate that we know how to
evaluate Trump's me furthermore Trump
doesn't believe it we know perfectly
well the Trump was a firm believer in
global warming we have the proof so for
example he has a fancy golf course in
Ireland he appealed to the government of
Ireland for permission to build a wall
to protect his Golf Course from rising
sea all right so many's so he believes
it just like everyone else yeah I said
that room until they didn't care if it
destroys the organized human life on
earth that goes beyond but but he's very
positive he's a positive person awesome
yeah he's very enthusiastic about
respective continent
this is a very con man he understands
his constituencies his main
constituencies private wealth Soviet
lavish gifts on them his voting
constituency or people who are angry
resentful or frightened for good reason
many plays on their prejudices very
effectively but there's no Holocaust oh
I mean there's no Holocaust it's worse
than the Holocaust killed six million
Jews
what Trump's policies are trying to do
is basically destroy human will you
think is whether he has it doesn't
intentionally or doesn't you know it's
like the tape twirler but there's one
plate falling and then there's another
plate to find you're trying to fix
things and you're you causing another
problem very clear
