mid-seventies many people in the West
thought that Marxism had a reasonable
case to argue but in the mid-1980s many
of them no longer considered that it had
what exactly happened did it turned out
that it was all just a big joke well I
think what happened is what you brought
up before Marxism was associated with
the Soviet Union and now is China and
other so-called communist systems but
you know Marx what it turned over in his
grave to see what they were doing they
were radically anti-marxist radically
but as long a click see the way the
Bolsheviks Lenin Trotsky decided to had
to drive the backward peasantry to
industrialization by force in order to
lead ultimately to a socialist society
in the last 20 or 30 years of his life
and Marx was working on peasant society
in Russia he was you the worthy than the
rod Nix you know the urban his lectures
went out to the countryside to collect
information to figure out how the
peasants are living and so on and so
forth try to system and things and they
collected tons of data and Marx was just
pouring over the data and he convinced
and he became convinced that there's
real revolutionary potential in peasant
society that peasant communes a peasant
co-operative tradition and so on this
the the urban socialists both the
Bolsheviks and the Social Democrats
literally suppressed all that work it
was just too inconsistent with their own
class interests the you know controlling
social movement so that was gone but and
the same is true across the board I mean
I'm not again kinda like Adam Smith you
can't worship Mars had things to say and
what he had to say what he believed was
utterly inconsistent with what are
called the communist
socialist movement even more the
Communists and the the Social Democratic
ones after all he believed that in
England you noticed that's the social
democratic society of his day that there
could be a parliamentary road to
communism but you notice there was
enough participation of the public in in
decisions but at any event
once you associate Marx with Russia and
it's clear that Russia is becoming a
disaster as was becoming clear by the
80s well of course then you have to say
let's give up Marx and I think that's
essentially what happened
