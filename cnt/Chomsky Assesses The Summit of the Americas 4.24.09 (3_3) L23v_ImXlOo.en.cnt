they're threatening to become a kind of
an independent force and maybe the most
important region of the world were the
energy resources or so I don't want to
overdo it but there the point is that
these similarities in policy which you
can find all over the police they tell
you a lot about what drives policy I
mean in individual cases if you look at
them alone there are special factors
like how can they defy us right offshore
the oldest issue in American foreign
policies to get control over Cuba
defining us so there's a kind of like a
savage atmosphere which is sometimes
been described in the White House but in
other cases there's this or that
idiosyncrasy but there are common thing
themes and they're very rational and
it's not that they're crazy when
something goes wrong everybody says a
terrible mistake but follow you know I
so say the Vietnam War follow you what
wouldn't I in fact it's quite rational
basically succeeded huge power usually
succeed and so you know too bad about
60,000 American dead but that doesn't
make it a mistake from the point of view
of state planning so it's basically
succeeded the same in Latin America and
in fact that edit I won't go through the
cases but you find this constantly and
it makes perfect sense if it's a it's a
fact an illustration of what seems to me
about the only significant principle of
world affairs and then that its run like
the Mafia if the Godfather is informed
of a case of successful defiance you
know some grocery stores and paying
protection money he doesn't say ok
forget it we don't need his five dollars
what you do is send in your goons and
not only they can pay but beat him
bloody because that's the threat of a
good example and if he can get away with
it
grocery store across the street will say
okay I can do it too and you know pretty
soon the system of control you rose its
base a lot of its basic fear that's
what's called credibility in
international affairs if to maintain
credibility that means everybody's
afraid of you and just as in kind of a
mafia system and that's rational so you
get these extreme reactions to tiny
provocations Laos is a case in point I
happened to be there but in northern
Laos who Stone Age practically a stone
age society where most of people didn't
know they were in Laos there was some
very low-level organizing going on the
US by 1968 had a huge Air Force sitting
in the region which had been using the
bomb Vietnam but then negotiation
started in 68 so they didn't do with
them so they started bombing northern
Laos and bombed it so heavily that
people were living in caves for years
unable to farm that's partly just well
we got these resources we got to use
them it's a Clinton supposed to have
asked Obama or bush or Powell or someone
Hillary Clinton's was too vast Powell
would he have this big army for if you
don't use it or maybe I've got the wrong
people but somebody said it and you know
is that kind of thinking so they had to
use it and it made sense to use it to
try to put an end to the minuscule
threat that something might start with
might spread elsewhere and it same with
Grenada soon as Grenada just started the
most minimal reforms in the under the
Carter government this was the cargo van
immediately reacted with pretty extreme
measures I mean it ended aid you know it
refused to give aid to the whole
Caribbean region after a hurricane
unless
it was excluded than later Reagan
invaded and so on crazy predates but all
of this it's kind of plausible from the
point of view rational planning on the
part of the Mafia Don or the equivalent
and international affairs of the world
leader and of course you have to have
ways of covering it up and that's what
the intellectual classes are for and the
median so you get the Boston Globe
editorials which is just don't pick on
them just happen to read it but it's
common our effort to bring democracy
failed so therefore we ought to modify
our tactics that doesn't matter what the
record shows the rain democracy was a
joke and punishing the population made a
lot of sense and you got to continue to
publish that they still haven't
overthrown the leader that we don't like
so that's the Trinidad kind of a
deviation that's in the background of
the Trinidad conference and until the
Obama has being praised because he made
this very generous forthcoming gesture
but saying okay I'll rescind the worst
of Bush's directives find out to your
time you have to do something and what
we says well we're willing to talk about
your internal problems so we're willing
to talk about your human rights
violations and your failure to run a
democratic election yeah we'll be
willing to talk about that but we're not
going to talk about the embargo that's
our prerogative as world will decide
what to do about that and that's
basically what came out of the Trinitite
conference the situation has changed I
mean thanks in part to Bush's neglect of
Latin America very benign contrary to
what said and other factors Latin
America has been moving towards degree
of Independence integration
diversification of its relations with
the world and even to some extent to
dealing with its massive internal
I mean Latin America has been remarkable
for centuries in the fact that the
wealthy classes were very narrow control
virtually everything you look at the
distribution of land and sea Bolivia
it's absurd that they have never had any
responsibility toward their own
societies so if they don't like what's
going on they export capital which
happens massively affect export of
capitals kind of more or less on the
scale of the crushing debt on the they
see absolutely no responsibility of the
rest of the population and I think a
rule is threatened they react with
considerable violence in fact Bolivia is
now okay striking case in point that
came up at the Trinidad summit Morales
accused the United States of some kind
of participation in an apparent
assassination plot we don't know the
details can't draw judgment but it's not
implausible the eastern provinces of
Bolivia where the more mostly white
wealthy elites are concentrated the ones
have always ruled the country they're
outraged by the fact that Bolivia move
towards democracy we're supposed to like
democracy here but we're opposed to it
too so the US is supporting naturally
the rich elites used to run the country
and is opposing Bolivian democracy which
is a pretty spectacular achievement it's
probably the most democratic country in
the world to good test of your attitudes
towards democracy now here's a country
where the indigenous majority that's the
most repressed people in the hemisphere
I mean don't do anything here because we
pretty much exterminated them but
they're still around in Bolivia that's
the pot Muslim population they actually
entered the political arena elected
somebody from their own ranks not some
rich guy and
the are dealing with very serious issues
cultural rights and controller resources
and so on and the rich mostly white
former ruling elite obviously doesn't
like it and they're trying to move
toward some kind of autonomy and the
u.s. is backing and whether that's
involved in the assassination plot can't
know but we do know how the other Latin
American countries free activists that
is we know if we're not confined to one
hundred percent of the u.s. mediate so
for example last there was violence in
eastern Bolivia a lot of peasants would
kill a lot of the opposition what would
happen is kind of interest very
interesting there is now a kind of a
moves towards unification in Latin
America one of the examples is unas or
the Union of South American Republic's
and after the violence against
government supporters in eastern Bolivia
they had a meeting in chile santiago
chile and they came out with declaration
read by President Bush let one of our
favorite who supported Morales and
condemned the quasi secessionist efforts
and we're always responded by thanking
them for their support and pointing out
that this is the first time in five
hundred years that Latin America's you
got to take its affairs into its own
hands without interference of the
foreign powers of control does last
couple centuries the United States was
pretty important of that in fact one
mark of its importance is that I don't
think I got a single mansion in the
United States I mean it was mentioned
that there's been a meeting but not
where it came out with which is a good
indication that something important
happened and it did and that's the kind
of situation that the u.s. now faces of
Latin America us is not without means of
influence and control but they're
diminished as Latin America begins to
move in it
to follow what we're all I said tickets
affairs of its own hands so that's kind
of in the background to the turn to dead
zone
