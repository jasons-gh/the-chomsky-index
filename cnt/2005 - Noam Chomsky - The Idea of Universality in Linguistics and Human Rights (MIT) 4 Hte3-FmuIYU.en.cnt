Mike rights such as the ones that are
enumerated in article 55 25 which I'll
quote everyone has the right to a
standard of living adequate for the
health and well-being of himself and his
family including food clothing housing
and medical care and necessary social
services and the right to security in
the event of unemployment sickness
disability widowhood old age or other
lack of livelihood and circumstances
beyond his control these provisions have
been reaffirmed in the enabling
conventions of the General Assembly
which are intended to implement the
stated rights and also in international
agreements on the right of development
usually in virtually the same words well
seems reasonably clear that this
formulation of universal human rights
rejects the impeccable logic of the
chief economist of the World Bank if not
as insane at least as profoundly immoral
which was in fact the virtually
Universal judgment at least insofar as
it was publicly expressed people thought
I don't know hear the word virtually
must not be overlooked it was a
virtually Universal judgment as is well
known many nations are condemned as
we're called relativists who interpret
the Universal Declaration selectively
and reject components that they don't
like there's been a great deal of
indignant rhetoric about we're called
Asian relativists or of course the
unspeakable communists who descend to
this degraded practice for some reason
less noticed is that the leader of the
relativist can't happens to be the
leader of the self designated
enlightened States the world's most
powerful state we see examples of this
almost daily although c is perhaps the
wrong word because we see them but
managed not to notice them so to
illustrate let's just go back two weeks
ago to march first on march first there
were lead stories in the press on the
release of the State Department's annual
report on human rights around the world
the spokesperson at the news conference
unveiling the report was Paula debris on
ski who's the Under Secretary of State
for global affairs and she emphasized
and quoting her that promoting human
rights is not just an element of our
foreign policy it is the bedrock of our
policy and our foremost concern that's
as much as it was reported but this
little more to the story as often the
case debris on ski was assistant
secretary of state for human rights and
human affairs in the Reagan and Bush
number one administration's and in that
capacity she sought to dispel a certain
of what she called certain myths about
human rights the most said it is the
myth that so-called economic and social
rights constitute human rights and she
denounced the efforts to obfuscate human
rights discourse by introducing these
spurious rights which are entrenched in
the Universal Declaration which in turn
was formulated at us initiative but is
explicitly rejected by the US government
let me stress US government the
population has sharply different
opinions and attitudes as we would
expect when we look at universals of
human rights and moral universals
generally and again there's a very clear
current illustration which is being
reported part of it was the federal
budget was announced a couple of weeks
ago next year's federal budget and along
with it there was released something
that wasn't reported namely a study of
public reactions to the budget by the
world's most prestigious institution for
the study of public opinion
the program on policy attitudes at the
University of Maryland the public turns
out calls for drastic cuts in military
spending sharply increased social
spending for education medical research
job training conservation and renewable
energy increased spending for the United
Nations and economic and humanitarian
aid and reversal of Bush's tax cuts for
the wealthy government policy is
dramatically the opposite in every
respect and there's very little
discussion about that within the
political system or the intellectual
culture the media etc there's a lot of
concern these days international concern
here too about the consequences of what
are called the twin deficits that are
expanding the trade and budget deficits
closely related to them is a third
deficit the growing Democratic deficit
it's the term we use for others who have
formal democratic institutions but they
don't function and that's very little
discussed because the democratic deficit
is very much welcomed by wealth and
power and we have every reason to want
the public removed from policy choices
and implementation which would be a
matter of considerable concern quite
apart from its relation to universal
human rights well in extenuation of
debris on ski I should say that it's
unfair to focus on her because her
position is standard UN ambassador
Jeanne Kirkpatrick described the
socio-economic provisions of the
Universal Declaration as a letter to
Santa Claus neither nature experience
and our probability informs these lists
of entitlements that's in quote scare
quotes entitlements which are subject to
no constraints except those of the mind
and appetite of their authors and the
same view is expressed in 1990 by the US
representative to the UN Commission
human rights ambassador Mars Abram he
was explaining Washington's unilateral
veto of the UN resolution on the right
of development which virtually repeated
the socio-economic provisions of the
Universal Declaration but these are not
rights Abram informed the Commission
they yield conclusions that seem
preposterous they are a little more than
an empty vessel into which vague hopes
and inchoate expectations can be poured
and there are even a dangerous
incitement the fundamental error of the
alleged right to development is that it
presupposes article 25 of the Universal
Declaration and assumes that it actually
means what it says and is not a mirror
letter to Santa Claus and that's
preposterous clearly so it would seem to
follow then that we should affirm the
impeccable logic of the summers memo on
pollution though no one says so in
public perhaps because they would be
regarded as insane well this teaches us
something about several topics that one
of them is about universal moral
judgments and the other is about the
moral and intellectual culture in which
we live which forcefully rejects
universal moral judgments there are
innumerable other cases presume you
noticed a couple of days ago the
appointment of John Bolton is ambassador
to the UN that Condoleezza Rice praised
Jeanne Kirkpatrick as a model for what
an ambassador should be reiterating what
I just said implicitly Bolton himself
has been clear and forthright and
expressing his attitudes toward the UN
he said there is no unit United Nations
when the United States leads the United
Nations will follow when it suits our
interests to do so we will do so when it
does not suit our interests we will not
do so that position happens to be maybe
a little bit extreme but it's right
about at the main bipartisan and
educated consensus but it happens to be
opposed by an overwhelming majority of
the public in fact public support for
the UN is so strong that a majority of
the public even think that the US should
give up the Security Council veto and
accept majority decisions though it is
an unspeakable notion in the
intellectual culture and the numbers are
kind of interesting in all these cases
because the people who express these
views have never heard them each one
must think I'm crazy but that's what I
think if they were ever discussed
there'd be a you can guess that the
numbers which are high would be even
higher but again the Democratic deficit
prevails so we have to worry about
universal moral judgments the principle
of universality arises and other
important connections to one instructive
example has occupied the World Court for
several years after the 1999 NATO
bombing of Serbia a group of
international lawyers presented the
international tribunal on Yugoslavia
with charges against NATO they were
relying on documentation which was
produced by the major human rights
organizations and in fact admissions by
the NATO command the prosecutors refused
to consider the matter in violation of
tribunal rules simply stating that they
relied on NATO's good faith they
undoubtedly knew what would happen to
them if they didn't Yugoslavia however
preceded it took the matter to the World
Court and the US alone withdrew from the
proceedings at the World Court the
reason was that Yugoslavia had invoked
the Genocide Convention which the US had
in fact signed after 40 years but with a
reservation that it does not apply to
the United States which therefore
retains the unilateral right to carry
out genocide and the court correctly
with the u.s. argument and the US was
excused alone that's happened
