a corporation is a totalitarian system
and by now they're very big ones you
know they're huge command economies
which are internally modeled I mean
they're just the you know they have
pretty much the structure with the
tellurian state they unify the judicial
legislative and executive functions and
a top unaccountable control system the
only accountability is to investors
which means other you know banks you
know big investment firms and so on and
public accountability is limited to the
regulatory system which of course
they're trying to destroy so it's
essentially a takeover of power by Big
totalitarian institutions which
incidentally their roots come their
roots are not very different emperor
forms of totalitarianism Bolshevism and
ISM they all come out of late nineteenth
century
you know vaguely hejian ideas about
organic entities having rights above
individuals and so on and so forth
there's actually pretty good scholarly
work on on this on the origin of 20th
century corporations got their current
power mostly in the early part of the
century you know they're not like sort
of graven in stone the rights of
immortal persons with things like free
speech and you know all that kind of
stuff
that's early twentieth century and it
was not granted by legislation either it
was done mostly by courts and lawyers
and so on and it's a form of
totalitarianism and you don't ask it to
be more soulful anymore now just on to
be more soulful it's these are
institutional structures they behave the
way they do you have to be eliminated in
some of these were truisms in the
working-class movement not very long ago
by now they sound really weird but
that's the sign of the of the victory of
powerful
propaganda systems corporate propaganda
system is simply driven out of people's
heads what used to be everybody's
understanding in fact you go back to the
early century ago in the ASL
you know which is not particularly
radical these are the things people are
talking about the national meetings you
know let's get rid of all these things
and working people working people ought
to own the mills and they and run them
there they build them they work in them
the auto-runner that was one of the big
issues in homesteads bitter strike back
in 1892 you know well you know if it's
been beaten out of people's heads that's
our our problem we order to get it back
in people says it's not very strange
sort of natural and automatic just like
opposition any other form of
totalitarianism and playing games about
me they should be nicer to people that
doesn't mean anything
yeah sure if you can sort of impose by
force if you can use federal to say OSHA
if you can impose health and safety
standards on them fine that's better
than not having those standards but
there should be no illusions
that's like forcing its totality
reinstate because of some countervailing
force to a cognizer
okay maybe you can do it but that's not
