hey the wall street journal is surveying
the opinions of bankers professionals
international lawyers and saying look we
hate you because you're blocking
democracy you're preventing economic
development you're supporting brutal
regimes terrorist regimes and you're
doing these horrible things in the
region a couple days later Anthony Lewis
no way out on the Left explained that
the terrorists seek only apocalyptic
nihilism nothing more and nothing we do
matters the only consequence of our
actions he says it could be harmful is
that it makes it harder to join for
Arabs to join in the coalition's
anti-terrorism effort but beyond that
everything we do is irrelevant well you
know that's got the advantage of being
sort of comforting makes you feel good
about yourself and how wonderful you are
it enables us to evade the consequences
of our actions it has a couple of
defects one is it's totally variance
with everything we know and another
defect is it's a perfect way to ensure
that you askah late the cycle of
violence if you want to live with your
head buried in the sand and pretend they
hate us because they're opposed the
globalization that's why they killed
Sadat 20 years ago and fought the
Russians and you know tried to blow up
the world trade center in 1993 and these
are all people who are in the midst of
what the corporate globalization but if
you want to believe that yeah comforting
and it's a great way to make sure that
violence escalates that's tribal
violence you know you did something to
me all this only worse to you I don't
care what the reasons are and we just
keep going that way you know that's a
way to do it pretty much straight left
liberal opinion what are the policy
options well there are a number a narrow
policy option from the beginning was to
follow the advice of really far out
radicals like the Pope and
and Vatican immediately said look it's a
horrible terrorist crime in the case of
a crime you try to find the perpetrators
you bring them to justice you try them
you don't kill innocent civilians like
if somebody Rob's my house and I think
the guy who did it is probably in a
neighborhood across the street I don't
go out with an assault rifle and kill
everybody in that neighborhood you know
that's not the way you deal with a crime
whether it's a small crime like this one
or a really massive one like the u.s.
terrorist war against Nicaragua and even
worse ones and others in between and
there are plenty of precedents for that
in fact I mentioned the president
Nicaragua a lawful state law abiding
state so accidentally why we had to
destroy it which followed the right
principles now of course it didn't get
anywhere because it was running up
against a power that wouldn't allow
lawful procedures to be followed but if
the United States tried to pursue them
nobody would stop it in fact everyone
would applaud and there are plenty of
other presidents when the IRA set off
bombs in London which was pretty serious
business Britain could a limp apart from
the fact that was unfeasible let's put
that aside one possible response would
have been to destroy Boston which is the
source of most of the financing well and
of course the wipeout west Belfast well
you know quite apart from feasibility
there have been criminal idiocy the way
to deal with it was pretty much what
they did you know find the perpetrators
bring them to trial and look for the
reasons because these things don't come
out of nowhere you know they come out of
something and whether it's a crime in
the streets or a monstrous terrorist
crime or anything else there's reasons
and usually if you look at the reasons
there some of them are legitimate and
ought to be addressed independently the
crime they ought to be addressed because
they're legitimate that's the way you
deal with it we it's many such examples
but there are problems with that one
problem is that the United States does
not recognize the jurisdiction of
institutions so it can't go to them it
has rejected the jurisdiction of the
World Court it's refused to ratify the
International Criminal Court it's
powerful enough to set up a new court if
at once so that wouldn't stop anything
but there's a problem with any kind of a
court namely you need evidence you go to
any kind of court you're going to need
some kind of evidence not Tony Blair
talking on television the and that's
very hard it may be impossible to find
you know it could be that the people who
did it kill themselves these are descent
and the seat nobody knows this better
than the CIA these are decentralized
non-hierarchical they follow a principle
that's called leaderless resistance
that's the principle that's been
developed by the Christian Right terror
terrorists in the United States called
leaderless resistance you have small
groups that do things they don't talk to
anybody else there's a kind of a general
background of assumptions and then you
do it actually people in the anti-war
movement are very familiar this we just
call it a call it affinity groups if
you're doing so if you assume correctly
that whatever your group you're in is
being penetrated by the FBI when
something serious is happening you don't
do it in a meeting you do it with some
people you know and trust an affinity
group and then it doesn't get penetrated
that's one of the reasons why the FBI is
never been able to figure out what's
going on in any of the popular movements
and other intelligence agencies are the
same they can't you know that's
leaderless resistance or affinity groups
and decentralized networks are extremely
hard to penetrate and it's quite
possible that they just don't know when
Osama bin Laden claims he wasn't
involved that's entirely possible fact
it's pretty hard to imagine how a guy in
a cave in Afghanistan who doesn't even
have a radio or a telephone could have
planned a highly sophisticated operation
like that chances are it's part of the
background you know like other
leaderless resistance terrorist groups
which means it's going to be extremely
hard to find evidence and the US doesn't
want to present evidence because it
wants to be able to do it
act without evidence that's a crucial
part of the reaction you'll notice that
the US did not ask for Security Council
authorization which they probably could
have gotten this time not for pretty
reasons but because the other permanent
members of the Security Council are also
terrorist states they are happy to join
a coalition against what they call
terror namely in support of their own
terror like Russia wasn't going to veto
it they love it so the u.s. probably
could have gotten Security Council
authorization but it didn't want and it
didn't want it because it follows a
long-standing principle which is not
George Bush it was explicit in the
Clinton administration articulated and
goes back much further and that is that
we have the right to act unilaterally we
don't want international authorization
because we act unilaterally and
therefore we don't want it we don't care
about evidence we don't care about
negotiation we don't care about treaties
we're the strongest guy around you know
toughest got on the block we do what we
want authorization is a bad thing and
therefore must be avoided there's even a
name for it and the technical literature
it's called establishing credibility you
have to establish credibility that's an
important factor in many policies that
was the leading it was the most clause
it was the official reason given for the
war in the Balkans and the most
plausible reason you want to know what
credibility means ask your favorite
Mafia Don explain to you what
credibility means and it's the same in
international affairs except you know
talked about in universities you do it
with big words and that sort of thing
but it's basically the same principle
and it makes sense and it usually works
main historian it was written about this
in the last cup for the last several
hundred years as Charles Tilly's book
called coercion and violence and he
points out that violence has been the
leading principle of Europe for hundreds
of years and the reason is because it
works you know it's very reasonable it
almost always works when you have an
oval
predominance of violence and a culture
of violence behind it so therefore it
makes sense to follow it well those are
all problems in pursuing lawful paths
and if you did try to follow them you'd
really open some very dangerous doors
like the u.s. is demanding that the
Taliban hand over Osama bin Laden and
they're responding in a way which is
regarded as totally absurd and
outlandish in the West namely they're
saying ok but first give us some
evidence that is in in the West that's
considered ludicrous it's a sign of
their criminality you know how can they
ask for evidence I mean if somebody
asked us to hand someone over we do it
tomorrow we wouldn't ask for any
evidence in fact it's easy to prove that
we don't have to make up cases so for
example for the last several years Haiti
has been requesting the United States to
extradite amano L constant there's a
major killer he was one of the leading
figures in the slaughter of maybe four
or five thousand people in the years in
the mid 90s under the military junta
which incidentally was being not so
tacit Lee supported by the bush and the
Clinton administration's contrary to
illusions anyways a leading killer
either they have plenty of evidence no
problem that evidence these already been
