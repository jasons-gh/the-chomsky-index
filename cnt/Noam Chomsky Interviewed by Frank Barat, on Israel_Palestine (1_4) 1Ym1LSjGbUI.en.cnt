you need in Israel and it was the 50 53
53 and how were you at the time at all
well I guess 25 yeah okay and but I had
been a active what was then called a
Zionist youth leader now it would be
called Eddie Zionist youth leader back
in the forties okay and I think that's
very interesting because people for
people Zionism means a Jewish state in
Palestine and so when you say you were
at the time as I knees leader which now
we've mean an anti Zionist leader I'd
like YouTube so well this America's back
in the 1940s before the state was
established one part of the Zionist
movement and not a small part of it was
opposed to a Jewish state I mean the
little that's remembered about that is
the famous man like Martin Buber and
Judah Magnusson's an errant you know
women and but that was a peripheral
elite a substantial part of the workers
movement in Israel then palestine was
anti-state actually that was the
official position of Pasha merits a year
which is like but almost half the
kibbutz movement and it was probably
twenty percent or so of the Histadrut
the labor movement and at least
according to the anglo-american
commission which did studies at the time
they estimated if I remember correctly
about a quarter of the population of the
issue of was supposed to Jewish state so
being opposed to a Jewish state was part
of the Zionist movement and there was
nothing surprising about being a Zionist
youth leader who was strongly opposed to
whichever state and was in favor of the
Arab Jewish working class cooperation to
construct a socialist Palestine so
that's not the frame of mind because you
went to you went to Israel Palestine in
the fifties once the state of astrology
establish so either the frame of my
you went to me once the frame once the
State of Israel was established which
was actually a day of mourning among me
and my friends I remembered very well
the only rational position to hold was
that it should have the rights of any
state in the international system no
more no less I'm they're all founded on
violence and destruction I take the
United States it's found it on
extermination of the indigenous
population many millions of people
conquest of half of Mexico in order to
try to monopolize cotton and all sorts
of things okay let's try to find a state
that isn't found Emma states are violent
systems almost all state borders are the
result of violence and repression but
there's an international system that we
could say okay I'm not going to
recognize any I imposed everybody I'm
just not going to act in the world well
okay you can live on a mountaintop in
Montana and where you're on food if you
like but if you want to function in the
world even as it has a dissident or as a
protest or zone you have to recognize
its reality part of the reality is
there's an international system which I
don't like but it's there and the israel
since 48 is part of it okay and so my my
question about you recently declared
during into with them Israeli TV that
and I quote now in fact I do not regard
myself as a critic of Israel I regard
myself for the supporter of Israel and
for people again that don't deep further
deep further this could mean I am a
supporter of a Jewish state the
colonnade of colonizing state and so
could you also stopped your language in
that would mean that the people who pick
up tidbits on the internet and don't
bother even the listen let alone to read
because we just listened to the
interview which is assembly was a
interview for an Israeli audience what
it says it was the context was dichotomy
that
this standard an Israeli culture either
you support Israel or you want Israel's
destruction and what I said is the
people who call themselves supporters of
Israel are in fact supporters of
Israel's moral degeneration and
ultimately destruction if you're a real
supporter of Israel meeting you what its
people to be able to live a decent life
then you would be in favor of Israel
meeting its international obligations
eliminating its internal repression
keeping the international law and so on
that would really be support for Israel
and in that sense llaman supporter of
Israel okay so i thought you support
office file but you'd like you smile I'm
a supporter of Israel the same sense I'm
supporter of the United States or of
England or France or anyone else I think
circumstances should be or i'm in favor
of circumstances which will allow their
populations to live decent honorable
lives and that would mean meeting a
variety of conditions difference for
different states such as observing
international law eliminating domestic
repression and so on okay so obviously
when you talk about the seat events of
this value also include the e3d
palestinians being able to leave that's
sick know a lot a crucial part of it i
mean if they meet their international
obligations i'll return to their borders
and if they deal with internal
repression there's plenty of problems
there so it's a saying about the united
states the people in the united states
too if your supporter of the people of
the united states and I don't know what
other since there is to support the
United States you want it to withdraw us
put an end to aggression I put an end to
subversion virtually eliminate the
military budget deal with the vicious
internal repression I don't have to go
into the details of I'll say the
african-american population is treated
same with it so called illegal
immigrants and so on plant
problems of extreme inequality and
poverty and there'd be a decent life for
Americans and if you said it to support
the United States means to be in favor
of those things so for example days I
think lastima right there was about 30
discriminatory laws inside Israel so
clearly Ferris no fair ism towards the
the Jewish Israelis compared to the
Israeli Arabs or the others so you know
those loaves for example would if he
thought something for a normal state to
others lo changed oh sure that
unfortunately not a normal state a
normal state has laws like those and
much worse but yes those were caught to
be changed and I've been writing about
it for 40 years in fact don't know one
else who has been I started writing
about the internal of the worst of these
there's a lot of the throne but the
worst of them of the land was and I was
reading about those in the in the sick
in the 60s and 70s I wrote the
introduction to submerge Eirias book
Arabs in Israel that's the first real
expose of this in a book called towards
a new Cold War came out around nineteen
eighty I I gave it a pretty detailed
analysis of the set of administrative
and legal practices that effectively
banned Palestinian citizens of Israel
from about ninety percent of the land I
think that was the first time that was
done later and recent work I've I've
written about the interesting changes
that are taking place there is at last
pressure inside Israel within the
mainstream civil rights movement I agree
the Civil Rights Association cases the
courts to try to terminate those laws
and some interesting developments is
taking place I could describe them but
sure that's on the same with other
discriminatory laws okay so we bring us
I guess if you say your support of
Israel because the realities Israeli
Israel exists no it's not I'm a
supporter of Israel
in a doubles in a sense in which I'm
sport or every other country in the
world I think sir we should be in favor
of circumstances that permit its
populations to live decent honorable
lives satisfying lives and we should
recognize that in a state system which I
don't like that exists the states should
have the same rights as other states
okay my question was about the now if we
take these to the ones day two states so
that's a different question okay back
and I've always been a superstore with
the term one state solution is very
misleading there's just two different
societies there so one state if you're
serious means a bi-national state I was
in support of a bi-national state in the
1940s as I said bi-national state based
on arab-jewish working class cooperation
I've remained so without change from
roughly sixty seven through 75 I wrote
about this pretty extensively because at
that time it was actually feasible to
introduce steps towards a binational
state in fact some proposals like that
were even made by Israeli intelligence
that was a period when his ruin trolled
the region Palestinian nationalism had
not yet been kind of crystallized as a
well-formulated position or entered the
international agenda his aura could have
moved at that time towards a federal
arrangement which would have granted
substantial degree of autonomy to the
occupied territories as they were asking
and the notables not you know and as it
was feasible move and that could have
been a significant step towards a true
binational settlement and I wrote about
it it was total anathema it was bitterly
denounced can then hate it on all sides
in nineteen and because it was feasible
that's crucial it became popular in the
late 90s when it's totally on
and then you can write about it in the
New York Times and your review books and
they'll like it because it's a it can
quickly be interpreted as undermining a
two-state settlements that is as
supporting us Israeli policy so
therefore it became popular but when it
was feasible it was anathema in 1975 the
situation changed roughly then
Palestinian national nationalism did
become an organized force to the point
where by 1976 the US had to veto
Security Council resolution calling for
a two-state settlement and on through
the rest of the history which I won't
run through but from that point on an
immediate goal for by National
Federation moving on to a bi-national
state was not implementable the only way
of reaching it was in stages where the
first stage would be a two-state
settlement and according to within
overwhelming international consensus
accepted by Palestine National Council
you know Arab League Iran Hamas
everybody of course over Europe online
countries as a first step which could
have the effect of reducing the cycle of
violence creating the institutions of a
degree of self-government among the
Palestinians and lead the way towards
erosion of the border which it was
extremely artificial and bad for both
sides and under those conditions you can
you can easily imagine in fact think of
carrying out actions which would extend
a commercial cultural other interchanges
associations on other than ethnic lines
which would lead to a very natural
erosion of the borders and an impetus in
on both side on many sides because
there's not just two towards moving
towards integrate
into a bi-national state system and
that's by no means the end of the road I
mean I don't see any reason why we
should honor the Imperial boundaries
that were said nothing holy about the
boundaries of the British and the French
drew in the Regency talking about Jordan
is the air jordan syria lebanon I mean
it's all just Imperial settlements like
Iraq so I think we should unless we are
dedicated supporters of imperial power
we should say yeah those are all
illegitimate too and we should be
thinking about how to move towards a
regional arrangement which might in fact
have some of the properties the Ottoman
Empire it's not so exotic nobody wants
the Ottoman Empire back with its
violence and corruption but there were
some things that did right I mean you
could go from Cairo to Baghdad it's not
without crossing any borders there was a
in particular regions like say a city
the Greeks ran their affairs the
Armenians read their affairs they had
interactions and so on I think that's a
pretty good type of arrangement to look
forward to for the Levant and in fact
for much of the rest of the world
actually one of the healthy things in
Europe is it's beginning to move towards
such arrangements so I'm not wedded to
imperial boundaries all of these things
are transitional stages in my view i
don't think states are legitimate all
together but if you really are in favor
of a bi-national state what's called 21
state settlement if you're in favor of
that it advocated advocacy doesn't mean
I put it on a you know banner and shout
about it it means I think about ways of
getting there then I think the only
proposal I've ever heard is work through
the international consensus edit our
national law and then go on from
