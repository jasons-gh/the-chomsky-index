have a few reflections on the alarming
lack of progress since David ended with
one of his eloquent poems
maybe I'll begin with one of my
favorites unfortunately I don't have the
exact word so it won't have the proper
eloquent but it's brief and succinct
enough so it I can make the point in
simple prose the poem is called
something like a lesson in history and
it mentions three dates August 6 1945
era Shima August 8 1945 the announcement
of the Nuremberg tribunals August 9th
1945 Nagasaki nothing else to be said
that does tell us something about the
alarming lack of progress in in this
case in understanding our own actions
and our consequences their consequences
and it should remind us that we're very
lucky very fortunate in that we are in
the most powerful country in world
history
its actions will shape significantly
what happens in the future and also a
country which is one of the most free in
world history which means we have
enormous opportunities to address the
crucial issues that confront the human
species and they are beyond anything it
has arisen in the past while turning to
lack of progress lack of progress may
not be as strong enough phrase David's
word regresses more to the point it's
hard to disagree with William Perry who
pointed out in his recent book that
by 2011 in his words the US and Russia
began a long backward slide as he points
out at that time the New START treaty
which was indeed finally implemented was
so politically contentious that Obama
decided not to offer the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty for ratification big
step backwards
Russia has since been engaged in a
massive the nuclear armaments program
general our apartment's program includes
ICBMs with Merv's very dangerous nuclear
submarines with ballistic missiles and
many other extremely dangerous weapons
u.s. is undertaking modernization as you
know the trillion-dollar 30-year
modernization program along with new
missiles that are understood to be
particularly dangerous because they're
small and can be scaled down for
battlefield use tactical nuclear weapons
which is an incitement to escalation of
a very enormous threat and events on the
ground are particularly threatening
primarily at the Russian border where
it's becoming really ominous accidents
could lead to sudden escalation Syria's
another flashpoint and there are others
India Pakistan is one of the most severe
the Kashmir crisis has been escalating
no signature as proposals for resolving
it open the New York Times this morning
and you'll see Prime Minister Modi's
warnings about a Indian reaction to any
Pakistani based terrorist attack which
is likely and at the border up in the up
in the high Himalayas
there's
the most one of the most ridiculous wars
that has ever happened it's captured
very nicely in a comment by Arundhati
Roy which I should have looked up so I
could quote it exactly but what she
describes is 12,000 feet up in the
mountain the glaciers are melting
threatening the water supply for India
and Pakistan and as the glaciers melt
you see the detritus of the battles that
they're fighting there over nothing
helmets arms skeletons and so on it's
reminiscent of Boris's comment on wars
which are like two bald men fighting
over a comb except this one is a lot
more serious this is an indication of
significant wars that could be just on
the horizon water wars India Pakistan's
of striking case or simply imagine what
the consequences will be when tens of
millions of people are fleeing out of
the coastal plains of Bangladesh where
they going to go what's going to happen
to them take a look this morning at the
dismemberment of the Calais jungle
what's going to happen when it's not
thousands but tens of millions and
that's coming very soon unless we do
something about it
the circumstances that lead to potential
conflict are growing and are frightening
and in many ways I think that's the most
alarming lack of progress the lack of
attention to trying to do something
about these things which is shocking
there are disappointments like the
recent
icj rejection of the Marshall Islands
claim but as David pointed out it's not
all grim the it was a virtually split
decision and on narrow technical grounds
not getting to the substance and there
are many avenues to pursue at the UN as
well as we just heard that's a very
important initiative and it's kind of
shocking that it I don't think it's even
made the press as far as I know one of
the most important initiatives underway
it should be known by everyone should
have massive public support which could
possibly lead to a modification of the
US position of these mitigation of the
US position of extreme hostility to what
could be a historic decision of the UN
there's crucial lack of progress and
maybe always regress in other
significant areas steps towards
abolition Kent as we all know can't be
just clicking your fingers there have to
be many avenues pursued and one of the
most significant of them I think
which doesn't receive the attention it
deserves is the development of weapons
nuclear weapons what WMD free zones in
various parts of the world which
restricts the possibility of conflict
they're not airtight of course but their
steps forward there is one in the
Western Hemisphere which of course
excludes the United States and Canada
there's one in the Pacific which for a
long time was impeded by France which
insisted on carrying out nuclear weapons
tests and the French possessions but
more recently it's blocked by the United
States which insists on nuclear weapons
preposition positioning and nuclear
submarines passing through the US
Pacific Islands so the Pacific WMD free
zone can't really be implemented there's
one for Africa but it's also for the
moment impeded by the United States
because the u.s. insists on a major
military base in Diego Garcia nuclear
base that one which is in fact used it's
been used extensively in the bombings in
Central Asia and it's been built up very
sharply under the Obama administration
again with very little attention so that
blocks the Africa zone but the most
important of all by far is the Middle
East that's where there certainly should
be significant efforts to impose nuclear
weapons free zone and it's there's no
reason among the major states the most
importance with one exception the
obvious exception the states in the
region are strongly in favor of it Iran
as in the lead in fact in pressing to
try to establish a WMD free zone in the
region that's in its position as head of
the non-aligned movement which has taken
a very strong stand on that the Arab
states are all in favor of it in fact
they initiated back in 1995 it was Egypt
and other Arab states that initiated the
call for a WMD free zone it comes up
every five years in the NPT review
sessions every time the u.s. blocks it
most recently in 2015 under Obama just
simply block the steps towards moving
towards establishing this now that's
extremely significant for one thing it
threatens the non-proliferation treaty
the commitment of the Arab states to the
NPT is conditioned on explicitly on a
stop moves to establish a WMD free zone
in the
and it's kind of striking that the US
and of course the reason is the u.s.
blocks it is totally obvious it's to
protect Israel's nuclear weapons system
from inspection and that's such a high
priority here that the government is
willing to threaten the NPT the most
important arms control treaty that
exists that's very serious
nothing talked about it and which is
again the what David called the terrible
silence that is the worst form of lack
of progress incidentally for anyone who
took seriously the hysteria about
Iranian nuclear weapons the easiest
simplest way to eliminate whatever
threat one believes might exist it would
be simply to accept the Iranian proposal
to move towards a verifiable nuclear
weapons-free zone not discussed for
reasons we know incidentally the Iranian
the Iranian deal was I think a step
forward but we should bear in mind that
the concept of an Iranian threat was
hardly credible and the idea that we
should put if you read US intelligence
reports they say the reports to Congress
they do point out that there's a
potential danger of Iranian nuclear
weapons if they ever development namely
they could be a deterrent they could be
a deterrent and the US and Israel cannot
tolerate a deterrent if you want to use
force freely you can't have deterrence
that's the Iranian nuclear threat such
as it is these are all things that we
should everyone should know another step
backwards is continuing Israel's a case
in point but continuing support for the
three nuclear weapon states that have
refused to join the NPT Israel Pakistan
and India
all of which developed their nuclear
weapons with considerable US support the
case of India since bush not before case
of Pakistan primarily under Reagan the
administration pretended that they
didn't know that Pakistan was developing
nuclear weapons though everyone outside
of the Beltway could see it quite
clearly the bush
number two changed the policy towards
India and it continues just last June
Obama authorized six new nuclear
reactors in India these are called
peaceful but we all know that the
transition from nuclear power to nuclear
weapons under contemporary technology is
not very great and furthermore
subsidizing Indian nuclear power simply
provides that allows them to divert
resources to their nuclear weapons
program which is extremely dangerous
because primarily because of the
india-pakistan conflict but also because
of what is likely to happen when tens of
millions of people from Bangladesh start
to flee because they're drowning what
happens then these are serious issues
there's all of this ends by they're all
combines on the matter of lack of
awareness lack of public awareness it's
striking that there is nothing today
like the huge anti-nuclear movement of
the early eighties enormous movement
some of the biggest mobilizations in
history and they had an effect that a
significant effect on modifying US
policy leading ultimately to the Reagan
Gorbachev agreements which were a
significant step forward and were
followed by many years of sharp pretty
sharp reduction and nuclear weapons
other positives
some steps backward but general progress
up until the turning point in 2011 when
we started going backwards again there's
no such popular mobilization today the
elections going on nothing being said
about it and worse no popular
mobilization to try to force something
to be said about it there there are some
encouraging signs so um you all read I'm
sure the leaked discussion of between
Hillary Clinton and several of the
prominent donors and others in which
she's a politician she's telling the
audience what they want to hear but it
doesn't matter what she said was not
insignificant she did question said we
have to raise questions about the
modernization program not just authorize
it and she specifically opposed the
worst part of it the development of
these smaller nuclear weapons which can
be scaled down to battlefield use well
there's two possible reactions to that
disclosure one of them is silence the
other would be popular mobilization to
keep her feet to the fire make press to
get the government assuming she wins the
election to move forward on the programs
that she claims at least she's committed
to that can have an effect it has had in
the past often count again well as you
know the reaction was silence it
appeared no comment disappeared just
like the UN proposal will be voted on
probably no comment maybe not even a
report and it'll disappear unless there
is popular mobilization that's the major
element of alarming lack of progress in
many ways regression and an indication
of the base
work that we all have to be dedicating
ourselves to
