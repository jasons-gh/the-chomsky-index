hybrid philosopher Hilary Putnam in the
mid 70s he wrote a paper called the
meaning of meaning which is very
influential and I guess the key slogan
that came out of that is that meanings
just ain't in the head
agree to disagree or just is that just
incoherent its incoherent without
further explanation first you have to
tell us what meanings are and you can't
decide whether they're in the head or
not until we know what they are
if by meanings we have in mind what
people have in mind when they're using
the word in English then sure they're
not in the head they're all over the
place talk about the meaning of life
it's not in the head if you have some
more technical notion in mind you've got
to explain what it is if the technical
and and there it's a matter of choice
you can define the technical notion so
that's in the head or so that it's not
in a hit when you define technical
notions you have a choice the way it's
done in the sciences and the way to
ought to be done is you define a
technical motion in the context of an
explanatory theory you know just define
it as technical notion out in space so
let's ask what's the explanatory theory
in which we're going to give a technical
notion which will pronounce meaning or
pronounce it some other way
and then we'll ask whether and that
theory is a sensible theory and does it
place this technical concept in the head
or not but all that extra work hasn't
been done why can't we say there's just
a pre theoretical notion of meaning and
what we want to do is try and elucidate
or pursue safai it in some way or other
you know you could do that million ways
of doing it so what about the meaning of
life for example that's part of the pre
theoretical notion it is it is it sure I
mean I thought people talked about the
meaning of love what's the meaning of
life yeah and you think that's the same
notion of meaning as when they say
what's the meaning of the word know this
you know it's a huge range of things
what did he mean by saying so and so
usually has to do with what was the
intention you know or something
than right so part of the pre
theoretical meaning has to do with
people's intentions in fact that when
you talk about the meaning of a word
that's a rather English specific
location and we could focus on that if
we like but and if you want you can try
to clarify it but again to try to
clarify a pre theoretical notion make
sense within the framework of an effort
to understand something - it's an
explanatory account well suppose we go
with the following attempt to clarify or
at least introduction of a piece of
technical terminology which is the
philosophers will talk about the content
of a mental state or the content of some
sort of expression hmm is that helpful
no because content is a technical notion
it's not being used in the sense of the
ordinary concept content right and it
used by now unless since Putnam in fact
and creepy and others it's typically
used to refer to something out there so
the content of expression is not needed
by definition because we've defined it
to be not in the head right or then the
question is well does that have anything
to do with our notions of decided
meaning do with our understanding of the
way language works and is used okay
that's the question and you can
certainly do I think it is very little
to do it well suppose we thought of it
this way we suppose we thought of the
enterprise being sketched in the
following way there are two ways in
which you might study primates for
example you might study primate Anatomy
in which case you're just concerned
about you know bones and muscles and
tendons and so forth and then you might
also study primate ecology in which case
you're studying the relation between the
primate and its environment and I take
it that what these philosophers are
talking about here when they talk about
external content is that they're saying
a part of talk about meaning has to be
analyzed in terms of thinking about the
organism the human organism in relation
to its environment right so it has to if
you want to study the relation between
the human organism in its environment
but if that's fine there's nothing wrong
with studying the human organism in its
and
that's what sociologists are doing all
the time but if do it seriously if you
want to do it seriously you ask first of
all you let's go back to primates when
you study primates in their ecology you
don't just look at the anatomy of
primates you look at the physiology of
primates the you know what you might
call mental processes of primates I mean
the way they seem to be interpreting the
world the perceptual perceptual
abilities of primates in fact what you
try to do is exploit to the extent you
can and what we know about it individual
8 you know chimpanzees you want to know
where we understand about that 8 and
that information we were willing to bear
in the study of how the ape interacts
with other apes and with the rest of the
environment and so on that's the way
it's done with primates or with ants or
anyone else and I think that's we have
you done with humans so we should ask ok
well what do we understand about these
the internal nature of the creature
that's doing all these things and to the
extent that we understand something
about that we can ask sensible questions
about how it interacts with the external
world with other people and so on and so
forth do you think that could
potentially inform the sort of
internalist investigation is sure
because the other time there's no order
you can study the sociology of
communities and maltase nothing could
taste something important about the
internal thinking processes of apes or
even their internal anatomy and
vice-versa because in the master science
goes always here's another technical
term that's been used reference you
consider that to be incoherent as well
or until it's explained I shouldn't go
here once it's explained and it becomes
not it well you see one thing I've never
quite understood is is exactly what the
problem is with reference because I mean
I can say okay now I'm referring to this
cough that's different okay
I could different okay you're talking
about an action of referring right that
we that's a common sense notions right
in English every language I know of
there's some way to talk about such
actions but what the philosophers have
introduced is in different
an ocean that's supposed to hold between
a linguistic entity and something in the
world now that's not referring referring
as an act that people do well yes the
first point is there are fears yeah but
um it goes way back but well and it's
just a fact okay so let's take money if
you want to make up a technical term
which you pronounced the same way yeah
first of all it's questionable but he
should pronounce it the same way because
it's misleading but if you do let's at
least keep clear that it's a technical
term kind of like get a physicists use
energy you know they don't mean it the
way we do an ordinary language they mean
it the way they say they mean it so
let's take the technical term refer or
denote or whatever you want to call it
and tell us what it's supposed to what
what you tell us what you mean by it and
tell us what explanatory theory it
enters into so when a physicist defines
energy you know just in the definition
you're interested in the set of
principles and assumptions and sewing
problems and so on within which that
technical concept is introduced and then
you look and see how good the theory is
well here we don't have any theory and
we don't even have an explanation about
the technical notion is so it's
impossible to talk about it yeah I think
it might be a mistake to think of it as
a technical notion I mean I think it's
just a sort of persisted way of
describing certain basic core level
facts right so for example I might say
well it once you understand that people
refer to things and so forth it's it's
not a hard step to say well okay I can't
certain names are canonical II used to
refer to certain things in certain
individuals so the name Noam Chomsky I
mean I can ask the people I can ask the
audience here what person in this room
does that term refer to well you could
ask what what do you what do you use
that term when you refer to something in
the world that you can ask well when you
ask what the term refers to you're
assuming that there is a relation
between terms and things and then you
have to explain what that relation is
because that's a new one
we don't have that in ordinary language
and in fact I think it's leading us off
into a wrong picture as vision Stein
would have called it it's leading us to
a picture of language which is
we know what it's based on I mean it's
based on things like frege's you know
the theory of arithmetic and it's just
the wrong picture for language
