ah that's very commonly expressed now my
friends express it but it's just but
it's just not rational because they're
missing a third option there's a third
option that is that the United States
and Israel will continue doing exactly
what they're doing right now there's
nothing to prevent that that's a third
option and we know what they're doing
it's not a secret you can see it in the
developments on the ground and you can
see it in policy it's essentially what
Prime Minister is on there called the
convergence or maybe convergence plus
Israel takes over everything outside the
separation wall which is actually an
annexation wall that means it takes over
the water resources it's the aquifer for
the region it takes over the valuable
land the pleasant suburbs of jerusalem
to tel aviv and so on so it just takes
that over it takes over the Jordan
Valley which is about a third of the
territory arable land and so on and then
it has corridors running through created
in order to break up what remains into
unviable banter stanzas argyllshire umm
kulthum the architect of the policy so
break up the rest into separated banta
stands one of the corridors expands from
what's now called Jerusalem it's a much
larger area crore larger than Jerusalem
called Jerusalem by the United States
and Israel big part of the West Bank
says one car door extends to the east
through the town of molybdenum which was
created in order to break up palestine
into two parts it's created underneath
ha carbon in the 1970s it was mostly
developed in the 1990s under bull the
Oslo framework like Clinton and others
and that corridor if it's fully
developed breaks essentially by six the
West Bank it reaches us about as far as
Jericho
so that separates 7 through northern
part if this interesting that the United
States has not permitted Israel to fully
develop it there's a crucial debate
going on about what's called am one
that's the part of the corridor that
goes from Allah demanded to greater
Jerusalem a couple of miles but if
that's closed off it does bisected and
the US has simply not permitted Israel
to develop their it's very crucial for
them but remember that Israel has to do
what the United States says has no
choices once it made the choice of
abandoning security in favor of
expansion it's completely vulnerable if
they with motorsport it would be in
serious trouble dozen also do it but if
they're rational they have to do it so
they have not yet developed he won
because of us orders so it's crucial for
them probably they will sooner or later
there's another corridor to the north
goes through the town of REO and there's
another one still the North going
through good to me but they essentially
break up the region well that's the
policy that's now being executed there
isn't going to be any Israel's not going
to take the keys it's not acceptable
territories doesn't want them it's very
different from South Africa in this
respect South African analogy is not to
the point South Africa raided the black
labor they were the workforce so they
had to take care of the benefit stands
there the Capon functioning just bazooey
slave owners had to keep their slaves
reasonably healthy their capital so they
the South Africa wanted the bantha
stands to be internationally recognized
Israel did recognize that the nobody
else did and they did sustain some
development so on Israel has a no
commitment to the Palestinian Aries
doesn't want them they wants them to go
away you know in fact that's actually
official policies you look back just
leave we don't want here
so they won't take the keys the US and
Israel will take no responsibility for
the Palestinians the areas that they'll
integrate into Israel and very few now
stands and they're more or less getting
rid of those so there won't be any as
it's called demographic problem a
problem of preventing Arabs in a Jewish
state that won't be a big problem there
is worse proposals on the table and can
go into if there's time and that's the
second option so the realistic options
today are in fact to either complement
the international consensus or israel in
the united states continue with what
they're doing and the third option to
the option that's discussed you know
that civil rights struggle with an
apartheid tight that's not smell on the
horizon no indication that anything like
that's going to happen and that's simply
illusion there's another aspect of us
Israeli programs it's been going on
since as low and that is to separate
Gaza from the West Bank that seriously
weakens any it's illegal of course but
that's irrelevant it's it's separate it
does severely weaken any potential
Palestinian entity means won't have
access to the scenes it loses a million
a half Palestinians and so on well I
won't go into the horrible story of
what's going on in Gaza you will know
about that but that's part of this
general program now the last comment
about this would Israel accept the
Palestinian state well if you look over
the history up until 1996 hello Israeli
leader ever mentioned the possibility of
a Palestinian state and before that the
official policy of Israel and the United
States was the official wording was
there cannot be an additional
Palestinian state between Jordan
Israel Lord additional meant Jordan
already is a Palestinian state and there
cannot be an additional one between
Jordan and Israel that was the policy of
human Paris chakra beam James Baker
Clinton everyone up until nineteen
ninety-six that was perishing repairs
his last term in office and as he left
office he had a press conference
international press conference in which
he said there can never be a Palestinian
state another one well at that point
Netanyahu came in he came into office
now his government was actually the
first one to permit the term Palestinian
state right away his master of
information and a press conference was
asked can there be a Palestine stayed
ever and the answer was well we're going
to leave fragments of the West Bank to
the Palestinians and if they want to
call it a state that's fine or they can
call it fried chicken that was the
answer it's kind of like goodbye you're
you know in called fried chicken if you
want and call yourselves countries if
you like but this is the reality that's
the first recognition of a Palestinian
state and it's been reading just a few
weeks ago in fact the Deputy Foreign
Minister of Israel Silvan Shalom was
asked it now what what what happens if
the Palestinians declare of state as
they're claiming yes excellent play
others claim he's going to do I said
Shalom said once all right they can call
of a state if they like they'll have a
state we have a state to state
settlement of course they won't have
borders but we don't have borders either
as he said which is correct so they'll
be two states without borders and small
footnote is will own everything that
matters but they can have fried chicken
and that's the that's essentially
petition these are the realistic options
today well I'll make one last comment
this was currently tension between
the United States and Israel it's not
new it's not exactly what happened 20
years ago 20 years ago the Israeli
government me structure here was the
Prime Minister it was acting in a way
that was extremely insulting to the
United States now the US doesn't like it
insults I mean the subject to the
policies in scaring out but don't want
them to be carried out in an insulting
fashion so what would happen is that say
when James Baker and secretary state
would arrive in Jerusalem shahmeer would
take that day to announce a new
settlement but just like what happened
with Biden a couple of weeks ago a
couple of months ago I guess and the
James Baker zoom patrician wasp he
doesn't like to be insulted they can
push didn't either so the bush Baker
administration informed Israel that this
is not acceptable behavior we're not
going to accept it and they imposed wild
sanctions just to make it
