what would a democracy look like well my
own feeling is that thinking about the
various kinds of technical ways in which
representation can take place it don't
really carry us very far almost because
what really matters is what kind of
socio-economic arrangements are there
you know here we go back to I think you
have to start with something more
fundamental there plenty of hierarchic
relations in society all kinds from
family to International Affairs I think
we should always ask the question
wherever there is such a structure is it
legitimate and there's a burden of proof
it has to prove its legitimacy it's not
automatically self legitimating so
wherever there's a structure of
authority domination hierarchy
patriarchal family
International Affairs anything in
between the question of legitimacy of
the structure arises sometimes you can
justify a structure of dominance but
very rarely that wherever you can't it
ought to simply be dismantled and that's
across the spectrum and it can be done
in many different ways so say the the
feminist revolution of the last roughly
generation had a big impact on certain
kinds of dominant structures okay that's
quite significant work around
enterprises set the basis up for a
different kind of economic and political
structure and they exist as some of them
in fact are quite substantial that the
Mondragon unglamorous in Spain is first
of all economically quite successful
it's one of the few parts of the Spanish
economy that's going to survive this
austerity
devastating austerity policies but it
also is democratic in a way which
doesn't show up in method of voting and
so on and I think those are kind of the
major factors that have to be looked at
the kinds you mentioned are important
and I don't you could debate exactly how
it could be done but I mean I don't see
how any complex system can avoid some
sort of representative democracy and we
just can't have a vote on everything but
representatives should be accountable
recallable subject to constant
surveillance and control and
interchangeable and that does have you
know there can be negative aspects to
that but I can't see that much can be
avoided
