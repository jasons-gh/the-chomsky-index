Nam Chomsky move aside McDevitt own the
tequila the task that I was assigned by
Sabina Trudeau and that I'm now
executing is to introduce her to the
Speaker of the evening
since Noam Chomsky has been a figure of
great importance in linguistics for the
last half century there's very there's
nobody here who hasn't read his work
there's nobody here who hasn't been
deeply influenced by it it is a great
honor and a great pleasure to introduce
my old Department colleague and friend
Noam Chomsky
you've all been through a long hard day
and I thought that instead of another
technical talk on current work it might
be more useful just to can't mix levels
if you're doing serious procedural
analysis you take get the smallest units
first and then classify them the bigger
units and sequence of these go to the
next level and so on but to explain
things like writer writer you have to
take account of the pretty obvious fact
that one of them's derived from right
the other from ride and the phonemic
difference is obvious but that's
illegitimate you can't look at that for
principle reasons and there were people
like say burn block who actually was
very helpful to us I should say in the
early days I me in particular he he was
very honest about it
he never fudged he was consistent
so for example I'm just his for example
it takes a words like caught caught that
you lie on for him they had to phonemic
differences the consonants were
different and the vowels were different
they contrasted and the reason they
contrast it because because there's one
pair in English in which they contrast
the 1950s normative Morris in Maine
Morris had and still has a house there
and they want for a walk and Morris's
wife Ross took a picture of the two of
them and in 1988 which was quite a few
years ago I was in my second year then
we had a party for gnomes sixtieth
birthday in the department and at that
party Morris presented gnome with a huge
enlargement of that picture that had
been taken more than 30 years before
that
now I had a set of us in my second year
then and I took a picture of them
holding that picture and the enlargement
of that picture is this
I don't know why you're applauding but
all right okay so if you're like me and
you're looking for a good photo op get
out your cameras and your phones because
no man amorous have agreed to pose for
the third recursion a little bit of
social history
Sabine didn't mention but the first
picture in 1955 was on a Sunday
afternoon that Morris was up at his
summer place and I went to visit them on
a Sunday afternoon I don't know if you
can see but we're both wearing jackets
and ties it's Sunday afternoon at the
beach that was he mid 1950s
we'll honored to have you part of this
show
atheism it's a big topic now on the
other boat
here's mr. question begins with the
question of are there phenomena in the
world that we cannot explain by
statements about material objects such
as well I mean such as what happens to
the air in this room how much pressure
we put on the air and so on now an
atheist says that and I would say that I
am one that science explains all the
phenomena that we know and the phenomena
that we cannot that science cannot
explain now either
mistakes in our reasoning there is we
have not properly analyzed the situation
or they're simply missed you know they
have no status I mean you can you know
is this as people say you know a fool
can ask more questions than 20 wise men
can answer I mean these are the kind of
questions for which either it's it's a
mistake to ask that kind of question
because sometimes when you ask I mean
like for example you ask you know how
you cannot ask him a question like how
many atoms well because you know in
order for it to count the atoms in this
room you have to isolate this room for
the rest of the world the computation of
that number is so carries of such
complexity that's you I mean you know
it's just beyond anything did you
experience discussing this issues with
what Chomsky no it was obvious both of
us that there couldn't possibly be any
seriously share the same beliefs with
you you know so I don't you know there
are many people who believe that you
know there's a power a power don't and
other people call God that created
everything well that's in order to
believe that you'd have to say that you
cannot explain that they I mean you
cannot explain this more without that
proposition but there's also scientists
do they believe in God
some scientists do you know and those
who believe in God you know they have
they believe in things which I define
not unnecessary to posit in order to
explain it the things of interest about
many explain why I find things that are
not I mean how I explain everything in
the world do you believe that morality
can morality moral values yes can be
existing in a society without believing
in God yes but first up I believe that
we have a responsibility to each of us I
mean you have a responsibility towards
me and I have a responsibility towards
you and it's because of that
responsibility I don't take out a knife
and cut you and you don't think
out the knife and cut me and I you know
we have a reasonable human conversation
as we are having right now you know and
that type of behavior you know it's
pretty supposed in my theory of what is
proper interaction between human beings
you want to know about the Crusades well
I mean as I as I know it you know I'm
not an expert on the history of what
happened in the 12th or 13th of you know
1200 or 1300 but because of preaching in
in the churches the many of the European
proletariat decided that they would and
they organized this it was organized in
France and Germany they organized
invasions of the Arab countries that
were in the East where they knew that
Jesus Christ had lived approximately
when he's supposed to have lived you
know yeah I mean I don't know what it is
in the Arabic year count but whatever
the year or the historians teach you I
believe that's probably the correct year
you know and so the Crusades people were
became very enthusiastic about going to
Palestine and removing the the and
conquering these places where their
their God had lived you know Jesus I
mean who in my mind wasn't out of God
that he was a person and he was a
preacher of some sort and we know I mean
we know
what he preached because people wrote
them down how do you see the person of
Jesus and he's teaching I mean this
would be like saying how would ice I
don't know much about you but I whatever
I know about you and that's what tell me
how much do you know about Jesus not
very much because I'm not a believer in
gee I mean I'm it's not part of my
religion and in fact I have no religion
so I I do not believe in Jesus being a
holy person or anything like that I mean
he was just a person who lived whenever
they I don't know what year it is in the
Mohammedan calendar but it's something
like 500 before the hell that she starts
or 600 600 before maybe for me how do
you see Islam Islam is just another
religion I don't happen to believe
either in Islam or in Christianity or in
fact the belief of the religion of the
Jews I don't how do you explain that in
the far east they don't have religions
they have system of ideas like we can
call it kind of philosophy like Buddhism
that's the way I think of it you know I
mean I would think Buddhism is a way of
thinking about the world and you know I
don't think that's nicest necessarily
that Buddhism is true or false
mmm because but I realized that many
people in the Far East believe believe
that
tenets of Buddhism are correct but I
don't know much about them I saw at the
end of this conversation I'm Organa that
you say whatever you want to say about
Chomsky what can you say as a final word
about the man Oh
in my opinion can you say very very
profound thinker and many I found many
of his ideas about again I will discuss
mainly technical issues about language
now to give you an instance of what a
technical issue about languages yes for
example when you say you take the past
tense of English okay now the past
tension in English I mean it's a very
precise thing you know I write but I
wrote yesterday and you can't say I
write yesterday that would be incorrect
in English I mean it's not a crime it's
not if the police will not come and I
will arrest you but if you speak English
it's more like knowing how to dance now
when you go on the dance floor I mean
either you know how to dance
there's the answer you don't know how
that and the appropriate people who know
how to dance will tell you how the
dancers dance correctly and they can say
right away yeah he'll he never learned
how to dance so he obviously this way
when we look at him we can see that he's
completely useless isn't the answer
okay that's also the same thing about
language I mean you know that in English
the past tense of right is Road Road
but the past tense of bite is not both
you know you know we have to
it's a bit you know so there are certain
facts that you learn when you were very
little and among them are facts like
that the I know how to make the past
tense so I know decide the past tense is
decided and divide it divided and
knowing how to speak English is knowing
a that there are different and which
words require one past tense and which
words require the other past tense so
divide requires divided but right it
does not work and say righted you have
to say the wrote you know and you can't
say decide this old wrong mean but
that's what you children learn that very
quickly and they don't ever make
mistakes you how to ena you're never
correct you know maybe when they very
young they make mistakes about certain
words but on the whole you know thank
you you're welcome

professor Chomsky it's an honor for our

guests pleasure to be with you I know
your father was one of the major like
Hebrew scholars he wrote books in to put
life in the Hebrew language how did that
affect you was a kid going in this
environment in many ways first of all it
just intellectually when I was maybe 12
years old or so I I read his doctoral
dissertation which was a scholarly
edition for scholarly edition of a
famous medieval Hebrew grammarian who
David Kinsey who essentially borrowed
from the very rich tradition of Arabic
grammar at the time which I later
studied and he adapted it to grammar of
Hebrew and this was a scholarly edition
which went into the history of the
Semitic history and so on and so forth
and of course learned from that my
parents were first of all the they were
lived in a kind of a kind of a Hebrew
ghetto not a physical ghetto but a
cultural one this was a period in which
there was an effort to revive Hebrew as
a living language it had been in the
19th century it was revived as a
literary language before that it was not
the language that nobody spoke you know
nobody but by the 1930s within the
Jewish community there was there were a
number of splits and many people just
didn't care but among those who were
involved there was a split between
yiddishists and
supporters of the revival of Hebrew it
was pretty cool to come for real no I
was you're dead Hebrews yep and he
forbid you to speak Yiddish ill-used and
that was their native my parents yeah
for them their native languages yeah but
they didn't you guys never heard a word
it's a secret language of parents going
but we were not supposed to read and
Julian people we learned Hebrew from an
early age I thought the v-rod reached a
loom and do speak in and from you know
also about 10 or 11 years old
I spend Friday evening I would always
read Hebrew with my father Hebrew
literature SAS and this goes into the
other phase of it the commitment to some
form of Zionism and Zionism then didn't
mean what it means now so I was I became
a scientist youth leader but in groups
that were opposed to a Jewish state a
Zionist opposed to the Jewish thing
which was lots of my views on that it
was not a position at the time a large
part of the so-called Zionist movement
was actually formally opposed to a
Jewish state that he the tendencies that
I was involved in I was also by then
involved in all kinds of radical
politics were committed to trying to
this pre 1948 you need to develop right
yeah we you know this is break and we'll
come back to discussion

Marah hail a new ruler and yeah for the
cool ticket office in Nam Chomsky you
faster than a high school immediately
know soon as you can do experiment there
was a course set off a raft of
experimentation and by now been shown of
course it's not any two languages
depends on properties and it seems to
fall into patterns of similar prosody so
it seems that kids or infants are just
tuned to picking out presenting elements
there is work I think mainly by some of
you know a lot more about this than I do
so correct me but the most that I know
is by Laura and Patito
finding element special structures in
the brain which apparently she claims
are humanely specific that pick out
certain kinds of rhythm roughly at the
level of roughly the size of a syllable
so maybe kids are picking out something
like syllable but
and then it's again you know by say six
months or so I think kids pretty much
have mastered the pros otic structure of
their language so something's going on
very fast you know obviously pre tuned
but it's more than just prosody and
periodicity it's of a specific kind it's
a kind that's looking in specific ways
and is using that information to
construct everything we know and in fact
what I said about telegraphic speech is
quite relevant here I think it shows the
more the better experimentation has
become the more it's been learned that
the younger and younger you get the more
that kids know and there is evidence by
now that by roughly maybe 1820 months
the kids probably know almost the whole
language one kind of evidence for this
is the Helen Keller type case the Helen
Keller was extremely fluent you know
wonderful fluency she was blind deaf but
I think she became blind deaf at 20
months there since as she invented for
herself it turns out while I look like
me when did this after me recently small
videotapes the surface she had worked
out the system is now called the DOMA
which is used to teach blind deaf it's
the system where you put your hand on
the cheek and your thumb on the vocal
cords and she somehow figured that out
and her almost you know remarkable
fluency and English came from something
like to DOMA but from 20 months now
since then there's been experimentation
some of it here my wife a lot the main
work on this that studied other view
studied other cases experimentally and
they never published this because they
weren't enough cases
what was coming out was that they could
get very successful results with two
DOMA if the person lost sight and
hearing roughly at that age but if it
was before about sixteen months they
never had any success well you know if
that holds up unfortunately you can't
study it anymore because this was spinal
meningitis
now it's curable but if some result like
that turned out right it would imply
that roughly at that age the kids must
know an awful lot about the language and
that the DOMA is just kind of eliciting
something that's inside sort of like the
telegraphic speech
we spoke about Elijah Elijah what's the
the the historic Jesus for you how do
you see it
he is a creation of a combination of
history mythology the history of what
Jesus stands for is quite intriguing the
first few centuries of after of
Christianity Christians were persecuted
bitterly harshly persecuted group the
reason is implicit in the lesson of the
Gospels the Gospels are radical pacifist
and of course any radical pacifist
movement is going to be harshly
repressed by power in the fourth century
3:15 the Roman Empire Constantine took
over Christianity turned it into the
official religion of the Roman Empire
the cross which had been the symbol of
the suffering was on the shield of the
Roman legions and from that point on
Christianity became shifted from the
religion of the persecuted to the
religion of the persecutors that pretty
much went on until 1962 when how do you
see the Crusades Crusades were a vicious
attack by Western Christians who were
the some of the most brutal people of
the period against the Middle East but
notice it was just not just the Crusades
when the Christians conquered Spain in
1492 they destroyed the most advanced
civilization in the world the most
tolerant civilization they threw out the
Jews they repressed the Muslims and they
created a barbarous regime Crusades were
and there were Crusades against a
heretical Christians to be very harsh
and brutal but I'm the history's pretty
ugly what happened in recent years is
very
destructive in 1962 pope john xxiii
called vatican ii which was a dramatic
event in the history of the church he
called for a revival of the gospels a
return of christianity to its origins
that was taken very seriously by life
especially in latin america and it led
to a war against the church the United
States thought of war against the church
with many religious martyrs it ended in
1989 with the murder of six leading
Jesuit intellectuals by a military unit
armed and supported by the United States
they were murdered in the university the
archbishop had been murdered while
reading Mass long series of events it's
out of history because we don't talk
about our own crimes we only talk about
other crimes but it's all part of the
history of Christianity the Gospels are
a subversive subversive literature very
dangerous because because of what they
say

Philip - Elliot you will Academy now
Chomsky the ulti have a Michele at that
I can't do it for physics that's kind of
a theorem there's no there's no measure
of when a theory fails so like that's so
much when it fails but why it fails what
the why it fails yeah well I mean take
contemporary physical theory what you
learn if you take a physics course at
MIT you learn modern physics which has a
slight problem it can't find the 90% of
the mass energy in the universe kind of
minor problem in fact being CERN
accelerator you know now trying to find
the famous Higgs bosons which if they
exist will maybe overcome this problem
well that's the state of science most
things that doesn't understand you know
you have theories which it's a terrific
theory works you know better to anything
in history but it has defects like this
also it doesn't know how many universes
there are are there one or an infinite
number that's a live question but you
can't admit it's an open question and
this is no way of measuring the extent
to which a theory succeeds and answering
the questions that it poses because they
all if you take a look at data they all
fail Wow
that's why that's why scientists do
experiments you know you do experiments
to try to experiment creates an
idealization a highly idealized
system in which you try to get an answer
to something
but you don't try to get an answer to
that what's going on in that world you
know that's way too complex far too many
variables and so on so all of in fact
this actually this is part of the we're
the Galilean revolution kind of took off
it
the Galileo was doing experiments most
of them were thought experiments he
didn't actually do them just kind of
thought about it
and a lot of them are physically
impossible it's now known but he tried
to convince the NSF of his day the
aristocrats that the results that he was
getting meant something and if you look
back at the discussions they couldn't
see the point of what he was doing
I mean why worry about a ball rolling
down a frictionless plane which can't
even exist instead of say worrying about
how a flower grows well to try to get
over that gap was no small task and in
fact the yellow faced plenty of problems
like he was never able to explain why
objects don't fall off the fly off the
earth and if the earth is rotating why
don't we all fly off it a small problem
that people didn't give up science at
that point kind of went on so you expect
theories to fail and it's interesting to
learn where they fail and yes you try
just like you said you look at the
failures and try to see if you can
overcome them often by just trying to
find real data you know not the data of
sense which is way too complex to look
at but the kind of data which will be
designed to give you the right answer

because matter of time your name was
mentioned in a late movie about you the
greatest atheist and another question
related to that how come an atheist have
such morality defending the pool and is
it your background fed your moral life
let's talk about atheism first what's
your concept about you're a man of
concepts if somebody asks me whether I'm
an atheist I can't answer mmm I'm being
asked do you believe in something but
they don't tell me what the something is
so therefore it can you know that's
about for something I don't know what it
is I mean people have their own varying
conceptions of it whatever they their
conceptions are I see no reason to
believe in them but if they want to
believe in them fine that's their
business people as long as it doesn't
interfere with others people can have
whatever beliefs they are I can
comprehend why people would want to
believe in some kind of force in the
world for good a benign for somewhere
bismillahi r-rahman r-rahim I can
understand why people would like to
believe that there is such a force I
don't I don't see any reason to believe
in it I don't see any but it's their
business not mine the why should I think
that as almost nothing to do with
concern for poor and suffering people
there are religious people who have
those concerns there are religious
people who don't care and are brutal and
harsh and the same is true of
