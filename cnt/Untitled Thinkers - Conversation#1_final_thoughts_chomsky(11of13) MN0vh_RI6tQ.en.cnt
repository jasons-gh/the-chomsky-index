first of all we would like to live in a
world with variation but more
fundamentally I think we like to live in
a world with no power system and I think
we're moving slowly toward that so we
don't live under kings and princes we
don't have slavery that women have some
degree of rights oh oh that is erosion
of power systems not just a political
power like kings and princes but also
for example patriarchal families eroding
their power is a step towards freedom
for women for children for England it's
not the top of the powers direction and
that's true in other aspects of life too
so instead of looking for one power
system which would be global tyranny
that we should be looking at modes of
eroding power systems so that people run
their own lives how did we get the
rights we had I mean we have a lot of
Rights a freedom speech for example was
protected in the United States beyond
maybe any other society it was a civil
and human rights to a substantive
women's rights or to substantial extent
protected how did it happen well look at
the history was it a gift from above the
one by struggles from below people can
struggle hard so from dangers many
people died but they ultimately win
rights which then power systems will try
to take away from because they're always
trying to erode those revenge that's the
way it's been done in the past it's the
way it can be done now
