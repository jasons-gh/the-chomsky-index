teniamos preguntar teh sobre todo como
vez la perspectiva de una relacion is
Mexico stands Unidos desde Abajo
those mementos that's the kind of
relationship that can be established and
can be very meaningful so just as an
example I code and now in living at
Arizona Sun I teach at the University of
Arizona but Co take a course on radical
politics with a colleague and friend
here and we have the course
connected life to a university in Mexico
Hermosillo and are planning to extend it
to other universities this is arranged
we're now trying to arrange it so that
there will be real interaction the
Mexican students will be able to
participate directly in the sessions
this is one of many kinds of
relationships that can be set up
including the visits in both directions
and so on and there are many others some
of them are symbolic and probably saw
the reports of the seesaws at the border
fence
these cords the children go up and down
on one one one side was in Mexico one
side was in the United States across the
border a symbolic indication of the
kinds of relationships that ought to be
established as well as a protest against
the obscene construction of the border
but there are many other kinds of
connections

were not for the enormous demand for

cultura you know it's certainly true and
where I live in Tucson right north of
the border about almost half the
population is mexican-american and the
University where I teach again
almost half the students are
mexican-american and there's a
considerable cultural integration and of
course Mexican music food the literature
and or widely read and so on so yes
those are modes of interaction but I
think thei they're also just a
people-to-people connections that can be
developed in fact there are many very
common concerns the one common concern
is in fact the border of the idea of
militarization of the border which
really goes back to Bill Clinton and
after which is when it started and has
of course been extended into a extremely
ugly process under crumb it's a common
to the people in Mexico in the United
States to abolish that and to allow free
transit across the border we should be
aiming for something like the Schengen
Agreement in Europe which allows free
movement within the European Union in
the Member States that's what we should
have between Mexico and the United
States it's a concern
a sidon and at least a political
permanente in los ultimos cinquain times
requiring tanya's dan Ozuna when and
Leticia Donald Trump's Aikido seven in
fact if you look at the there is some
standard models that you are used to
predict elections that usually they what
they usually find is that the election
is determined substantially by people's
perceptions about the state of the
economy not the actual state but
people's perceptions is it being better
or getting worse and so on by those
those models are predicting that unless
is a recession Trump would probably win
on the other other hand there are many
other factors of the things that he's
doing or often I just atrocious and some
of them are again will affect not only
the United States in Mexico but the
entire world so the worst and the most
horrendous of the Trump policies are his
attitude and towards global warming this
is actually the whole Republican Party
but he's leading it we know we should
know that we have only a few years to
try to
serious threats to the survival of
organized human society yeah well this
is a really substantial crisis every
country in the world is trying to do
something about it some more some less
the United States is alone under Crump
in trying to race towards destruction as
quickly as possible that will another
four years is from might literally be a
death knell for the species that's not a
joke
this is vastly more serious than the
things that are discussed like you know
it's telephone call to the Prime
Minister of Ukraine and so on but this
is really evil and of course it'll
affect Mexico directly the Gulf of
Mexico can be simply poisoned by
whatever destruction the Mexico itself
large parts will become virtually
unlivable because of the heat and in
fact that sea level rising may be
several feet oh this is destruction
beyond what can be imagined
other parts of the world are already
becoming virtually uninhabited
the temperatures in India this summer
went up to 50 degrees centigrade in
October on the Gulf but they're now at
the point where they not only have to
air conditioned buildings but they have
to air-conditioned the outdoors because
people can't survive in the extreme heat
in Japan an advanced industrial country
they had a huge typhoon which was very
destructive
and they're now beginning to wonder
whether there is any point in even
trying to develop barriers against the
extremely severe storms of the company
we're facing a major crisis well as I
was saying this for years more crumb
will possibly doom the human society to
the virtual destruction deferred from
climate change global warming but that's
only one of two major crises of the
other which is not discussed very much
this is the growing and very severe
threat of nuclear war from justice
abolished the major arms treaty which
was preventing a confrontation in Europe
from developing into nuclear war
signed by Reagan and Gorbachev it has
just been announced that he's going to
abandon the Outer Space Treaty which
blocks developing military forces in
space that means well the right after
dismantling of matter that's animated
from immediately tested a missile which
violates created diversity cleaning is a
reference to reciprocate this is opening
the door to development of massive new
techniques of mutual destruction in fact
local destruction
very good intentions being heading to
another few years we may not survive
that either it's a very significant
election may determine the phase Papa

abilities he's not you've never had a
president entrance where the Secretary
of State supposed to be serious person
says the president was sent by God to
protect Israel from her brand
we're off on a new dimension which has
never existed in the past
it's possible Trump talks about
withdrawing troops from the Middle East
it's doing the opposite he's sending
troops to the Middle East
mm fruits which are sent to Saudi Arabia
to help accelerate their war in Yemen
which is destroying the country its
conflict with Iran could just by
accident work out into some incident
that
Gallade into a major war in the region
this is places just look point by point
let's take the Russian border the
treating teacher Trump just abrogated
had to do with east-west confrontations
in Europe by eliminating when Reagan and
Gorbachev decided to eliminate
short-range missiles that gave us 20
years of peace in Europe now that's gone
the United States has installations
threatening installations right on the
border of Europe of Russia of there
threatening actions actually on both
sides but the most provocative are from
native under Trump nobody knows where
that will go next point that may sound
exotic but it's being discussed by
serious political analysts and it's a
real word you said that Trump won't have
to worry in his second term about being
elected again is that true suppose he
decides not to leave office then what
happens there are you have murderers
drug cartels the United States has
heavily armed white supremacist militias
which outmatch local forces they're
wildly in favor of Trump who they see is
protecting white supremacy against all
these terrible people who are trying to
destroy our white Christians
they supposed to cause on them to
revolve
well the US Army could overcome them but
what an army does depends on not the
general but the Colonel's what better
than they don't say we could be facing a
real crisis in fact that could even
happen if he doesn't win the 2020
election suppose he doesn't concede
suppose he said it was fated by illegal
immigrants Mexicans who were voting who
were brought in by Democrats to vote for
them and this same scenario plays out I
don't say it's likely but it's not
impossible the United States is in a
very strange situation know from
represents extremely dangerous
tendencies within the country a large
part of the country it's the country
where white supremacy is very profound a
very deeply rooted and so it is
fundamentalist Christianity this leads
to a picture where large segments of the
population recognize that under current
tendencies that whites will be a
minority and white Christian they call
anglo-saxon civilization is in danger

prettiness como podemos ayudar I can no
say religious Rambla there have been for
the first time in many years of there's
a real opposition in the United States
and mainly among young people opposition
to the neoliberal programs of the past
40 years which have been very harmful
there's a move towards a social
democracy which is new others
young people are acting very effectively
to counter the dangerous developments
were talking about so just if you want
one example one of many some form of
what's called green New Deal is
essential for the survival of the
species a couple of years ago nobody was
even dreaming about it now it's in the
center of attention the legislative
agenda corporations are being forced to
pay attention to it what happened a
small group of young people sunrise
movement agitated for is began to take
direct action like sitting in in
correctional offices they got support
from some of the young women in Congress
especially
Aleksandra got a Kazakh quartet
who were elected in fact on the Winnie's
of popular activism they said she
supported it others did now a major
issue it might save us and there are
many cases like that
the country is in a deferment there
which direction will go but there were
many reasons for hope and like right
here right here in Tucson where I live
it's not far from the border there's
very substantial support in the city for
for helping refugees who are fleeing
from misery and dying in the desert
there are groups who go out into the
desert believe bottles of water until

provider for permits and establishment
the media portrayed him in the most
negative possible world dismissed him
disparagement man I think he'll be
prevented from any denomination could be
Elizabeth Warren who's certainly far
better than from most an acquaintance
but I think it will be very it's very
difficult at this point to predict the
outcome of the election there are
conflicting forces on almost all issues
even outside of the immediate political
domain like for example
was dried and the green reveal the sport
for Refugees there's a proposal right
now where I live in two Sun to turn to
Sun into a sanctuary city which will
welcome and protect people who managed
to escape the order control monstrosity
these are tendencies all over the
country and they could prevail what
Mexicans can do since us that is to try
to create in Mexico damage a model a
demonstration of where a forward-looking
progressive society could advance and
there are enough interactions is that
can have an effect on what will happen
here but it says we should just finish
by saying that we live in a moment of
truly existential crisis what happens in
the next few years will determine the
failure of human society that has never
been true in the past but it is true now
and kinds of issues we've been
discussing
