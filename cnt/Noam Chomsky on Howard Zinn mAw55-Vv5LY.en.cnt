it was a close personal friend in fact
for 45 years and we've been through
quite a lot together the families were
also very close so it's a personal loss
of course but it's much broader than
that it's a very serious loss beyond the
beyond his faculties family and the his
many friends much wider circle through
it's hard to imagine even how many lives
were touched and changed by his his work
and his own life which was intimately
interrelated with his work his work
changed the significantly the way
history is viewed in particular American
history but extends far beyond bringing
focusing attention on what had been
marginalized namely the crucial
contributions of what he called
countless unknown people who whose
actions lay the basis lies like the
roots of the great events that enter
history and he brought that to the fore
he also exposed much of the truth of
American history which like other states
is not very pretty but as concealed and
that just to change all of this changed
the conscience of a generation as did
his own model he was a participant
commentator that William the first days
he was he was a he was teaching they had
tenure in fact at Spelman College black
collagen at Georgia and he was one of
the few supporters of the black students
in the early and very dangerous days of
the civil rights movement when they were
right beginning to sit-in at lunch
counters right freedom buses and so on
he not only supported them but
participated in their activities and
later
I wrote the first major book about the
snack league which was Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee which
was at the forefront of the civil rights
movement and for a thanks for his
integrity who was run out of the
university and it went on like that
through the rest of his life his actions
were he was just a model of integrity of
sincerity of insight of you know good
humor and wit in the face of adversity
it was just inspiring figure
