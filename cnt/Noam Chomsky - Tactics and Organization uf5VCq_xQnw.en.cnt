the fact that the treads were our very
survival are so acute and real adds to a
certain puzzlement of many admirers of
your work and thought they deplore that
you have almost always been very
reluctant to respond to those demands
that are often put to you regarding what
and can and should be done and that you
typically won't answer them beyond
generalities such as organized one could
argue that these requests are both
legitimate and strategically important
and more ever that your socialist
libertarian ideals should inspire you
some answers answers that could today
for example put on the agenda to take
over of workplaces as a live option so
those answer would of course be
tentative and modest answers but they
would nevertheless be answers and I
think they are much needed today you
seem to think otherwise why every topic
that I've ever spoken and written about
as far as I can think of I have
suggested definite solutions but when
you get down to the tactical level like
what should we do tomorrow about this
problem then it's true I can't give
answers and I don't think anyone can
because it depends very much on
circumstances I mean a lot of my own
activities you don't know this from what
I write of course but a lot of my own
activities have been organizational so
I've spent a lot of time involved since
the sixties and in actual organization
in the sixties and seventies an
organization of resistance activities
for example later other movements
anybody who's involved in an
organization say resistance serious
actions this is not a joke
I mean I was facing a long jail sentence
for example and knew it these were
serious actions they were they were
illegal and they had to be planned
carefully and you have to think quite
carefully about tactic
that there aren't trivial answers to
questions of tactics so we would spend a
lot of you know at least if you know the
constant meetings to try to work out the
kinds of tactics that would be
appropriate in the existing situations
you want tactics to work you don't want
to carry them out because they make you
feel good you want them to have an
effect and that requires thinking
through a lot of complicated things and
when people come to me and ask well what
should I do to change the immune to
protect the environment I can't say
depends where they are and who they are
what they're facing what they're willing
to do who they're trying to reach and so
on there aren't general answers to
tactical questions there are very
specific answers which have to do with
immediate circumstances including what
the individual in question is willing to
undertake I don't expect everyone to be
willing to undertake resistance or civil
disobedience even or even large-scale
protests those are choices and within
the range of choices about yourself and
the circumstances you face tactics have
to be thought through carefully and
advice from the outside is meaningless
so yes I agree at the tactical level but
in terms of general solutions I think we
can spell them out so israel-palestine
nuclear weapons Iran whatever you like I
think it's not that hard to even a large
scale economic change social economic
change they can spell out solutions but
how you get there is a hard problem
