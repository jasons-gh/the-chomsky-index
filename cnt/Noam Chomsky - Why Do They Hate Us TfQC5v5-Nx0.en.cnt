after September 11th some of the press
particularly The Wall Street Journal did
do what they should have done they began
investigating opinion in the in the
region to find out why people they were
trying to find out the answer to George
Bush's plaintiff question why do they
hate us when we're so good actually
before even before I asked the question
the Wall Street Journal had provided
some of the answers they did do what
they should have done they did a
investigation of opinions in the region
now they kept to the people they care
about so they had a it was what they
called money Muslims meaning bankers
lawyers managers of branches of us Corp
transnationals that kind of people
people are right inside the US system
and of course naturally despise some
have been Laden because there is main
targets they're the ones he's after so
they don't like it and in that group you
can't what's their opinion about the
United States well turns out they're
they're very antagonistic to US policy
though they're in the main policies
they're just part of like the
international economic policies but what
they what they object to is the fact
that the United States has consistently
opposed a democracy independent
development as sporting corrupt brutal
regimes is there naturally strongly
opposed to the unilateral US support for
the Israeli military occupation which is
very harsh and brutal ZnO in its 35th
year strongly opposed the US sanctions
against Iraq which they understand
perfectly well and you know to go into
are devastating the population but
strengthening Saddam Hussein and for
reasons like that
they say they a lot of hatred of US
policies despite the fact that they're
right in the middle of the entire US
system well that's one answer to George
Bush's question it's not the kind of
answer you read and most of the
intellectual journals and the press and
so on there you read sophisticated
answers about how people of that region
have bad cultures or they left out by
globalization or they you know can't
stand our freedoms and our magnificence
and so on and so forth
anyone who is seriously concerned with
these issues certainly anyone who's a
specialist than International Affairs or
the Middle East knows that there's
nothing new about these answers you can
go way back and find them as far back as
you want to go obvious place to look if
you want to find out more about this is
the records for 1958 President
Eisenhower into an internal discussion
observed to his staff his words that
there's a campaign of hatred against us
in the Middle East not by governments
but by the people and there was
discussion about this to the National
Security Council the highest planning
body gave their analysis they said that
there is the reason is that there's a
perception in the region that the United
States is supporting harsh and brutal
and corrupt regimes and is blocking
democratization and development and is
doing so because of our interest in
controlling the oil reserves of the
region and they said it's difficult to
counter this perception because it's
accurate
not only is it accurate but it should be
accurate it said it is natural for us to
support status quo governments meaning
the kind I just described and to prevent
democracy and development because we
want to maintain control over the energy
resources of the region so there's a
campaign of hatred against us by the
people and that's the reason for it
essentially the same is what the Wall
Street Journal discovered on September
14th and anybody knew in between so if
you want to listen to some voices
outside the cocoon it's not hard to hear
them and they'll answer the questions
about why there's a campaign of hatred
against us whether it's now or in 1958
and in a good part of the rest of the
world where people just don't enjoy
being ground to dust under somebody's
boot I don't like it leads to hatred you
can avoid you know you can indulge in
the fantasies if you like but that's a
choice
