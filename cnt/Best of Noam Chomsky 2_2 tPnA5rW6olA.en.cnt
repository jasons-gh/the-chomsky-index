Israel that's a half of a very important
question the other half of it is what's
the effect of war on terrorism on the
Palestinians now if you take a look at
we are not supposed to talk about that
question here but if you look at the
both you'll find that what penny Mars
described is in fact correct the balance
of terror and violence is overwhelmingly
against the Palestinians not
surprisingly given the balance of forces
and that's even true that's true right
to the present I mean for three decades
Israel was able to run the West Bank
virtually with no forces as Mars point
out others point out because the
population was so passive while they
were being humiliated beaten tortured
land stolen and so on just as I quoted
finally there was a reaction and it's
interesting to see the u.s. reaction to
it in the first month of the Intifada
this one october two thousand in the
first month of the Intifada at 275
palestine 74 palestinians were killed
four israelis were killed so in the
occupied territories the Israeli army
according to its own records fired a
million bullets in the first day which
disgusted the generals when they learned
about it Israel first few days of the
Intifada was using us helicopters they
don't make them us helicopters to attack
civilian complexes apartment houses and
so on killing and wounding dozens of
people and the US did respond to that
Clinton responded by sending the biggest
shipment of military helicopters in a
decade to Israel the press responded to
by not publishing it i should add
refusing to publish it because it was
repeatedly brought to their attention
well while the ratio was 20 21 which is
pretty much what it's been for a long
time there was no concern here then over
the next 2-3 years the ratio reduced to
closer to three two one and then came
enormous concern about the one not three
and this goes back for a long time what
i quoted from Aris
accurate well you know I don't know
follow the very brief response the idea
that there is this vast conspiracy
between the American media and both
Democrats like Clinton and Republicans
like Bush to hide the truth from the
American public just does not bear
reality Israel's an open society any
newspaper can come and cover it why
would not the newspapers cover these
stories before one reason they are
figments of Chomsky's imagination well
then if and they're just never happened
now listen I want to talk about another
figment of his imagination chose the
party verified friend as a young Afghan
American woman who is still in high
school and has chosen not to live her
life here instead she's chosen to earn a
degree in teaching and move to
Afghanistan to reach and help Afghan
children what advice would you offer her
specifically what can she do to be most
effective and protect herself as a woman
I mean she knows I'm sure without
knowing her she knows a hundred times as
much about this topic as I do so I
wouldn't offer any advice I would offer
ourselves advice we have a
responsibility to Afghanistan the United
States and Russia those two countries
that destroyed Afghanistan in the last
20 years that two countries have
destroyed the Afghanistan we shouldn't
be giving them aid we should be paying
them reparations we should be honest
enough to do
it's not the only country in the world
to which we owe reparations but it's one
and the way we could that's it's this
young Afghan woman as by doing the kind
of thing that she and others like or
would or would ask us to do and we
should follow their lead we don't
anything to tell them again the choice
not a necessity so we end up with a kind
of a dilemma if we're on if we're not
honest forget it if we are honest
there's a dilemma one possibility is
just to acknowledge that we are total
hypocrites that we and then to at least
have the decency to stop talking about
things like human rights and right and
wrong and good and evil and so on and
just say yeah we're hypocrites we want
to we have force and we're going to rule
the world by force period let's forget
about everything else the other option
is harder to pursue but it's imperative
unless we would like to contribute to
still worse disasters that are likely
lie ahead
industrial civilization has developed
within a certain system of convenient
myths the driving force of modern
industrial civilization has been
individual material gain which is
accepted legitimate even praiseworthy on
the grounds that private vices new
public benefits in the classic
formulation now it's long been
understood very well that a society is
that is based on this principle will
destroy itself in time it can only
persist with whatever suffering and
injustice it entails as long as it's
possible to pretend that the destructive
forces that humans create are limited
that the world is an infinite resource
and that the world is an infinite
garbage can at this stage of history
either one of two things as possible
either the general population will take
control of its own destiny and will
concern itself with community interests
guided by values of solidarity and
sympathy and concern for others or
alternatively there will be no destiny
for anyone to control as long as some
specialized classes in a position of
authority it is going to set policy and
the special interests that it serves but
the conditions of survival
along justice require rational social
planning in the interests of the
community as a whole and by now that
means the global community the question
is whether privileged elite should
dominate mass communication and should
use this power as they tell us they must
mainly to enclose necessary illusions to
manipulate and deceive the stupid
majority and remove them from the public
arena the question in brief is whether
democracy and freedom are values to be
preserved or threats to be avoided in
this possibly terminal phase of human
existence democracy and freedom are more
than values to be treasured they may
well be essential to survive
Oh
you
a biologist friend of mine who thinks
that correctly that the evolutionary
psychology and sociobiology apology ankh
once gave an argument to prove that
there was natural selection for
stupidity and passivity and the argument
runs like this he says imagine a bunch
of hunter-gatherers sitting around a
fire and somebody hears a saber-toothed
tiger screaming outside and most of them
huddle around the fire but one of them
is kind of energetic and enthusiastic
and smart and so on so he figures he'll
go out and drive the saber-toothed tiger
away well you know the chances of the
other people's genes being perpetuated
is fairly high but the chances of his D
intriguing perpetuated or rather low so
it's obvious the selection is going to
lead to stupidity and passivity so but
it's just a good argument as any other
one namely zero but the fact is that
that you know answers your question
really it's easier just to look at
listen to something and sort of feel
good and gone and there's something else
you want to try to go on and do
something more yeah it takes effort and
maybe costs in the long term it'll make
a better world but that's for everybody
not just for you the constructive ways
begin with an honest look in the mirror
and never an easy task always a
necessary one
you
you
