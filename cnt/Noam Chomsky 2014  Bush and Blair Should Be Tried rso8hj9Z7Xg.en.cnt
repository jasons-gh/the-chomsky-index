as retribution but just punishment for
crimes I mean the worst crime of the
21st century has been the bush Blair
invasion of Iraq totally without any
credible pretext if you notice the
protect kept changing everything facts
changed the it's a textbook example of
aggression supreme international crime
under international law differing from
other war crimes and that it includes
all of the evil that follows that's the
Nuremberg judgment on and that you
recall perhaps that Robert Jackson the
US prosecutor at Nuremberg who warned
the tribunal that as he put it we're
giving these defendants a poisoned
chalice and if we sip from it we must be
treated the same way or else the
nuremberg tribunal as a farce Victor's
justice so sure they should be subjected
to international law now in the United
States that can't happen because the
United States uniquely is self immunized
against law when the United States
supported the International Court of
Justice and correctly initiated in 1946
they added a proviso that the u.s.
cannot be charged with violation of
international treaties they meant
specifically the UN Charter which bans
the use of force or the OS charter
that's been accepted by the court in
fact if you look at the record just what
the u.s. rarely ratifies any
international agreements but when it
does is almost invariably a reservation
which says what's called non self
executing technically that means doesn't
apply to us unless there's specific
legislation and that's accepted by the
courts like for example when Yugoslavia
brought charges against NATO
the US appealed to the court and said we
can't be charged and the reason was that
they had mentioned the word genocide and
when the u.s. signed the Genocide
Convention ratified it 40 years later
there was a reservation saying
inapplicable to the United States so
this is across the board us is immune
self immunized to international law
written not quite that much but these
are really things that are in the hands
of the public again if we permit our
leaders to be major war criminals sure
that's what they'll do power tries to
achieve whatever can and if its domestic
enemy allows it to do it they'll do it
so in case is a case in point
