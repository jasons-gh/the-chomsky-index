hello everyone my name is Julie
goldsmith I am an intern at the SUNY Old
Westbury media Innovation Center I am
also the co-executive producer at Oh W
TV news it is an honor to welcome dr.
know'm Chomsky an expert in linguistics
to discuss the corona virus pandemic dr.
Chomsky how are you today you should be
with you thank you so much and we
understand your time is limited so we
have about five questions to ask okay
let's march ahead so in urban cities in
the u.s. like New Orleans blacks make up
70% of coronavirus deaths similar to its
kind of pattern during Hurricane Katrina
can you talk about the inherent societal
problems especially in the US that have
led the coronavirus to
disproportionately affect the black and
brown and poor populations only real
answer would start 400 years ago not
going to run through the details but you
know them very well first came the most
vicious version of slavery in human
history who has been slavery in the past
but nothing like what was instituted in
the American South that is the basis for
us prosperity that's cotton was the oil
of the 19th 18th 19th centuries cheap
cotton was the basis for in the United
States in England for the development of
manufacturing textile textile
manufacturing finance it was developed
to make the system work commerce retail
obviously in fact the whole economy was
basically based on slavery just as oil
was a large basis of the Industrial
Revolution
theoretically slavery ended in after the
Civil War just into men theoretically as
it was a decade of reconstruction in
fact when blacks were free free advanced
considerably politically coming out
doing that as well as could be imagined
in circumstances that ended in 1877
it was a compact between the north and
south which essentially cleared the
South actually we're seeing that right
now in another form when the Roberts
Court action recording in history the
South that you can Steve Cindy where you
look and you want to keep blacks from
voting fine you figure out a way to do
it it's what they did when they
rescinded the little working going say
voting rights day right that happened in
1877 but much it introduced with sound a
couple slavery and another in fact a
better form from the point of view of
the Masters if you have slaves we have
to keep them alive if you get the
government to imprison them and then
when you you
any responsibility taxpayer keeps in the
life and that's what happened so the
steps apart from massacres and lynching
and so on and intimidate people the
South instituted procedures which
essentially you can send much much of
the especially male population to jail
that's up guys standing on a street
corner
my sheriff's can cut up and charge him
with vagrancy because the judge isn't
some client can't pay it goes to jail
next thing he's on a chain gang
and it over the steel company for
cheaper work perfectly before camp the
test somebody else pays for them that's
the basis for the Second Industrial
Revolution large order goes on until the
Second World War
pretty much I can remember that from
childhood black domestic workers
disappeared then off the Workmen's
manufacturing plant then comes a short
spear in the early system still operates
when blacks had a brief opportunity to
enter into the American life some order
work for black Ottawa good little money
in Sandusky knew that there were
problems well there was a lot of housing
federal housing development during the
early push for theory leather towns and
others that offered relatively
inexpensive housing to people like man I
was just talking about that he couldn't
apply because federal law required
segregation in public housing that
lasted until the late sixties liberal
people in Congress voted for they hated
it but they voted for it because there
was no other way to get any funding for
public house Southern Democrats had a
lock in the system they'd always be
voted the office
they had all the top Kevin challenger
they could block anything that
interfered with segregation they looked
finally in the late sixties that began
to dissolve under the civil rights
movement it's too late by then
stagnation begins as a neo pretty pretty
soon and the neoliberal policies begins
real wages for male workers are about
what they were in the nineteen seventies
and of course that makes it worse for
afro-american not going into further
detail we get up to today poverty
discrimination racism overwhelmingly
affect black people there the wind this
morning may have noticed the EPA's used
to be a reasonable organization is now
run by commercial interests under Trump
but just eliminated regulations that
require manufacturers fossil fuel
companies to reduce mercury pollution
who dies for mercury pollution people
who live near refineries manufacturing
installations it's not people like me I
live in the suburbs
it's people like afro-americans so
today's decision was in order to kill
black children okay let's be honest
that's what it was in order to do maybe
that's not in the minds of the
businessman who did it but if they're
capable of thinking for two minutes I
assume there's that much intelligence
they can see it wasn't exactly accurate
well that goes on to your question of
course this is gonna happen with people
who've had four hundred years of brutal
violent repression blocked at every turn
are now living in here not just poverty
but constant racism my black low lyric
and walking down the street dressed
better than I would
been arrested and asked for
identification season since the deal
chronic cases we all know okay that's
that's it this is one cases it's very
interesting thank you so much so what
kinds of drastic changes do you think we
need to see to address care disparity
can you prevent future of similar
problems quite a few and this I mean
what I just described it's obvious what
the changes are to be they're not
happening in the other direction as ever
there are groups like saved black lives
matter another who like Sanders gave an
opportunity group could happen but there
are lots of other things for some things
that are happening now a little bit or
shortly and I don't see anybody calm
anymore so let's talk about them take a
look at the Sanders campaign crossed
across the spectrum being criticized on
the right of course the obvious
criticism but as usual the more
interesting creations are on the Left
what's called the lift I mean the left
end of the mainstream spectrum common
mid liberal left the world commentators
in New York Times notice what they're
saying the same we think Sanders as
ideas are pretty good but the American
people aren't ready for them just let's
take that apart for a minute
what are Sanders is main proposals
universal health care free higher
college education that's too much for
the American people other countries
all of your pleasure every every major
country many others has some form of
universal health care right to the north
of us they have it for most countries
fact the ones who be best in educational
efforts have free higher public
education in Finland Germany just look
south of the border Mexico
poor country a lot of money for
facilities because the education system
is fine in fact I just got off my last
interview happened to be with the
college and Mexico has a very high
quality of Torre when all major
universities you free very high quality
so what these left commentators are
saying is the United States is such a
backward country but it can begin to
rise to the level of most other
countries reaching toward that's the
kind of condemnation of the society that
you might hear from its worst enemies
does anybody know
me certain kind of questions that should
be in people's mind well yes of course
these are the kinds of changes took
place we should rise to the level of
civilization and culture all over most
other societies but we can surely do way
better than that after all this is the
richest country in the world
it has incomparable advantages no other
country has anything like the internal
resources material or other homogeneous
country fly from Boston to Los Angeles
you think you're in the same country
when you get out slightly different
action may be warmer but there's no
place like that anywhere and we can't be
a such a dysfunctional political and
economic system that we can't even rise
to the level of other countries surely
that can be used
very interesting yes and so the
President of the United States is
talking about reopening the economy soon
do you think that this rush to reopen
the world economies is the wish of the
rich at the expense of the working class
and the poor well I don't consider
myself a specialist I rely on the
scientists in the experts they're almost
uniform and saying that this will be
devastating for poor and working people
which is already happening today who are
the people exposing themselves today
not me on my stage I considered home two
things by the internet but what about
the guys who were working on groceries
for packaging the thingses I can order
on the phone what's happening to the bus
driver
are they expressed in fact just take
even privileged people doctors and
nurses I mean they're incredible what
they're doing they have to make the
working out of front lines
without protection why without
protection
because of their malevolence of the
people in the government it's exactly
true mince words january/february
perfectly well known there's a endemic
what was the White House doing exporting
ventilators and masks and other
equipment to China and in other places
try to improve this in trade balance
look better for the election that's just
the tip of an iceberg it goes all the
way back I mean why do we have a
pandemic in the first place so that sort
of mother could run away there's not
very well at that time the pandemic is
coming kept regularly that's probably
for runnable ever spend any scientists
are saying that the much vilified World
Health Organization was saying like his
latest lists
timber the World Health Organization
issued the warning to the developed
rental companies mainly development to
prepare for an oncoming whenever okay
perfectly well-known why didn't it
happen and three reasons first
capitalist market failure ordinary
capitalist failure somebody's got to
pick up the ball and run with it what
about drug companies they have the
facilities the will very wealthy because
of the gifts we lavish on them doing
today did they do it no more consumers
were wrong
you don't like profit by preparing for a
pandemic it's going to destroy the
society than somebody else's reasons
that well the government could step in
the way we play the way we eradicated
polio program initiated play Roseville
funded by the government
so I'll coax him talk insisted he didn't
free with note that that was in the days
of more regimented capitalism but
remember in Ronald Reagan in his
inaugural speech government is the
problem not the solution he didn't make
it up he was being handed the word the
people who handed them the words know
what that means that means take
decisions away from the government which
is flawed because it's under some public
influence and decisions over these two
institutions which don't have that floor
private corporations tyrannies which are
unaccountable to the public that's
what's called Liberty in the United
States world libertarian so if you do
that then the government is sidelined
Clinton had it too severely goes on so
when you get to the early days of the
coronavirus the Democrats type in there
the problem well then comes the
neoliberal flake and it is another
hammer blow which strengthen which I
actually just described not just we
can't follow market signals but the
government can't stay
then come something special to the
United States happens to me in the hands
of associate that's manic sociopath
I'm not mincing words I'm telling I just
might tell the truth fact from Trump
during his four years in office has
steadily defunded the Center for Disease
Control and other health-related parts
of the government this is well the
pandemic warnings are coming that's good
when the warnings come first of all II
in the administration didn't pay any
attention they now they blame the world
hillford they're the ones to blame
wasn't until March that from something
actually penetrated well he was instead
of playing golf and watching his TV
ratings he heard somebody on Fox News
saying there's a vendetta my face if he
said something weighted they meanwhile
he came out with a federal budget every
tenth missile of the pandemic take a
look at the federal budget further cuts
in the Center for Disease Control and
other health related parts of the
government
increase in the subsidies to fossil
fuels which are going to destroy us and
of course increases with the military
and its famous wool what's the name for
this
I mean sociopath that's strong I don't
think so
you put those three things together you
get the situation we're in now countries
in East Asia listened and when China
gave out all the information in early
January was old ear sequence the genome
they listened they did something about
it they're in pretty good shape some of
them very good trait
I like Taiwan you're just kind of slow
on the uptake but they finally got
started then comes the United States the
outlier did nothing it's now the only
country in the world that can't even
provide data to the World Health
Organization infection deaths
that's ricki dysfunction to do that and
of course it shows it's the center it's
the epicenter of the pandemic way more
death that deaths perimeter retailer
nowhere else and every day if I'd had
more like people were thousands of
pilgrims died nobody knows that's the
result of three hammer glues capitalist
logic neoliberalism when a gang of
sociopaths running the place so that's
what happens some wolf nature could have
been stopped and if we want to protect
ourselves from the next pandemic zone
certainly coming we've got a sink
through these things and remedy them or
else we'll be in much deeper truth that
meanwhile a lot of people into
we can't really plan for the future now
we have to take care of this urgent
problem everybody in the act is some
people aren't listening there are people
who pursue class war relentlessly never
stop make use of every opportunity doing
it right now like the EPA regulations
this morning let's make sure to make the
future world as dangerous as possible
for poor and working people and in fact
for everybody with more subsidies for
fossil fuels same thing there they're
working hard they know they don't relax
right now take a look at the stimulus
bill huge stimulus bill five hundred
billion dollars is being given under the
supervision of Donald Trump that is you
know it's a sycophant are they gonna
expose Congress pass this legislation
are they gonna pay any attention to them
who's going to do anything is food are
they going on Peacham so they'll do
whatever they want and we can see what's
happening right now
so I say take the airline industry it's
bleeding for fifty billion dollars why
does it need fifty billion dollars take
a look
after the financial crisis profits were
booming did they use them to improve
surface to improve the business no they
use them on stock buybacks stock
buybacks or market interference which
inflates the stock value benefits the
wealthy shareholders shoots the salaries
of and stock options of the management
into the stratosphere forty five billion
dollars they spent on that that's what
they're not asking for is it possible in
the stimulus bill to put in a condition
saying no more stock options if you get
a cent from us it's not only possible
it's easy
was the law until wrong Ravens no
suck-up can do it was illegal Treasury
Department enforced it there weren't any
same with tax havens none before Reagan
was illegal Treasury Department enforced
it now it's tens of trillions of dollars
robbed from people like you would mean
is could we go back to those conditions
when I talked before about rising to the
level of other countries
how about rising to the level of the
United States pre Reagan none can be
done it's not terribly utopian many more
things to be added there could be
kitchen conditionalities in the stimulus
saying you got to put workers on your
management board to represent the
interests of the working class you have
to maintain a living wage not just a
minimum wage you talk about a $15 an
hour minimum wage that's a bit of a joke
that's a few ticket races the minimum
wage through the period pre
neoliberalism neoliberalism before the
neoliberal plea the minimum wage tracked
gross domestic product and productivity
then it breaks stays flat which means it
reduces because of inflation if the
minimum wage had increased as it did up
til the late 70s probably about $25 an
hour now so put a condition on saying
you have to have a livable wage for your
workforce and not just for your
workforce also for the precariat the
precarious workforce that one of the
contributions of neoliberalism has been
of course the destroy unions which
enable people who get some bright but
also to shift the workforce so that most
of it is precarious you could cold if
they want you know you're not on a
regular salary it's called the economy
the precarious economy those people
don't get anything
from these stimulus the amount forwards
large part of the Econo
and you can go on from there like take
number we certainly should rise to the
level of having the universal health
care like other countries and also
unemployment insurance like the
unemployment figure here
skyrocketing in the united states right
nothing like that l super because they
have fixed regulations which keep people
employed you pay for it
if there's some reason they can't work
they put them on part-time keep them
employed and part of the enterprise my
feeling that's nowhere near enough if
you just take those put that aside
keeping the basic system that it is
there are things that can be done right
away that can make it far better and
more humane and it's so scary to see the
rates of unemployment it's really really
terrifying and definitely this country
should have been more prepared so so we
are used to big societal gathered social
excuse me they're used to big social
gatherings like birthday parties
concerts and even going to the movies or
theater do you think the virus will mean
a permanent change to the American Way
of life can't it will make a change
question is what kind of change as I
mentioned there's a group right now
working to institute the kind of change
they want more repression more profit
for the privileged worse conditions for
working people deaths for black children
they're doing it right now
question is are there going to be
counter forces take a look at Bernie
Sanders is mister roelle speech the very
end of the speech he said this campaign
is
for now the movement is going on that's
the crucial message we're kind of
trained to think that our role in the
political world is to to show up every
four years and push a lever and then
somebody else that's not the way it
should work either all the time pressing
working things civil rights see some
some people are fighting all the time
but we have to do it too and it's got to
be done on international scale there's
it's very hard to find much of any
coherence in the Creepshow in the white
house if there's some things happening
and they're quite important so in the
international level the trumpet maneuver
maybe Trump doesn't know it to people
and we're doing any thinking his
administration are doing something very
significant there can truck construct
carefully constructing a reactionary
international headed by the white house
encompassing the most reactionary states
in the world Middle East the Gulf
dictatorships Egypt under the worst
dictatorship has ever had Israel which
is so far to the right you need to tell
us what to see moving on to India under
the control of a fanatic
Hindu nationalist it's trying to destroy
secular democracy and India's pressure
in Kashmir hundreds of millions of
Muslims under severe threat he'll be
part of it
that guys like urban and Hungary is
turning it into dictatorship solve any
and it
great joy and life is helping people
fleeing from misery and Africa to drive
to Rio in the Mediterranean
that'll be thee any other guys like it
elsewhere that's the International run
by the White House now there is another
one being formed Bernie Sanders and
Yanis varoufakis
fine economists in Europe have called
for with a little aggressive
international just want to have its
first conference in November yeah based
on partly on things like the Sanders
movement here around the very important
movement that focus initiated in Europe
the m25 in school which is a europe-wide
movement to try to save what's a value
in the European Union and get rid of the
 that's rotten well has it's a
popular based movement bringing in
people from the global south
we see some global zone that can form on
the international level but we are
fighting to do on the domestic level to
try to overcome this malignancy and go
back to some kind of functioning decent
Society let's go on from there
