do you believe as the US intelligence
community and plenty of us investigative
journalists have pointed out that Russia
tried to undermine the US election
through hacking through leaking through
deliberate disinformation that's
possible but it's a kind of strange
complaint in the United States the US
has been interfering with an undermining
electioned all over the world for
decades and is proud of it so yes maybe
maybe they're doing it too
