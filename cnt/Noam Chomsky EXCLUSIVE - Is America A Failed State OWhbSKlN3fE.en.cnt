[Music]
so it is truly an honor to get to
introduce you to
our next guest i'm excited i think
you'll be excited too
one of the most cited public
intellectuals of our time professor
emeritus at mit
historian author political activist
scholar
noam chomsky great to have you professor
so great to speak with you
glad to be with you um so there's so
many things that we could
talk about but i was wondering if you
could start by
putting this moment that we're all
living through in a little bit of
context i mean we have this unbelievable
pandemic
we have a racial unrest and uprisings
across the country
we have a great depression we have the
existential threat of climate change and
so many more things that we're living
through right now
how does this compare to other things
that you've lived through
or that you've studied help us put this
in context
this is a unique moment in history in
human history not just my lifetime
we're living at a point of confluence
of severe crises
there's another one that you didn't
mention equally severe
the increasing threat of terminal
nuclear war
so nuclear war destruction of the
environment
raging pandemic others likely to come
unless we
prepare for them uh innumerable problems
internal to the country uh visa there's
never been a moment in human history
where
such a confluence of crises emerged
and the decisions about them have to be
made
very soon they cannot be delayed
nuclear war could break out at any time
or the
we've lived under the shadow of nuclear
war for
75 years those familiar with the record
that i must be aware that it's a near
miracle that we've escaped
when president trump has is
systematically
dismantling the protections that
offered some defense against nuclear war
while the
leading experts like uh william perry
former secretary of defense
person not given to exaggeration very
conservative period bill informed about
these issues
argues that the threat is now greater
than during the cold war
when it was extremely dangerous
environmental catastrophe is approaching
we will emerge somehow from the pandemic
at a terrible cost and mostly needless
cost
particularly in countries like the
united states which are
off the international spectrum and
efforts to control it
but we will emerge we will not emerge
from the melting of the polar ice sheets
that's permanent it's going to have a
permanent effect
we can go on but there are a few decades
left
in which we can make a decision as to
whether
organized human life will survive on
earth
or will succumb to the threat of
environmental disaster
again the united states under president
trump
is virtually alone in the world
in pushing the accelerator to erase the
disaster
other countries are doing but there's
something not enough for
something the united states along with a
few
outliers elsewhere is trying to
escalate the crisis the pandemic
is severe much worse here than in
most other countries take a look back at
say late march of this year of the
united states and europe for
comparable almost identical and
low-level
cases and deaths since then the
curve for europe has gone way down many
fewer
many countries are opening up partially
opening up
uh the pandemic is more or less under
control
and the united states has gotten worse
and there are other countries that are
doing much better countries of east asia
oceania new zealand australia south
korea
taiwan much better so it can be dealt
with
but furthermore apart from this pandemic
we can be pretty confident that others
might come
uh scientists who've been warning about
this one for years
overwhelming majority of them are now
warning
that others more severe may come unless
we prepare for them if those
preparations are not being made
then there are the internal problems
inside the country so we are
at a unique moment either
we will decide all of those decisions
will be made in a few weeks
but within the next decade or two we
will decide
whether our grandchildren their
grandchildren will have a world in which
human beings can survive
there's never been a moment in history
where those just
had to be made so yes this moment is
unique
and with the pandemic i mean this has
hit no one's been exempt right not here
not around the world
and so we've kind of had a real time
test of which countries were able to
effectively deal with this
and best protect their citizens and
which weren't and as you
accurately point out the united states
has utterly failed on this measurement
both in terms of keeping citizens safe
from
illness and death but also in terms of
protecting their
economic well-being during this period a
lot of people have started to use the
term failed state
just because there's been such a failure
on every level of government response
starting of course of the at the white
house with president trump
do you think that that's an accurate
characterization of what we're seeing
here
well if we want to characterize what
we're seeing and we want to
prevent the next pandemic i assume we
want to present it now
we have to ask why we're having a
pandemic all together
a very serious question you should think
about it look at it closely
so in 2003 it was a sars
epidemic that's another coronavirus
uh it was contained but scientists knew
at the time that another one was coming
they warned about it that you got to get
prepared for it
explained how to get prepared for it
same things that are being said now
the knowledge was there actions weren't
taken
who could take the actions well the
first
the group that comes to mind is the the
drug companies
they have huge profits uh
wonderful laboratories but they're
blocked
they're blocked by something called
capitalist logic
which says your goal is to make
profits tomorrow not to prepare
for something a couple of years down the
road
that you won't make that much profits
from anyway
vaccine you use once you know so you
want to
do things that are still i think of
tomorrow
so their health the other possibilities
to cover
again enormous resources wonderful
laboratories
but they're blocked by something called
neoliberalism
you may recall when ronald reagan
was inaugurated 40 years ago multiple
speech
famously said the government is the
problem
not the solution translating that into
english
it means decisions have to be taken
out of the hands of government which is
partially
responsive to popular
citizens to its own citizens placed in
the hands of
private unaccountable enterprises
which you can have no effect so that's
and that's the world has been suffering
under that for 40 years
many ways one of the ways is government
was blocked from picking up the ball and
running with it
well there still were things you could
do but when
president obama was elected the first
few days in office
he called a meeting of the presidential
the
scientific advisory council passed
forward
and said h w bush first bus
and asked them to prepare
a pandemic preparation program
came back a couple of weeks later with a
detailed program as to how to deal with
a pandemic
when it arrives put into place
there were programs of american
scientists
working with chinese colleagues to
discover and study new coronaviruses
all over the caves of china
dangerous important work
simulations undertaken of
what to do in case of strike some of
these regulators
october 2019 so there at least was
something in place
not enough then came january
2017 president trump came into office
first few days in office he dismantled
the whole system
initially and started moving to end the
programs
with science us scientists working with
chinese colleagues
began to try to defund the fund
the center for disease control and other
health-related components of government
every
year's budget has tried to do the same
most recent one was february 2020
this february pandemic is raging
budget proposal comes to the white house
cut
back more on the center for disease
control
and other health-related components
building
uh the united states was singularly
unprepared on january 10th
the chinese government released the
little science chinese scientists said
she had discovered the source of the
epidemic identified the virus
sequenced the genome presented the
information to the entire world
through the word health organization the
countries that
cared about their citizens active
east asian oceania mostly
from south korea to vietnam new zealand
to australia
very quickly and have the situation very
much under control
as china itself pretty much does
europe delayed somewhat but then
got into the act he got to work with
germany
norway and others have done situation
pretty much under control
even italy which had a huge pandemic has
gotten it under control then there's the
united states
not you couldn't us intelligence was
trying to get information to the white
house
warning them what was happening with no
interest
the answer was one central disease
control
and finally in march uh trump took
notice
probably because the stock market is
declining
um then since then it's been chaotic
uh one thing after motive fire
the chief scientist in charge of vaccine
carriage
right in the midst of it and then fire
him because
he said some things that trump didn't
like about one of his
black medicine he asked the
responsibility that the states if they
don't have the resources
to come from the federal government let
the states
take responsibility so therefore if
anything goes wrong i can blame someone
else
and it's something by accident works i
can take credit for it
that's the reason uh break up the
programs that are working with
chinese scientists because it's
necessary
to try to cast blame on someone else
for the tragedy of killing by now about
175 000 americans
i think that's the beginning of the
country
have to blame someone else to blame the
world health open speech
let's show them kill lots of people in
africa and yemen and others who rely on
the world
of translation for survival for many
diseases
and now they have the situation
so let's blame that blame anybody as
long as it deflects attention
from the villains who are responsible
right
in the white house that's what we're
living with
and if we decide we want to live with
this for another four years
maybe too late to run it already
there are indications that uh
science journal saying that perhaps the
greenland
which has a huge quality of ice
perhaps greenland but i smelt in
greenland
is moving towards a tipping point there
will be a relationship reversal
i don't want to be placed vastly more
even
in the glaciers that you can
split off
increasing intensity of storms hurricane
wild weather events exactly as predicted
heating taking place and we'll get much
worse
so that's
there are ways to deal with every single
one of these problems
well within our capacity but they have
to be done
professor i wanted to ask you about the
the future of the
american left obviously many were
demoralized by
bernie sanders second loss this time
around and so there's this
open debate about what the right path is
for do you try again to have this sort
of political revolution
within the democratic party to kick out
the neoliberals
do you start an entirely new third party
there's a new effort underway with the
people's party to start
something new working class focused from
scratch
which way do you think is the most
likely to succeed
and then do you think that it's um
possible
to influence and move a biden
administration if he does in fact win
the presidency
all we can say is that assuming he's
elected it better be possible
or else we're in serious trouble but yes
i think it is possible in fact we've
seen evidence of it already
biden the slogan that i think we should
hold up and follow is get rid of the
trump malignancy which will destroy us
and then challenge the democratic party
establishment
challenged blind biden keep defeat to
the fire
public popular pressure popular activism
the engagement of the sanders movement
and popular groups like sunrise movement
in the
planning of the program have in fact
shifted the
democratic party program uh
well towards the it's called here the
left
social democratic side farther than any
uh
previously any person any
presidential candidate in recent memory
way beyond
clinton court obama
now the point is can you keep keep the
fade to the fire
can you continue with the pressures and
the activism that has forced them to
move to the left
the dnc the democratic national
committee that are like
they're trying to block their clintonite
neoliberals more or less what used to be
called moderate republicans
before the republican party went way off
the spectrum
and they don't like it we can see it so
for example both
wyden and kamala harris
had calls for an end to subsidies for
fossil fuel industries
the dnc canceled they didn't want that
they want to want to alienate the donor
class
and these struggles will continue so the
question
if you ask people or the answer the
answer is in the hands of
people like you are you going to keep
pressing them
to do what they ought to do
or will we let them go the way that
private power will drive
the whole question prices all the time
there's no
prediction it's a matter of action not
speculation
it can be moved we've seen it we've seen
it before in the past
old enough to remember pretty well the
great depression
uh 1929 it
devastating to the couple the
labor movement had been crushed in the
1920s
mostly by woodrow wilson's redskins
there's nothing there but a couple of
years finally years live
in 1934 the
cio organizing labor actions
lots of other political actions
fairly sympathetic administration and it
was possible to
get things in hand to establish the
systems that we've benefited from ever
since
ranging from things like the tva
tennessee valley authority which greatly
improved the lives of
people in populations ranging from that
to social security
to workers some degree
of some but anyway had it
kind of under control it lived under
that system
plenty of floors lots of
fairly decent until 40 years ago
when the neoliberal assault began
with quite predictable results
when you shift power into the hands of
decision corporate chapter that's the
one
rules that the goals maximize profit
their concern is not the welfare of the
population
well professor thank you so much for
giving us so much of your time
today um i'm truly honored to get to
speak with you
and we really really are grateful for
you your thoughts and your time
thank you we'll have more rising for you
after this
