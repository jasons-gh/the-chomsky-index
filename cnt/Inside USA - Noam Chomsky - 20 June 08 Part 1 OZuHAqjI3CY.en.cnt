in the world of academia he is the most
cited author alive when you look at the
all-time most quoted list his name is up
there with Plato Floyd and the Bible
he's written well over 200 books been
translated in more than 50 languages his
name is no on chomp and he's my guest on
this special edition of inside new SS
I'd like to start by talking about the
the presidential election campaign in
writing about the last election in 2004
you called America system a fake
democracy in which the public is hardly
more than an irrelevant onlooker and
you've been arguing in your work in the
last year or so that the candidates this
time around are considerably to the
right of public opinion on all major
issues so the question is do Americans
have any legitimate hope of change this
time around and what's the difference in
dynamic between America's presidential
cup 2008 versus 2004 2010 TSA's and the
differences are quite enlightening in
fact i should say however that i'm
expressing a very conventional thought
so eighty percent of the population
thinks that read the words of the polls
that the government is run by a few big
interests looking out for themselves not
for the population ninety-five percent
of the public thinks the government
ought to pay some attention to public
opinion but doesn't as far as the
elections are concerned and forget the
exact figure but i think by about three
to one people wish that the elections
were about issues not you know marginal
character you know qualities and so on
so I'm right in the mainstream it's not
as usual about unusual position that
there is some interesting differences
between 2004 and 2008 and they're very
revealing its kind of striking that the
commentators don't pick it up because
it's a transparent it the main domestic
issue for years you know way at the top
of the polls decades in fact is the
health system which is understandable to
total disaster the last election debate
in 2004 was on domestic issues late
october two thousand four and the new
york times the next day had an accurate
description of it it said that John
Kerry was on a brain up any
government involvement in health care
because it has so little political
support at just the large majority of
the population but what he meant is and
he's right it was not supported by the
pharmaceutical industry wasn't supported
by the financial institutions and so on
let's go to this election 2008 this
election the Democratic candidates all
have programs that are not what the
public's asking for but approaching it
you know and could even turn into it so
what happened between 2004 and 2008 it's
not a shift in public opinion that's the
same as it was what happened is that a
big segment of segment of American
corporate power is being so harmed by
the health care system that they want to
changed namely manufacturing industry so
for example General Motors says that it
costs them I think maybe fifteen hundred
dollars more to produce a car in Detroit
then right across the border in Windsor
Canada just because there was more
sensible healthcare system there well
when a big segment of Corporate America
shifts its position then it becomes
politically possible and it has
political support so therefore you can
begin to talk about it but those aren't
those aren't changes coming from a
pressure from below you're saying public
is the same it's been saying the same
for decades but the public is irrelevant
is understood to be irrelevant what
matters is a few big interests looking
out for themselves exactly what the
public sees and yet you can see people
agitating against the official story
even within the electoral process where
there is there is definitely a new mood
in America and a restlessness among
populations who are going to political
rallies in unprecedented numbers and
what do you make of this well branded
phenomenon of Hope which is obviously
part marketing but is it not also part
something else well that's where
mama he has his way presents himself for
his party management handlers presented
him as basically the kind of a blank
slate which you can write whatever you
like and there are a few slogans hope
unity changed change you know hope unity
change now write down whatever you like
there and it does arouse enthusiasm and
you can understand why I mean again
about like eighty percent of the
population thinks the country is going
the wrong way it's been a for most
people in the United States the last 30
years have been pretty grim on this rich
country so you know it's not like living
in southern Africa Africa but wait for
the majority of the population real
wages have stagnated or declined for
about 30 years has been growth but it's
going the wealth is going to the very
few pockets benefits which were never
very great have declined work hours have
greatly increased and there isn't
anything much to show for it other than
kind of maybe staying kind of staying
afloat you know and there is tremendous
dissatisfaction with institutions I mean
there's a lot of talk about bush's very
low poll ratings which is correct but
people sometimes overlook the fact that
Congress as Paul ratings are even lower
in fact all institutions are almost all
all or just are not trusted and on
dislike there's a sense everything's
going wrong so when somebody says hope
change unity and kind of talks
eloquently nice little guy and so on
yeah fine if the elite strategy for
managing the electorate is to ignore the
will of the people as you interpret it
through polling data essentially and to
carry on with a constructed conversation
what is the what is an actual
progressive vision of changing the
American electoral system is it election
finance is it is it third-party activism
we have models right in front of us like
takes a Bolivia poorest country in South
America I mean they had a democratic
election a couple of years ago which you
can't even dream of in the West it's
kind of interesting but it's not
discussed I mean this is a real
democratic election the large majority
of the population became organized and
active for the first time in history and
elected someone from their own ranks on
crucial issues which they all knew about
control of resources Cultural Rights is
just as really serious issues for them
where they didn't just do it on Election
Day pushing a button I've been
struggling about these things for years
you know they couple years before this
they managed to drive Bechtel and the
World Bank out of the country when they
were trying to privatize water it was a
pretty harsh struggle a lot of people
killed well it they reached a point
where they finally could could manifest
this through the electoral system they
didn't have to change the electoral laws
they had to change the way the public
acts and that's the poorest country in
South America actually if we look at the
poorest country in the hemisphere Haiti
same thing happened in nineteen ninety
well you know if peasants and Bolivia
and haiti can do this too ridiculous to
say that we can't you know as the
conversation about us politics
inevitably draws us out to the rest of
the world let me just take a quick break
and when we come back I want to talk
about the rest of the world we'll take a
break we'll be right back with more of
my conversation with noam chomsky
