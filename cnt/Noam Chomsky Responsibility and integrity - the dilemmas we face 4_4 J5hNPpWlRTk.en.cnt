buttons are treated roughly the same
time in the from the biblical records we
discover that there were dissidents and
they weren't called that they weren't
called intellectuals they were called
prophets it's a bad translation of a
very obscure Hebrew word nobody knows
what it means but they're called
prophets but if you look back if you
read the Bible what they what they were
was what we would call visit and
intellectuals they were carrying out geo
political analysis warning that the the
Kings were you know carrying out actions
like alienating the Assyrians and so on
which were going to cause disaster they
were calling for mercy and justice to
widows and orphans they were condemning
the crimes of the evil king and so on
were they treated nicely well you know
go back to the Bible and take a look
they were called haters of Israel that's
the origin of the phrase a self-hating
Jew which you hear all the time extends
to anti-american you know meaning
critics of your own country and its they
were driven into the desert you know
imprisoned not treated nicely at all
there were intellectuals who were
treated very well and honored they were
they were also called prophets a
centuries later they were called false
prophets but they were the flatterers
the court and they were doing fine and
that's the way it works flatters at the
court are honored and respected the
critics are punished one way or another
how they're punished depends on the
society but always treated badly in one
way or another it can be at the extreme
it can be like the assassin assassinated
Jesuits
lesser punishment could be see the hovel
and softer of and similarly all the way
back this is a very persistent theme of
in history you can think it through and
see if you can find exact counter
examples actually there are a few
counter examples and they're very
striking so today in today's world the
only really significant counter examples
that I know of at least are in Turkey in
Turkey leading intellectuals the
prominent writers the most prominent
writers academics journalists publishers
and artists not on your protesting
constantly the crimes of the Turkish
state to preserve not only protesting
that those crimes but constantly
participating in civil disobedience
against them which means facing
sometimes enduring really severe
punishment like long jail sentences I
don't have any other country like this
and i have to say when i come to europe
i always have to smile a little when i
hear that the Turks are not civilized
enough to be allowed into the August
European Union I mean maybe but from
another point of view it looks a little
bit different but that's the only major
exception that I know today so there are
exceptions undoubtedly well that's one
interpretation of the responsibility of
intellectuals what's the general task
that they fulfill the factual side
there's also the value issue there you
have two factual side you just you can
study the facts and draw pretty
conclusions with fair confidence when
you turn to the values of course you're
asking what your own moral values are
and I think there are a number of pretty
simple ideas that ought to define what
the role of intellectuals oughta be by
intellectuals I just mean people of
relative privilege training resources
opportunity an ability it be in a
position where you can get involved in
some fashion and affairs that matter to
human beings so it's intellectuals it
excludes for example of pretty
scientists who just stays in his
laboratory and you know means his Nobel
Prize it excludes somebody who is
working so hard putting food on the
table that it just doesn't have time to
think about these things but it includes
in our societies like ours a large group
of other people for example anybody
related to a university anyhow because
we have these privileges and opportunity
so that's roughly the category at one
principle that you think would be
obvious is that we apply to ourselves
the same standards we apply to others or
maybe harsher wants more stringent ones
but at least the same ones so if terror
is bad when they do to us then terror is
bad when we do it to them maybe 10 times
as much and that's again to take a
historical example if anyone were to
follow this principle that takes a 911
you know great modern event that changed
the world transformed the world it was a
terrible atrocity undoubtedly could have
been a lot worse very much like how else
punishment could have been worse so
suppose on 911 that al-qaeda had saved
mom the White House killed the president
installed a military dictatorship
murdered thousands of people tortured
tens of thousands of people established
an international terror Center in
Washington which started overthrowing
governments in other countries and
installing comparable dictatorships
securing out assassinations abroad and
so on brought in a group of economists
you know maybe call them the Kandahar
boys who quickly tanked the economy that
drove it into the worst depression it
had been in maybe in its entire history
okay that would have been worse it
happened on 911 that happened on 911
1973 that's the overthrow of the end a
government in Chile and the installation
the Pinochet dictatorship was a lot
worse in fact in Latin America they
often call it the first 911 it was a
comparably worse than what we call 911
by any dimension you can think of with
that one and it certainly changed the
world it was instrumental in causing the
rash of dictatorships that spread over
Latin American and much else not to
speak of what it did to the people of
Chile but that's not in history if we
were to accept the elementary principle
that the usual defect wrong agency us
was behind the if we were to accept the
principle that we apply to our self the
same standards we do to others that's
the way we'd be discussing and teaching
and thinking about the atrocities of 911
needless to say it's not though it is in
parts of South America the victims tend
to have a somewhat more realistic view
of the world than the ones who hold the
clubs the so one principle is at least
supply to yourselves the same standards
you do not apply to others and it sounds
simple that almost never observed
another is to set priorities you know we
all have finite energy and time can't do
everything so try to focus on the things
that are important what are importance
of course is another value judgment so
what's important well one criterion for
importance is things that you can
influence so if there's something going
on somewhere where you can have an
influence well that's important to focus
on may be nice to criticize the crimes
of Genghis Khan but you can't do much
about it and the same is true of crimes
carried out by somebody else now you can
see how awful it is but nothing much you
can do on the other hand crimes in which
you're involved yourselves you can do
quite a lot the closer you are to agency
the more you can do so that should be
the focus well I won't run through
examples I leave it as an exercise but
you'll find that exactly the opposite is
done exactly the opposite in fact you
can pretty well determine what the role
of intellectuals ought to be by taking a
look at what is going on and just
turning it to the opposite comes out
it's pretty turns out to be a pretty
successful technique of analysis so
that's another thing you can do other
things you can do are to participate in
changing the your own surroundings you
know as much as the societies you can
reach in such ways that these values
will be accepted whether it's by
teaching by organizing by activism many
other ways I just end by citing an
injunction by which which often is used
to formulate these principles which I
think merits some critical attention
it's a precept used by people who
personally are close friend and who I
respect and honor a lot a Quaker act
just at quaker human rights anti-war
activists very courageous people also
involved in civil disobedience protests
very dedicated picking the right
principles their precept is that they
should be telling truth to power that I
think that's that's the one thing I
really disagree with them on I don't
think that the role of people with some
degree of privilege say like us should
be to tell truth to power one reason is
power or he knows the truth you don't
tell it to them they understand it very
well that's why they're doing what
they're doing another is that they're
not the righted so they're not the right
audience you should be reaching people
who don't know the truth tell them
furthermore you shouldn't be telling
them a you should it's not that we have
some you know I you whoever it is has
some kind of magic authority we have our
own ideas they have their ideas in 1975
for example the large majority of
Americans I think knew the truth that
the war was not a mistake it was
fundamentally wrong a tomorrow you'd
have to tell them the truth you can
participate with them and failing at
finding out the truth learning it
yourself charging them to think it
through for themselves so you should be
reaching out to other people trying to
learn the truth as best you can together
with them and it should be the audience
that matters not the powerful and it
should be on issues that are
significance so I think is somewhat more
complex version of that precept ought to
be adopted but the basic the intuition
behind it is right and I think it's a
sensible guide and from that we can
they'll kind of work out what the
responsibility of intellectuals ought to
be comparing it with what the function
actually is and drawing appropriate
conclusions and I'll stop there
