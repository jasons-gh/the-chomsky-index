we set up my purse canario global level
where we can see the calyx in the over
cover and the common people don't lose
laughing or anything common people yeah
all the common people won't able to do
anything because the media calls the
blackboard shows anyway and that's a
movement we have the activists and what
can we do well what's the difference
between the internet communications and
the direct action well first of all the
the role of a cure this is not just
direct action I'm direct action has its
place but the direct action by direct
action you mean like sort of
penetrations or breaking windows or
whatever that has its place but its its
role as education it is tactic it's
either good or bad in itself this is the
tactic and it's a tactic that you carry
our tactics are judged by their
consequences ok they don't have any
intrinsic value now you ask them they're
good tactic so they lead to good
consequences otherwise they're bad
tactic but direct action in itself is
not a has no value if it is a way of
leading to good consequence at the other
side well what are the consequences on
the consequences are education and
organization that's the point of any
kind of activism sometimes direct action
may be a way to do it
maybe harm that's what you have asked
what about other techniques like
consciousness-raising groups or you know
working wherever you happen to be to try
to get people organized to take control
of their own little part of the world
whatever it may be in the workplace or a
community or family or anything else
well that's another kind of activism and
organizing groups that join the world
social forum as and other kinds planning
on this difference in different
countries but in the United States one
crucial and important kind of activism
is simply anti-corporate activism for
the first time ever in the United States
and it's important this is the
beginnings of a movement to try to
dismantle corporations and their
illegitimate institutions they have no
right to exist and their control is very
fragile they know you know they it's in
principle easy to paypal emanate them
and dismantle them they understand it
and a large part of the corporate effort
to appear benevolent you know giveaway
she throws to the poor and the sort of
thing is an effort to make sure that the
population that you can read it in court
decisions they advise them to act
benevolent so that an aroused population
will not take away their rights which
are official right well you know for the
first time there's the beginnings of
some kind of consciousness about that
and groups organizing to do something
about it and little parts of the country
which are preventing corporations from
functioning and so on those could grow
into very powerful movements I mean it's
much more important in the United States
Senate Hungary just because of their
role in the international economy but
simpler things can happen angler well
what's the right choice what we're back
to that question again
that depends on an assessment of
circumstances of the conditions which
you live on your own self examination
what are you willing to do but there
there's no reason why which kind of the
common people everybody can't be
organized on these topics and people
have interests and concerns and mostly
it's the same interests and concerns
people do feel helpless but they're made
to feel helpless as a major effort to
make them feel helpless and they really
aren't you know there are plenty of
controls but controls can be dismantled
and overthrown I mean after all looking
single at the last century okay at the
beginning of the last century under
yours directly there were several forms
of totalitarianism that were beginning
to develop okay one of them with fascism
one was Bolshevism and a third is
corporations there are all forms of
totalitarian if I could come from the
same intellectual roots they all come
from newegg alien ideas about the rights
of the organizations over the rights of
individuals and in fact progressives
support at all you know supported
corporatism sporting Bolshevism and
sport of fascism mostly in particularly
plenty of the price of sport because
they all believe in the same ideas well
of those three forms of totalitarianism
to have been overcome the third has
extended but the third is the weakest of
all I mean it's held together just by
propaganda not by force they don't have
torture chambers you know they don't
secret police that plenty of modes of
control but it's much more fragile and
there's no reason why the general
population
can overthrow those the third but of
course you have to be aware of it in the
first place people are aware and then
you've got to begin to act whatever
scale you can act and put turn into
major social movements well that would
be a social revolution
