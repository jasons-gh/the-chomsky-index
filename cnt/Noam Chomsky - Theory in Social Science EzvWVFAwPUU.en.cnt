it sounds as if your work draws a lot on
CW males marks and Immanuel Wallerstein
thinking and I'm wondering what's new
and exciting about Chomsky in theory so
for us students are the social sciences
in the room what can we take away from
this lecture yeah
well certainly not I mean especially
first of all there's no theory in fact I
don't know of any theories in the social
sciences I mean I don't think the term
theory should be applied to fields as
intellectually thin as the social
sciences there's just some common sense
observations I started off with you
remember by saying that views of this
kind are commonly described as Marxist
which is kind of ironic because the
clearest articulation is people like
Adam Smith and Winston Churchill and so
on which is true the and I think that
most of this is kind of common sense so
there's no what's the point
oh the theory is very different from
understanding most of our lives
we live our lives often pretty
successfully without any theories about
other people and we don't have any
theories about other people you know we
get along and manage our interactions
and so on there's very few areas of
human life where there's anything you
might call a theory so some areas like
even in biology you know it would be but
when you get very far beyond big
molecules I mean starts to become pretty
descriptive sure there's an in this in
the world of human affairs I don't think
there's much in the way of theory I
think the message you go to take is use
your use your sense look at history you
know think of obvious things you know
break through the propaganda images
remember that the institutions are
trying to indoctrinate you keep that in
mind compensate for it and if you do
these things I think you can get as good
a sense of the world as anybody has
thank you
