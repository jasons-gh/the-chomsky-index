what seeing a massive division you know
between the left and the right and
obviously protests on the street or
America but the last question I asked to
you what do you think is the solution to
this problem or how could we move
forward in the next 10 years and not see
such division such anger such violence
first of all there's very little
violence but there is some so to give
you an example I don't know if it was
reported in England about a week or two
ago there was a small village in Ohio
Bethel Ohio she won't look it up village
of about 2,000 people that couple of
dozen young people decided to have a a
completely nonviolent demonstration
where they expressed support for black
lives matter but the village was
attacked by seven or eight hundred angry
militia types with guns and baseball
bats Detroit and smashed the place up
and prevent this from happening
Tallinn has about half a dozen policemen
we couldn't do anything you do get that
type of violence which is dangerous or
militias are very significant want to
take a look at some statistics when
Donald Trump came in 2016 there was
careful Clips analyses of terrorism and
terrorist related threats not very high
in the United States but it's there
2016 about 20% of them were white
supremacists today awesome almost 100%
of white supremacists that's four years
of tweets and hints and stimulation of
white supremacist violence from the
White House okay made a difference yes
that's there but if you look at the
demonstrations in the streets
overwhelmingly nonviolent there's a
fringe of looting and violence we also
don't know who's responsible
but overwhelmingly not and the
organizers black workers mostly try to
tamp it down because they know it's just
a gift of the right you been oh boy
and they're aiming at very crucial
issues not just police violence with you
series but not just that and of course
the police violence itself takes place
in the context of a very violent society
killings by guns are way beyond any
comparable country police violence is
not coming out and over that's part of
that but this beginning to look at the
roots of the whole business remember
we're looking at a society which has had
four hundred years of vicious repression
was virtually unremitting to the
president leaving a very bitter legacy
there's a lot to unravel and
interestingly it's arousing comparable
concerns into other countries so Britain
has a hideous record of horrifying
atrocities all over the world go back to
Adam Smith who was condemning the savage
and justice of the Europeans
particularly the British in India who
were turning drought into famine by
their vicious actions well I wasn't
taught in British schools barely
beginning to look at today same in
France so this awakening to looking at
what our wealth is based on what our
privilege is based on who's been
suffering that's important it's
important and though when you have a
cell phone in your hand as everybody
does to ask why it's cheap well a couple
of reasons one of them is virtual slave
labour run by Apple and its subsidiaries
in China of which China doesn't make
much profit but Apple does and Foxconn
does that's one reason
another reason is because
the worst atrocities in the world are
taking place in eastern Congo where the
minerals or millions of people are being
killed the militias are slaughtering and
so on in the background there are
multinationals hovering to get cheap
minerals from the militias that are
slaughtering people that gets into
yourself it's important to think about
things like this it's all over we don't
think about it much but we should
and what these demonstrations are
showing is that that kind of
consciousness is developing its belated
it's not enough what's important
