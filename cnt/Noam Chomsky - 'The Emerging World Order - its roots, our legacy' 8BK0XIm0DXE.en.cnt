ladies and gentlemen no I'm Chomsky
thank you
perhaps it's a sign of my age or perhaps
something else but I can't I cannot help
thinking that more and more about what
kind of a world we're leaving for our
children grandchildren and it's not a
very pretty picture not one that should
inspire pride there are quite a few grim
shadows that however menacingly over
thoughts about our legacy and of all of
them two are dominant because they
literally threaten survival of the
species
at least in any decent form one is
nuclear war the other is environmental
disaster and not only is nothing serious
being done about these challenges but
current decisions are enhancing the
threats it should be unnecessary to
carry on environmental disasters and how
the impending crisis is being handled as
for the threat of nuclear war it's on
the front pages daily but in a way that
would seem outlandish to an independent
observer
viewing the strange doings on earth in
fact this same independent observer that
might wonder if we are trying to settle
a debate that took place some years ago
between two eminent scientists Carl
Sagan astrophysicist Ernst Meier
biologists they were debating the
probability of intelligent
extraterrestrial life and Sagan arguing
from the point of view of an
astrophysicist concluded that it's very
likely because there are so many planets
similar enough to earth so that they
could sustain life and hence evolution
to higher intelligence ernst mayr took
the opposite view arguing as a biologist
he said that we should pay attention to
the one example we have namely Earth and
he pointed out that in the history of
life on Earth there have been several
billion species some successful some not
and turns out that the success of a
species as determined by the number of
the number of instances of it that
survive is inversely related to
intelligence
so the must most successful species are
those that mutate very quickly like
bacteria or those that have a fixed
ecological niche like beetles they do
very well no matter what happens and as
you move up the scale of what we call
intelligence the survival becomes much
more hazardous among mammals there are
actually very few of them and there are
a lot of cows but that's only because
humans domesticate them just as there a
lot of chickens for the same reason but
survival on their own is that they don't
do very well when you get the primates
there are very few humans have been very
sparsely have been very sparse
throughout the world until very recently
so reason that doesn't mean anything
in evolutionary terms he also pointed
out that the average life expectancy for
a species is roughly a hundred thousand
years rather ominously that's about how
long it's been that Homo sapiens has
been on earth so his conclusion is that
intelligence is basically a lethal
mutation as you move up to greater
intelligence there's more and more
self-destruction and it
you couldn't this extraterrestrial
observer might argue that we're trying
to prove that Maier was correct
certainly what it looks like
well turning to nuclear threats the
current nuclear threat not for the first
time is in the Middle East in this case
that focuses on Iran the general picture
in the West is clear and straightforward
it is far too dangerous to allow Iran to
reach new points called nuclear
capability that is the ability to create
nuclear weapons if they decide to do -
to do so that capability is enjoyed by
the great many countries in the world as
to whether they have decided the u.s.
intelligence says it doesn't know the
International Atomic Energy Agency says
pretty much the same thing in their
latest report just a few weeks ago the
agency concludes all quote that it
cannot demonstrate the absence of
undeclared nuclear material and
activities in Iran can't prove that
they're not taking place that's a
condition that can't be satisfied maybe
conveniently therefore Iran must be
denied the right to enrich uranium
that's guaranteed by the
proliferation treaty which in fact Iran
has signed unlike three nuclear powers
in the Pakistan and Israel that's the
general picture in the West I have to
emphasize West not the rest of the world
the non-aligned movement which is the
majority of people of the world and
states of the world by far has taken a
rather different stabbed you as you know
I'm sure it has recently met in Tehran
its regular meeting and it came out with
a vigorous endorsement of Iran's right
to enrich uranium as guaranteed by the
non-proliferation treaty that's not a
new position they've been taking that
position for a long time also quite
interesting as the Arab world I'll come
back to that in a moment well the basic
reason for the concern has been
expressed succinctly by general an
American general General Lee Butler is
the former head of the US Strategic
Command which is in charge of nuclear
weapons strategic policies involving
nuclear weapons that he writes that it
is dangerous in the extreme that in the
cauldron of animosities that we call the
Middle East one nation should arm itself
with nuclear weapons which may inspire
other nations to do so that general
Butler however was not referring to Iran
he was referring to Israel
that's the country that ranks highest in
polls of European public opinion as the
most dangerous country in the world
right above Iran and not in the Arab
world
in the Arab world the public regards the
United States as the second most
dangerous country after Israel that's
goes back quite a while Iran is
generally disliked but it doesn't it
ranks far lower as a threat among
populations that is not the
dictatorships Western media and
commentary keep almost entirely to the
views of the dictators so we constantly
hear that the Arabs want decisive US
action against Iran which is true of the
dictators you may recall that a while
ago
WikiLeaks released diplomatic documents
quoting Arab dictators Saudi Arabia and
the Emirates as calling for a strong US
action against Iran and the commentary
about that was interesting
it was almost euphoric isn't this
wonderful the Arabs support US policy
against Iran which is true of the Arab
dictators at the very same time Western
polls were coming out Western run polls
showing that it's quite the opposite
that though again they don't like Iran
they're not regarded as a threat the
United States is regarded as a threat
and in fact opposition to US policy was
so strong that a majority in some
countries like Egypt a substantial
majority thought that the region would
be more secure if Iran had nuclear
weapons they don't want Iran to have
nuclear weapons but if the United States
and Israel are half of them and are
there that's what's needed that that I
was almost never mentioned and that
reaction is pretty striking it
illustrates the
contempt for democracy among Western in
Western elite opinion doesn't matter
what the population thinks that's
derided as the Arab Street who cares
what they think
what matters is what the dictators think
it's a commentary about us not about the
Arab world well unlike Iran Israel
refuses to allow inspections refuses to
join the non-proliferation treaty it has
hundreds of nuclear weapons and advanced
delivery systems also has a long record
of violence and repression it has a
taxed and settled conquered territories
illegally in violation of Security
Council orders World Court decisions and
many acts of aggression invaded Lebanon
five times with no credible pretext and
much more the meanwhile severe threats
of attack continued from the United
States and particularly Israel daily
there are strong threats of attack and
there's a reaction from the US
government the Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta reacted to threats from Israel
by saying we don't want them to attack
Iran but they're a sovereign country
they can do what they like I mean if
Iran was making comparable threats about
Israel and it isn't the reaction would
be quite different if some of you have
antiquarian interests that you may
remember that there's a document called
the United Nations Charter the key
provision in the UN Charter is a ban
against the threat or use of force in
international affairs there are two
rogue states
United States and Israel that pay no
attention to this and are constantly
issuing severe threats and the European
Union goes along politely and the
threats are not just words there is an
ongoing war or at least what we would
regard as regard as an ongoing war if it
was directed against us there are
regular assassinations of scientists
terrorist acts there's a very severe
economic war us threats which are
unilateral have cut I ran out of the
international financial system European
countries don't disobey the United
States they have gone along five
high-level former NATO commanders that
recently released what they called a new
grand strategy which identified various
acts of war that justify a violent
response but one of them is weapons of
finance that's an act of war that
justifies a military reaction when it's
directed against us but cutting I ran
out of global financial markets is
different
cyber the US government is very proudly
announcing that it's undertaking
extensive cyber warfare against against
Iran the Pentagon has identified cyber
warfare as a serious military attack
which justifies our military response
but that's that's the difference between
what we do to them and what they do to
us
Israel has an enormous lethal armory not
just nuclear only recently in the last
few months
Israel has received advanced submarines
provided by Germany these are capable of
carrying israel's
nuclear-tipped missiles and they're sure
to be the plot deployed in the Persian
Gulf or nearby they may already be there
certainly if Israel proceeds with its
plan to bomb Iran and the u.s. of course
has a vast array of nuclear weapons
surrounding the region from the Indian
Ocean all the way to the West in the
Persian Gulf itself
the US has enough firepower to destroy
the world
many times over another story that's in
the news right now is the Israeli
bombing of the Iraqi reactor OSI Rock
and 1981 and that's being presented as a
model for Israeli bombing of Iran it's
rarely pointed out that that bombing did
not end Iraq's nuclear weapons program
it initiated it we know that even from
US intelligence they did enhance Adam
Hussein didn't have a nuclear weapons
program but after the bombing he made
sure to develop one that was the effect
of the 1981 bombing if Iran is bombed
it's almost certain to proceed just as
Saddam Hussein did after the OSI Rock
bombing and it's not a pleasant prospect
well in a few weeks we will be
commemorating the 50th anniversary of
the most dangerous moment in human
history I'm quoting the words of
American historian Kennedy advisor
Arthur Schlesinger is referring of
course to the October 1962 Cuban Missile
Crisis I doubt that the commemoration
will be presenting it accurately but you
should bear in mind what happened then
Kennedy raised the nuclear alert to the
second-highest level just short of
launch he authorized NATO NATO aircraft
with Turkish or other pilots to take off
fly to Moscow drop bombs which would set
off the nuclear conflagration at the
peak of the Missile Crisis Kennedy
himself estimated the probably
probability of nuclear war at perhaps
50% that would have been a war that
would destroy the northern hemisphere
President Eisenhower had warned and
facing that risk Kennedy refused to
agree publicly to an offer from Russian
Prime Minister Khrushchev to end the
crisis by simultaneous withdrawal of
Russian missiles from Cuba and u.s.
missiles from Turkey
these were obsolete missiles a
withdrawal order had already been issued
to get rid of them because they were
weak replaced by invulnerable Polaris
submarines nevertheless Kennedy refused
to accept the offer it was felt
necessary to firmly establish the
principle that Russia has no right to
have offensive weapons anywhere beyond
the borders of the USSR while the US
must retain the right to have them
anywhere at once all over the world
targeting Russia or for that matter
targeting China in in fact at that time
1962 the United States had just secretly
deployed nuclear missiles in Okinawa
theoretically a Japanese island but the
u.s. took it over after the second world
war is a military base against the
strong and continuing protests to the
people of Okinawa those missiles were
aimed at China at a moment of serious
regional tensions
that's just recently been learned well
fortunately her staff backed down
but the world can't be assured of such
sanity forever particularly threatening
is the fact that intellectual opinion
and even scholarship a hail Kennedy's
achievement as his finest hour I think
that requires some serious reflection
inability to face the truth about
oneself is all too common a feature of
the intellectual culture and it has
ominous implications
well that was 1962 ten years later
during the 1970 73 Israel Arab War a
Henry Kissinger
called a high-level nuclear alert the
purpose was to warn the Russians to keep
hands off while he was secretly
informing Israel that they were
authorized to violate the ceasefire
imposed by the US and Russia documents
that have only recently been released
pretty serious in fact though reporting
of course when Ronald Reagan came into
office a few years later the United
States launched operations probing
Russian defenses and simulating air and
naval attacks and also placing Pershing
missiles in Germany with a five-minute
flight time to Russian targets provided
with the CIA called a super Sutton's
first strike capability now the Russians
were naturally deeply concerned they
didn't know if these
through probing efforts probing entering
Russian airspace to probe defences and
so on and the simulation of air and
naval attacks they didn't know whether
they were tests or whether they were
real they were concerned that led to a
major war scare in 1983 we came very
close there have been hundreds of cases
when human intervention aborted a first
nuclear strike just minutes before
launch
that was when automated systems gave
false alarms as they regularly do that's
on the US side
we don't have records from Russia but
there's no doubt that their systems are
far more accident prone and the same
would be true of any other nuclear power
in fact it's a near miracle that nuclear
war has so far been avoided and we are
escalating the threat that meanwhile
India and Pakistan have come close to
nuclear war several times and the crises
remain mainly over Kashmir both
countries have refused to sign the
non-proliferation treaty
along with Israel and along with Israel
they've received a US support for
development of their nuclear weapons
program that's going on right now last
few years in the case of India since it
became a US ally today the war threats
of the Middle East
once again escalate these dangers is
there a way to deal with them you know
there's a very straightforward way to
mitigate or probably end that whatever
threat Iran is alleged to pose namely
move towards establishing a nuclear
weapons-free zone in the Middle East
that has enormous international support
it's been called for repeatedly by the
UN Security Council
the there are actually two countries
that have a very special commitment to
pursue this the United States and
Britain the reason is that when the US
and Britain invaded Iraq ten years ago
they tried to provide a thin legal cover
for the invasion as you recall they
claimed that Iraq had weapons for had
programs to develop nuclear weapons and
they appealed to a UN resolutions during
council resolution the resolution 687 in
1991 which compelled your act to stop
its programs of nuclear weapons
development that was the pretext for the
war we know what happened to the pretext
but much less discussed in fact not
discussed is that same resolution 687
that calls on all states to move to
create a nuclear weapons free zone in
the Middle East so the US and Brett
Britain have a specific commitment to
this the latest major the UN resolution
on Iranian nuclear weapons also calls
strongly for these moves there's
overwhelming international support
including even a majority of the
population in Israel so far it's been
blocked by the United States which
insists that Israel must be excluded
there's an opportunity coming again
this December when an international
conference is scheduled under UN
auspices on moving towards nuclear
weapons free zone unless there's a very
large-scale public pressure it's quite
unlikely that anything
we'll be done but the very few people
are even aware of this press doesn't
cover it in the United States at least
the matters virtually never discussed I
can't be that confident about Europe but
I've never seen anything in the West
generally except for specialist journals
if you read specialist journals on arms
control they report it but very few
people read that well let's put these
prospects aside and grim prospects and
turn to how the current world system
developed since World War two how it's
changed over the years
and where things and today there's a
very common theme I'm actually quoting
from the u.s. Academy of political
science a common theme that only a few
years ago America was hailed to stride
the world as a colossus with
unparalleled power and unmatched appeal
but it is now in decline
Thomas onam ominously facing the
prospect of its final decay the major
establishment journal in the Journal of
international relations in the United
States foreign affairs Journal of the
Council on Foreign Relations I had an
issue a few months ago where the front
cover and big bold letters have featured
the title of the issue the title was is
America over these themes are very
widely believed and with some reason
though some essential qualifications are
in order I think the decline is real but
it's not recent in fact it's been
proceeding since World War two that's
when US power reached its highest point
it's been declining steadily since
there's a
corollary that's commonly drawn namely
that power will shift to China and India
that's highly dubious I think there are
very poor countries very severe internal
problems don't have time to go into it
the can if you like the world is surely
becoming more diverse but despite
America's continued decline in the
foreseeable future
there's no competitor for global
hegemonic power just to keep to one
dimension military power the US military
spending is almost the same as the rest
of the world combined
and the u.s. is technologically far more
advanced the u.s. is alone in having
military bases elsewhere roughly a
thousand military bases riki the whole
world recently figures were announced on
global arms sales the United States
holds three-quarters of the global
market sales are more than ten times as
high as second place Russia and the
military dimension is only one of many
so the decline is real but the power
remains overwhelming well going back to
the beginnings of the contemporary era
the during World War 2 the u.s. planners
President Roosevelt's planners
recognized that the United States would
emerge from the war in a position of
overwhelming power in fact it's very
clear from the documentary record that
President Roosevelt was aiming at United
States hegemony in the post-war world
quoting the assessment of distinguished
British diplomatic historian Jeffrey
Warner he's one of the most respected
specialists on the topic and on the
documentary evidence and what he says is
quite quite well supported
the plans were developed during during
the war during the Second World War to
control the what was called what the
planners called a grand area the grand
area was to include as a minimum the
entire western hemisphere of course the
Far East and the former British Empire
which the US would take over in
particular the crucial Middle East oil
reserves and also as much of Eurasia as
possible at the very least its core
industrial regions in the Western Europe
and in the southern European states
Italy and Greece Italy and Greece in the
planning of the time were regarded as
essential for ensuring control of Middle
East energy resources which passed
through the Mediterranean and within
these expansive domains the documents
read the United States was to maintain
unquestioned power with military and
economic supremacy while ensuring the
limitation of any exercise of
sovereignty by states that might
interfere with these global designs
these doctrines still prevail though the
capacity to implement them has sharply
declined actually we know quite a lot
about the u.s. internal planning the
reason is that the United States is an
unusually free society maybe unique and
we have enormous access to internal
records that kind of a side
complimentary comment is that the
population is saved from knowing
anything about this because surely the
media that even most scholarship
just ignore it except for highly
specialized scholarship these wartime
were not at all unrealistic for a long
time the United States had been far and
away the richest country in the world
had unparalleled advantages and in fact
still is the war time there was huge
government stimulus during the war time
during the war that ended the depression
and in fact u.s. industrial capacity
nearly quadrupled during the Second
World War that mean while rival
industrial powers were decimated at the
end of the war the United States
literally had half the world's wealth
and unmatched security there's never
been a situation of global dominance
anywhere near like that there was a cold
war that followed if you take a look at
the actual events of the Cold War they
consisted very largely of efforts by the
two superpowers to enforce order in
their own domains for the Soviet Union
it was Eastern Europe the traditional
invasion corridor into Russia for the
United States it was most of the world
well that was 1945 very quickly the
grand area began to erode the first blow
and a very serious one was in 1949 it is
a phrase to describe it the routine
phrase describing it is the loss of
China China being moved towards
independence that had very severe
domestic repercussions in the United
States one of the factors that led to
what's called McCarthyism many
accusations about who's to blame for the
loss of China that phrase the loss of
China is interesting the one can only
lose what one possesses like I can lose
my computer right
lose your computer and it's taken for
granted that the United States owns most
of the world by right
so therefore if part of it becomes
independent we've lost it
and the question is who's to blame for
this loss well shortly after Southeast
Asia began to fall out of control
leading to concern about further losses
and by 1950 the US had launched
supporting France than on its own what
became Washington's horrendous Indochina
Wars and also going on another case was
the huge massacres in Indonesia in 1965
as US dominance was restored many other
cases meanwhile subversion massive
violence that continued elsewhere in the
effort to maintain what's called
stability meaning conformity to u.s.
demands Italy was not overlooked 1948 as
I'm sure you know the United States
intervened massively to try to ensure
that it would maintain control of the
political process in Italy and in
subsequent years Italy was the scene of
more CIA covered activity than any other
country at least until the 1970s that's
when the record runs dry nevertheless
decline was inevitable the industrial
world reconstituted and reconstructed
decolonization proceeded pursuing
agonizing course by 1970 the US share of
world wealth had declined to about 25
percent and that's still colossal but
much less than 50 percent it's
approximately what it still is at that
point the industrial world was becoming
what's called tri-polar three major
centers the United States you
in asia asia was then Japan centered
already becoming the world's most
dynamic industrial region well 20 years
later Soviet Union collapsed and for
those who want to understand the reality
of the Cold War it's highly informative
to look into what happened and when it
ended to a natural place to look that
was the time of the first Bush
administration the civilized Bush was
then in office the Bush administration
immediately declared officially that
policies would remain pretty much
unchanged but with different pretexts so
the huge military establishment would be
maintained but not for defense against
the Russians their rather to confront
what they called the technological
sophistication of third world powers
well-educated intellectuals don't laugh
when they read that similarly it would
be necessary to maintain what was called
the defense industrial base it's
actually a euphemism for advanced
industry which is highly reliant on
government subsidy and initiative that's
contrary to free-market delusions
what about intervention forces well they
still had to be aimed at the Middle East
where the serious problems could not be
laid at the Kremlin's door it's the
official wording notice that that
quietly withdraws a half a century of
deceit when it was claimed that the
threat was the Russians it was no longer
possible to claim that so it was
conceded that the problems had always
been what's called radical nationalism
that is attempts by countries to pursue
an independent course in violation of
grand area principles analogous to the
Russian actions and they're much more
stricted domain interventions and
hungary chose Lockean Poland for the us
almost the whole world
well the principles were retained they
were not modified in fact the Clinton
administration declared and quote its
official comment statement position
declared that the United States has the
right to use military force unilaterally
to ensure uninhibited access to key
markets energy supplies and strategic
resources and must have military forces
forward deployed in Europe and Asia in
order to shape people's opinions about
us not by gentle persuasion and to shape
events that will affect our livelihood
and our security quoting official
documents of the Clinton era
incidentally that goes beyond anything
claimed by his successor George W Bush
Bush's proclamations aroused enormous
anger and concern it Clinton's much more
extreme ones were ignored because they
were kind of presented politely and
quietly not arrogantly the doctrines
themselves were actually worse one very
instructive case is native according to
standard doctrine the NATO was
established to defend Europe defended
against the Russian hordes
well after 1989 no more Russian words so
therefore if you believe the official
doctrine NATO should have been they
reduced or eliminated on the contrary
the NATO was expanded to the east
immediately in violation of verbal
pledges to Mikhail Gorbachev when he
agreed he did agree to allow a unified
Germany to
that's an amazing concession on his part
in the light of history but there was a
quid pro quo he received a guarantee
from President Bush and the Secretary of
State James Baker that NATO would not
move one inch to the east that was the
phrase meaning to East Germany or
certainly not beyond that was
immediately violated that Gorbachev was
naturally pretty upset but when he
complained the US government informed
him that it had only been a verbal
agreement nothing on paper and if he's
naive enough to accept the promises of
an American administration that's his
problem
the by now the NATO has become a global
intervention force under US command it
has an official task namely controlling
the international energy system sea
lanes and pipelines and in fact whatever
else the hegemonic power determines
there was a period of euphoria after the
collapse of the superpower enemy excited
tales about the end of history
possibility at last of carrying out
humanitarian intervention the idealistic
new world bent on ending and humanity
can proceed guided by altruism and the
principles and values that's just a
small sample of the inspired rhetoric of
prominent the European and American
intellectuals it's the 1990s and not
everyone was so enraptured the
traditional victims the global South
bitterly condemned what they called the
so-called right of humanitarian
intervention
which they recognized just to be the old
write of imperial domination but as
usual they were ignored after Bush
number two took over increasingly
hostile world opinion could scarcely be
ignored that particularly in the Arab
world and Bush's approval ratings
plummeted one of President Obama's most
impressive feats is that he succeeded in
becoming even more unpopular than Bush
his popularity is down to 5% in Egypt
it's not much higher elsewhere in the
region considering the reaction to Bush
that's not a small accomplishment well
meanwhile decline continued in the past
decade South America has been lost
that's serious enough but far more
serious would be moves towards
independence in the Middle East planners
of the 1940s recognized that control of
the incomparable energy reserves of the
Middle East would yield substantial
control of the world it's the words of
the influential Roosevelt advisor a
burly and many for many others it was
standard view and correspondingly the
loss of control would threaten the
project of global dominance that was
clearly articulated during World War two
and has been sustained since in the face
of major changes in world order now
there's a further danger in the Middle
East as elsewhere there might be
meaningful moves towards democracy and
that's a threat and a look at Western
studies of public opinion in the Arab
world
of them and they're pretty consistent
that makes it very clear why democracy
is a very severe threat it has to be
prevented as fully as possible the
United States and its Western Allies do
not want policies to be responsive to a
public that sees Israel and the United
States as the major threat so severe a
threat that many think that the region
would be better off if here at had
nuclear weapons that's not what the West
wants obviously for the West the most
important states are the oil
dictatorships in Saudi Arabia and the
Emirates they're the Democratic
uprisings have been brutally repressed
with Western support and tolerance
elsewhere particularly in Egypt the main
structure of the former military
dictatorship remains partially intact
it's threatened by popular forces and
that's quite a serious concern in the
West this is different from official
rhetoric but official rhetoric always
has to be regarded with extreme
skepticism for obvious reasons well
control of the Middle East remains
intact for the moment nevertheless
American decline is continuing and a
significant element of it is that the
decline is in no small and small measure
self-inflicted there's a recent study by
the Economic Policy Institute in
Washington that's the major source of
regular information and analysis of the
economy their recent study is called
failure by design it reviews the data on
the impact of the neoliberal policies
from the past generation
that includes remarkable concentration
of wealth while wages have stagnated or
declined the working hours have
increased and far beyond Europe and the
weak benefit system has been eroded it
is now further threatened the authors
point out that the failure is
class-based the designers have achieved
spectacular success and they also stress
that it is by design alternative Apostle
Paul policies were always possible then
still are and though I won't go into it
the same as true of Europe
the corporate power just keeping to the
United States for now the corporate
power is by now
a largely financial capital it's become
so influential in the political system
that by now both parties are well to the
right of the population major issues
under debate there are careful studies
of this by major political scientists
and they make it very clear that in the
collapsing political system the very
rich top a few percent that probably top
one-tenth of one percent if you could
get adequate polling data the very rich
generally get what they want
that whatever the public might prefer
the most recent detailed study major
study by Martin gilens that shows that
for about three-quarters of the
population they are in his words
powerless to shape government policy
doesn't matter what they think and the
mechanisms are by no means obscure
however it's fair to say that the US
Federal Reserve the central bank though
heavily influenced by financial
corporations looks pretty progressive in
comparison with the European Central
Bank its counterpart the US
fed Central Bank has a formal commitment
to two tasks the one is keeping
inflation from getting too high
and the second is reducing unemployment
that a latter concern there is no threat
of inflation so it doesn't have to worry
about that the threat is deflation the
other commitment reducing unemployment
that does receive some attention it's
why the Federal Reserve has been
effectively printing money trying to
support a stimulus the European Central
Bank is quite different it's only formal
commitment is to keep inflation low it's
for the benefit of bankers primarily the
Bundys function that provides a welcome
opportunity to dismantle the welfare
state one of europe's great
contributions to civilization in the
modern period that's what we're seeing
before our eyes and the European Central
Bank President Mario Draghi knew exactly
what he was saying when he informed the
Wall Street Journal that quoting him the
continents traditional social contract
is obsolete not for any intrinsic
reasons but by design alternatives are
possible
these self-inflicted blows in the United
States as in much of the West are not a
current innovation they trace back to
the 1970s when the national political
economy underwent major transformations
it brought to an end what's commonly
called the Golden Age of capitalism
should be called state capitalism
because of the massive state
intervention I'll keep here to the
United States but the process is
international
taking different forms and various parts
of the state capitalist world there were
two major processes the one was
financialization the second is
offshoring of production there were
reasons but the policies that were
adopted were by no means necessary they
reflected the increasing power of
international corporate capital
increasingly financial they also
reflected the ideological triumph of
what are called free-market doctrines
which were used to translate it into
policies of sharp decrease in taxes for
the very rich in the corporate sector
deregulation the rules of corporate
governance that were designed to allow
salaries of top management to reach
unprecedented heights and other such
policy decisions stress again that the
term free-market is a more propaganda
than reality the rich and the corporate
sector insist on a very powerful state
one that intervenes radically to distort
markets and their interest many examples
well the resulting concentration of
wealth yielded automatically greater
political power that accelerated a
vicious cycle that has led to
extraordinary wealth for literally a
tenth of one percent of the population
that's mainly a chairman of major
corporations managers of hedge funds and
so on meanwhile for the large majority
it really incomes of virtually stagnated
often declined well in parallel the cost
of Elections has skyrocketed
right now it's billions of dollars
drives both parties even deeper into
corporate pockets where the money is in
the United States and the current u.s.
electoral force it's reached the level
of caricature probably observing it the
post Golden Age economy is actually
enacting a nightmare which was envisaged
by the classical economists Adam Smith
and David Ricardo at both Smith and
Ricardo recognized that if British of
course concerned with Britain if British
merchants and manufacturers invested
abroad and relied on imports they would
profit but England would suffer that
both of them hoped that these
consequences would be averted by what's
called home bias a preference to do
business in the home country and to see
it grow grow and develop so therefore as
if by an invisible hand England would be
saved from the ravages of global markets
actually that's the only occurrence of
the phrase famous phrase invisible hand
in Adam Smith's classic wealth of
nations it's kind of hard to miss it's
basically in the course of an argument
against neoliberal globalization his
immediate successor Ricardo hoped that
thanks to home bias most men of property
on quoting him now most men of property
would be satisfied with a low rate of
profits in their own country rather than
seek a more advantageous employment for
their wealth in foreign nations the
feelings that I should be sorry to see
weakened that's Smith and Ricardo in the
past 30 years the masters of mankind as
Smith called them have abandoned any
sentimental concern
for the welfare of their own societies
and concentrating instead on short-term
gain and huge bonuses country be damned
as long as the powerful nanny state the
remains intact to serve their interests
the there's a government insurance
policy which is colloquially called too
big to fail
meaning banks will be saved if they're
too big no matter what they do that
government insurance policy is estimated
at about a sixty billion dollar annual
taxpayer gift to the biggest banks and
that's only one small illustration of
the state subsidy to the rich and
powerful the emerging world order is
very aptly described in a brochure for
investors which is produced by which was
produced a couple years ago by Citigroup
Missy grows a huge bank that's been
feeding at the public trough for thirty
years in a cycle of risky loans huge
profits crash public bailout it's
happened again now what's been going on
since the early eighties the bank's
analysts describe a world that's
dividing into two blocks that one of
them is what they call the plutonomy the
of the rest is and then there's the the
rest the vast majority sometimes they're
called the global precariat those who
live a precarious existence whether or
not they're lucky enough to have
employment in the United States they're
subject to growing worker insecurity
that's the basis for a healthy economy
as Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan
explained to Congress while lauding his
performance in economic management
during the clinton years that's the real
shift in power in
global society and not to China and
India but to the global plutonomy the
Citigroup analysts and advise investors
to focus on the very rich that's where
the action is they have what they call a
plutonomy stock basket investments in
products and activities that benefit the
tiny super-rich and they point out that
their plutonomy stock basket has far out
performed the world index of developed
markets since 1985 that's when the
reagan-thatcher economic programs of
enriching the very wealthy and punishing
the rest were just taking off that
before the 2007 crash for which they
were largely responsible the financial
institutions of the neoliberal failure
by design had gained startling economic
power they had more than tripled their
share of corporate profits after the
crash a number of economists for the
first time began to inquire into their
function in purely economic terms some
that amazingly had never been done
before the one Nobel laureate and
economics Robert Solow
MIT he concludes from a study that the
general impact of financial institutions
is probably negative they're harmful
quoting him the successes probably add
little or nothing to the into the
efficiency of the real economy while the
disasters transfer wealth from taxpayers
to fin its ears the most respected
financial correspondent in the
english-speaking world Martin wolf of
the London Financial
writes that the out-of-control financial
sector is eating out the modern market
economy from inside just as the larvae
of the spider wasp eats out the host in
which it has been laid but it's a great
success for the fraction of 1% of the
population who were the designers of the
current system and not surprisingly its
beneficiaries well by shredding the
remnants of political democracy they
also lay the basis for carrying the
lethal process forward and will continue
to do so as long as their victims are
willing to suffer in silence
