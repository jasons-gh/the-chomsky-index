I was asked to speak here by one of my
students by Casey and I'm grateful for
the opportunity this is something that
even in his existence just well it just
makes me really happy it makes me just
excited to be here and I'm excited that
you guys are all here but I'm also
acutely aware that I'm the opening act
for dr. Chomsky and then I'm honored and
respectful of him so I'm going to try to
keep my comments fairly brief and then
really I'm here to talk about the
history of student activism and as a
historian you know I have this natural
inclination to want to run through a
chronology of student resistance for the
last 150 years and tell you about all of
these excuse me great accomplishments
but I'm not really sure that that's the
purpose of this summit and I'm not
really sure that going into a bunch of
details about a bunch of movements that
are in some ways sort of historically
specific to their time is what you need
right it is what is needed at this
moment I think that takes place on a
smaller scale so even though as I said I
kind of admittedly wanted to do that and
I do have probably more detail in here
that I need I want to talk more about
the condition of student activism and
the historical tradition of student
activism because the idea of student has
really over a long course of time the
idea of being a student Empowered young
people that make claims against the
state that they might not otherwise have
made and they've come together under
this identity and this banner of student
across the globe and across time in part
of a shared tradition and so that's what
I want to sort of focus on today and I'm
going to try to stay close to my notes
which I'm not very good at doing so I
think that where I begin where I began
my preparations for this is really this
question of what makes a student
particularly so well positioned to
organize and i think that there's a lot
of answers to that question i think
everyone in this room probably has to
some degree a slightly different answer
to that question on an individual level
but if we historically
this and we look at this larger pattern
of student resistance in this larger
tradition globally of student resistance
we can see certain commonalities that
make us understand ourselves a little
better but also make us understand what
we're doing and the entire
collectivities of this a little greater
and a little broader and I think one of
the major ideas that we see in student
activism is an inherent hopefulness in
education so education in of itself is
and getting an education is a hopeful
activity and it's in asking for more
when you're going to get an education
and when you're receiving an education
it's because you want to know more you
want more information you want to
understand more and you want to see
things in a new way and this hunger
that's inherent in education and I
understand that every time a student is
sitting and a lecture hall or not you
know hungry for more education but it is
heart it really is right this is what
this is why you choose to become a
student because you want you want more
and I also think that you know the idea
behind an education you're told this
over and over and over as a student is
that you're being prepared for the
future right so you know oh you're the
next generation and the future is yours
so well really why not make that future
one in which you want to live and in
such you know being a student is often a
time of political awakening push for
young people it's a transition from
being the child of your parents to a
citizen of the state in a lot of ways
right and you're you're looking at your
role as a citizen of the state not just
you know it's different it's different
when you're in primary or lower
education because you're still under the
guise of being cared for a university or
a college level you're you're becoming
more of a free agent so to speak and
this is a really transitional period and
it's it's a transitional period that
others have noticed long before you and
i and i really like a quote that i'm
going to reach you from 1966 the poverty
of student life and the poverty of
student life was written by some many of
you have hopefully probably read this it
was written by Strasburg students that
came together and offered a real
critique of their situation
but while they were talking about
themselves let's let's consider might
they be talking about us as well and so
they said i quote modern capitalism and
its spectacle a lot everyone a specific
role in general pet in a general
passivity the student is no exception to
the rule he has a provisional part to
play a rehearsal for his final role as
an element in market society as
conservative as the rest the student
leaves adult leads a double life poised
between his present status and his
future role end quote now that's kind of
negative don't worry it does get more
hopeful later for them but what the I
think the duality of your role as a
student is captured really well here and
your position to move forward um is is
captured well now a little more
positively and in fact earlier again I'm
a historian so I've gotta pull quotes
for you guys in 1962 here in the United
States students for a Democratic Society
issued the Port Huron Statement this is
of course a landmark document in the
creation and articulation of the new
left something that really is in many
ways the root or one of the many roots
of what we're doing here today right
that this sort of open democracy is it a
direct outgrowth of many of these new
left ideas and in the opening of their
statement they say introduction I'm
quoting agenda for a generation we are
people of this generation bred in at
least modern comfort housed now in
universities looking uncomfortably to
the world we inherit and and here we see
again they get more positive and more
direct as they go on as well but we see
this this sort of precipice that
students are standing on this this
moment of you know we're now at a point
where we can see issues we can see
problems and we're actually in a
position to make changes right and we
can't necessarily rely on those that
came before us to have solved all of
these problems because in fact they may
have contributed to them and the point
in trying out these quotes I guess um
for me as a historian is that you know I
suspect that most of us can relate
to the sentiments that I just read but
these were written in the 60s right but
the the condition of the student and the
state of the student and this position
this precipice of the student is
something that we've all shared that
we've all felt and experienced and it's
something that really roots and guides
what what's happening here today so it
doesn't mean that you have to be a
student to want to change the future
right and nor our students somehow just
to be clear especially qualified to do
this over there non-student counterparts
but on a practical level again this is
sort of in a historical tradition being
a student at a university or a college
or community college or another
educational institution put you in
direct and immediate contact with other
people in the same position right
there's a physicality of the campus
there's a physicality of your community
that puts you all together and the
physicality of that and the location of
that makes for great conditions for
collective action and this again is an
example today so the student identity
has a historical tradition and you know
student activists of each generation
they know that students before them have
come together and active collectively
right and that itself this knowledge
that this is a historical tradition is
itself the key to mobilization right so
knowing that students have come together
in the past and made changes and here
you are now a student and you're coming
together that's motivating and it's
mobilizing and you know this historical
tradition which again is long and
diverse and globally spread out more
global than many many other phenomenons
that we call global it inspires us it
also offers us lessons and we can look
back at prior mobilizations and prior
efforts and we can see what worked right
and and does that mean it's going to
work for us now know it might not we
have our own conditions right in as much
as we learn from the past so to do the
powers-that-be right anybody that's been
to a protest in the last ten years is
aware that the state has figured out how
to manage protesters but in you know we
can also see what didn't work and we
see mistakes that were made we can see
divisions that were made we can see in
sensitivities that were not that we're
not cared for we can see how people harm
each other when they meant to hurt each
other and these are all important
lessons that we can learn from each
other and from from people that have
done this before so uh you know in terms
of successes and mistakes I guess before
I move away from this I just want to say
that this this historical tradition in a
way and sometimes we don't think in
these terms but it's not so really
validating right so the question is what
are these dumb students know about the
world right they're just a bunch of kids
right didn't they should just let us
handle it they need to get an education
well this is as much a part of education
as anything else what you're doing here
is probably fundamental to your
education as a citizen to the state I
would argue foundational to your
education as a citizen of the state so I
think that looking back and saying you
know what we do have a right as students
to come together and we are valid in
asking and for these things in making
these claims that's engaging with a
historical tradition and that's using
this historical tradition in a way that
history is great right in in what
history is for we should learn from it
and we should be empowered by it um so
again you know I guess I'm jumping a bit
but you know one of the things that I
think makes students particularly keen
to organize and in some ways is why we
can look back at this tradition and see
a lot of similar causes across space and
time someone who works outside
regionally I work outside the United
States and it's always amazing to me how
many of the issues that students in you
know 1975 Bangladesh were talking about
you know the same issues that I was
talking about when I was in you know
undergrad myself in you know last year
not really I'm not that young but I like
to pretend that I'm still younger than I
am for the point is that these are
shared issues across time right and one
of the reasons is that college campuses
and university campuses are often little
microcosms of larger society right you
have a lot of different people from a
lot of different backgrounds that often
come together
so you can start to see problems and
issues and positives as well in kind of
a sharp relief right it's a focus in
it's a it's a it's a distilling so some
of the examples is when you have a rape
culture on campus or you're encountering
rape culture on campus this isn't
something that exists only on your
campus right this is a reflection of
larger problems in society of sexism and
society of a tolerance for misogyny in
society and so you see it on your campus
its immediate it's stark it's in front
of you and you're able to extrapolate
and are able to expand it right I think
another example and I think dr. Chomsky
will probably bring this issue up in
more detail is this corporatization
that's taking place on the campuses and
we can see this as a reflection of the
larger problems of capitalist greed
generally and the bloated power of
multinational corporations in virtually
every aspect of society so students are
in a position both personally as
individuals collectively as a social
role to see issues that they want to
address and to imagine ways that these
issues could be addressed and so I think
those are two examples but I want to
give a little bit more specifically of
how it's really easy to start with
campus issues or even shared campus
issues and connect those and draw those
into larger social issues and so for
example when students in South Africa in
the 1960s formed the National Student
Union of South Africa their opening goal
their mission was to desegregate the
campus now obviously this is one would
argue a campus issue on some level right
there talking about the policy on their
campus of desegregation but clearly this
is linked in part of a larger struggle
to end apartheid in South Africa the
struggle that took decades of and then
later much later in fact decades later
when students in the United States and
many at universities that are
represented here today by you came
together and organized and mobilized and
protested for their universities to
divest funds from South Africa they were
taking part in that same struggle right
to end apartheid an ultimate
this the larger struggle and strategy of
opposing apartheid works and and the
policy at least one on a policy level is
ended but what's important is that
separated by space and time students
here in the united states in the
Northeast and in particular and students
in South Africa you know decades prior
all mobilized the student identity for
this larger cause right this student
identity gave them what they needed to
make a change to end this policy and in
another vein I guess but was similarly
what what starts as students or starts
as campus issues often escalates when
students join up with other
constituencies and this is an aspect
that I guess I would want to emphasize a
great deal because I think that
solidarity and and working with
constituencies outside of the student
identity is fundamental and so it a good
historical example is of course 1968 in
Paris this is one of the sort of most
famous uprisings of the nineteen sixty
eight students take over the university
they occupy it it gets lots of attention
but when does it really get serious well
it gets serious when the workers join
them and they have a general strike and
they essentially shut down Paris right
they almost bring the de Gaulle
government which was a horrible
government to collapse ultimately they
don't um but what they are successful in
doing is is creating such a spectacle
and creating such a fear in not only the
French government but governments all
over that people see the power of
students and workers coming together
right and nineteen sixty eight and
nineteen sixty-nine globally explodes in
movements and in terms of workers
student collaboration the 68 as we call
them they don't all take place in the
year 68 our phenomenal examples of
students and workers finding common
ground and realizing that they're
working on the same issues so we have
uprisings as widespread as the united
states pakistan germany london mexico
city cairo istanbul rio de janeiro you
really I mean I couldn't even list off
how many of these
mobilizations occur and many of this is
sort of many of these are inspired by
the may 68 but but or the Paris may 68
but it's also more of just a generalized
realization right i mean george katia
ficus who's a scholar of 68 you know
calls this in a sense of zeitgeist that
takes place it's this magic moment where
everyone realizes that this is a
possibility well i don't think it's a
magic moment right i mean it may have
been a historical convergence but this
could be a magic moment just as easily
it just takes noticing it it just takes
realizing and it deciding to act um so
this this link between workers and
students i guess i just i'm going to
harp on this for a minute because it's a
genuinely powerful alliance and it's one
that really cannot be underestimated in
terms of political economic and social
power and it's one that generally in
terms of state power and even university
administration power is incredibly
terrifying right because it's a real
threat so another example of the
Alliance that I think is a really
important one and a lost illustrative is
that when a hundred and twenty either
din Tiananmen Square in 1989 to call for
democratic opening in China not a lot
happened actually initially it was a
hundred thousand students which is a lot
but there wasn't a huge state response
when over a million workers and
residents joined with those students it
hit the fan right the government
responded tragically and violently but
and it was brutal and and and in some
ways you could argue that they that they
were defeated but they weren't defeated
right there's a historical twist to this
because we remember 1989 in China today
at most of you know what I'm talking
about when in Tiananmen Square and we
remember that as a student protest but
only about a tenth of the people here
were students write the students were
the Vanguard the students were there
first but this is an example of how this
sort of student identity is latched onto
this one of the reasons it's latched on
is because in terms of media
power seeing students getting gunned
down and beat down by the authorities is
enormously strategically effective for a
movement to emphasize or to show right
and that's something that you know the
power of a non-violent protester being
beaten down by a violence state and
particularly a young optimistic youthful
student being not encouraging you and
also get deep down I'm just pointing out
that you know the image this is
something that has been strategically
deployed this was employed in the
decolonization movements this was
employed in the American Civil Rights
Movement you you force the state to show
its violence right you force the
violence in the system to the surface
and they can't deny it right if they're
if they're beating kids down in the
street they can't deny that their power
is being enforced through force so uh
you know that this worker Student
Alliance I guess I just ended
emphasizing well partly because it's my
thing but um but you know it gets to sum
that up the past has lessons but I also
want to emphasize that it's not some
kind of perfect model so I you know I
use this phrase a lot and you know I
have some students here that have
probably heard me say it before you know
the past offers a select lessons but not
dogma so it's really as a young person
that is participating in this movement
now it's perfectly acceptable and and
good for you to be critical of movements
that have come before you and for you to
say yeah I know that's the way you guys
did it and I know it worked for you but
that's not necessarily what's working
for us now right and so I think that
that approaching the past with one that
says we're willing to learn from this
but we're not just going to you know
it's not such a checklist that we're
going to fill out first we hold this
summit and then we're going to hold a
March and then we're going to have them
we're gonna you know I don't even know
what comes after that I think that's as
far as the model goes often so because
if the model went any further we
wouldn't need this summit right we'd be
done but so I think that um when we look
at history and a great tradition of
student activism around the world we
learned from that experience of the past
but it's also important that we remember
that this movement has to look
word and at the present in every era
including our own has its own historical
specificity in new conditions that you
have to address and also new strategies
that are available to you I was just
speaking with with students of my own
about how you know I'm not that old and
i remember in 1999 being so excited by
the existence of Indymedia to find out
what was happening in seattle that was
99 that's not that long ago and it was
shaking right that you could know what
was happening in this protest as it was
happening now that's a given right
that's that's like you know it's in the
water it's it's fluoride we expect to
know what's happening in protests around
the world and that's a huge benefit and
that's a huge power of that that we have
that that we can use to our advantage um
and so ah I would also like to just make
a final point as I wrap this up about
the campus community itself and and
maybe this is a little self-serving at
since I'm no longer an undergraduate
student but I want to point out that you
know it's not just undergraduate
students that are sharing in this goal
and so really faculty campus workers
graduate undergraduate students we're
kind of all on the same side and one in
particular on campus issues um you know
as an educator myself I don't really
know any professors or educators and I
suspect dr. Jones can back me up on this
that went into academia or went into
becoming an educator because we wanted
to make the university administration a
lot of money it's just that really isn't
what motivates us it's not what
motivates us to stand up for am writing
a lecture right not that we aren't as
prepared as you always are but we're
there because we're taking part in the
Academy we're taking part in this quest
for knowledge right we want to share
ideas and when we do see it by and large
most of my colleagues see this as a back
and forth and we see your education in
your right education our right to give
you an education all right to talk about
ideas as something that usual
we is only being interrupted by some
sort of administrative policy right um
so you know we treat edge uh well okay
so I'll put this into my analytical
terms if we look at the university
administration in terms of a class
system the administration is the owning
class this is what they are they own the
money and they own the purse strings and
they they that's who they are and you
know we don't have anything in common
with them and they know that they know
it very well now on an individual level
have you met an administrator and you
think oh yeah we both like you know Bob
Dylan so great we have everything in
common that's not what I mean our
position these are the what we're doing
at that institution we have nothing in
common the administration is not there
with the same goal as us but and they
know that and we need to know that what
they also know is that what we faculty
graduate students undergraduate students
all have in common is that we have
nothing in common with them right and
I'm not trying to create an antagonism
but if their goal is to get as much
money out of each student then you don't
have anything in common you're on the
other side of the aisle from that issue
right there trying to squeeze money out
of you and what's really terrifying to
them is that if we workers students
faculties if all of us who have in
common that we have nothing in common
with them were to come together into one
single constituency imagine if all of
the people they were trying to squeeze
money out of came together and said
could you stop squeezing money out of us
seriously they know that they would be
completely powerless in the face of that
and so just to illustrate I'd like to
point out that when the university cuts
library workers which we know you're
here we are on the Harvard campus it's
cutting academic resources for students
right so you may not know anybody who
works in the library but your library is
not going to be as functional because
they've cut workers when it cuts
security jobs it makes your campus less
safe when it increases class sizes it
makes it harder for faculty to teach
classes when they jack up tuition they
make education less available for
working class students when they hire
adjunct instructors instead of tenure
track positions at less than minimum
wage they make
the quality of your class experience
less because you have adjunct
instructors that are trying to teach
five or six classes just to put bread on
the table ah when they cut ethnic
studies programs make contraceptives
unavailable sweep reports of rape and
sexual assault under the carpet so they
aren't deemed an unsafe campus when they
tell students that it isn't the school's
fault that they have a hundred grand and
student loan debt when they graduate
when they pay janitors a fifth of what
one student pays a year in tuition it's
all an attack on everybody it's all an
attack on the shared goal and it's all
part of the scheme where these
administration's are getting rich and
we're all paying for it together so it's
to their advantage when we say students
and workers don't have anything in
common it's to their advantage when they
say oh you know it's not our fault that
your that your classes just said
dissatisfactory faculties fault right oh
no it's all to their advantage when we
fight amongst ourselves and I would
argue that's that's really something
that we can all apply to the left in
general we fight each other when we
really don't need to be fighting each
other so in conclusion what to do I like
to try and end things on the positive
I'm not always great at doing that but
I'm going to ah so you know I have to
say I think that you're the question is
where do we go from here well you're
already doing so much right you're
already here now and that's significant
and that's that's more than so many
others are doing and it's really leading
the way for others to join you that you
can do things in small scales too right
you guys have classes you can't do this
every weekend there's a lot of resources
and time that went into planning
organizing this event and so you can't
do this every day and this can't be all
that you do so I really encourage you to
think in small scales also because
collective action takes place in
multiple scales and some of it takes
place at the individual and small-group
level so I mean one of my big calls to
action is often to educate yourself
beyond the syllabus form reading groups
I am a strong advocate of reading groups
talk talk talk to each other form cross
campus reading groups right so read with
people from other universities look at
what they're learning look at what
they're talking about listen to what
their problems are right so much of the
feminist movement in the United States
was built on women getting too
together and talking about their
problems right do this recreate this
this is an example of a lesson that you
can recreate ask questions of people
that have done this sort of thing before
right listen to their stories here what
worked here what didn't work and finally
I want to encourage you to sort of
consider that you are creating your own
stories and to record those four others
that are going to come after you right
so document yourselves document what
you're doing here now recognize and
celebrate that you're not only learning
and participating in the immediate goals
but you're participating in this great
worldwide tradition of students working
together to make the world better you
know 50 years from now I hope that
someone will be standing in my position
oh maybe not because you'll have solved
the world's problems but someone will be
standing in some position and they'll be
saying you know in 2012 Boston occupy
student summit came together and they
launched a new program and it was the
beginning of a new wave that ultimately
led to the destruction of capitalism or
like I said if I'm hoping right and he
and end up say and they'll stand in my
position they'll say this is what they
said this is what they thought because
those records were made available to
them because those words are made
available so that's sort of where I'll
end it on our future destruction
capitalism I do want to make before we
transition over to my fellow worker
Chomsky I do want to make a shout out to
the table and lobby for the IWW who is
organizing on the same platform that I
have talked about that we as education
workers students instructors graduate
students any one working in a capacity
with education we have the shared goal
we should have the shared platform which
have a shared Union so i encourage you
to stop by their table on your way out
and I thank you for your time
well I'd much prefer to leave as much
time as possible for discussion so I
have to be too long don't really have
anything particular planned there's lots
of topics that could be discussed i'll
start by picking up in a couple of
things that Sam said so she mentioned
that the South African students movement
when it began was committed not just to
student issues but to the larger goal of
ending apartheid a major problem in the
society for sure problem and that brings
up something that's always truly
whatever is going on in the universities
is closely interrelated to
socio-economic political other
developments in the larger society and
we can bring that right to here so where
you guys are sitting now that's where I
was a 60 years ago same ol same seat
didn't look as fancy then and at that
point it was a very serious problem of
apartheid in multiple problems in
universities like Harvard but for one
thing there were no women and of course
no minorities that my wife was a student
at the women's college but if she wanted
to get a book say from lamont library
next door I had to get it for the change
act activism over the years particularly
the 60s made a very big difference in
the nature of the universities so now I
presume Harvard's probably about half
women most colleges are the other kind
of apartheid remains very significantly
and these are of course changes in the
larger society the manner of the type of
education Harvard at that time is kind
of a gentleman's club and that's a
stress on men and that related both
to the character the institution and to
the nature of what was taught and that
again was true throughout the alien
universities the Ivy League universities
so for example my wife and I had both
come from another ID League university
university of pennsylvania also with a
separate women's college and when my
wife was a freshman at college first
thing that all women had to do was to
take a course on what was called
orientation where they learn the
important things for women to know like
how to hold a teacup and sit on the
floor with and then stand up again
without spilling it which is pretty
tricky when you're wearing a dress
particularly but that was women's
education well that's gone there's been
a lot of changes a lot of victories and
changing the nature of the educational
system also been a lot of regression if
you look over the the trajectory that
the progress and regression has taken it
reflects very much things that have been
going on in the larger society and can
influence them so the the 1950s early
post-war period was a pretty radical
period in American life a large
percentage of the population for example
thought that workers are owned and run
their own factories and with the wartime
experience the depression and the war
had already had a radicalizing effect
all over the all over the world in fact
it's not the kind of thing usually study
but when the American and British troops
carried out what's called liberating
Europe which we celebrated in some ways
should celebrate but there were other
aspects of it which weren't so great so
the first thing they had to do their
primary task
was to destroy the anti-fascist
resistance the anti-fascist resistance
was worker and peasant based and pretty
radical a kind of right spirit of
radical democracy that had to be
demolished so as American British troops
moved up the Italian peninsula first
move into the into the the mainland they
they had to dismantle the resistance the
resistance movements and what they had
established like in northern Italy
they'd basically taken it over it was
worker and peasant run a worker managed
to factories and so on and the British
and Americans were not going to tolerate
that remember these were liberal
administration's with a Labour
government in England Liberal Democrats
here but that wasn't going to be
tolerated so that was all dismantled and
the traditional order was reestablished
including fascist collaborators same
same thing happening Greece but much
worse in Greece it just ended up being a
massacre maybe higher up 50,000 people
killed and similar actions were taken
throughout the areas that were conquered
something similar happened here right
after the war there was a man of the
business world was scandalized by the
radicalization of the 40s and the 50s
and 40s which was changing a appeared to
be changing a long tradition of business
domination and they said in motion major
programs to try to beat back these
popular movements and it continues right
up to this moment the last 30 years have
been a new phase an effort to try to
drive drive out the attitudes these
opinions and beliefs structures that
were democratizing the society there's
been a major attack on democracy and
freedom particular
the 60s were a break the 60s did
civilized the society in a lot of ways
one imagined that bringing women more or
less into mainstream society you might
remember that as late as 1975 women
still didn't have a guaranteed right
even to serve on juries that's lots of
changes have taken place a lot of it
through soon action but there was an
immediate move made right after the 60s
to beat back this new wave and it's
across the spectrum a lot of it had to
do with universities that was if you
haven't done it yet I'd urge you to read
some of the documents from the period so
in the early 1970s from across the
spectrum from the right to the liberal
internationalists left the same
essentially the same views were
expressed the view that there's too much
democracy that people are participating
too much in the political system the
so-called special interests meeting most
of the population are pressing for the
rights that should be allowed and
particularly that there's a problem with
what was called the institutions
responsible for the indoctrination of
the young that's not my phrase that's
the phrase from the liberal end of the
spectrum the sector that filled the
Carter Administration for example
actually I'm quoting a Harvard professor
Samuel Huntington who was the author of
part of a study called the crisis of
democracy about how to impose more
moderation and democracy to drive people
back to passivity and obedience you go
to the right wing it's much harsher if
you haven't done it I urge you to take a
look on the internet at very significant
than
random by Lewis Powell Powell was
corporate lobbyists later appointed the
Supreme Court by Richard Nixon and he
wrote a very important memorandum very
influential memorandum I think 1971
which he wrote actually to the Chamber
of Commerce the main business lobby and
what he told the Chamber of Commerce is
he said the entire free enterprise
system the basis of our Liberty is under
attack the university's the media the
government have all been taken over
literally is very paranoid but it
reflects the attitude they've been taken
over by left-wing extremists who were
going to destroy our freedoms it's a
little bit like listening to Mitt Romney
and the rest of them today the only
choices he said are between freedom free
enterprise or bureaucratic regulation of
our lives by the state and they're
winning they've taken over everything
they're destroying free enterprise he
said the businessmen he said are the
group that have the least influence in
the country on government on the economy
and everything else and he said we've
got to do something to mobilize and the
core part was the university's the
institutions responsible for the
indoctrination of the young he said
after all we the business world have the
resources that we have the money you
know we fund them that we pay them weird
that what's now called job graders I
mean profit creators and so we have the
money so we've got to mobilize and
organize and do something about it and
right at that point this kind of common
conception across the spectrum that did
lead to many significant changes which
you're living in right now so it takes a
student debt debt is now as you probably
know / / trillion dollars that's more
than credit card debt that's phenomenal
well that's a crucial way of
dealing with the failure of the
institutions responsible for
indoctrination of the young you come out
of college with a heavy debt you're
trapped that's the rest of your life
maybe you want it to be say a public
interest lawyer when you way into
Harvard but you come out with tens of
thousands of dollars of debt just going
to have to go into a corporation to pay
off your debt you get trapped in the
corporate culture it's the end of that
and it generalizes it's supposed to
generalize across the society very
that's the point at time in fact early
70s when debt started to when college
tuition started to go through the roof
by now it's outlandish and it isn't
instantly not an economic necessity
that's very easy to see so our own
country or on society in the 1950s
that's the period of the greatest growth
50s and 60s greatest economic growth in
history very successful period that
education wasn't entirely free but it
was fairly free so when I went to
college in 1945 University of
Pennsylvania it was a hundred dollars a
year which was a lot of money for
working students which we were but you
could very easily get a scholarship to
pay it and work on the side you could
make out but not like now the effort for
the GI Bill was passed and that brought
a huge number of students would never
have been able to get into college
enabled them to go to college free and
that was a major kind of big effect on
their lives of course but also a major
spur to the development of the society
it's part of the reason why the 50s and
the 60s were such a successful growth
period furthermore if you look at other
countries you can see clearly that it's
not an economic necessity so go across
the border to Mexico that's a poor
country they
it's not like us richest country in the
world they have quite a respectable
higher education system when I
universities electric left her there a
couple times very high standards lively
student body rotten salaries of course
but reasonable facilities you know not
experts stadiums enough anything but
it's free and as a reason why it's free
about ten years ago the government tried
to institute a small tuition there was a
national student strike across the
country beat it back still free in fact
one of the main administration buildings
on the moon on campus is still occupied
it's become a kind of a activist center
on campus this kind of thing in snell is
going on all over the continent now in
Chile there have been major student
strikes for almost a year now which has
become national strikes which are aiming
to undermine the the system of the
system of education that was imposed by
the Pinochet dictatorship which
installed back in 1973 which created
basically a sharply two-tiered
educational system education for the
rich nothing very little for anyone else
that's been very effective it's
spreading through the hemisphere and in
places like Mexico persists in fact it's
more than that Mexico had a left-wing
mayor Mexico City a couple of years ago
and he established a university on in
the city which is not only free but is
open admissions so anybody can go they
have compensatory courses for people who
have to have a little back more
background then they got out of school
and it's pretty good I've lectured there
to met students and features fairly high
standards points these are not economic
issues
same is true in rich countries like
Germany is a rich country education is
free and as I say here it was not free
but very low pay except for the
gentlemen's clubs back in not very long
ago fifties and sixties well but these
but these are effective techniques of
indoctrination you know it yourself and
there are the things like them Sam
mentioned the increasing corporatization
of the universities which is part of the
more general growth in power of
corporate institutions in the society
altogether not that they weren't there
before they were the dominant force in
the society for well over a century but
there's been a big change in the last 30
years it's the change that's symbolized
by the Occupy slogan which is now taken
over everywhere ninety-nine percent 1%
the last 30 years and what both of the
details because you know there's been
virtual stagnation or declined for the
majority of the population plenty of
wealth generated but going into mostly a
fraction of one percent of the
population the financial institutions
and hedge fund managers and so on those
are big changes in the society that by
no means necessary in fact there's a
good monograph that just came out about
it the fencin you might take a look put
out by the economic policy it's too
they're the main monitor of sort of data
on the state of work in America it's
called failure by design and the phrase
by design is perfect but they're talking
about what's reviewing what's happened
in the last 30 years you know all the
data and statistics which most of you
know and they point out it is by design
is it's not required by economic
principles and international
integrations of both globalization it
doesn't require this technology doesn't
it's very explicit planning
design to create a certain kind of
society namely one which is sharply
two-tiered of course in the interest of
the designers it's not a failure for
them they're doing fine and it reaches
the universities in the 50s and the 60s
the funding was from the state or from
state institutions so down the street at
MIT where I am and was since the mid
50's a funding was almost entirely from
the government federal government
through the Pentagon incidentally the
Pentagon funded almost the entire
university up until the 1970s there's a
lot of confusing about that the Pentagon
is a funnel designed to take taxpayer
money and turn it into the next phase of
the high-tech economy so for example at
MIT there was no war work not on campus
almost entirely Pentagon funded but it
was developing things you not take for
granted the internet computers like
electronics that the whole IT revolution
basically state created that people like
Bill Gates and Steve Jobs cherry picked
from the results of public funding and
commercialize it you know become big
heroes and very rich of course but most
of the funding comes from the public it
it was done through the Pentagon because
that's the way you can get taxpayers to
pay for it you have to frighten them it
tilt as a standard technique a control
frighten people then they'll huddle
under the umbrella of power so the
Russians are coming the Chinese are
coming you know whoever it may be the
drug peddlers a im's whatever it may be
and people are frightened it's a very
frightened society it's worked
unfortunately in those days it worked to
take public funds and turn them into
naturally profits for Microsoft Apple
and so on and objects that people like
like I phones and Internet useful
product in the 1970s that'd be kind of
change Pentagon funding declined and
funding from the health related parts of
the federal government National
Institute of Health and others increased
as a reason the economy was changing the
cutting edge of the economy was changing
from electronics based to biology based
and therefore the taxpayer has to fund
the next phase of the advanced economy
by a different means not because the
Russians are coming but because we're
going to cure cancer or something
meanwhile you do a biotechnology and
genetic engineering whatever the next
phase of the economy will be well that's
why Senate another component in the last
30 years has been corporate funding and
that has very interesting effect so
again let me just take MIT I know it
best and three here the corporate
funding has a multiple effect for one
thing it the federal funding say the
Pentagon basically doesn't care what you
do they're the best funders that exist
they do your work incidentally they
don't care what you do politically you
so well in the 60s MIT was about ninety
percent kind of unfunded than the
elaborate that I was in one hundred
percent Pentagon funded it was also the
academic center of act of anti-war
resistant not protest but resistance
they basically didn't care if you want
to overthrow the government that's your
business as long as you're doing your
work but when it moves to corporate
funding it goes towards short term
profits I mean the Pentagon or the
Nationalists of health or the government
generally they are trying to develop the
advanced economy across the board not
because they love advanced technology
but that's where profit comes from in
the next phase a corporation is trying
to fund something for itself not for the
not for the general economy so they want
something and they wanted short-term not
for 30 years from now like you know the
internet for example is in this state
sector for about 30 years before it was
privatized computers were digital
computers were getting built in the
early 50s it was until around nineteen
eighty he came commercially viable and
you know Apple and IBM could make some
profit out of them but the corporation's
want short term benefits and they want
it for themselves not for others so to
be effect on furthermore they in state
they want secrecy the Pentagon didn't
care about secrecy so in fact there was
no secrecy on campus no classified work
now corporations can't order secrecy but
they have ways of imposing it for
example they can threaten not to renew a
contract well that has an effect that
has the desired effect people don't talk
in fact the scandals have come serious
enough to make the front page of The
Wall Street Journal from secrecy at MIT
students refusing to answer questions on
exams because they're bound by a
contract that their professor has not to
release information that they know so
they can't answer the question is it is
also a corporate culture becomes imposed
on the university that's the basis for
what Sam was talking about there's been
a sharp increase in the proportion of
administrators relative to faculty and
students number of administrators
as all over the country incidentally
layer after layer of administration far
be at you very much like corporate
culture decisions over running the
University he used to be pretty much
faculty and now its administration
faculty and also other aspects of
corporate culture that are introduced or
what's called efficiency efficiency is
it's called an economic notion but
that's highly misleading it's an
ideological notion so for example if say
a business sheds employees like say an
airline and you want to get a ticket for
something or rather when you talk to a
person it's a it works but it's
inefficient because they have to pay
more if you call up and you get a menu
and you sit there for half an hour and
while a voice says I think you know we
love your business hang on and finally
you get something that isn't what you
wanted so you have to try something else
you've all had this kind of experience
all over the place economists don't call
that a cost because it's transferred to
people on things that are transferred to
people aren't costs but it's a efficient
for the for the business and that
corporate culture goes to the
universities and reaches what Sam was
talking about you cut back increase the
number administrators that cut back
class size uses a cheap temporary easily
exploitable labor what's called graduate
students to teach courses and you know
all of these things have a cost but the
cost is transferred to students to
faculty to just people and it saves it
sufficient from the point of view of the
funders the people who Justice Powell
was talking about the businessmen who
essentially fund the university we've
now reached the stage where public
education is practically disappearing
more than half the states that by now
already majority of the in the state
colleges and universities most of the
funding is coming from tuition if
tuition is going sky-high community
colleges are still funded but it's
predicted that they'll disappear too and
that the whole concept of publicly
funded universities will disappear the
universities will be for the rich and
for the rest it will be vocational
education so maybe get a job and that
will impose passivity discipline and
obedience well these are principles that
go very far back I won't run through the
history but in the 19th century when the
mass education system was just beginning
in the united states that ralph waldo
emerson wrote about it than he he raised
the question why our political leaders
interested in educating people and he
said well they have a good answer and we
have to educate them to keep them from
our throats in other words if we let
them be free and independent they're not
going to let us do to them what we are
doing and of course that means a
specific kind of education education for
passivity obedience discipline it has an
aim now it's called No Child Left Behind
that's essentially what it is that it
goes all the way up to the universities
who somewhat resisted but not entirely
and you can go back even earlier finish
with a earlier discussion of it by David
Hume in the century earlier
eighteenth-century pick a look at his
first principles of government
government one of the basic principles
of what he says is that he's astonished
by the easiness with which the mass of
the population submits to the few
he says this kind of paradox because
power is in the hands of the governed
just what you said about 68 powers in
the hands of the governed and the only
way that the rulers can maintain their
control is by control of opinion and
attitudes and that's true in the most
free and the democratic society and in
the most military and brutal same all
the way power is in the hands of the
governor they have to be educated to
keep them from our throats and educated
in a particular way corporatization is
one way of doing it tuition rises to
make sure that the institution is
responsible for the indoctrination a
young do the job is another way of doing
it and you can struggle against it and
you can win and we can see it right here
Harvard is not what it was 60 years ago
when I was a student same across the
country and that's because people didn't
well first of all it's not my concept
that goes back at least to David human
not just quoted it and there's a
everyone understands it everyone in
power understands what Hume said you
can't really control it sometimes you
can control people what force they have
an extremely violent brutal society but
most of the time power really is in the
hands of the general population so you
have to control their attitudes and
opinions in the case of the Occupy
movement it's been kind of interesting
to watch I frankly have been a little
bit surprised that a lot of the coverage
has been pretty sympathetic that's been
strikingly to Andrew in the business
press so the main business journal in
the world the most important significant
business daily is the London Financial
Times he'd take a look at it and is
across the ocean so it's not right in
front of them but they've had a series
of quite sympathetic articles about the
Occupy movement now of course they
choose what they like you know they're
not talking about the effort to
overthrow capitalism you know they pick
things that they like what they say
something like that has to be done I
mean they know for example they know
very well that say the economic problems
in American society are not what's on
the front pages I mean you can read the
major world's most respected financial
correspondent Martin willfully of London
with Financial Times he says look it's
totally crazy the United States
completely under taxed the level of the
ratio of taxes to GDP is the lowest it's
ever been way below the Reagan
administration and of course the rich
aren't barely being taxed they said sure
this is obviously going to cause
economic problems but is an obvious way
to get out of it trivially they also
understand very well that the problem of
the United States incidentally this
generalized to Europe is not a deficit
problem
that may be a problem for the banks but
it's not a problem for the society from
for the Society's joblessness and which
need is stimulus government stimulus to
create demand of jobs well you know when
these things are brought out by the
occupant they also understand very well
that inequality while it may be great
for you know fraction of one percent is
terrible for the economy and the society
so when the Occupy movement puts issues
like that to the fore it actually does
get picked up this is a resonance and
even the business press of course they
don't like the idea that popular
movements might form and develop and
communities of solidarity and mutual
support which might expand into the rest
of the society and have large scale
effects they don't like that part but
the reporting has been moderately some
if it were sympathetic than I would have
expected frankly and of course there's
the you know derision and once you get a
job and take a shower and all that kind
of stuff but that's predictable when
there's been no just kind of love that
stuff off for me I think it's an
indication of the fact that uh you know
things have been brought up have been
brought to the fore in the Occupy
movements which have a lot of resonance
and in fact a big challenge of the
movement right now is to move beyond the
tactics that have worked so
spectacularly well and to find a way to
bring the general population into this
and that's going to be a problem serious
problem take a look at this morning's
New York Times is an interesting study
of a couple of interesting studies one
of them is about the people who are
reliant on benefit or called benefit but
don't but want to get the government off
our backs and it talks about their
dilemmas they get the government off our
backs
starve I get health care about we don't
want to have a government interfering
with us that's a lot of the public
incidentally and it's an indication of
the success of the few like
manufacturing consent or control of
opinion and attitudes it's left people
extremely confused you take a look at
say teak poles of tea party members
turns out their Social Democrats
literally they think there ought to be
more government spending on education on
health but get the government off our
backs you know there's some interesting
take a look at these kind of interesting
they're against welfare everybody's
against welfare but they're in favor of
more aid to women with dependents with
dependent children for example just not
welfare okay that's another great
propaganda achievement Regan particular
succeeded in developing an image of
welfare which nobody's in favor of you
know rich black woman driven a limousine
to welfare office by our chauffeur to
pick up your hard-earned money well
nobody wants that but giving aid to the
same disabled women widows women with
children that can't support so mature in
favor of that and this runs across the
board is another article in the time so
they was extremely illuminating it's a
poll they ran a poll of people's
attitudes towards what are called
entitlements okay and the purpose of the
article is to show how confused people
are at which it actually does so their
conception of you know the the burden of
Social Security and Medicare is kind of
way out of proportional with the facts
actually are but what is not discussed
in the article and this gets back to
manufacture of consent is the
contribution of this very article
towards controlling attitudes and
opinions you all know that the answer is
you get a nap old event on
since you asked so take a look at the
questions they're asking and the
presuppositions which are across the
board first freeze opposition is the
problem is federal spending you know
we've got to speak problem the deficit
and then second question is what's
causing it well the first problem is not
a problem that's again a problem for the
banks certainly not a problem for the
society as I say and read that in the
Financial Times that Larry Summers for
former president here he'll tell you
same thing it's not that's not the
problem but that's the presupposition of
the article is that's the problem then
comes the question about what's causing
the deficit well they say it's Medicare
which is not totally false but there's a
reason for it Medicare costs are going
out of sight and will swamp the budget
because we have a totally dysfunctional
privatized health care system if the
United States had a health care system
like other industrial societies not
exactly a utopian ideal not I would
there be no deficit to be surplus but
you can't raise that question similar
you can't point out that a huge
component of the deficit is a bloated
military budget which has nothing to do
with defense but as plenty to do with
conquest so those questions just just
can't ask and then you get specific
questions and you show public confused
about the data yeah minor confusion on
the part of the public but much worse
confusion on the baby ideological
commitment on the part of the opinion
managers editors and writers in new york
times and everyone else like them you
know so manufacturing consents going on
all the time and it's the way to
organize and control people but nothing
novel event
second Josh we're going to try to field
a couple questions at a time in the
interest of times just so it'd make sure
that we can accommodate all questions is
that all right finish with that Johnston
episode Josh should dr. Chauncey you
talked about the need to instructed
people this concept being obsequious
two universities I'm wondering specially
undergraduate education where it's moved
from kind of the humanities and the arts
to these majors at service kind of
service industries maybe on it was
fairly lengthy so it's it's difficult to
hear the questions for dr. turkey so I
is it do people might just kind of
coming up and asking the question with
inputs yeah yeah just the talk to the
audience both ways yeah yeah I can
gather here may not be hearing yesterday
through there so right anyway um dr.
Chomsky mentioned the need to teach
obedience and that working all the way
up into the university level and I'm
wondering and I bet you've noticed that
humanity at the education you get as an
undergraduate isn't the same as it was
60 years ago it's moved from you know
the humanities and the arts into these
majors that feed into service industries
and I'm wondering if that kind of
corporate culture in terms of what
people are learning is undergraduates is
related to the need to teach people how
to be obsequious basically well I think
I think it varies so in places like say
Harvard and MIT of the Cambridge
University's it's probably not true
because it you know this is a standard
joke which you've probably all heard
that at Harvard they teach people how to
rule the world and at MIT they teach
people how to make the world work you
know well there's something to that and
that means you've got to train them to
do it but that
something about kind of a undergraduate
education you have but if you go to most
of the educational system it's going
just in the direction you're describing
that's part of the effect of the tuition
verizon and the lack of state funding so
take say the state of california they
had the greatest public education system
in the world i feei i happen to go from
mexico city because i'm angela is
lecturing to berkeley where was gonna
lecture that's from a poor country to
the richest place in the world the
richest place in the world they're
taking what had been quite a spectacular
public education system and destroying
it the major universities Berkeley Los
Angeles UCLA are being essentially
privatized they're becoming Ivy League
colleges you know huge tuitions big
endowments essentially colleges for the
wealthy privileged and the rest of the
state system which was a great system is
being thumbed down to vocational
education to training people to for
services and so on there's also been a
tremendous appeal there's another effect
of the socio-economic system so as you
all know the financial institutions have
just grown way out of any relevance to a
functioning economy back in the 50s and
60s big growth periods and they were
banks doing the kind of things banksters
supposed to do in a state capitalist
society now complicated financial
manipulations exotic devices about forty
percent of corporate profits before the
last crash again martin wolf as i said
the most respected financial
correspondent in the world he just
describes the financial institutions as
like larvae who attach themselves to a
host and eat it out and destroy it the
host is the market system which he of
course applauds and you know they're
having that effect
to one consequence is that they're
drawing a tremendous amount of talent so
a lot of universities may be here MIT
for example the math department has
separate sub departments in the
financial mathematics where people with
talented mathematicians of quite a lot
of them are being drawn away from
productive work either creating new
mathematics or physics or whatever will
be towards figuring out how to cheat
people and subprime mortgages that has
multiple harmful effects on the econ on
the society all kinds of and that's
happening all over so that's drawing
people away but I think the basic thing
that's happening is what you described
and that starts with kindergarten so k
to 12 programs are now increasingly
geared towards control and obedience I'm
sure you've all experienced this that's
what No Child Left Behind means you're
studying for tests you memorize for test
you forget it all because he didn't care
about it and it's not the way to learn
anything it's been well understood those
of you who are scientists and who read
journals like science the main journal
the American Academy for the Advancement
of science the last month or so they've
had a series of editorials by the the
editor on how science education is being
destroyed by teaching people from you
know how to six-year-olds to memorize
what's in the periodic table they don't
know what they're talking about so they
can then pass a test and teaching them
the lists of enzymes when they don't
understand what it's all about and
that's been going on actually for quite
a while I mean I'm sure you've
experienced it but you know I noticed it
with my own children back in
sixties I remember that his daughter who
was studying new math in wolf called new
math back around 16 1970s and it was a
joke the teacher they were being taught
what was called set theory the teacher
didn't understand a word of it of course
the students understood nothing the kids
couldn't learn how to do long division
of course they come from families where
their parents could teach them to bus
and sober my wife went in to observe the
class to see what the heck was going on
the teacher was standing there in front
of the class of the text a new mass text
which was giving you a principled
approach to long division of the kind
that they'd like you to know in the
Harvard Graduate Department of math but
she didn't understand it the kids didn't
understand it and his disaster that one
last story I and I think this is the way
it works across the board we had a visit
from an old friend of mine was Israeli
logician and my daughter who was in 10 i
think was studying with the call set
theory actually boolean algebra and he
was surprised because he'd been trying
to teach it and more advanced courses in
in Israel and I couldn't wasn't
succeeding but she seemed to be learning
it so she answered the questions he
asked like he asked if you have three
objects you know coffee cup you know a
book pencil whatever how many sets are
there to write off eight set I said and
she listed the sets including the null
said that he asked which set is included
in all the other sets they should
indulge it at that point I was surprised
so I asked her how do you know that the
null set is included in all the other
states she's very simple to make a set
what you do is draw braces and put the
things that are in the set inside it if
you look carefully there's always a
little space between the things you put
in there that's where the null set go
while she was doing something very
sensible she was making up a physical
model to explain it actually nothing to
do with what she was being taught of
course but you made of a physical model
that kind of got her through the exam
well you know that's the way you can
you're going to be taught on a No Child
Left Behind system you memorize you
figure out things that will get you
through then you'll learn anything you
can't explore you can't be imaginative
and sure that'll turn people into just
what you described actually just came
back from Arizona and one of the things
the state is doing there is and it's
happening elsewhere is to try it that
just what they're doing is destroying a
very successful Mexican Studies program
it's a bit it's basically occupied
Mexico that's we had a call arizona new
mexico and california but and the big
mexican population at a very lively
mexican studies program lot of students
taking it it's injury it enriches that
meant everyone else they learn things
they ought to learn the growth and
understanding but state doesn't want
they want indoctrination and they're
actually getting to the point of banning
books they've been called a forever for
example they've been even banta tempest
Shakespeare's Tempest because that's too
much of a kind of anti-colonial element
in well that's what goes on when you
tried it and it's happening here too you
know a destruction of bilingual programs
and so it's pretty particularly dramatic
there you know all of these I think are
ways to achieve what you were describing
for the elite to make sure that they
know how to rule the world and make the
world work but for the rest turn them
into servants
I don't think so i think in the essence
of time will typically dr. Joffe as you
probably are aware northern Basque
region of Spain boasts one of the
largest worker-owned cooperatives in the
world or 30,000 employees 1020 256
different companies what can be done
here in the United States to sort of
strong neck kind of parallel universe if
you will and how can that also be
employed in academia where we can
actually extricate people like yourself
from the administrative process and
start to start education cooperatives
that bring costs down get the message
that's where he was talking about
Mondragon this huge worker-owned big
manufacturing financial community system
in the best country in Spain and it's a
it's a very it's it is everything
manufacturing banks schools hospitals
communities it's absolutely not worker
managed it's not worker managed which is
a big gap and problem so they it's
worker-owned but they've picked
professional managers which means it
actually functions like the capitalist
institution and that's another important
step we iww people you know we don't
agree with that but it is it is very
important and not only can it be done
here it is being done so there's not so
small the especially in Ohio around
Cleveland which actually is an old
labour town with you know a lot of labor
traditions that's why somebody like
Dennis percentage can be elected around
the Cleveland there's a quite a
substantial array of work around
enterprises they're not huge it's not
one dragon but it's a lot and their
expanded actually is a very good book on
it though
alperovitz who I think is going to be
speaking here not from distant future
and it can be done right here in fact if
the Occupy movement had been around say
a year ago but there was a case that it
could have helped out with then I think
there are others all the time at one of
the Boston suburbs taunton there was a
one of some multinational it was closing
down a subsidiary a pretty sophisticated
manufacturing firm which is doing fine
it was profitable but for a
multinational unless your profits are
high enough it's not worth keeping on
the books so they were going to close it
down the workers the Union which that
youive was kind of a mildly left the
Union they and the workers wanted to buy
it if there had been enough support it
was closed they didn't win but if they'd
been community support and popular
support I think they could have won and
things like that are happening all the
time so far as educational cooperatives
are concerned there's a fundamental
issue that goes back again to the 18th
century will run through the history
whose education for who is it for you
know well you go back to the 19th
century it was working people were quite
highly educated if you want to know
something about it there's a terrific
book by Jonathan rose called the I don't
forget what schools about the British
working classes and it's a detailed
scholarly investigation of what working
people were reading in England and it
turns out you know pirates hype that
it's high culture I can remember this
myself I'm old enough to remember the
30s and my family are mostly unemployed
working class they were talking about
Shakespeare plays you know the latest
concert of the Budapest string quartet
the differences between Freud and
steckel these people never went
never in school not been in graduate
elementary school and at that time
intellectual left-wing intellectuals and
academics Muslim around the Communist
Party were involved in worker education
so there were books like mathematics for
the millions or husbands or you know JD
Bernal well-known scientist was
publishing general science and math
looks quite good good ones and in other
fields to when this was going right into
the workers education programs its kind
of thing that working people did it's
taken a lot of effort to drive this out
of people's heads and it is real effort
if you go back to the early industrial
revolution right around here eastern
Massachusetts it was normal I mean an
Irish blacksmith and Boston he had
enough money would hire a boy to read to
him while he's working and to read
classics orkin with contemporary
literature of the time we now regarded
as classics and the the young women in
the mills factory girls that were called
bitterly condemned condemned the rising
industrial system for a lot of reasons
with one because it was just taking away
their high culture which was turning
them into automata it's been a long
battle to try to turn people into
obedient passive creatures and it's kind
of like Marx's old mole that keeps
coming up no matter how much you push it
down and I think it could be revived
today there's no reason why working
people can't participate in high culture
like anyone else and this the edge
educational cooperative be a way of
doing the way of reconstructing the
kinds of worker education programs that
were all over the place not that long
ago 1930s
the role of leadership in movements I I
personally other things for a bit these
centralized leadership structure so I
think well I'm being encouraged I think
to respond so I you know I I think maybe
I'll make a brief answer and if you want
to build off of that I think that the
entire concept of leadership is sort of
interesting the way that it's discussed
when it comes to social movements and I
think that often movements have much
less of a leadership core historically
then we remember them having and if you
certainly look at it on a much more
individualized level in terms of ways
that people participate in collective
action and way that ways that
mobilizations are actually composed of
individuals that are there and that
participate in various scales of the
movement and that identify invariant
with various scales of the movement
there's this this tendency that we as
scholars and and and in the media and in
generally this tendency that we lean
towards where we want to say well who's
in charge here who was in charge of the
movement and who were the leaders right
you know where's the root eadicicco the
Martin Luther King jr. but you know how
many people in the civil rights movement
in the United States ever met Martin
Luther King jr. there are a few right
and and to say that they were following
marching orders is absurd right and I
think that this movement is just a bit
dis occupy I think one of the things
that's been so exciting about this is
that it's just a little bit more aware
of itself in terms of you know it's true
we're not always in employment and we're
not always following the same even
necessarily motivation right but we have
common interests and we have common
goals and you know the the problem isn't
within the movement the movement has
been successful this has built
solidarity this has built collaboration
this has built cooperation the only
problem has been
trying to explain to other people who
the leaders are when they want to hear
who the leaders are right the problem
hasn't been that there's been no
leadership so that said I mean I guess
that's the optimistic viewpoint I do
also think that you know there are
social dynamics that happen in groups
and I think that as much as we need to
not worry about trying to frame this in
terms of communication into one where we
can define leaders we also don't want to
pretend that leadership isn't happening
when it is right and so when you have
you know core members that emerge and
you had you feel like you you I don't
know you so please don't think I'm
speaking to you when you feel like I'll
talk to the wall so no one feels thrown
out you feel like you can't speak up or
you feel like your interest wasn't
really represented you know this is a
two-way street right you know collective
action takes bravery and it's really
hard in groups to speak out when you
think that that something isn't going
the way that you want on the other hand
it also takes bravery to compromise and
to listen and to change your mind and a
big part of cooperation well I think a
big part of occupy success rests in
people being able to change being
willing to change their minds at being
willing to listen and saying you know I
came into this GA thinking that this was
the right direction but instead of just
waiting for my turn to argue my point
waiting from for my turn to present my
position I'm really using this as a
place of communication and that's
leadership right listening to someone
else is really what leadership is
listening and and coming together as
leadership so sometimes I mean I know
you have a media reality and you have to
you have to think in terms of leadership
and you have to think in terms of pumps
marketing campaigns sometimes right um
but you know occupy and and this
generation has rejected a lot of norms
and and who says we can't reject
leadership norms to right we're all
leaders I think that that works if you
really believe it
it's going to speak to the kiss of death
penalty following the earlier question
about educational cooperative some
occupy Boston actresses are creating a
cooperative center with several elements
and one element is a truly free and
public at open admission school
sustained by eight from cooperative
business in the schools and offer
courses training teachers for adult
students making for credit through a
relationship with a community college
and my question for both of you is what
would your three curriculum be for such
a school oh well also mine briefly and I
think anybody that's encountered me
knows what I'm know and I'm own the loss
of humanities in education I think that
the humanities are not only where you
learn on it you know what I love science
and math you that's great but you know
it's in the humanities that you you
learn humanity right you're you find joy
and you find sorrow and you find
compassion and you find politics and the
state and your rights and and I think
that you know dr. Chauncey was talking
about you know the literature habits of
the working class of the past and I
really can't emphasize enough how sad it
is that this has been lost right so you
know if you if you have great literature
it makes you think about the ways that
we treat each other and the ways that we
want to be treated and the ways that we
feel right and I don't you know I sound
like a waxing romantic girl up here but
at the end of the day like romance and
love is is enriching in their life and
who wants to create a world where that's
not celebrated and that's not what we
spend our time on so to me education is
a way to find more of that and I think
you know any curriculum that would teach
people how to you know find these these
sources that are going to make them
enjoy their life more and make their
life more enriched on a personal
philosophical spiritual emotional level
is what is what is needed and I also
think that if you
pinned it down what the ideal for
curriculum for any class would be would
be a dialogue it wouldn't be with what I
want the class to be it would be what
the class wants to be right so it would
be a cooperative within the cooperative
I think dr. Chomsky career well you know
that this is a question that goes back
hundreds of years you go back to the
Enlightenment again there were sort of
two views of Education which were
contrasted there was in kind of an
imagery used one image is that education
is like a vessel into which you pour
water and is of course a very linky
vessel as you all know from having been
through the experience the other is that
education is like a string the teacher
lays out a string along which the
student it progresses in their own way a
going where they want so there's some
kind of other some kind of framework and
then within that framework children
adults whatever it is go and explore
okay that's pretty much the way a
graduate science teaching is done but it
can go down to kindergarten and it could
be in the humanities and literature
covina sciences so just give it one
example of a successful program for
kindergarten kids instead of teaching
them to you know memorize the periodic
table of totally meaningless or to learn
boolean algebra whatever it would be the
program that was carried out
successfully for five-year-olds they
were given the task of their each each
kid was given a dish in which there were
seeds pebbles and shells and their task
was to figure out which ones were the
scenes so the first thing they did was
have what was called a scientific
conference the kids all got together and
exchanged ideas about how you would
determine which is a scene
and then they tried out their ideas and
some of them didn't work someone did
work and it went on and it finally ended
up at the end of this this class group
was where they were given magnifying
glasses and we're dissecting figured out
what the scenes were and we're
dissecting the scenes and looking for
the embryo inside that's the source of
nutrition okay those kids learned
something I'll give you an example from
sixth grade history a friend of mine
sixth grade history teacher oh the they
were getting to the point where they
were studying the American Revolution so
what she did was for a couple of weeks
she started acting extremely arbitrary
in class you know forcing the kids to do
things they didn't want to do when
something they got kind of you know
restless and fine with its Gaga
revolution going on in class at that
point you introduce the American
Revolution okay understood it you can do
this on in anything and it really
doesn't matter that much I don't think
what the topic is if you learn how to
discover and search and inquire that can
carry on through your life if you learn
a particular domain might be interesting
but doesn't leave you with much
to be able to get everybody one respect
our panel sign on their agenda cydia
how do you think why we use language
effectively convey our issues with these
systems in a way that doesn't cause
people to avoid hours or on an hour
movement with a bit so accessible from
linguistically what when are we like she
can repeat better oh I can't hear very
well through a microphone soon mmm how
can you use language to effectively
convey your issues with the system that
we're kind of down within as students
without quitting ourselves or kind of
drawing people's memories of the
unsuccessful new resident ask how can
they move beyond the magical um for our
you know purposes okay so how can change
like hugging a use language students or
prevent the move to articulate their
goals without being associated with
unsuccessful movements
well you know language is kind of a
neutral instrument depends that you use
it there are traps like every just about
every word that's used for in social and
political discourse has two meanings it
has its literal meaning and a meaning
that's used for political warfare which
is often quite different that's true of
everything sometimes it's quite
interesting so tech save the notion
person fundamental notion very
interesting to see the way that's
evolved in American law up to the
present and used in a way which in which
is highly significant right now so you
go back to the Magna Carta it says all
free men have certain rights you know
jury trial duper what we call due
process and so on a couple centuries
later that was expanded to free people
when it crosses the Atlantic and enters
the constitutional system it was
modified again it's it's free white men
okay so blacks are out and of course the
indigenous population are out they have
no rights exterminated and women were so
as I mentioned it was until 1975 that
even a guarantee to be on the jury trial
couldn't vote till the nineteen twenties
and so on so it was a person me that the
Fifth Amendment says no person shall be
deprived of rights you know without due
process but didn't mean the indigenous
population didn't mean blacks it didn't
mean native-americans it didn't even
mean it's mean women and it didn't even
mean poor man because you had to you
know it poll taxes and various kinds of
restrictions but when you get to the
Fourteenth Amendment the word has
changed its expanded its again the same
phrase you know
person shall be deprived of right it
technically included freed slaves that
was my technical but within a couple of
years they were back in slavery after
reconstruction but at least technically
it did it even formally get rights for
another century 1960s still excluded
women but it was expanded as you all
know over the next century to include
corporations so without going through
the history when you get up to the
present you look at the recent Supreme
Court cases they both expand and
restrict the notion person it's expanded
to include corporations of Rights way
beyond human you know people flesh and
blood it's also restricted it's
restricted to explicitly to exclude
undocumented aliens they cannot they
don't fall in the category of persons
Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled on
this over the years and the latest is
Russell the Rumsfeld very reason they're
not persons they don't have the right of
free speech they'll have any of the
rights in the Bill of Rights because
they're not persons there what George
Orwell called unpeopled meaning kind of
look like people but it's superficial
they're not people well that's the word
person there you go to any other word
that's used and Chris becomes ridiculous
that takes a terrorist the terror that's
an interesting term became particularly
interesting since Reagan the reagan came
into office declaring a war on terror
core issue and policy has to be a
struggle against international terrorism
and so on well that the question is
what's terrorism well it happens to be a
definition in the u.s. code and in the
british law that an army manual can't
use that definition i've been writing
about terror ever since then
use that definition but it's out of the
cannon because if you use that
definition it immediately follows that
the United States is one of the leading
terrorist source of terror in the world
okay that won't work so an academic
discipline is developed of terrorism
studies you know academic conferences
big books professional departments
trying to find a definition of the word
terror which will meet the crucial
condition that it excludes what we do to
them and includes what they do to us and
it's tricky so you get the weight
terrorist is used now without discussion
it is pretty shocking so as for example
Nelson Mandela was on the terrorist list
until about two years ago and the reason
was because reagan was supporting
apartheid so therefore the AMC was one
of the more notorious terrorist groups
in the world this one ok the first case
to come to westfeld trial under Obama
from Guantanamo a military court of
course the first case was Omar Fattah
that tackled take a look at in the
internet homer kata is a 15 year old
child whose crime was to try to defend
his village when it was attacked by
American soldiers in Afghanistan so he
spent eight years in Bagram and
Guantanamo and you know what that's like
then he came to try all he was given two
choices either plead guilty and he have
another eight years or plead innocent
you stay here for the rest of your life
ok he pleaded guilty now he's got
another eight years that's a terrorist
who has to be imprisoned for 16 years
under hideous conditions because he
tried to defend this village his own
village when it was attacked by American
soldiers and try to find anyone who even
bats an eyelash
this side and discuss well okay that's
terror and you just go down the list and
it's the same thing if you one of the
interesting the words in the last 20
years really has been jobs with the
first there's a word you're not allowed
to pronounce in the United States it's a
dirty word I'll spell it PR 0 F ites
that's unpronounceable the way you
pronounce it is jobs it's literally so
you hear it all over now that job
creators meaning the private creators
they don't produce job and that's so
across the board of course you have to
get out of these traps but it's so you
can a perfectly well understand it those
are means of ideological control
unfortunately that's all the questions
we can take now we really apologize for
all the new litter or take down staff go
to the inches of time and finishing the
rest of the summit and respect for our
speakers we're going to clear our Q&A
session so if I could get a really big
warm round
