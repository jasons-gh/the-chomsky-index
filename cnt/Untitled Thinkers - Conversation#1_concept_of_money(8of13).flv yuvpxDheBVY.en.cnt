I think in the end obviously money is in
exchange form that we we use to simplify
the process by which we obtain goods in
exchange for our services but and at
that level monetary system provides us
obviously enables us to get what we need
to live but beyond that what is the real
value of money beyond what you need just
to survive the purpose then is to see
what you can do that's good in the world
with it leading an institution which
asks people to give their money to
invest in social good I I really believe
in that model because it is what it is
what we do so people put in money we
generate knowledge and we communicate
knowledge and and what's remarkable
about universities of course is that
every year they send out this incredible
group of young people that are going out
with their minds full of wonderful new
thoughts and knowledge to make a
positive contribution in the world oh
man that's what's remarkable them
the concept of money well money was
invented at a certain level of
complexity of the economy when it just
becomes too cumbersome do barter so if
you have something that I want say
computer I want to take a computer from
you and I have something you want maybe
an honor of you we could exchange with
how to be extremely cumbersome on the
other hand the simple way of exchanging
mainly having a common medium of
exchange which we both accept and using
that common medium which happens to be a
couple of pieces of paper it's a lot
easier and over the course of time money
evolved to play that role that's a lot
more complicated than that patience I
mean even getting to a single currency
for a particular country to belong
claude levi-strauss and famous
anthropologist remember once as a
graduate student going to listen to the
talk of his which i thought was a joke
but i guess it wasn't in which he argued
this is like 60 years ago so my memory
may not be exactly right i know he wrote
it up he argued that humans have three
modes of interchange one of them is
language another is money a third is
women he says if you look at cultures
they will have some language which is
very kind of light you know a word
doesn't weigh anything so very fast
communication with words money is a
little bit heavier more cumbersome so
the interaction is slower women in many
cultures is just like once a generation
so then plenty of cultures a woman is
handed over to another family in
exchange for something that's received
by the donor family and then the woman
becomes may be the slave of her
mother-in-law or something like that
that's communication and over generation
I could see what he's talking about
concept of money
arises in the context that there is no
culture that exists in its isolation
and that cultures have been interacting
with each other whether on poverty terms
whether one emerges at times as dominant
and other as lesser as less dominant the
reality is there is been a coexistence
of cultures all the time but for that
exchange to take place there is an
aspect of our lives particularly as it
related to the material aspect of our
world that was so easy to be translated
into commodities and around with the
exchange took place so many sits at the
Nexus of a very perceivable material
exchange taking place between cultures
and communities it is therefore an
extremely useful instrument and a
facilitator but like all instruments you
can use it for your own destruction or
for building and if you therefore take
everything and reduce it to a commodity
you'll be diminishing yourself so money
for me has been is and remains an
extremely useful mechanism and tool to
facilitate that exchange but i do not
want us to end up worshipping it
