hi I'm Tammy okay and you're in the
stream today
how is u.s. foreign policy impacting
israeli-palestinian conflict we'll ask
the author and activist Noam Chomsky
Noam Chomsky author activist academic an
professor emeritus of linguistics at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
for decades he has been a vocal critic
of u.s. foreign policy especially in the
israeli-palestinian conflict
he's also the author of many books
including Gaza in crisis so Noam welcome
to the stream it is great to have you
thank you very much now as always in the
stream we have Malika Palau she is our
digital producer a little bit of extra
spice though in the way that we connect
with that community today I think we
both love these type of shows because
we're joined by a few extra people so
today standing by in our stream hangout
we have a group of people ready to chat
with Professor Chomsky today we have
Dania helu in Memphis Tennessee
max marker in New York City Jacob
Patterson Stein in Washington DC and
Yaqoob corrupt in Los Angeles now you at
home you can be part of this
conversation too just use the hashtag AJ
stream the US Secretary of State John
Kerry said this recently professor we
also believe that any process to resolve
the crisis in Gaza in a lasting and
meaningful way must lead to the
disarmament of Hamas and all terrorist
groups so he said that just recently
what would be your response to that line
of thinking to ask the resistance to
disarm while they're under brutal attack
is not a very serious proposal this is
quite independent of whether one
approves or disapproves of particular
Hamas policies Hamas has general
policies I think are represented for
example by its agreement to join the
unity government that's what set off the
last latest range of Israeli atrocities
go back a couple of months Fatah and
Hamas formed the unity government and
Hamas agreed within that unity
government to accept every demand every
demand of the so-called quartet
the United States European Union United
Nations and Russia that means basically
the United States the United States had
demands and recognition of Israel and
the violence and so on
Hamas agreed to be part of a government
which would accept all of those demands
that instantly led to a violent reaction
on the part of the Israeli government
became even more extreme when the United
States gave mild support for it and that
lid right on to the latest assault
against Gaza that goes back to the
deeper reasons that go back to the Oslo
accord and go back to the early 90s the
Oslo Accords they explicitly determined
that Gaza and the West Bank are a single
territorial entity whose integrity
cannot be broken called for a passage
between them to ensure that they could
be a single entity Israel and the United
States instantly sought to separate the
two and they've been doing so ever since
a lot of the tweets look a little
something like this from Azaz Vaz who
says we see the cycle of violence
erupting in Gaza every free few years
and yet Israel has failed to disrupt it
what did they gain so all of the
questions are on this topic and what I
want to pivot off of that to our hangout
where there's a similar question from
Danya and Dania is speaking to us from
Memphis Tennessee and and Dania I know
that you studied Noam Chomsky's work for
your thesis you recently graduated so go
ahead and ask your question I was
wondering nayoung Chomsky um why does BU
I'm not monitor and manage the Gaza as a
green soap zone and what would it take
for it to do so the United the United
Nations is not an independent act
it can act only so far as the great
powers permitted to do so and that means
primarily the United States
so in effect insofar as the United
States authorizes and tolerates UN
action it can act and the United States
does not tolerate very much you can see
that from the record so for example
simply take the most recent you know a
United States veto of a Security Council
resolution
by Obama in February 2011 that
resolution in effect called for
implementation of official US policy
opposition to expanding the settlements
notice that that's not the real issue
the issue is the settlements not
expansion of there's a very mild
resolution calling for implementation of
US policy the United States vetoed it
take the most recent vote of the UN
Human Rights Council calling for an
independent investigation of the latest
conflict was passed unanimously with one
negative vote the United States as long
as that continues the United States the
United Nations is constrained and its
ability to act in this or any other
situation I want to share with you a
headline from The Times of Israel from
August the 5th Obama approves 225 and
million dollars in Iron Dome funding if
you add up all of the military aid that
goes to Israel right now for each year's
about 3.1 a billion dollars so there are
some critics who are saying about the
u.s. how can they broker peace in the
Middle East between Israelis and
Palestinians and also fund as well it's
a question that came up in a State
Department briefing have a listen to
this no
how do you think that continuing to
supply or when you're done okay how do
you can think that continuing to supply
ammunition is not furthering this
conflict because that's a simplistic
reading of what this
military-to-military relationship is
like recently resupply allies and
partners and friends that we have a
military to military relationship with
when there are requests to do so that is
an ongoing process and a fairly routine
process that's it hasn't you know that
doesn't in any way further the conflict
so no what is your take on the u.s.
being both peace brokers and also
funders to Israel in terms of military
aid and lots of other kind of aid as
well how does that even work well the
military it is quite explicit I mean as
you said Obama he's recently released
additional military aid Israel and it's
important to look at the context the
Obama issued a declaration criticizing
calling for moderation by both sides and
coupled it with an announcement that new
military aid is going to Israel this
incidentally is at a moment when US jet
planes are smashing Gaza to rubble so
let's send them more munitions meanwhile
pretending to be what sometimes called
an honest broker actually Israel's
lawyer and this has been going on for 40
years nothing new there's a persistent
policy of that kind with very rare
exceptions the United States is also
acting unilaterally the very few
countries support this European Union
tepidly goes along most of the time the
international world is strongly opposed
that should be mentioned that all of
this is not only in violation of
international law but it's in violation
of US law the US law quite explicitly
bans provision of arms to any military
units
organizations that are engaged in
systematic human rights violations and
there isn't the slightest doubt that
Israel is using the human the u.s. arms
for human rights violations so the US
government is in strict violation of US
law the so-called Laidlaw senator lay
and also international law and there's
also making very clear that it's a
pretense of being some kind of a neutral
brokers called honest broker is just
pure cynicism violations of US law our
community is asking well why does the
support continue so professor Chomsky on
Twitter one person says if normal
hardworking Americans asked what they
want to give their tax dollars to Israel
the answer would be no but as less than
on Twitter says this is linked to us
internal politics who wants to lose
election so professor Chomsky would you
agree with the sentiment that the
majority of the taxpayer base the US
citizens may not be as in support of
these policies as their politicians are
well in this case there are the polls
which are pretty consistent shows that a
substantial majority of Americans
support US policy towards Israel recall
that important to bear in mind that
Americans see the media presentation of
this issue which is quite different from
what's actually happening so for example
what I just said recently is almost
inexpressible in the US media but that
proportion is diminishing support for US
policies in in Israel Palestine is
diminishing and first furthermore the
demographics are important among younger
people it's changed very substantially
so by now the support for us
actions with regard israel-palestine is
much smaller among younger people and in
fact on college campuses support
Palestinian solidarity is actually one
of the biggest issues now it's a big
change in the last 10 or 15 years
professor if you look at the difference
between Republicans and the difference
between Democrats doesn't make any
difference who the commander in chief is
regarding the u.s. relations with Israel
have you noticed over the years that
changing in any way it's a complicated
situation by now the Republicans are
considerably more supportive of the
Israeli crimes than the Democrats are
that's not a huge difference but it is a
striking difference and different from
the past a large part of the reason for
that is that for various reasons the
Republican Party has moved so far off
the political spectrum that it's finding
it difficult to obtain voters to support
its actual policies the actual policies
are radical support for corporate power
and private wealth can't get votes that
way so they've been compelled to
mobilize sectors of the population that
have always been there but have never
been a organized political force like
for example the evangelical Christians
or nationalist elements who fear that
we're being attacked by all kinds of
foreigners and so on and so forth that
has given a very contractionary slant to
its added to the reactionary slant of
the Republican Party and it's
contributed to their support of Israel
important to remember as well that the
primary constituency of both parties is
of course the business community and
they're pretty supportive of Israel take
a look at investment patterns they
continue to flow towards Israel fairly
substantially a Warren Buffett Intel
their industry of course very close ties
to Israel all of this and there's a
there are there's a a pact of effective
lobby which adds to this their many
factors that contribute to the
traditional support for Israeli policies
but it is diminishing I can tell you how
to just from my own experience quite
dramatically up until a few years ago I
literally used to have police protection
on campus but college campuses when I
was talking about this matter that even
in my own campus last ten or fifteen
years that's changed enormously by now
as I mentioned this is Palestinian
solidarity is one of the major issues on
campus professor you mentioned those
campuses and we have a few members that
are hango who aren't that far away from
campuses themselves so max I want to go
to you for your question sure professor
Chomsky I know that you just mentioned
AIPAC and that organization and
like-minded ones have sort of had a
chokehold over the narrative coming out
of the American Jewish community for a
long time so I want to explore if you
think that we're approaching any sort of
a meaningful turning point there as
perhaps younger American Jews are
becoming more progressive or left on
this issue you're indicating from this
Pew poll that you think that younger
Americans are starting to change their
views on this so particularly what can
young Americans or young American Jews
do to sort of get closer towards the
reflection point that you seem to hope
for well the general tendency that I
mentioned among the population as a
whole is also quite manifest in the
Jewish population and this is fairly
intensively studied so there's good
polling results on it and among American
Jews younger ones there's a very
significant change over the past roughly
10-15 years distancing themselves from
support for Israel and also often
distancing themselves from any Jewish
connections altogether
so for example in her marriages
increasing very rapidly but that the
general fact is that Israeli crimes have
become so extreme that they're
inconsistent with the more or less
liberal attitudes held by young American
Jews and many Americans so it's harder
and harder to reconcile in your mind
support for Israel with your own general
attitudes and that's a striking change
over the years and may indicate a change
in government policy over time if
activist efforts are taken effectively
to immobilize the population on these
issues so for example what you mentioned
what we were talking about before the
u.s. arms to Israel as I said that's in
strict violation of US law international
law of course and moral principles as
well that's a very could be a very
effective organizing technique not only
to end the dispatch of American arms to
carry out extreme crimes but also as an
opening to discussing the opening the
inquiry and into the entire issue and
the way it's been presented over the
years professor you've been so critical
of u.s. foreign policy over the years I
was just curious if there were any
politicians that you actually liked
that I liked yes oh admire some issues I
mean that I can't really list
personalities who I like on particular
issues I do approve of the policies that
many of them advocate incidentally on
both parties professor Chomsky I have a
question kind of following up with what
we were talking about um given that the
occupation and generally disagreeable
Israeli policies were going on at the
start of the most recent the most recent
hostilities what do you see as the most
ethical response that the Israeli
military could have taken under you know
ongoing missile attacks on the ethical
response on the latest of the Israeli
onslaught is that the press the ethical
response is to withhold all US aid to
Israel to compel Israel not to use u.s.
arms to call for a no-fly zone over Gaza
and to request the United Nations to
implement it which they could do and to
put an end to the farce of pretending to
try to broker a political settlement
when the country is in fact the
government is in fact undermining it the
US for it's worth recalling that for
about 40 years the United States has
almost unilaterally blocked the
implementation of a diplomatic
settlement which it's not very beautiful
in my mind but it's probably the least
bad of short-term options and is
supported by the into almost the entire
world and everyone knows what it is to
state settlement on the internationally
recognized border or maybe some minor
and mutual modifications to quote
earlier US policy with arrangements for
the various other standing issues that's
the basic framework for a diplomatic
settlement as I say I don't particularly
like it I don't think it's particularly
good but I think it's probably the best
option at the moment has enormous
international support the United States
and locking blocking it for 40 years I
recall that this proposal that reached
the Security Council of the United
Nations in January 1976 now there was a
resolution calling for a two-state
settlement on the international border
with quoting at guarantees for the right
of each state to exist in peace and
security within secure and recognized
borders the United States vetoed it that
resolution was brought by Egypt Syria
and Jordan same thing happened in 1980 I
won't run through the rest of the record
but it's pretty much the same up to the
latest veto which I quoted before and
this goes along with constant decisive
US military economic diplomatic support
for Israeli policies and decisive
support and also ideological support and
the way the issues are framed well what
do you and the ethical response would be
to end all of that as the boost our
response on behalf of the IDF you know
given yeah over a hundred rockets sent
in to Israel in the first five months of
2014 the aid given to the idea of just
the IDS reaction what do you think the
most ethical response should have been
the IDF 3 the IDF's reactions would be
to withdraw from the occupied
territories and to put an end to the
idea of operates on the orders of the
civilian government it's not an
independent actor it's not an israel's
far from a military dictatorship
civilian government determines policy
idea
if carries it out I don't think the idea
should carry out criminal orders or any
army should but the real question is
about the civilian government and of
course for Americans the questions are
crucially about our own government the
certainly the actions that the IDF has
taken has been ordered to take and often
us taking on its own initiative are a
very brutal and violent there's ample
reporting of that so that we don't have
to review it there's one more question
coming from our hangout yaqoob go ahead
briefly because we're almost out of time
recently a few bills have just passed
through Congress pass through the Senate
unanimously to me this indicates that
our representatives are not trying to
represent their constituents the Gallup
poll you mentioned earlier white people
think that what Israel's doing is
justified whereas people of color don't
make the question to do right through
the question because we have one minute
to wrap it up so go in with a question
loud and clear given that Congress
doesn't seem to be representing its
people do you feel like right now that
the US government can be considered a
democracy
professor is the US government a
democracy
dr. C the US government is a has formal
democratic procedures but in practice
it's a plutocracy there's extensive
research from mainstream political
science showing very conclusively that
the majority the population has no
influence on politics on policies
whatsoever policies are very largely set
by a very small elite of based
ultimately in corporate wealth and power
independent state power linked to it and
the public is not totally but
substantially out of the picture okay
all right so you only need two professor
Noam Chomsky if you'd like to hear some
from him I can highly recommend that you
go to the post show at stream
aljazeera.com and if you can't get to it
right now you can catch it up on our
online link a little bit later now I
think really Kurt it's interesting that
the professor he doesn't have a Twitter
page he doesn't have Facebook but if you
look at him online there are so many
quotes so many places for you to
actually see the things he says so
professor Noam Chomsky it's been great
having as a guest don't go away we're
gonna take you to the post show
meanwhile let me tell you about the next
MJ stream homeless and hungry why
thousands of people in South Sudan can't
wait for a famine declaration before
receiving help we're dig deeper into
that story on the next AJ stream until
then see you online stream got a zero
calm thanks for watching
you
