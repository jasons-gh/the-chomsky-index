let me say that there are plenty of
people who live constantly under the
threat of terrorism if you want to find
them go to Yemen or North Waziristan
where people don't have to be told about
terrorism they are constantly in fear
that five minutes from now the guy
across the street is going to be blown
away along with anybody else who happens
to be around
that's massive global terrorism and it
has repercussions and we're seeing some
of the repercussions what happened in
Brussels was a monstrous terrorist act
but it's worth looking at the
explanation that was given for it Isis
took credit for it and issued a
statement which basically said as long
as you keep bombing us we're going to
respond by attacking you there's
something to that there's a real problem
but the answer and we can we have to
make a decision as to deal with it one
decision we can make is to follow the
PlayBook that al Qaeda and Isis have
presented and want us to follow namely
and they're very explicit about it
destroy your own societies destroy your
own freedom and liberty and get into a
war with the Muslim world that's their
playbook we can accept that if we like
we've been doing it for 15 years if you
go back 15 years to the launching of the
so-called war on terror a terrorism what
we call terrorism was located in a tiny
area of a tribal area of the tribal
areas of we call aspect Afghanistan and
Pakistan where is it now all over the
world every time you hit it with a
sledgehammer it expands the invasion of
Iraq for example that one of the effects
was that in the year follow
terrorism increased by a factor of seven
intelligence agencies had predicted that
it would lead the more terror but it was
way beyond and that continues there's
another possibility and that is to try
to get to the roots and the causes of it
and try to deal with them that's it's
not dramatic and exciting but it
wouldn't work and there's plenty of
research that tells us why people why
people turn to terrorism that take
Brussels or Paris the terrorist acts are
carried out by people lived and grew up
there in slums miserable suburbs young
people who lived with the humiliation
degradation no hope
some from countries in North Africa
where they'd been subjected to brutal
European atrocities for centuries young
people who wanted something in their
lives they wanted some dignity some hope
some excitement something to look
forward to that we're not going to find
it in their own societies so they must
have had very little background in Islam
it's a big picked up Islam this gave
them a cause okay we can increase that
by following the ISIS playbook or you
could look at the causes for it and try
to deal with them take a look at the
British and Northern Ireland
terrorism in England was pretty serious
for a long time much more than it is now
fortunately they didn't react by carpet
bombing Northern Ireland following Ted
Cruz's proposal they finally after a
long period of doing the wrong thing the
vibe reacting with violence they began
to consider the reasons and the causes
and to deal with them and didn't turn
into a paradise but it's a big
difference I was in Belfast in 1993 and
it was a war zone literally I was there
15 years later it was
you could see tensions but it was a
pretty normal city and some of the
people who had been hitmen for the IRA
we're now part of the negotiating teams
that's the way you deal with if you want
to end the terrorism if you want to
follow the PlayBook outlines by Osama
bin Laden and his successors you'll then
hit it with a sledgehammer
and you know I just want to make one
point about terrorism itself and and
professor Chomsky made all the key
points but you know I just what's what's
really remarkable to me is I've had the
misfortune because I was traveling this
week throughout the u.s. of being
subjected to what I typically try really
hard to avoid which is watching cable
news and what's amazing is you know they
had like wall-to-wall coverage of every
minut aspect of this terrorist attack in
Brussels and they had like all their
famous TV correspondents and their
really chic overcoats being deployed to
Brussels walking around like all
investigative and whatever you know all
those actors who play the role of
journalists on TV they're all in
Brussels and
you know for everything that they talked
about the one question that literally
was never asked it is what was the
motive in why terrorists decided to
sacrifice their own lives and kill
people in Belgium like why would they do
that it was just assumed these are
savages and barbaric monsters with this
primitive inscrutable religion you know
I lived in Brazil for the last ten years
Brazil is a non Muslim country
overwhelmingly Catholic and evangelical
it's also a free and open and democratic
society there's never any talk about
Muslims targeting Brazil the same is
true in Japan or Korea or Argentina or
Chile or dozens of democratic non-muslim
countries around the world why is that
is it that the terrorists just put the
names of all the countries into a paper
bag and like randomly pull the ones out
and that they're going to attack or is
there something that is true about the
government's and policies of the
countries they attack that is causing
them to become target and there's tons
of evidence as professor Chomsky said
but just go to Google and Google 2004
Rumsfeld report on terrorism because
Donald Rumsfeld in 2004 asked this
question he said why are there so many
people who hate the United States so
much that they're willing to give up
their own lives to attack and kill
Americans and the answer that Donald
Rumsfeld's commissioned said was it said
you know what these people they don't
eat us for our freedoms and they don't
hate us because they're involved in a
religious war because they have this
religion that hypnotizes them into
committing violence they hate us because
of our policies on overwhelming support
for Israel occupying and bombing their
countries killing their children
propping up their dictators and so as
professor Chomsky said we can continue
to engage in those policies that our own
government says in secret causes
terrorism or for really serious about
stopping it we don't need to spend tens
of billions of dollars and tell the
government to spy on us we can ask our
what is it that we can be doing
differently that lessens that desire and
dilutes and weakens that infrastructure
if I can just add a word that report was
quite interesting and particularly
interesting was that it was a repeat of
a National Security Council document
from 1958 when that's one of the
advantages of living in us as free
society where you can get declassified
documents a President Eisenhower in 1958
asked his staff why is there a campaign
of hatred against us in the Arab world
not from the government's but from the
populations and there happened to be a
National Security Council study that
came out that year which gave the answer
it said there is a perception in the
Arab world that the United States
supports brutal and dictatorial regimes
and blocks democracy and development and
that we do it because we want to make
sure we can control their resources and
their policies and then it said these
perceptions are more or less accurate
but we should continue doing it because
that's in our interest
so the Rumsfeld report is repeating what
we should know and what the victims do
know they don't have to read secret
documents to find out
