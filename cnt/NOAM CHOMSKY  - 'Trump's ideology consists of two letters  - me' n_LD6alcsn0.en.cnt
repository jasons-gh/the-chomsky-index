hello professor Chomsky and my and
thanks again for accepting to do this I
want to start by asking you about the
current protests in the u.s. spreading
like fire all around the country
President Trump recently said when the
looting starts the shooting starts and
then today he asked governor's to
dominate the activists so when you see
the level of violence and that the
police or / military and he's inflicting
on the protester is he easy to
understand following what the president
is saying oh yeah very easy to
understand he wants to ensure that the
actions are as violent as possible that
he wants to call forth a strong military
response
remember that Trump has only has an
ideology but it's very simple it
consists of two letters me that's the
total ideology and he knows how to
appeal to his white supremacist racist
base and the way to do it is to stand up
for law and order against these violent
leftists who are destroying our society
and of course there's a racist
subtext it's pretty easy to detect it's
all traceable to those blacks so it's
pretty easy to understand him
incidentally about that quote he was
quoting a Miami racist mayor from 1967
and there was a negative reaction to it
so he lied his way out of it he said
well he just meant that the looters
would be shooting of course so you know
when you have a lot of people say that
the president of a country most of the
time he's just a puppet because
corporations are actually giving the
orders etc but when you have someone
like Trump who every day pushy
the boundaries of what it is possible to
say and do um like do you think its
first white supremacist and and bigots
into action the fact that he pushes the
sort of the Overton Window all the time
well I wouldn't exactly say that
corporations are giving him the orders
because he knows the instructions
without the orders but he's concerned
with his own power and he understands
his a skilled politician he's doing very
well he understands that his antics will
be tolerated by the rich and the
powerful and the corporate sector as
long as he fulfills his main function
stuffing their dollars with with
pockets with dollars as long as he does
that let him get away with it ever he
wants so it's and in fact if you look at
his legislative program that's a hundred
percent of it just enrich the rich and
powerful in fact it's happening right
now in a pretty dramatic way the corona
virus is a respiratory lung disease so
what is he doing well nobody's looking
he's removing the regulations which
limit air pollution which increases the
numbers of deaths by the business press
estimates maybe 10,000 mostly black so
it doesn't matter because they're the
ones who gave you the right in the
middle of the pandemic now if we can
kill more people than increase profits
for my prime constituency perfect same
with defunding the w-h-o World Health
Organization moment this is an opinion
it's a effort to try to part of his
effort to try to find some scapegoat for
his responsibility for killing tens of
thousands of Americans Louise handle
this or blame someone else and it's easy
to blame international institutions
voting base dislikes in any way what's
the consequence slaughtering unknown
numbers of Africans and Yemenis it's
immediate that they who rely on the
World Health Organization for medical
services and supplies but you know who
cares my electoral prospects are what
matter
I thought you can interpret the whole
Trump presidency this way very simply
talking about electoral electoral in
like elections I mean there must be
replication replications right for for
someone that um is responsible in a way
so far there's been one more one more
than 100,000 death and still counting in
the US the elections are coming up in a
in a few months and you've advocated to
vote for Biden mainly to stop trying
yeah okay lift perspective on this which
has apparently been long for God you
don't vote for people you vote against
people every once if you're a left
activist politics doesn't mean they're
coming
you know concentrating laser-like on
elections the elections are an event you
know they take place they should take 15
minutes of your time away from real
politics which is constant activism then
you take the 15 minutes you decide is
there somebody so rotten we want to
protect the world from him if there is
you vote against it which technically
means voting for the opposition you
don't vote for the opposition you're
voting from the other guy in effect
taking the vote away from the opposition
is same as giving the vote to the rubble
so you take 15 minutes you decide is it
important to vote against this guy in
this case obviously there's a colossal
difference between the candidates so you
take the 15 minutes and you go back to
work that's an election from the left
point of view not the establishment
point of view establishment point of
view is everything has to be focused on
the election foot laser-like focused on
the quadrennial extravaganza avenge of
them all but we don't okay and so
talking about this election what would
you think he's their way for him to win
and pretty loose is it even will well
regrettably he'll be using things like
what's happening right now and here we
have to ask yourself some serious
questions if we care about the issues
it's very easy and right to sympathize
with city protesters especially blacks
were victims of 400 years of vicious
repressions and yes when they react
together sympathize reading you can also
ask is it wise and that extends to the
other protesters it may be what you're
doing is understandable but is it wise
here you have to ask yourself a question
that should be foremost in the mind for
any activist is a difference between
feel-good politics and do good politics
so you have to ask yourself is this just
something that makes me feel good if so
it's just self-indulgence forget it is
it something that's going to advance the
cause I'm interested in well then you
get serious questions not on this we
have a ton of evidence the overwhelming
evidence is that violent protests are a
gift to the write constantly they
reinforce the Trump types it's a gift
and they love it nonviolent protests are
much harder take a lot more courage but
they succeed they do have a steady
of increasing support for the cause your
personally the evidence on this is
pretty strong it's difficult it's know
you can understand people are so angry
that go smash a store window or
something it's understandable it's not
wise unless you're working for the
opposition and in fact a lot of the
protesters probably are but what we call
the protests are pretty much a mixture
among them are white supremacists who
want to instigate a race war and said of
white Christian dystopia the problem
cropped provocateurs at least price they
usually are not a lot of genuine
activists on the Left who are outraged
what happened what's happening but are
not thinking is true this has happened
over and over again always with the same
consequences not just on this issue but
we should also look at something else
the amazing hypocrisy of the law and
order types right at the time where
they're saying let's bring in the troops
to demonstrators they're giving immense
gifts to people who are violating the
law like in this including to the
liberals like the liberal governor of
New York : just passed legislation to
grant immunity to the corporate owners
of the nursing homes who brought them up
to try to milk every cent of profit from
them and meanwhile our consigning none
of the people there to death from
coronavirus so they should have immunity
the Trump Republicans are trying to pass
legislation right now which will give
immunity to the corporations who are
ordering their workers back to work even
in the face of theories that
so let's give immunity to them
white collar prosecutions have dropped
to the lowest point ever environmental
prosecute prosecution's for
environmental violations the
disappearing so the idea of law and
order is yeah let's go after that got
these the guys who were protesting
racism but meanwhile let's lavish gifts
on the the criminals who are killing
people at random growing the population
of huge amounts I mean some of this is
so obscene you don't know what to say
about it was going under or under Obama
to one of the major white-collar crimes
in the United States his wage theft
employers who simply refuse to pay wages
that are due usually from poor people
you know blacks can't they're not going
to start a lawsuit if they can't do
anything about it
this is estimated at billions of dollars
a year of robbery of poor working people
the right is don't worry is working hard
to impose restrictions against even
investigating it let alone criminalizing
because that's the kind of crime that's
good that's the kind of crime we want to
extend now if you look at it more
broadly at amounts of tens of trillions
of dollars a year uh tax havens and
stock buybacks
are just pure robbery of the public
before Reagan they were illegal in the
United States and in fact it was
enforced the Justice Department actually
enforced it Reagan opened the spigot
it really blossomed under Clinton that's
when it really took off
this is bipartisan robbery of the poor
and vulnerable
goes on all the time huge amounts of
money
I mean utterly to wharfs anything that
people are talking about a law and order
but it's under the radar because it's
protecting the rich and the powerful so
therefore I don't want to hear about it
I don't want to see it and in fact you
see no comment occasional comments on
over the fringe that people like us and
they talk about it but it's not gonna
reach anywhere that's a little harder I
wanted to ask you about something and
something else regarding that the
current corona' crisis then you've wrote
rich you've caught written a book and
called manufacturing consent a while ago
and can you tell us about the role
played by the corporate media into in a
way pacifying the people we've seen
something incredible happened in the
last two months
people were just asked through
bombardment by the media to stay home
not to go and see the elders dining in
care homes and most people listened very
quickly well in this case I see the
problem
it'll swear but with regard to listening
I think that makes sense
violating the lockdown or borders it's
comparable to running around in the
streets with an assault rifle firing
randomly now you're endangering people I
don't think I should be encouraged to
endanger others seriously
so keeping to the lockdown orders I mean
there may be exceptions but landlords
it's pretty reasonable the manufacturers
consent from somewhere else this one
word usually comes from silence what is
not being talked about so for example
why is there a corona virus pandemic
we better answer that question just for
our own safety because there's another
one coming which will be worse because
of global warming and if we don't ask
ourselves why this one came and prepare
for the next one we'll be in deep
trouble
so that's a question it should be very
high in priority you can look and see
how much it's discussed and there's a
reason why it's not discussed
that's a capitalist crime not the kind
of thing you discussed so it wasn't but
it's transparent just open your eyes
2003 after the SARS epidemic was
contained scientists were talking quite
openly about the next likely epidemic
probably a corona virus and what we
could do to prepare for it but it's not
enough to have foreknowledge somebody
has to do something with it well who
would it be
some of the drug companies have you know
money pouring out of their ears they
have all the resources but there's
blocked by something called capitalism
it's not profitable to prepare for a
coming catastrophe it's profitable to do
what you make money on tomorrow so
they're blocked well the government
could step in they have plenty of
resources they do most of the work on
viruses and vaccines anyway they hand it
over to private corporations for
marketing and profit so they could do
the whole job they're blocked by
something called Reagan and Thatcher
neoliberalism the government is the
problem not the solution translate that
into English it means take decisions
away from the government which has a
flaw it's partially responsible to the
public put it in the hands of private
tyrannies who are totally unaccountable
to the public now that's what it means
to say government is the problem
there's no society and we've been living
with that for 40 years with consequences
we know the review
right now what it means is the
government can step in to fulfill what
the private corporations the one who do
quizzes are profitable so it's a
capitalist crisis exacerbated by
neoliberalism exacerbated further by
malignancies like President Trump
extreme in nine countries did responded
one or another way to the crisis us just
didn't respond I mean it wasn't even US
intelligence services we're banging at
the door of the White House for two
months I'm going to get somebody to pay
attention
no is he looking at his TV ratings when
the stock market went down he finally
noticed and since then was just in
efforts cover up on chaos I mean some of
the things that have been done are just
almost surreal like everyone's concerned
of course with getting a vaccine there
is a scientist and the government in
charge of vaccine production he was
fired by the president why because he
questioned some of his quack remedies
Krampus managed to surround himself with
pure psycho fans like Mike Pompeo knows
only one thing out of Dickens boots
everyone else's been kicked out not just
in the last couple of weeks he carried
out a purge an amazing purge of the
Inspector General's these are people who
will imposed mostly by Republicans
incidentally to oversee the departments
in the government the weed out
corruption to stop illegal activities
Trump has created a total swamp of
corruption
he is just fired all the Inspector
General's that's a coup reminiscent of
the fascist state I mean it's a couple
of words of not nice but those are the
kind of things he's from doing it's a
power takeover in the interest
corporate power the rich the profitable
they're making out like bandits right
through the corona virus epidemic
private equity funds and hedge funds and
major corporations are seen profits go
through the sky not just as in the 2008
recession seeing it again there's a
stimulus program huge stimulus program
who administers it thanks how are they
going to administer I don't have to talk
about it of course they're supervised by
Steve Manucci not a Trump's right in
admin so we're in good hands
maybe charge 20 push yourself so you can
figure out what's gonna happen and I was
in fact drivel in that's what's
happening I mean it's in it the
corruption the city sadism of it is
really hard to destroy so yes that's
what the endemic was caused by
travellish choices neoliberal crisis on
top of it gangsters from the top couples
class exacerbating I don't see much
about that in the New York College Thank
You professor Chomsky thanks thanks
again for your time thank 700 everyday
so sure that the next Rihanna good luck
good luck with everything
bye
