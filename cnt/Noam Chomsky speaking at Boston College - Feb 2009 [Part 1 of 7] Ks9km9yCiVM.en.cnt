thanks um well as you heard I'll talk
for a few minutes about what I think of
the transition to the new administration
what we're likely to see and so on and
then leave it open for questions we'll
talk about what you'd like to talk about
the first word that came tripping off
everyone's lips after the election was
historic and that's correct it's a
historic event to have a black family
living in the White House in fact an
astonishing event if you go back not too
many years it was inconceivable so it
takes a 40 years ago or even more
recently it would have been absolutely
unimaginable so that alone qualifies as
a start in fact it's broader than that
the two Democratic candidates were black
and a woman and that would have been
inconceivable 40 years ago or even more
recently and what that means is that yes
historic changes have taken place the
country's gotten a lot more civilized is
now capable of accepting things that
would have been totally unimaginable not
long ago and we know the reasons and
should think about them in fact they
answer the question what's likely to
happen under the Obama administration
the reasons are that in the 1960s people
like you became active energized engaged
in all sorts of activism and it set off
in motion a wide range of activities
civil rights movement the anti-war
movement the women's movement the
environmental movement most of these
things like say the feminist in the
environmental movement didn't even exist
in the 60s in anything remotely like
their present form they're part of the
aftermath later the International
Solidarity movements the huge global
justice movement
actually this this century and on till
today the effect of all of this was just
to change the society it didn't change
the institution's much they're pretty
stable of the institutions of domination
and control decision-making and so on
but it did it change the culvert quite a
lot and laid the basis for historical
event an event of historical
significance and the lessons pretty
incidentally the 60s are constantly
defamed in the literature there the Time
of Troubles you know when kids are all
off on dope or Woodstock or doing some
breaking windows or something rather and
it's very natural that they should be
defamed because they had a strongly
demic democratizing effect and democracy
is hated by a lead opinion for very good
reasons democracy undermines elite
control so it's despised and we see that
all around today International Affairs
everywhere and the civilizing effect was
greatly resisted because people lost
privilege and power and domination and
since they're the people who write
history the the picture that's presented
of these movements is defamatory but
that's natural and normal you can figure
out for yourself what happened and what
the reasons are for the change which is
illustrated one of the numeral
illustrations by the by the last
election many more illustrations and
then the lesson is well you know what
happens from now on depends very much on
what people like you were going to do if
you become energized engaged involved
active organized the protesting
struggling and so on okay there can be
more historical changes if you choose to
resign into apathy and obedience then
you get a reconstruction of what
happened before
that's the way history works the Verret
we have a legacy of by comparative and
historical standards of unique privilege
and freedom but it wasn't given as a
gift it was one step by step it was won
by hard struggle it's never given as a
gift and if population backs off the
games are taken away people in with
power and privilege do not relinquish it
easily and there's no reason to expect
them to well the the historic event was
greeted with quite extraordinary
euphoria in the United States and even
more so in Europe common to read about
that only in America because something
magical like this happened it's
astonishing cetera et cetera and by
European standards that's true Europe is
probably more racist than the United
States so it's hard to imagine anything
like this happening in Europe but by
world standards it's not true at all I
mean we tend to disregard you know the
lesser breeds anyone outside the West
and barely exists but elsewhere this
would not be a magical moment infected
even in comparison with very recent
events so say take the poorest country
of the hemisphere continental hemisphere
Bolivia they had an election in 2005 it
was reaffirmed with an even stronger
vote in a referendum just last year
which is far more democratic than the
unsurprising and amazing than the
election of 2008 I mean in the Bolivian
election unlike here the population
participated here the population listens
there's no popular input into the Obama
campaign in fact that so it's described
by its leaders and by the press is an
army of people who are waiting for
instructions from the leader to act to
push forward brand Obama that's the
regular characterization Bolivia was
totally different there were mass
popular organizations the election was
just one day in ongoing struggles hard
difficult struggles they hear the issues
are essentially ignored I'm supposed to
think about hope and change and soaring
rhetoric and so on but nobody knows what
anyone stands for and that's not by
design it's not by accident and a
Bolivia the issues were front and center
they were highly significant control of
resources cultural rights and social
justice all kinds of things and they
were things that the mass of the
population had been struggling for for a
long time and they are the most
repressed people in atmosphere that's
the indigenous population I mean they
don't make much of a difference here
because we exterminated them but in
Bolivia they survived a little piece of
national history for which we don't have
museums and so on but in Bolivia they
survived the majority and for the first
time in history they entered the
political arena with crucial issues
included an election whether this age is
one stage and they elected someone from
their own ranks a poor peasant to
implement the policies that they had
designed okay that's democracy and
that's why when you read about Bolivia
in the United States read that it's
undermining democracy so it's mmm does
one of the countries where democracy is
being attacked yeah because it's far
more democratic than Western societies
and therefore is undermining a lead
control and of course the old elites
don't like it there are there's a group
mostly white Europeanized wealthy that's
run the country forever and they don't
like it so they're initiating a kind of
a secessionist movement with a
considerable amount of violence and
predictably they're being supported by
the United States which is under pitches
committed and has been for a long time
to undermining democracy here it's
called promoting democracy but this is
the age of our will so it's undermining
democracy and naturally the US is
supporting the secessionist movement of
the old westernize elites which it
became pretty violent struggle and Latin
America is undergoing important changes
there was a conference of a newly formed
organization the Union of South American
Republic's unas or all the countries of
South America including Colombia the one
you SLI they had a meeting in Santiago
in which they came out with a resolution
condemning the secessionist movement in
the violence and strongly supporting
