I am perturbed by two questions of moral
philosophy
the first one is concerning Peter Singer
is he right on animal rights and my
second question is on inequities at
birth
we can't redistribute IQ height good
looks talent we can redistribute wealth
and income does this have any moral
significance at all
thank you do kill insects like
mosquitoes or do you think that when
mosquitoes are carrying malaria we ought
to develop the means to kill them off
question okay that's part of the answer
you can sure I don't know should have
rights but none of us believes that
animal including Peter Singer that
animals should have the rights of human
beings and there's good reasons for that
the rights don't exist in a vacuum if
you're talking about moral philosophy
the rights are associated with
responsibilities we don't tribute any
responsibilities at all other animals do
we don't say that a a lion has to be
ascent to the gas chamber if it kills a
gazelle that's a no they don't have
responsibilities and that of course if
in moral philosophy now just abstract
discussion relates to the question of
what their rights are and you can they
should have rights so for example it's a
step forward in our general kind of
moral development that animals are not
subjected to a torture in the way they
were just a few years ago so in Britain
and the United States there are now
constraints on the torture what we call
experiment torture of
at least animals that are closer to us
like primates than there were 30 or 40
years ago so yes we're developing some
sort of conception of Rights but I don't
think anyone thinks that animals have
the rights and responsibilities of human
beings okay then we can enter into the
details oh yeah about about general
gifts that we are born with okay I mean
like you know somebody asked me to
before to sign a picture and told me
that she had only once before asked
someone to sign a picture some tennis
champion okay I'm never going to be a
tennis champion so good I'm not sorry
that he has those talents which I don't
have I mean I'm not sorry that people
can play the violin in ways I can't
dream over and so on I think that's
great otherwise it'd be extremely boring
world so yes people have all sorts of
qualities and capacities I think you
mentioned IQ that's one of the least
significant of them but whatever it is
it's some very marginal phenomenon
on that site but there are real ones and
I think it's great sure there should be
a very complex world in which people can
do different things and we can admire
and enjoy what they do
